usual disclaimer all the characters well almost all of them are property of jk rowling and im merely borrowing her brilliance and her world with no claim to it at all id like to thank the harry potter lexicon in particular since theyre help in filling in the holes of ms rowlings world has been invaluable to making this story as authentic as possible please look them up sometime as for why i chose to focus on the lily and james era of things well the characters arent so deeply established for the most part that i have to worry about stepping over ms rowlings toes and perverting her thoughtful creations beyond necessity i hope you enjoy and reviews are always appreciated lily evans roamed diagon alley listlessly she was alone although she had seen and spoken to a few other hogwarts students in passing and weighed down by a few bags already lily was saving her heavier shopping for later so as not to burden herself anymore than she had already managed to content to wander into shop after shop exploring their wares she committed herself to getting a sundae at florean fortescues ice cream parlor at some point during the day  although she wasnt uncomfortable with it lily was growing slightly bored being alone with only her thoughts her older sister petunia had made such a fuss about all the attention lily was getting she demanded her own quality time with their parents they offered to take her along to diagon alley since she had never been there but petunia insisted buying lilys freakish school supplies wasnt her idea of a holiday petunias moping and pouting had eventually wore on all the evans and lily feeling a little guilty over her sisters jealousy and hostility told her parents she was more than able to get all her things for hogwarts on her own the evans dropped lily off in front of the leaky cauldron at ten that morning promising to retrieve her at six that evening that was more than enough time for lily to have a leisurely afternoon in diagon alley and gradually become bored out of her mind finding herself lingering outside quality quidditch supplies lily shrugged to herself and decided to go in passing the pack of young wizard children gawking at whatever topoftheline broom was on display in the window lily figured her stay within the shop would be relatively brief since her only interest for quidditch was infrequent at best aside from her support of the gryffindor house team lily didnt keep up much with quidditch on large she figured it was largely attributed to her not finding the energy to follow along with muggle sports let alone ones only found in the wizarding world  still she always had a good time watching the house matches and wouldnt mind seeing a professional match sometime as quidditch was easily the most exciting sport invented lily stepped into the shop just as james potter stepped out colliding gently into one another the contents of their bags rustled lily would be lying if she said she were surprised to find him there he was the chaser captain and all around star player of their house quidditch team  hell it wouldnt have surprised her if she found out james potter was living out of the back of quality quidditch supplies james face lit up when he saw lily as he almost selfconsciously if lily didnt know for a fact james had all the confidence in the world readjusted his circular spectacles and ran a hand through his black mess of hair that wouldnt lay flat if it was charmed to lily sighed a little it wasnt that she disliked james they were both gryffindors and ran in pretty much the same social circles but james was something of a goofoff in spite of his potent magical skill and relation to a respectable wizarding family he was cocky brash and sometimes even a prat but james was irredeemably gallant and had a charm to him that made it hard to utterly dislike him oh im sorry james lily apologized casually since no one had been hurt and nothing had been broken james bowed jokingly fancy meeting you her miss evans james was failing miserably as he attempted to maintain his stiff pretense showing that formality didnt suit him well got wind that youre our new house killjoy ill assume you meant prefect lily said dryly but cracked a smile she knew james was only teasing and she expected no less from him now as they were about to enter their th year at hogwarts yes well you only got the position because i didnt want it james insisted with a grin twitching over his lips lily knew he had meant this as a joke but considering everyone had james pegged on the fasttrack to becoming headboy she had no doubt that if he had bothered to apply himself to following at least a fraction of the school rules hed be wearing the prefect badge instead of her i can see how it would be a conflict of interests youd have to subtract points from gryffindor every time you come up with something new and deviant to slip under the noses of the faculty lily solemnly nodded  wed be in the negatives every time you had a brain st
