not tonight though tonight the students sat in their own cars not frequently crossing the threshold into others the only sound came from the movement of the train the quiet talking of the students and the rain even under normal circumstances there would have been a definite decline in the pranks pulled due to the absence of the weasley twins both of whom had graduated from hogwarts last year had they been there they would have been grandly disappointed at the fact that no one even thought of playing pranks that night happiness seemed to be long abandoned and the feeling hovering in the air was a melancholy one in one car near the back of the train three students were seated one was a fifteenyearold girl who sat curled up on a seat of her own a schoolbook propped open in front of her as she munched on a cauldron cake two others boys of the same age sat across from her one of the boys was polishing a broomstick while the other stared out the train window into the dark black beyond though all of them kept up their facades of normalcy it was apparent that their hearts were not in it harry potter sat down his firebolt on the floor and its movement blended with the trains vibrating in an unsteady manner he tucked away the polishing kit and looked up neither of his friends had moved hermione granger was still staring determinedly at her book which would normally have been quite an average sight however harry had been watching her and the normally fast reader had been staring blankly at the same page for fifteen minutes her eyes unmoving he looked over at ron weasley ron noticed his friends gaze and met harrys eyes he was expressionless and when he spoke breaking the silence for the first time in over an hour his voice was just as toneless as his face had been time to change into our school robes i reckon we should almost be there by now no one moved though hermione did look up apparently confused harry and ron had no doubt shed been lost in her thoughts until ron had spoken harry scowled this is rather ridiculous guys we havent seen or spoken to each other for an entire summer and now im wondering if were going to talk at all during the school year either hermione looked a bit shocked but harry you cant tell us you arent scared you of all people    im not happy harry said in a distant voice but im not terrified either the fact is this is what he wants terror mayhem disruption were giving it to him if we cant fight him mentally we certainly cant do it physically ron remained quiet and looked back out the window hermione and harry exchanged knowing glances of sympathy for their friend voldemort was back hed returned to full strength the year before at the final event of the triwizard tournament harry had witnessed it it was not until recently that voldemort had acted though but he hit hard when he finally did one week before there had been a ministry conference in eastern england the point of which was to discuss the impending threat of voldemorts return death eaters had swarmed the conference about halfway through the final death toll was thirtytwomen and women from all different departments of the ministry cornelius fudge had been present but had amazingly managed to escape the destruction and horror along with twentyseven others rons brother percy had attended the conference and had not been so lucky throughout his years at hogwarts ron had always made sure all of gryffindor knew he hated his brother hed frequently described his older sibling as annoying egotistical powerhungry arrogant and a disciplinarian hed always supportedeven helpedfred and george when they bewitched his prefect and head boy badges or when they played pranks on him he never missed a chance to put percy down but in spite of that he had always loved his brother losing percy had torn him apart inside and had done the same to his entire family ron wasnt letting his pain show to his friendsor so he thought despite his illusion of normalcy his grief showed in his distant stares his silence and his refusal to eat anything so far harry and hermione had been careful not to say anything to him the whole of hogwarts was frightened by this recent act of terror many that now attended hogwarts had not been alive during voldemorts first reign and none had they even been born were old enough to remember this was all new and terrifying to them the only ones who had any idea of the type of terror voldemort could inspire were harry hermione ron and ginny in an effort to escape the depressing anguished feeling that had come over them hermione stood she picked up her hogwarts robe and slipped into it she had already been wearing the typical gray uniform so that this was all she had to do aside from putting on the tie which she decided to do later just as she was shrugging into the redlined black robe that proudly bore the gryffindor lion she heard the door slide open behind her she was startled as the only people to stop by all day had been ginny and the snack
