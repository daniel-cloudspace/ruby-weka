i almost think that there is a greater war  here at hogwarts than in the rest of the wizarding  world dumbledore commented sighing he watched as mcgonagall  approached looking grave albus we have a  situation he  chuckled but she narrowed her eyes and he looked at her seriously it isnt  only your house minerva the whole of hogwarts is split only slytherin is  still together and they stick to themselves anyway what good do they think can come out of  separating my house isnt gryffindor at all anymore only  the cavillors and auscultos its the same in hufflepuff  and ravenclaw dont think its your fault they  dont agree on the voldemort issues for the most part although you know there  are other things as well and they dont know how to deal with it so  naturally they refuse to speak to each other anymore naturally this  isnt natural its absurd dumbledore  smiled to himself lead the way minerva well see about this situation  shall we the corridor outside the gryffindor common  room appeared to be filled with a mob as they came closer they saw the whole  gryffindor house split into two and on opposite sides facing each other with  scowls in the middle of the two sides were james  potter a cavillor and lily evans an ausculto the newly  appointed heads we cant have a cavillor as head boy a  boy from behind lily yelled at  the same time someone from james group announced i say james get rid of  this one lily and james were in the middle of a  heated argument with each other and neither of them appeared to be winning oh  and i suppose that you think i like the idea dumbledore cleared his throat loudly the  students stopped shouting and looked sheepish there will be no change in  heads and no protesting he said slowly so that they heard every bit of it  you are obliged to work together mr potter and ms evans and dont even  consider the fact that youre not of the same group the rest of you will also  cooperate with each other as far as i am concerned there is only one group  now and there always was he walked away mcgonagall  added this has gone on too long and she was gone as well the  cavillors and auscultos glared at each other for a  long time before shoving their way through the portrait hole and proceeding to  gather at opposite sides of the common room neither group acknowledged the  fact that they were sharing a room with some of their worst enemies sure at first they had started out as merely  debating sides mostly about how to handle voldemort and bring him out of power  but now they were oh so much more now they were their own houses in a way  only they were studentcreated and that made them more powerful you alright lils kristen asked brushing dirty blond hair out  of her face lily  scowled and then sighed im not angry at you you know that but the whole  thing makes me angry im almost ready to go to dumbledore and tell him that i  refuse to work with a cavillor so do it selene joined in go tell  him lily  smiled and turned to her other friend and you should know that id never do  that she thought for a moment but you would lily  sighed it was a long shot anyway she glanced around at the five beds in the  room there had been two other girls living with them in first year but when  the groups or associations were formed they ended up being cavillors it was  no longer boys to the left and girls to the right now it was cavillors to the  left and auscultos to the right she didnt know about the cavillors but  her group still had dignity the guys slept together farther up into the tower  than the girls their dorm was the only one with any empty beds at all i think ill go walk around lily said  rubbing her temple i need to think about all of this want us to come kristen asked  selene nodded too her hazel eyes watching  with interest no no ill catch you guys later she  left the dorm before they came up with reasons for them to come with her she  wouldnt get anything done that way without knowing where she was going or  why she descended the curving stairs to the gryffindor common room it was a  shame that they still had only one common room what about the ravenclaw and hufflepuff auscultos they were more associated with her than these  other gryffindors she found it empty of students first  night back so as usual everyone was upstairs getting situated she sighed and  dropped herself down in front of the roaring fire i shouldnt even be talking to you now  she heard a voice hiss from behind it was obvious who it was she closed her  eyes attempting to force it into a dream it wasnt working what are you doing here potter he  scowled at her i have as much right as you do more  ive already appealed to dumbledore and he wont do anything about  thissituation i hate it as much as you do but hes up to something hes not  going to change his mind as he spoke lily watched his dark hair fall into  his aqua eyes and all over the place she closed the door to her dorm behind her  and looked up at her friends who were sitting on one
