an as some of you know i completely screwed up and accidently replaced this chapter so now ive put it back to how it should be i probably should have used that chance to edit it a little but oh well it was the first day back at hogwarts everyone was filing into the great hall for the sorting i wonder who theyve got for us for dada this year ron said as they made their way for the gryffindor table i hope its a female hermione said so far all of our dada teachers have been male i dont really care as long as he or she doesnt work for voldemort and nothings wrong with them harry said craning his neck trying to see their new teacher your neck wont hurt so much afterwards if you wait until we sit down to look hermione told him harry sheepishly stopped looking up at the high table when they finally reached the gryffindor table they sat down harry and ron on one side with hermione across from them right after they sat down the twins sat by ron who groaned and looked away from them his gaze fell uponthe high table where he saw the new dada teacher his mouth dropped open shaylee what harry and hermione looked up occupating the dada professors spot was a tall redheaded girl with freckleswith her hat on lopsided while his two friends looked at him bewildered ron was getting fred george and ginny who had just sat down by hermione to look up at the high table fred and georges mouths also dropped open and a mischievous look came into their eyes ginny squealed and jumped up to wave the new professor laughed and waved back winking at fred and george who grinned and gave each other high fives erm harry and hermione looked to rom for an explanation he opened his mouth to explain but he was interrupted by mcgonagall coming in the first years behind her the first yearsall stared at the hat confused and jumped when it broke into a song perhaps the greatest known slytherin the choosiest of them all always liked them like his own ravenclaw the wisest one chose cleverness and sport while hufflepuff the kind old chap the workers were hers to sort and last there is gryffindor but certainly not the least his bravery and boldness made sure he was no beast these four brilliant wizards put me in charge for i can see your thoughts even hidden far so put me on that head of yours and we shall see which of the four you are most like and put you there bless me everyoneapplauded and the sorting began they listened vaguely and clapped when someone was sorted into gryffindor finally after all of the first years had been sorted mcgonagall took her seat harry and hermione once again looked to ron but before he could say anything dumbledore stood ron rolled his eyes and sat back for the wait before we begin i have two announcements im sure many of you have noticed the newcomer in our staff dumbledores eyes twinkled as he looked at the gaggle of weasleys at the gryffindor table it is my pleasure to introduce to you our new defense against the dark arts teacher professor shaylee weasley her name got tremendous applause most of it coming from the gryffindors fred and georges whistling probably won that competition shes my cousin the only young girl in the family besides ginny and fred and georges third stooge ron took the time to explain to harry and hermione after the applause dumbledore spoke again it seems that youve been accepted professor shaylee grinned a grin identical to the twins i see the resemblance hermione whispered dumbledore continued many of you might have realized that you havent received your timetables yet he smiled at hermione she blushed she had in fact been wondering that very thing earlier this is part of my second announcement you have not received them yet because there is a new course being added for all years a groan rippled through the great hall dumbledore smiled yes yes but you havent heard me out yet he waited until there was silence in a recent study about muggle education it was found out that to keep their students in shape they require a physical education class be taken that study also reports that four out of five young wizards in europe are out of shape american wizarding schools are already requiring this course so naturally we studied a little more into the matter weve added a gymnasium to the th floor so in short your new course is physical education there werent any groans but nobody was exactly thrilled either dumbledore laughed again and continued normally there would be separate classes for boys and girls but at the lack of a male teacher willing to risk his life doing athletic activities with some certain th year boys his eyes twinkled as he pointedly looked at the twins weve persuaded instead professor weasley to handle the classes by years this got dumbledore the response hes been waiting for applause he smiled and said i only have one more thing to say tuck in he waved his wand and food appeared on the tables finally im starving ron exclaimed stuffing a chicken leg in his mouth im not harry said filling
