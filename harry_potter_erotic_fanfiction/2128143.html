so i cantkill it completely we ll just make her a little more conscientious and non headgame y shall we schedule next chapter hogsmeade trip chapter after fast forward a couple weeks find out about what that parchment said will be long chapter get pumped hermione held on tight for if she didntshe feared she d fall right out of his arms he kissed her hard and deep with a passion that made her skin burn and her toes curl but all good things must come to an end when their need for oxygen became too great sirius pulled away with one last caress to her cheek hermione his warm breath burned on her flushed skin hermione her eyes fluttered open and she looked up at him with eyes glossy and lips bruised red sirius she murmured having a difficult time forming any sort of words at all we should go back his raised voice at the end made it a question his hands on her waist on the look in his dark eyes begged her to stay she swallowed her throat suddenly dry and cleared it yeah the others will be worried she slipped off his feet and sunk a little into the sand sirius let her go this is wrong this shouldnthave happened turn around she told him what i wet my clothes are going to be clingy turn around she insisted sirius bit back his laughter and did as she instructed listening carefully to the slosh of water as she climbed back onto the bank and the odd suctioning sound as she peeled the clothes away from her skin are you decent he teased oh just get out already she griped sirius turned around and was met with a long length of leg hermione was wringing out her skirt and by the frustrated look on her face it wasntmaking much difference he climbed out as well and tried to squeeze the water out of his pants he took his robe and used it rub his hair dry he offered it to hermione but she declined it saying it ll make my hair poofy she stuffed her socks in her shoes and threw her robes over her arm grabbing the picnic basket and then waiting for sirius to do the same before they started the walk back up to the castle dumbledore d be furious if he found out she groaned inwardly i probably just killed harry parents before he was born or something halfway up the stone path sirius put his arm over hermione shivering shoulders but she stepped out of it by picking up her pace and admonishing him for making her stay out too late this is all such a mess having created a dripping ruin that filch would be furious over from the entrance to gryffindor tower sirius stepped back to hold the portrait door open for hermione and she slipped inside sirius followed after hermione had made it halfway through the common room before she was spotted hermione she waved weakly at harry face appearing over the back of the couch hullo harry the others faces appeared as well hullo everyone what the hell happened to you ron interjected you look like a drowned cat hermione glared at him thanks ronald we went for a little swim sirius commented causally brushing back his long hair in your clothes lily cried in disbelief blame him hermione said blandly and chucked the picnic basket at the smirking sirius who looked incredibly too pleased with himself he caught it easily and tossed it off to james who consequently got hit in the head and almost knocked out of the chair i going to get cleaned up hermione informed them and disappeared into her head girl quarters without a backwards glance so padfoot james said slowly taking the opportunity of catching sirius alone he was grinning from ear to ear you werentat dinner no i wasn t he agreed with a jovial smile kicking harry legs off the coffee table he propped his own up on the wooden furniture piece and slouched down into the couch james looked aghast were you doing something untoward with our dear miss granger blimey ron gagged that my best mate you re talking about sirius and james both laughed heartily i never kiss and tell sirius guffawed snatching some ice mice from lily you didntkiss her remus told him confidently sirius was a ladies man but he couldnthave gotten to hermione right sirius just waggled his eyebrows remus cursed his own slowness it doesntmatter anyways lily announced primly because hermione will tell me everything yeah right babe james teased flipping her immaculately straight hair over her head squeaky clean hermione called loudly bounding back into the room she d changed into a plain set of navy shorts and a white t shirt with her thigh length canary colored bathrobe loosely tied around her middle you shower too quickly harry complained we were just getting to the juicy details he wouldnttell everyone would he hermione sharp eyes drifted to sirius whose look of innocence was too fake to be believable and she smiled faintly i sure she drawled her words practically dripping sarcasm do you even own a nightgown hermione lily blurted out in exasperation hermione stopped halfway through a chocolate frog and its enchanted legs writhed between her lips excuse me she mumbled through a mouthful of candy she looked down at her pajamas lily looked disgusted i think you ve spent way too much time with the boys and what wrong with that hermione laughed slurping the frog legs into her mouth while ron laughed at her where your feminine side lily asked incredulous hermione grabbed another frog and glanced downwards at herself i pretty sure it at the front the boys howled with laughter while lily became increasingly frustrated smacking james she put her hands on her hips and frowned disapprovingly at hermione who was laughing raucously i serious sirius winked at her you can be me if you d like lils he teased a headless chocolate frog squirming in hermione fingers she flopped down onto the corner of the couch where harry was sitting putting her back to the armrest and lily she stretched her legs out over harry lap and wrapped her arms around his neck oh harry she bemoaned dramatically pressing her face into his shoulder you smell like strawberries he told her randomly changing topics hermione pulled away to bat her eyes coquettishly really oh i was so frightfully hoping you d notice she gushed earning snickers from their audience it very feminine harry said seriously he nodded his head sagely you think so the sound she made was squealing sort of high pitched yip that made remus and his highly sensitive hearing wince does that mean you love me now harry lips were twitching to stay serious as he looked thoughtfully down into hermione wide and expectantly adoring eyes a bigger chest wouldnthurt he answered after much hmm ing and huh ing that d make you more feminine i can do that she insisted vehemently really her hands fluttered across his chest anything you want darling she cooed kiss me he exclaimed dramatically hermione fanned herself oh my you re such a charmer wrapping his arms around her waist he lowered a ridiculously puckered face on her and she half screamed half laughed pushing him away with one hand and shoving her half eaten chocolate frog into his fishy mouth chomping contentedly on his chocolaty reward harry resettled hermione on his lap and draped his arms over her legs when the group laughter finally receded sirius put on his most pitiful face and tweaked one of hermione toes you kicked me you know he complained with all that flailing about aww she cooed sympathetically that wasntvery ladylike of me was it she asked looking slyly at lily i give up the redhead exacerbated throwing her hands up into the air and consequently hitting her boyfriend in the face james just wasnthaving a very good night seems you re a lost cause best friend hermione ron mused he shook his hair out of eyes and rooted through the pile of sweets on the table really she had to lean her head back over the armrest to look at ron and the upside down view of him was rather disorienting that the cause i ve always wanted to be he crawled over to her and dangled a licorice wand temptingly in front of her you know he said taking a big bite out of the candy before she could grab it harry never lets me sit on his lap you re missing out she said off handily snitching the licorice right out of his mouth very comfy ron chuckled as she happily finished off the candy wand and fell back against harry used to having to work around her legs harry expertly reached for an acid pop and hermione unwrapped it for him sirius cleared his throat and hermione sleepy eyes closed took it as a sign that she was kicking him again so she curled her feet around harry legs and sighed softly ron however was eyeing the annoyed look on sirius face directed towards his two friends it getting a bit late we should go to bed remus voice was tight when ron glanced over at him he could barely contain his amusement as he saw the lycan frowning at hermione back ron shook his head they d probably never understand hermione completely alienated from the bubble headed females of their year and best friends with two males had over the years turned hermione into a guy gal she was most comfortable around and in the company of guys so far as he knew his little sister was her only female friend and probably lily now too circumstances had made her that way and she filled her position as one of the guys with gusto lily had hit the niffler right on the head hermione spent all her time with him and especially harry she d once told the bespectacled boy that if he d been gay it would have been tv show perfect as it was they were inseparably close and without doubt would be for the rest of their lives they were something ron could always count on harry and hermione never one without the other they would always be together never dating just together it was a comforting constant in a life of inconsistency of course to his knowledge she d never had any blokes interested in much less two and that made her behavior personality and relationship with harry and himself much more easily misunderstood at any rate it was going to be amusing to watch the subject of his thoughts yawned and it was clear she was getting drowsy instead she murmured i wanna sit by the fire a little longer chuckling harry patted her knee and threw his other arm over the back of the couch i guess that means i staying too mmm hmm she mumbled through a grin well she has gotten all situated james reasoned cracking a smile he never could be serious it would help she sighed if remus and sirius would stop glaring at me she opened one eye smiling faintly at the varied looks of embarrassment and amusement on the faces of her friends she stretched pushing her toes into sirius side and brushing her fingertips against the table lamp behind her alrighty she yawned bedtime finally harry exaggerated he started to laugh when hermione made no move to get up um bestest best friend you gotta get up and go to your room too sleepy she complained into the armrest with a roll of his eyes ron hoisted her up onto his back she cooperatively wrapped her legs around his waist and clutched his neck letting her head loll on his shoulder i ll get her to bed the rest of you head on up as they all put their stuff away and trekked to their respective dorms they could hear hermione mumbling all the way into her head girl rooms this is how it works she said you put me to bed and i wake you up perfect i ll talk to ron about it hermione was wide awake this spell is designed to tap into one sense of self knoll barked out her lecture with audible precision when you are balanced your spells are bloody stronger all in all a handy spell to know the incantation is liberatio praebeo long e after the a dontwant you turning into a ruddy milk carton hermione had already written out the translation phonetically beneath the original incantation it looked smart but no one who was copying off her notes could make sense of it still they copied it anyways now all you do is tap the top of your head and recite the incantation she wrapped the top of her pointed hat with the long yard stick to demonstrate and barked out the spell if you re unadventurous page one ninety two tells you what to expect knoll looked positively annoyed about divulging that fact lily probably would have opened her book to read but knoll fixed her rather batty looking eyes on the redhead and she shifted uncomfortably in her seat trying not to open her dada book she glanced at hermione are you gonna look she whispered loud enough for hermione to hear hermione shook her head in the middle of pushing up her sleeves i ve already read this chapter sirius groaned beside her but remus leaned in almost conspiratorially and whispered me too hermione grinned did you read the part about gwendolyn the gorgon she giggled for some unknown reason to the eavesdropping sirius remus started quietly laughing too as if she could use atlantan dewdrops to she might as well use a himoglyphus charm she finished for him and they both laughed deliriously into their robe sleeves a joke that sirius was completely out of you are such nerds he sighed shaking his head you think so hermione scoffed yeah he turned on devilish charm but it sexy hermione eyebrow lifted as she prepared to cast her spell i wasntaware you felt that way about remus she commented dryly sirius groaned when remus waved coquettishly at him liberatio praebeo hermione recited perfectly as she tapped her hair with her wand tip all around her students did the same she slipped into the predicted trance and waited for the blackness to fill her mind but it didntcome instead a bright blue sparkle darted across the white field of her vision she watched it shift from red to gold to purple and then it exploded in a silent burst of shimmering rainbow lights the multitude of colors landed upon some unknown boundary and black ink spilled out from each contact point until she saw nothing but ebony in time to the beating of her heart it pulsed to white and then back to black over and over again sirius watched her eyelashes fluttering spastically against her face a sliver of white peeking from beneath her jerking eyelids it cantbe that bad he muttered to himself and performed the charm as well he thought everything had gone dark until he focused harder and caught the faint navy outline of a building it was large and castle like with its turrets and raised drawbridge as it moved closer he could see greater details the flagless poles the barred windows it became too large to even see all of it and soon it was jut the pattern of bricks flying straight at him he squeezed his eyes tighter shut and everything went blue one by one the rest performed the charm as well lily vision was a small ring its gem pulsating pink and maroon the more she focused the faster the pulse went until it was a dizzying swirl of colors that twisted into a picture resembling the muggle art of spin paint the swirl grew greater than the ring and a vibrant cherry red heart flashed in front of her before pink filled her sight james struggled to keep his eyes open but they fell shut and he fell into the trance in a series of quick slides he saw a skull with a snake a wand bursting into flames and a rearing lion its jaws open in a silent roar the disjointed slideshow repeated faster this time slipping without a pause into the next cycle just when he thought he was going to be sick the crazily spinning pictures slowed down and stopped on the lion glowing green brow furrowed as he watched his mum and dad twitch under the spell influence harry received a stern look from knoll and grudgingly tapped his head silver dripped down across the blackness that came without light and once the shaking metallic sheen covered his vision an invisible hand inked the black outline of a mighty sword a flash of light and the drawing was made real a group of stars he hadntnoticed before flared to life and the faint outline of a man was made by the connected lights just as the star man reached for the sword it all disappeared and he was left staring into silver in his entranced state remus regarded the golden bell before him but couldntmake sense of it it swung silently back and forth being as unobtrusive as it could before it was replaced by swinging charms equally gold equally silent the bell reappeared faint and transparent as if a ghost and overlaid itself upon its partner the charms making for a dizzying image that remus wished would just disappear ron was the last to be charm himself mostly because he d lost his wand somewhere in the mess of his bag a set of golden eyes immediately blinked back at him he scrunched up his nose in surprise and the feline orbs were replaced by rapidly passing patterns of stripes and spots and possibly more that he couldntcatch sight of as if they were moving too fast for themselves the designs collided into a disastrously jumbled picture that like a spill of paint began dripping down and out of sight hermione came to first her eyes snapping open to the blinding classroom light with such suddenness that tears formed in her eyes then like a set of dominos the rest followed in the order they d gone heads snapping up like a displaced wave whoa ron exhaled that was bloody brilliant james agreed thumping harry on the back hermione on the other hand exchanged worried looks with remus you didntsee black did you she made it a statement no was all he said in a quiet voice while sirius who had been eavesdropping again launched into a detailed reenactment lily was nose deep in her textbook realizing as she read that what she d experienced hadntbeen normal catching the tail end of hermione and remus conversation she offered a theory of her own well this book was copyrighted in 24 they ve probably adapted the spell since then but we didntall see the same thing hermione brought up the gears in her head already turning it probably user specific sirius said and waved his hand frivolously as if brushing away the conversation let talk about something more important like how we re going to set the slytherin tablecloth on fire sighing hermione turned back to her book but the words might as well have not been in front of her for all the reading she was doing her mind was going over the possible reasoning for their alien experience she caught lavender and padme talking about how scary their dark visions had been and it only cemented hermione belief that what they d all experienced hadntbeen normal i ll bet a fizzing whizbee you re not plotting fire starting techniques remus said quietly she shook her head and managed a faint smile before her face fell serious again i dontknow what this means and that bothers me she confessed glancing up into his blue gray eyes do you think it might have anything to do with those tempus infractus scrolls he proposed the ones you used to bring us here she made a face that the only thing i can think of actually she supplied tucking her hair behind her ears she turned slightly in her seat so that she could look properly at her conversation companion i wonder if this spell is tied to it somehow remus lips pursed and she could tell he was rolling it around in his mind perhaps with the right people of course instead of tapping into a person sense of self it taps into something else he theorized gesturing with his hand when the words failed him hermione expression became thoughtful something else she repeated what do you mean a hidden power some blocked memory a secondary identity he rambled off a few more using his fingers to tick them off who knows what was represented by what we saw i ll talk to the order and look in on it she decided finally telling him of her plans i ll help he agreed two minds are better than one especially in research hermione smiled at the tiny joke and brushed back the hair that had fallen into her face yet again thanks she told him in gratification who knows we might actually be the seven warriors from the scrolls he grinned handsomely you had doubts she laughed and waved her hand behind her without looking with this motley crew we dontexactly fit the warrior genre i sure you ll whip us into shape professor his compliment was teasing and made a pretty pink blush rise on the apples of her cheeks speaking of training she said quickly steering to a new topic there ll be a little bit of time afterwards to get a start down at the library if you want to meet up he nodded his consent sure but we should both probably shower first she nodded her head laughing you dontthink you ll be too tired she gibed with a grin back he replied with a modest i ll do what i can sirius watched hermione turned back with barely contained frustration she was laughing at something remus said and talking in depth with him about something sirius couldntfollow but what he really didntfollow was hermione behavior they d kissed last night and here she was right next to him by the way flirting with another guy she didntseem the promiscuous type but the way she was acting confused him he resolved to sort things out with her in astronomy hermione on the other hand completely unaware of sirius angry confusion talked with remus the rest of class finalizing their plans to meet in the library that evening and when they were finally out in the hallway and on their way to transfiguration she was too busy to notice much of anything as she was checking ron essay while she walked they all left lunch together walking slowly so they could continue chatting before they had to part for their separate classes to sirius surprise hermione sought him out and pulled him away from the others we need to talk she told him as she lead him several paces back from the main group nothing good ever started with those words he joked waiting for an opportunity to ask her about dada she got right down to business i wanted to apologize for last night she said bluntly that shouldnthave happened excuse me he exclaimed grabbing her arm that was the last thing he d expected out of her mouth she shot him a pointed look and twisted her arm free resuming her walking he caught back up with her and barely got a word out before she cut him off i dontknow exactly what you thought was going to happen here the spell brought you forward to save the world not to start a relationship with someone i like to multitask the joke was dead growled out in an angry voice as sirius stalked along beside her crisp walk hermione sighed and a hand went to her aching forehead as she struggled to find the words i so sorry if i somehow gave you the wrong idea i know you think i attractive he accused yes she admitted easily you are very handsome but but there is more than one reason why this canthappen why it wouldntwork the fact that you re from a past before i was born being a key one she explained in exasperation you have no problem hanging all over moony he spat or is he just the exception what hermione gasped in bewilderment what on merlin green earth are you talking about nevermind he muttered darkly listen she ordered no one is going to be having relationships with anyone it just simply isnt done sirius looked down at her in suspicion do you know something i don t hermione of course she sniffed rather haughtily in response to his angry demeanor you re being ridiculous you know that right there are rules that are meant to be followed and there are rules that are meant to be broken he interjected hermione looked at him in muted shock you want me to just go against all the rules and do whatever i feel like yes witches and wizards who travel to the future are surrounded by much different circumstances when such time travelers return to the past they some are meant to be followed she repeated in a low voice that brooked no argument hermione it would not end well for you sirius and i dontwant to be the reason how could it not end well that just one of those things i know that you don t that not good enough hermione grabbed his arm please sirius i dontwant this to ruin our friendship this hadntbeen an easy choice for her and he had to know that no matter what her friends thought there were greater things at work here and they required rules be followed so she d never know if she d be able to care about sirius having known his future self because she wasntgoing to give herself the chance they were splitting off to go to their different classes and james was waiting ahead for the pair to catch up sirius was silent the entire way hermione fingers digging into his arm just before they reached james he spoke up you worry too much though it was half heartedly spoken hermione instantly smiled thanks for understanding she whispered pulling away to catch up with james but the truth was sirius didnt understand are you excited for the hogsmeade trip hermione asked james hoisting her bag higher on her shoulder as she slowed down yeah i want to check out those gloves ginny mentioned he rubbed his hands together excitedly like a little boy on christmas eve and we can finally get you lot your own set of uniforms she reminded him glancing over at sirius on her other side he was recovering quickly from their little talk and smirked as he said and what will our little miss granger be shopping for books of course she laughed and pushed open the astronomy door sirius 22 remus 28 threesome 4 a n sorry it been so long hope to have another chapter up tonight though where was hermione this morning james yawned still looking abnormally sleepy for eleven in the morning she lets us sleep in on the weekends ron spoke up from his lounging position on the couch unless there quidditch of course by the way harry cut in we ve gotta tell her to wake us up earlier this year on game days ron made a face you mean wake you up earlier i actually like to let my eyes stay closed for awhile to the marauders he said crazy that one he jerked his head at harry says he needs four hours to get into game mode where is hermione remus asked noting the brunette lack of presence lily and gin are turning her into a girl harry said blandly too distracted by the turning pages of his quidditch magazine to put much inflection in his voice turning her into a girl remus repeated harry nodded not really listening and turned the page she sent out a distress signal about a quarter of an hour ago what a distress signal sirius made a face disbelieving something about save yourself he flipped to an article near the back i wasntreally listening he confessed ron took the magazine straight out of his hands and threw it down shut onto the coffee table time to go in an uncanny synchronicity a door slammed upstairs immediately following his words and thundering footfalls echoed down the stairwell hermione bypassed the final four steps with a rushed leap and she was vaulting over the couch before they could get a word out hide me she begged as new footfalls began how did you know she was coming a slowly awakening james asked of ron looking down blithely at the brunette trying to hide behind him it like a sixth sense hermione keep your psychotic girlfriend away from me with that wand hermione hissed trying to make the sleeves of his jumper spread far enough away from his arm to cover her face we ve only just started ginny exclaimed bounding down into the common room ahead of lily just started harry checked the underside of his wrist for his watch face you ve been up there half of an hour her hair took ages lily defended as if on cue they all looked back on the hiding hermione her still damp hair had been tricked into looking tamer than it was by being confined to two twin french braids with her wild and distracting curls pulled back she was revealed to have a rather pretty sort of face something her bushy hair had made difficult to notice normally of course the feminine qualities of her face were somewhat overshadowed by the pale worn jeans and handed down manchester united jumper she wore nice clothes ron complimented with a pointed look at his sister that made her mouth click shut now let go hermione stuck her tongue out triumphantly and squeezed in between remus and harry to the front of the group putting as much distance between herself and the other girls as possible she wasntgoing to let either one of them near her today with their wands still in their possession after handing their passes to an extra surly snape who was filling in for filch and executing another race between sirius and hermione in an attempt for him to win back the chocolate frogs he d lost the rosy faces teenagers found themselves in honeydukes where hermione was collecting her double prize i mad at you she told him sucking on a chocolate frog what for he exclaimed juggling the sweets boxes she was making him carry as part of his bet you made me race you and kick your arse she explained simply and now i being forced to eat these frogs i ll take em james offered with a greedy eye on the twin wrapped packages no way she shook her head i under moral obligation to eat every one sirius face lit up in a childishly gleeful sort of way and you could almost see the comprehension dawning on him you d think the daughter of dentists wouldntbe allowed a sweet tooth he drawled and in so doing made hermione suddenly swallow a painfully large bite of squirming chocolate i not but this is a magical sweet completely different she reasoned perusing the shelves ron rolled his eyes in passing arms filled with every sort of sugary confection a store like honeydukes could offer and hermione finally took pity on sirius enough to shrink the boxes of chocolate and stash them in her pocket let head to the robe shop harry shouted so they could all hear over the din of younger kids screaming for candy before we have to carry ron out on a hippogriff i gonna kick your arse when we get out of here his threat was made an eensy less threatening by the flakes of pumpkin pasty flying out of his mouth the group headed next to gladrags and using the private fund hogwarts had established for just such odd emergencies bought lily and the boys their own set of the school uniform as well as new robes that seemed to be the breaking point however for after which ginny took off for the quidditch store with an eager james dragging a not so enthusiastic lily behind hermione immediately sought out the bookstore and with half of their group save for lily at their respective obsessions the remaining four split off as well harry to show sirius and remus the new and improved zonko s and ron to get a drink with hannah abbot they were all to meet at the three broomsticks in an hour lily stamped her feet to regain the feeling three quarters of an hour had passed since they d gotten to the store and she had yet to be given the chance to sit down just as she was planning for an unfortunate something to fall into her boyfriend tea and about to beg james to let her go to the bookstore something odd caught her eye a man standing across the street was dressed from head to toe in official looking white and looking ridiculous in a sea of brightly clad teenage students sorry lils james said taking her hand and steering her down the walk to a bench lily realized her face must have held an embarrassingly vacant expression and her cheeks flushed the peculiar man in white had at least done one thing he d made her forget about the aching in her feet but now it was back and she sunk onto the wooden seat with a sigh of relief james draped an arm around her shoulders the box containing his new chaser gloves placed carefully beside him you done she asked implying with a dart of her eyes the package next to him yeah he was slouched with his legs crossed at the ankle and his eyes watching the passers by lily followed his example casting her eyes up and down the street past the doorway where the man in white had stood to the joke shop down near the end of the lane it not quite the same as i remember it lily murmured eyes alighting on a new lamp post it looks it but then i notice something that wasntthere before i know what you mean james agreed there are things i shouldntknow but i feel like i do lily bobbed her head and buried her chin in the lapels of her corduroy jacket it must be our memories catching up with us do you think it ll be weird when we go back knowing our future i mean he was looking at her she could tell and very slowly she met his eyes and voiced the concern she d been harboring since the beginning do you think we will get back home the arm slung over the bench dropped onto her shoulders and he squeezed her to him in a reassuring way hermione ll find a way lily thought about this he was right if anyone could find a way it would be hermione and she d do whatever it took to see them home again that much lily was sure on even only knowing the other girl for two weeks with a blossoming smile lily snuggled closer to her boyfriend content to spend their last ten minutes with each other watching the people hermione was so enthralled with her newly purchased book that she didntlook up as she stepped out into the bright september light and consequently collided with another body rubbing her pained bum hermione was startled when a hand was thrust just under her nose she took the slender and obviously feminine hand and snatching her book off the ground as she rose up allowed the other person to pull her back to her feet a middle aged witch looked down her small glasses and smiled disconcertingly at her looking decidedly serpentine in the eerie way she appeared pleased to have been run so rudely into hermione returned it with an uncertain smile of her own terribly sorry she murmured and was about to make a hasty retreat before the woman hand on her arm held her in place the grip was firmly demanding not at all a match to the smiling face my name is carolyn eustice from the ministry of magic hermione took in the all white outfit and nodded to convey her understanding mouth too dry to speak for a moment can i help you ma am she offered with strained formality the ruby red lips parted baring the perfect sort of teeth her parents refused to let her magically achieve we were not able to find your headmaster in the castle she trailed off with a saccharine sweetness hermione believe was meant to bait her into giving something away what that something was she had no idea would you happen to know his whereabouts hermione didn t i believe he had some business in belgium she supplied schooling her face to look excitedly helpful the murky green brown eyes soaked in the snippet of information gleefully like it was a jewel of knowledge she d just coerced out of a seemingly innocent girl the woman carolyn swept off without so much of a goodbye leaving hermione standing alone in the street her hands were trembling as they slipped the book into her pocket and her steps were staggered as she turned her feet towards the three broomsticks any sight of white hastened her steps and by the time she passed durvish banges she was in a full out run her thick braids slapping against her back as she ducked her head down into the wind pushing through a group of laughing ravenclaws hermione stumbled barely seeing with her lowered face her way into the alleyway beside the bar her breathing was heavy and her spiking adrenaline was accompanies by a heaviness pushing down on her shoulders and trying to force her to her knees with shaking hooked fingers she reached up and clawed at lily painstakingly fashioned braids one of the ties snapped with the ferocity at which she yanked but the other got tangled in her curls it was ripped from her braid with desperate hands to the sound of ripping hair a high pitched keen fluxed in and out of her voice whimpering as she ran her hands wildly and urgently through her locks to separate the woven strands when her wild hair was in a bushy mess around her face she ran her uncontrollable hands shaking down her face and slid down the wall to the ground the icy stone was soothing as she pressed her cheek against it one hand bracing herself against the wall and the other clutched the thick material of her jumper trying to slow the rampant thudump thumping of her heart shaking her hair to fall over her face like a curtain she brought her head down between her knees and sucked in the stuffy air of the alley when the tremors had passed and she was no longer breathing any differently than before she exhaled slowly and stood up any attempt she made to flatten her hair only made it more staticky and unmanageable and so she gave up on the mess oddly comforted by the feel of rough curls across her cheeks and the warm weight on the back of her neck steeling herself for the bright lights of the open street she checked to make sure her book hadntbeen lost in her panic attack and brushed off her jeans before rounding the corner and entering the three broomsticks warm humid air engulfed her like a grandmother enveloping her grandchild in a big bear hug and her nose was assailed with a variety of pleasing smells the thick vanilla of the candles on the walls the earthy smell of autumn and a rich tang of cinnamon arising from the day special she caught sight of ron vibrant hair and made her way to their usual table in the back corner james and lily were still absent hermione slid in beside harry and was reaching for his butterbeer when her eyes alighted on the boys faces what the bloody hell happened she shrieked ron was sporting a split lip sirius jaw was red and remus face was smeared with dirt harry looked worse of all his glasses cracked and the skin around his left eye turned a disgusting purple bruise harry got into a fight with some slytherin remus replied automatically then looked shocked that he d even opened his mouth sirius scowled you said you wouldnttell moony malfoy attacked you hermione said aghast fumbling her wand out of her pocket harry attacked him remus ron shouted the lycan covered his mouth already sinking into his seat sorry he insisted it just slipped out honest hermione gave them all a stern look at least one of you has some sense she quipped repairing her friend glasses with an ease brought on by performing it so many times dontfuss mione ron groaned she rapped him sharply on the head with her wand dontyou mione me she reprimanded but her hands on his face were gentle and soft an unconscious effort to keep from paining him more lightly alighting her wand tip upon the cut of his lip she murmured simple healing spell and it was gone your hands are cold he complained pushing her wand away to swig his butterbeer well look at you all just sitting here looking terrible like this she scolded quickly scourgifying remus face across the table we were getting around to it harry mumbled you dontlook like a basket of roses yourself sirius pointed out as she leaned over to reduce the swelling of his face what happened to your hair it was a mess she already knew that but glancing down she saw grit and grime across her jeans from when she d sat in the dirty alley i was helping hagrid round up a thestral that got loose she lied fluidly banishing the violet of harry black eye to yellow and then back to the normal flush of his skin now tell me why you engaged in a duel with malfoy she demanded before the others could question her it wasnta duel harry replied rather snappily hermione brow furrowed i dontunderstand we were walking out of zonko when malfoy and his grunts walked by ron explained the next thing i knew harry and malfoy were rolling on the ground punching the sod out of each other harry just tackled him remus supplied and this time was rewarded with a resounding hit upside the head from sirius ow remus hand immediately went to his head that hurt i barely touched you he countered twirling his bottle along the table you bloody well punched me in the head remus grumbled wincing as he rubbed the spot of injury well if you d stop opening your mouth the bottle in his grip shattered into a thousand shards littering the table with glittering brown fragments gods hermione cried sirius his face screwed in discomfort he lifted his hand up for view blood was beading around the few punctures he d acquired brown glass jutting out of his skin blimey ron was gaping at the shrapnel that had pierced the booth leather back directly between himself and remus the glass just gave out sirius was saying you get tired of abusing me so you attack your drink remus was muttering at the same time harry was cleaning up the glass and repairing any tears in the booth while hermione diligently worked on sirius hand and with ron gaping still at the entire thing lily and james finally arrived sorry we re la what the devil have you done to your hand james and lily both squeezed in on hermione side saving a little space with lily sort of half sitting on james no one was really concerned about seating arrangements at the moment he crushed it with his bare hands ron insisted gesturing wildly at the pile of glass harry had constructed james face broke out in a fierce grin wicked he slid harry bottle across to hermione patient do it again mate hermione shot him a disapproving look that turned to one of disbelief as sirius obligingly picked up the butterbeer he squeezed it firmly but to no avail for a moment he scowled at it as if willing it to shatter the bottle was probably faulty lily reasoned plucking the bottle out of his grasp much to hermione relief the both of you are ridiculous she grumbled turning over sirius hand for one last ocular check it was all healed both james looked confused sirius and harry he got into a fist fight with malfoy of all things ron banished the glass hill with a flick of his wand it was probably pretty entertaining though what did he say to you harry hermione prompted turning as best she could in the crowded booth to address him he was staring out the window nothing did he do something to provoke you no he rested his chin in his palm and looked back at her out of the corner of his eye he was just walking past and i had this urge this need to just punch him one right in that sneering face of his you could get detention for that lilt exclaimed harry shrugged body still slouched towards the window i think malfoy and my rivalry is past tattling hermione and ron exchanged looks no they answered simultaneously listen harry hermione started she placed a hand on his arm malfoy ll do anything to get you expelled we ll probably lose fifty house points for this it wasntmy fault harry shouted his emerald eyes were blazing with an angry fire but hermione was unrelenting then whose i dontknow he snapped irritably avoiding her honey gaze hermione sighed looking over his form tense with frustration and decided it would be best to question him another time that is if he wasntexpelled for assault on another student things sure have been weird today lily murmured offhandedly hermione looked up what do you mean a wizard stopped james and i on the way here lily didntfinish the sentence she waved it away as unimportant he looked really funny all dressed in white a man from the ministry harry attention came rocketing back to the conversation lily blinked in bewilderment and nodded yes how did you know their investigation team wears white harry bespectacled gaze moved quickly to ron and then back to lily i met one of them too hermione added quietly they re here to evaluate hogwarts defenses and root out any possible spies apparently they ve gotten wind of a leak of information coming from here how come you always know everything ron exclaimed exasperated at the injustice of it all it was posted on the common room notice board ronald she shook her head wearily and began to subconsciously fiddle with the sleeves of her jumper hermione lily was peering at her intently with a peculiar expression on her pretty face is something bothering you hermione smiled quickly and sat on her fidgeting hands no of course not except for having to nanny you lot all day remus looked at her oddly what did you do to your hair lily pouted hermione leaned back and out of reach as lily moved to touch her curls thestral chasing she repeated the lie the table rattled slightly and hermione lips pursed to see remus in physical discomfort as if her lie had been a slap in the face you werenthelping hagrid it was a statement hermione shifted apprehensively under the sudden six stares placed upon her i dontlike people seeing my face alright it was almost true that disconcerting look was on remus face again and then it switched suddenly to an expression of surprise things have been a little weird hermione finally relented i gonna go find dumbledore make sure there isnta magical disruption storm coming dontbe such a wet blanket hermione ron groused we were just going to show remus the new shrieking shack smiling kindly at remus she shook her head i sorry but i ll have to pass james and lily obligingly stood up and climbed out of the booth so hermione could slide out i ll see you all at dinner you mean that this time sirius teased hermione shrugged laughing no rest for the wicked she called over her shoulder and swept out the door polls closed cuz sirius was getting beat down in an embarassing sort of way sirius 26 remus 60 threesome 5 not saying this is how it going to turn out cuz that not a surprise but thank you all for your input and your reasons that ranged from legitimate to giggly fun new poll i want to know how many of you think hermione is going to get out and how many think she ll go mad released or not would love your feedback a n okay so it took one more day than expected but it is rather long and fun filled hoping to have the next one up by late tomorrow night when i done with class and that will be back with hermione love you all oodles for your fabulous reviewing enjoy sunday september 18th one week after hermione trial the gryffindor common room was deserted a virtual ghost town with a fine layer of dust settling in the corners where feet no longer trod as per every evening after dinner the large grated fireplace was filled with a brightly crackling flame it was an empty symbol unnoticed in the equally empty common room remus was in the library he d scarcely been away from it for the past five days and more recently he d been missing classes it wasntrare to find him passed out in a pile of thick volumes while in the middle of a late night research marathon or hidden behind a mound of empty styrofoam coffee cups with the book so close to his tired eyes that his nose touched the pages sirius was on the grounds every spare moment between classes was spent in the small grass clearing beside the lake his presence completely obscured by the three quarter circling of trees on the fringe of the forbidden forest it wouldntbe until hours past dark that he would finally drag himself through the portrait and drop into his bed not bothering to shower until the next morning when he d drag himself out of the tower and repeat it all over again only able to sleep by working himself to pure exhaustion harry and ron were never seen they d missed every class since hermione had been forcibly removed from the great hall and after her sentencing they d been running around with the order grasping at everything and anything that could be done to get her out ignoring any and all teachers most especially dumbledore no one knew quite what words had been exchanged between the two parties but they knew that there had been a falling out of drastic proportions luckily the white jackets had cleared out immediately following the arrest and there had been no following investigation in which they d had to conceal hermione white cube which was especially fortunate because they had no idea how to put everything back inside two days ago they had disappeared into hermione room and no one had seen hide nor hair of them since the atmosphere of the gryffindor tower was despondent at best lily and james were the only ones out of the six to have gone to dinner that night bang the portrait slammed open with a disgruntled cry from the fat lady james the raven haired boy in question was walking quickly through the common room across one of the few worn paths and up the boys dormitory steps with his girlfriend lily evans right behind him james dontbe reckless the redhead pleaded grabbing his sleeve i going he replied firmly and fell to his knees to begin rummaging through his trunk lily ducked beneath the flying paraphernalia and knelt beside him what is the matter with you she tried to shut the trunk lid but he was stronger than her and he kept it held up with one hand while the other continued searching and lily struggled to use all her weight to close it again someone has to do something he said his voice growing louder in the empty dormitory everyone doing something james remus is in the james cut her off remus has gone through every legal book and hasntfound anything that we can appeal for sirius is running himself down without point and harry and ron have become recluse no one is doing anything a thick swell of liquid cloth pooled into his lap and a crinkled parchment was soon thrown on top of it grabbing his invisibility cloak and the marauder map in one hand he stood up to leave but lily hand tightened around his wrist we may not have found a way to help hermione she said lowly yet but we are doing something that not good enough james insisted he turned on his heel and stalked out of the dorms lily having to jog on her shorter legs to keep up and maintain her grip on his forearm i know you re worried but we have no idea what they could be doing to her james shouted pulling away she watched him pace the common room anxiously stirring up clouds of dust whenever he strayed into the disused portions of the floor she been there six days lily six days i know she whispered using the couch back to support her but the order worthless lily fists slammed onto her hips and she gave him a look that was clearly hermione you re being utterly daft look and what your plan he hesitated in his pacing and looked pensive i gonna get to azkaban find her and start blowing stuff up he nodded his head in abstract agreement with himself as if he were deciding what a great plan he had after all james lily shrieked the portrait door swung open and they both turned to look at the new arrival it was dumbledore and he was supporting a half unconscious remus have i interrupted something he asked in a tone too light for contrasting with the mood between lily and james she pointed a quick finger at her boyfriend james is going after hermione he scowled at her before turning a defiant look to dumbledore arms cross haughtily over his chest so that is ill advised mr potter dumbledore said quietly what good is your advice james muttered but everyone heard him save maybe remus james lily hissed mortified what he answered defensively maybe harry and ron are right he supposed to be the most powerful wizard in the world and he canteven keep a seventeen year old girl out of prison dumbledore hmph ed beneath his beard and nodded you are entitled to your opinion mr potter james lips were pressed into a thin line but i must ask dumbledore murmured that you never again accuse me of doing nothing where miss granger is concerned i would trade places with her if i could arms slowly unfolding themselves james looked chagrined he might have said something if there hadntbeen a particularly loud groan from remus trying to stand on his own lily hurried over and helped dumbledore guide the exhausted gryffindor to one of the couches musty from neglect the sofa acrid fumes stymied a fit of coughing from remus lily was already conjuring a compress and searching her satchel for a spare pepper up potion when another set of footsteps entered the room party eh padfoot sirius tree was all he said he must have been wearing at least five pounds of dirt and twice that amount of grass twigs were jutting out of every seeming location and there was a large bloody smear at his temple that disappeared into his ebony hairline james and just like that their argument was forgotten and james was slipping sirius arm over his shoulders and helping him over to the couch so lily could care over both of their friends tree he grunted in question moving sirius around the coffee table and depositing him on the floor beside remus couch he hissed in pain at his unceremonious dropping and rubbed ruefully at his shoulder apparently i ve got me a stronger right hook than i thought james quirked an eyebrow it fell on me lily was astounded the tree fell on you there was a sigh only you would punch a tree the breathy words were followed by a jerking chuckle remus pushed himself into a sitting position leaning heavily on the armrest and the damp rag of lily conjuring fell into his lap only you would torture yourself reading sirius joked back remus face was washed blank and sirius face scowled as he realized his error in words remus looked away from his friends only to glance back in surprise as a wheezy breath pushed weakly at his cheek lily he asked in surprise she had one hand pressed to her breast and her face was flushed pink as she tried to suck in air that didntseem to be making it far down her throat lily james was on his feet now leaning over her and dumbledore was moving quickly around to their side lily she was clutching at her neck now mouth opening and shutting like a landed fish and her face turning redder by the minute her beautiful emerald eyes were filled with an ugly silent fear pushing himself weakly up remus moved with the strength of a newborn foal as he reached out and held the back of his palm a fraction of an inch above her gaping lips she not breathing he exclaimed as loudly as he was able but it came out as a desperate sort of murmur dumbledore had to forcibly move james and sirius out of his way lowering himself beside her face in a liquid fluidity that spoke of an age younger than his own he pressed a weather hand to the large pulse in her throat it was thumping erratically in a frantic accompaniment to lily panic but the rhythm was already slowing as her lungs burned with carbon dioxide and her circulation slowed he pressed his wand lightly against the small triangle of skin bared between the unbuttoned collar of her shirt and said ennervate like a muggle doctor shouting clear a visible shock went through lily slender frame and her back arched up and off the couch it was a painful sound as she gasped in a desperate breath of blessed oxygen james pulled her into his arms and hugged her tightly bloody hell lily he exclaimed into her hair you sure know how to scare a bloke step back a moment dumbledore instructed james still grateful to him for helping his girlfriend moved away from her with only a kiss to her forehead as a hesitation their headmaster cast a spell none of them had ever heard before and the only sign that lily had been the spell target was a slight shiver down her body as it worked over her i feel kinda numb y she described poorly i had to shield your power before it did damage to you he explained straightening his robes lily looked at him as if he d gone mad power dumbledore was shaking his head ah but merlin if i haventgone and gotten ahead of myself will one of you please fetch mr weasley and the other mr potter this is something that affects the seven of you seven james repeated you mean hermione too dumbledore nodded that is why we need misters potter and weasley that ll be easy sirius deadpanned remus breath hitched and he gave sirius an odd look sirius rolled his eyes i was kidding remus frown deepened and he seemed confused i know he said slowly taking deep breaths to regain his breathing mr black dumbledore interrupted perhaps one of you should go now before mr lupin has a similar episode sirius instantly looked up to the quiet boy on the couch and tried to cover his surprise james and remus were both looking at lily what you should go hun james told her remus added they might actually open the door lily floundered helplessly i i don t lily james pleaded maybe we should just leave them alone she argued they just lost their best friend hey sirius shouted making lily press a hand to her temple so did we lily was shaking her head it not the same sirius they ve been friends for years it d be like if you lost james just like men sirius and james met eyes and then abruptly looked away again it was the equivalent of a woman teary eyed hug lily satisfied that her point had come across went on i saw the way they were around each other they arent just friends they re she gestured aimlessly with her hands trying to find the words they re more i dontunderstand remus murmured prompting her to explain it in greater detail her finely arched brows furrowed a moment then her eyes brightened like a lumos spell going off in her head and it seemed she had found the answer connecting her thumb and index finger with their partners on her other hand she held up her hands for view they re like a triangle she began animatedly a triangle sirius interrupted they all looked at him in surprise lily hands still up in the air and his face was unusually grave y yes lily answered a little unsure sirius cursed and began digging through his bag he was muttering something about a prophecy dumbledore motioned for her to continue mr black i sure will enlighten us in a few moments time please go on she smiled weakly if a point was lost she curled one of her index fingers back against her palm it would not longer be a triangle they hold each other together and without hermione they re falling apart remus finished for her she nodded exactly we should let them be dumbledore laid a hand upon her shoulder and she looked up at him with clear bewilderment painted across her delicate features please miss evans i would not ask if this matter were not of grave importance lily looked to james as if asking his opinion and the deep set frown on his face wasnthelpful she gave him a plaintive look that would stem any argument he might have been coming up with and finally came up with her own decision i ll try my best professor she told him standing up but i am no hermione granger setting the rag beside the frantically rummaging sirius for him to clean up with lily straightened her robes and set off for the shadowed doorway concealed beneath the girls staircase polaris she murmured to the portrait of a little girl in her hoopskirt and petticoats she was petting a giraffe so sorry madame the girl curtsied blonde ringlets bouncing the two gentlemen inside have gone and changed the password lily had figured as much rapping her knuckles lightly above the painting inhabitant she leaned closer to hear better harry ron there was no answer it lily please open the door the blonde girl smiled apologetically when there was again no answer lily tugged anxiously on a piece of her hair listen we may have found something it involves hermione there was a loud click of a lock being slid back and very slowly the portrait door swung open she wasntsure if ron had slept in a week his clothes were rumpled beyond repair and his hair was greasy and wild around his darkened eyes with their tired bags he was standing so far into the doorway that she couldntsee around him what he snapped lily grabbed his hand please ron come out into the common room harry too it about all of us there was a short grunt and harry head appeared over ron shoulder alright he said in a blas tone lily shoulder visibly sagged with relief and she grabbed both of their hands as if afraid they d suddenly change their minds and dart back into hermione room and led them out into the common room when the saw dumbledore standing beside the couch both of them tensed and their grips on lily hand tightened lily gasped and a sharp jolt of ice sliced through her back she coughed suddenly stumbled forward and might have covered her mouth if harry and ron grip hadntbeen painfully attached to her the room was reeling around her like a carousel gone off its axis and she tasted bile in the back of her throat she couldntbreathe much less vomit lily james yelled he nearly vaulted over the couch to get to her mr black dumbledore ordered firmly remove them from her sirius didnteven have to get up staring in horror at the suffocating girl harry and ron both released her hands and stumbled back in disbelief instantly lily sagged against james and breathed in deeply one hand pressed over her heart dumbledore murmured his earlier spell again and lily shivered in james arms what the hell ron exclaimed have any of you fully read the tempus infractus scrolls dumbledore asked they all shook their heads he cleared his throat as you know it contained the spell that brought these four to our present time the spell to unite the seven warriors through time miss granger however believed that it contained more and so several members of the order as well as outside sources have been working to translate the remainder of the scrolls what did it say harry demanded evenly it described something called the seven pointed star of power each point delegated to a separate influence strength truth heart and courage ruled by the stronger man beast and magic remus pieced together the information quicker than the rest you mean we yes mr lupin the wizard nodded you are those powers miss evans was awakened into heart lily eyes were as wide as bludgers that is why you were having those episodes miss evans he explained the first i know not what the cause the second came from mr potter and mr weasley strong disfavor towards myself they both scowled at this physical contact enhances your power it would have been worse had i not shielded you beforehand lily was staring hard at remus and he shifted uncomfortably under her piercing jade stare i must ask dumbledore voiced are you able to differentiate between which emotions you re intercepting she turned to face the headmaster keeping eye contact with remus long enough to slowly answer yes very good then what are the rest of us remus asked quickly steering the topic away he was rewarded with a painfully jab to his knee sirius was giving him a disapproving look as the smaller boy rubbed at his leg you moony he said knowingly are truth ron seconded that deduction you couldntkeep your mouth shut at the three broomsticks at least i not fancied by a giraffe remus shot back with a satisfied smug ron was as red as his disheveled hair remember when that entire box of hagrid snifflers came after you sirius reminded him adding his own two knuts for a second time you re definitely beast well ron didntmake a tree fall on him james butted in turning on his friend and you shattered that butterbeer with just your hand sirius crossed his arms over his chest i have no problem being strength you re just jealous no lily defended he courage even if that means he reckless enough to try and break into azkaban speaking of stupid things james interrupted good naturedly insulting himself i believe one of us got involved with a bit of fisticuffs a few days back harry frowned at him and the look deepened into a scowl as he glanced up at a blank faced dumbledore i figured that out at the beginning of this little meeting lily smiled widely to try and smooth the ruffled feathers well if harry man than that makes hermione magic ron supplied makes sense dumbledore stepped forward something must have happened to the seven of you that served as a catalyst to your powers hermione face fazed into remus mind her brow was furrowed and she was tapping a quill against her chin deep in thought she tucked a curl behind her ear and looked at him head tipped slightly to the side as if she were listening to something perhaps with the right people of course instead of tapping into a person sense of self it taps into something else defense against the dark arts the moment he said it aloud hermione face disappeared but he couldnthelp but think he d seen a small smile on her face as it went the rest of them were looking at him expectantly he saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces as he said the liberatio praebeo spell do you remember none of us saw the same thing a castle sirius supplied a ring lily offered and a heart i saw a wonky looking skull a wand james eyes squinted as he tried to remember and a lion i think a constellation orion maybe with a sword harry begrudgingly answered bells and chimes gold remus added cat eyes ron was shaking his head frustrated that he hadntconnected it sooner furs dumbledore was nodding his head again do any of you know what miss granger saw they all shook their heads in turn until it came to harry and ron they werentmoving harry lily queried perplexed the raven haired boy shot dumbledore a foul look that softened at lily confused face he shifted his weight between his feet and looked to ron in silent conference finally though he looked loathed to divulge it he answered hermione she left a diary behind we haventlooked through it yet twenty minutes later harry and ron had locked themselves back in hermione room after being given an appointment with the order to control their powers and were continuing the long process of going through her things the last two days in the filled room had been spent sorting all of hermione research into a large pile atop her bed it was not a small pile to say the least ron dropped the last binding of translations atop the miniature everest and shrunk it all to fit into one of the drawers of the magical filing cabinet harry had transfigured the red leather embossed diary was still sitting on her vanity untouched ron was in the middle of transferring the racks of polyjuice potion to the cabinet when harry called him over depositing the half empty container of flasks beside the waiting rack of veritaserum ron dusted off his hands and moved over to his friend sitting against the side of hermione bed what did you find he asked crouching wearily beside him harry was holding a rather small cardboard box in his lap his hands were shaking burned into the box lid were the letters gt golden trio ron reached over and pulled the lid off nestled at the very top were letters addressed to him and harry they both grabbed them and harry opened his dear harry if you re reading this then my fears have proven true please dontbe angry that i didnttell you but i couldntrisk you and ron for my sake i do know though that i can say this with certainty for the future once you read this letter i will be missing you both terribly azkaban isntthe brightest of places to spend ones time but it worse off without your presence i can only pray that it wontbe too long before we ll be back together harry had to stop for a moment to clear the lump from his throat please help dumbledore any way you can in my absence i know things may seem dark now but we re so close to defeating voldemort so close you can almost touch it with your fingertips i ve left everything to you and ron i know that you will use it to the order every advantage in this war by now you must have seen a great deal more than you d expected and i can only apologize again for not telling you you both have always been the troublemakers and i suppose this year was my turn for skirting the rules i did what i thought needed to be done i d ask that you send my research where it is most needed and kindly send my potions to professor snape he looked around at the shelves and crates of dutifully labeled and stoppered potion flasks and worried why she d felt the need to brew such dangerous and in some cases illegal potions i ve written letters to the others as well please see that they get them and that the papers in this box get to where they need to be as well now i afraid i must end my letter it nearly time for the quidditch game to begin and you know i ve never missed seeing you play dontlet what happened dishearten you who else will take care of ron be kind to the marauders and do your best to help them get back home i fear i was rather unsuccessful in the time i had to find a spell to send them back here the writing started to become a little smeared and watermarks marred hermione perfect cursive i feel rather silly and must look it too crying over a piece of parchment but i canthelp sitting here writing you this letter thinking of a long piece of my life without you no one would have thought it would have taken a troll for us to become friends but it was i who never thought i could become so attached to someone this sounds much like one of those ridiculous love letters one reads in witch weekly but i just know you ll understand what i trying to say we ve become so close and i only just now realizing it and as the stories go it come far too late dontlaugh as i tell you this but when i was little my mum told me about a boy she d known when she was a little girl she told me they were soul mates i knew that word and asked if that why she d married my father i remembered being confused when she d told me that my father hadntbeen the boy she explained to me that she loved my father but soul mates didnthave anything to do with love the boy had been her other half whenever they were together she felt complete and when he died young from a sickness she lost a piece of herself that she could never get back she told me that the one you loved and the one who completed you could be two completely different people and i suppose i ve held on to that belief until now i ve never been in love with you but at the same time i cantthink of a time when i haventloved you just thinking of being without you has ruined the ink though if i tried to rewrite this letter i think i d ruin more i dontwant to feel empty but that what i fear will happen if they take me away from you i think you might be my soul mate harry and that why i afraid i afraid for me but mostly i afraid for you and ron i afraid of what would happen if voldemort ever found you i afraid that you ll both go on and forget all about me but it doesntmatter because no matter the future i ll always love you both azkaban cantbe too bad as long as i have you and ron in my heart please be safe love hermione harry roughly wiped the tears from his eyes and coughed loudly to try and clear the thick lump of emotion in his throat it didnthelp he heard muted sniffling beside him but couldntbring himself to look at ron as he read his own letter vision still watery he pulled out the remaining envelopes and set them on the floor beside the box nestled inside was a small potion rack a light blue ribbon tied into a bow around its handle he lifted it out to read the bottles labels wolfsbane potion he d completely forgotten about the young lupin lycanthropy but hermione always thinking had remembered and brewed some it looked like a gift and harry remembered dimly that in his parents time the potion must not have even been invented yet tucked between two of the bottles was the envelope addressed to remus he set the entire rack on the floor and bent down over the box again he picked up the large stack of parchments the last item in the box and as he read the first paper a hand went to his mouth in disbelief the properties and effects of the aging potion he flipped frantically through the entire stack but they were all the same and by the time he was finished he was crying bitter silent tears in his hands he held hermione homework for the next three weeks right y all better freaking enjoy this cuz you probably aintgetting anything til thursday the 23rd my birthday btw it the christmas season so you re

ya little buggers october 1 death was pressed into the far corner when the first group arrived the smallest ones ran straight to the bars cherubic faces pushing farther to try and see past the gloomy shadows the older ones stuck to the middle with the cameras and the bulb lights inconspicuously glancing over the heads of the shorter ones death was shivering she clutched the tatters of her clothes around her and did her best to regain the warmth that fluxed in and out since harry had left her it came with scorching symphonic delight then left her just as suddenly taking more warmth than it had given her face was beaded with cold sweat and the cell was filled with the echoing rasps of her halting breaths she felt sick get away from there a woman in acid green robes was yanking the small children away from the bars an unintelligible roar was followed by a shriek and the kids all stumbled back against the bars of her cage death didntmove from her corner i gonna eat you she could tell colonel was the one bellowing he liked to terrify anyone who came too near his cell an all too familiar zap filled the hall with the smell of smoking flesh and burning hair after the two some weeks she d resided there death had learned to block out the writhing moans of agony as the brutal shocks subsided from the bodies of her prison companions she would have just curled back up into the corner if it werentfor the chubby face staring at her somberly through the bars get them out she rasped loudly she d been practicing heads turned in the bright lights filling up the normally dim hall and stared at her in surprised interest do you have something to say monster the acid robed woman inquired snootily painfully slowly death unfolded herself from the knot she d made of her limbs and held up a callused hand to block the faint ribbons of light leaking into her corner children shouldn t be here we re conditioning them to never become like the likes of you another woman hissed carefully maintaining her distance death scowled and her cell was suddenly filled with light robert get away from there she howled in pain falling hard to the stone floor as she pressed her shaking grimy fingers to her eyes to block out the retina searing light her temples throbbed with the sudden onset of a headache and the reflexive tears leaked down the line of her face shielding herself with the tattered remains of her robes death squinted at the women and children gathered around her cell they were staring behind her horror making the cold sweat slither down her brow and the knots in her stomach tighten death looked up at the slime strewn walls merlin beard the light flooded to every corner of the small room and the writing on the wall glowed stark white death screamed don t she shrieked and threw her body against the wall pitifully she flung out her hands trying to block her painstaking work from sight but there were too many walls eyes squeezed shut against the torturous flood light the chalk smeared beneath her desperate hands as her eyes watered stop flames erupted inside of her screaming all the way from the floor to the very roots of her hair her sickness melted beneath the lava flow of pleasure flooding every nerve until her very sight burned through the light glass shattered and everything went dark to the terrified screams of little children colonel roared blabber howled and death fell boneless to the merciful dark floor we ve lost the lights a man shouted children hurry back to the entrance the voice of the acid green robed woman echoed shrilly death lay in a heap on the floor content to just lie there basking in the rolling warmth like a drug she d become addicted to the escape and she craved it every moment it was gone she was still lying in that same position when the shouts finally died away and one by one the torches flickered back to life down the long dark corridor an hour must have passed but the rush never abated and death never moved the heat completely took her over making things low in her body clench and the beating of her heart to accelerate its rhythm she was panting always panting but the fire was burning her up inside and in some moments when the euphoria of it was too great she d forget to breathe entirely and only when darkness began to freeze the flames did she remember and large gasping breaths would echo into the hall scarecrow was mumbling it might have been to her she couldnttell something was happening outside something through the heat something was nagging at her crawling through the fire on its belly and becoming deeper and deeper engrained death focused in on that tiny feeling and the passionate waves rolled back not enough to startle her but enough that she was able to hold her eyes open she was facing the wall that didnthelp she might have whimpered at the sudden cold but the more she focused on that little thought the more the heat settled into the background she lifted her head off the cooling floor and her vision reeled for a moment at the sudden movement a tiny face was pressed to the bars of his cage scarecrow was indeed talking but it wasntto her she caught something that sounded like dark magick and useful but the roar of the fire was too strong in her ears despite the nausea it brought she shook her head fiercely to shake the noise from it and managed to pull herself to her knees panting with the effort it took to fight the burning urge to lay back down she nearly toppled over fingers digging into any purchase they could find on the slick stone she swallowed her bile and looked up the child was staring at her it was the same boy from the tour group who is she the voice of the young boy was hollow and even death shivered hunched over and staring at the floor potter spy blabber shrieked and it sounded like she was pounding on the wall that separated them the boy shot a contemptuous look to his left shut up lestrange death eyes widened beneath the fringe of her bangs lestrange she knew that name this is hermione granger the child looked unimpressed gryffindor pride surging hermione scowled up at him feral honey eyes peering out at him from beneath the torrent of her mahogany curls something he most have seen made him lean closer to the bars dark eyes narrowing after a moment he shook his head disregarding his vision as a trick of the light she been all over the papers he told scarecrow they actually think she is one of our master lieutenants death breath caught and she noticed a small detail hovering just outside the torch light where the sleeves of his too large robes had slipped down to the crooks of his elbows just beneath the small fists gripping the bars of her cage a snake infested skull glittered black skull she blinked skull means death eater she stared at the kid impossible got dark magicks she has scarecrow insisted in a hushed whisper she made some kid appear out of thin air and potter come out of the bloomin wall from the wall the child looked down on her with distaste as she slowly slowly put one hand in front of the other and crawled into the light i think you re a fucking idiot the boy turned away from her and backhanded scarecrow through the bars now get ready the kid barked the dark lord wants this breakout to be remembered death fingers curled around the cool metal bars and she leaned her flushed forehead against them grunting with the effort she screamed inside for the flames to die out and hand over hand hauled herself to shaking feet hmph the boy snorted and sharp fingernails pierced the skin of her hands so the gryffindor bitch can stand the hair fell out of death eyes and she bared her teeth at him his black eyes widened under her red hot scowl and he took a step back what the he whore blabber had been spurred on again tramp concubine the boy shoved off death bars with a growl of annoyance and actually stalked over to blabber cell a loud crack resounded into death cell as the boy knuckles met with the flesh of blabber cheek shut the fuck up lestrange i dontcare if you re his favorite or not i ll leave your ass lestrange the memory was there she could feel it every thing she d loved had been sucked from her but this this memory held no happiness she bit her lip til it bled the congealing blood splattering against the stone was what brought the memory back to the surface the department of mysteries the veil sirius bellatrix death yelled the scuffling in the cell beside her ceased and the only sound was of death heavy breaths the boy was suddenly in front of her again moving as silently as the shadows that filled the prison tiny cold fingers gripped her chin roughly and bent it painfully to expose her face to the light blood filled her mouth with the coppery taste of pennies and the red trickling down her chin was what must have made him draw his hand back maybe your boy wonder will come and save you he sneered the boy gave an enraged snarl as he wiped the blood and spit from his face death couldnthave moved if she wanted to but just as he lifted a hand to strike her there was a nose from down the hall death watched the sadistic smile curve his baby lips and strained to hear it was the sound of children voices you re going to kill them death wheezed gripping the bars tightly he got up on the tiptoes of his shined shoes and breathed foully right into her sweating face all hail voldemort death shook with rage as the spittle dripped down her cheek and the heat rose in her clenched fists as the boy put on an eager face and skipped merrily down the hall to meet up with his group again a door opened from the opposite end of the hall and loud crashing noises echoed down it death turned frantically to scarecrow he was hanging through the bars a maniacal look of eagerness on his face the raid was here the death eaters were getting closer she could hear their footsteps echoing on stone as more racing feet were added to it the rapidity increased until she was sure an entire swarm of voldemort forces was surging down the corridor to where the unsuspecting reporters were having the children pose for shots with all the strength she possessed death shook at the bars crying out in frustration she could not break free please she cried give me strength thousands of miles away where he d been dozing on the common room couch sirius eyes snapped open in surprise fire exploded inside her and the roaring crackle of flames met the thunder of dozens of footsteps pounding in her head children were screaming the swarm was upon her and her hand snaked out with inhumane agility she seized a man by the throat and lifted him straight off the ground his comrades ran into his dangling legs and were knocked against the walls those that werentfreeing the nearby prisons stared in awe others continued their run down the hall what the fu death tightened her grip and the man eyes bulged you must stop this she insisted in a panic the fire could no longer be contained to her body and the floor of her cell began to shake the bars rattled and dust rained down from the ceiling somewhere down the hall a little girl screamed she couldntcontrol the power with a desperate scream the bars ripped right off their hinges and were blasted straight across the hall and straight across the man she d gripped between them all four limbs were pinned against scarecrow empty cell and when gravity pulled the metallic wall down to the floor the stumps fell on top of it with a thick meaty sound while the death eater screamed very much alive death retched against the wall wiping her mouth with the back of her hand she stepped over him and staggered down the hall on unsteady feet he d survive if he didntbleed to death each cell she stumbled past was empty doors hanging wide open her bare feet slapped against the stones as she ran picking up her pace off the burning floor she skirted around a corner and careened headlong into black robed bodies covering her head she gave a cowering scream it was echoed by a half dozen shouts and when she opened her eyes the men were crumpled against the floor more masked figures turned at the sudden disturbance and death arm began to burn she flung it outwards and a visible force rocked out against them knocking the death eaters aside as if they were mere playthings help the children were being levitated into the air crying as they were cruelly spun around and around the reporters were being knocked about into one another and against the walls they re wands had been taken by some of the escaped prisoners sagging against the wall death looked up and met the frightened blue eyes of a tiny girl clutching to her blonde pigtails as she was almost dropped by the spell caster death lost control with a snarl of pure rage she leapt into the fray with a fervor and a heat that she hadntbeen capable of moments before her arms trailed behind her as she ran and with sickening cracks the metallic cell doors ripped off their hinges fists swinging she launched the weighty bars into the swarm of death eaters beating a path through to the innocents before they could get back onto their feet death slid through and placed herself between voldemort forces and the levitating wizards and witches stop this she yelled there was a spark behind her and the children began to fall the flames inside her spiked and a large pink bubble engulfed everyone behind her trapping them inside who the hell is she a man demanded over the clamor scarecrow was standing at the fore a stolen wand gripped in his grimy fingers his eyes were wide under the choppy fringe of his dishwater blonde hair that death what can one girl do the boy hissed standing between the blonde and a woman should ve listened scarecrow hissed she ainteven got a wand the boy crossed his arms over his chest and glared at her looking like a petulant child that was being annoyed by some broken toy kill her a dozen green sparking killing curses came straight for her and death knees bent her fists by her head the ground rumbled underfoot and with an inarticulate scream she straightened throwing her head back the stone exploded upward in a spray of concrete and dirt a wall of rock rocketing all the way up to the ceiling break it down she could hear the boy shouting and she looked back over her shoulder at the people she was protecting in the middle of the bubble rita skeeter in her acid green robes stared back in disbelief i won t let them hurt you she promised blood trickling down her cheek the center of the wall exploded death was knocked to the ground by the flying shrapnel but the chunks of rock rebounded harmlessly off the great pink bubble keeping those inside safe a pile shifted and stone clattered to the floor as death surfaced her rage was peaking as the first masked attackers crawled through the hole and with a ferocious snapping of her jaws she narrowed her eyes and they were thrown back pushing off with a spike of adrenaline she crossed her arms over her face and ran straight through the small hole breaking a man high tunnel through the middle of it whoever it was she came barreling into in a plume of dirt and dust met with her fists she d been right after all wizards werentprepared to take a fist in the gut she punched upward with such an unbelievable strength that she lifted the death eater straight off the ground her left hand met the side of his face and he was slapped into the far wall she caught a rushing man behind her in the face with her elbow and as the stream of blood arced through the air she fell into a crouch and kicked upwards at his kneecap sending his leg bending the complete opposite way the wall of rock behind her began patching itself together blocking the fight from the sight of the children and death let the flames carry her through she flipped onto her hands to avoid a curse and kicked at a woman before springing back onto her feet running at the wall she ran halfway up it to the ceiling before she somersaulted and landed with a furious roundhouse in the center of the pack she landed with such force that the stone dented beneath her bare feet with a fierce cry she gripped at nothing and the muscles in her arms strained the cell doors on either side of her were flung open like swatting a fly she swung one hand out and the nearest death eaters were sucked into the cell she flicked out her other hand and the opposite side was thrown into their own cell each cage was filled to the brim with death eaters but no matter how they pushed they could not get out of the tauntingly open doorway hardly able to breath death called to the doors to shut and they did locking the raiders and the prisoners inside the fire was dying her arms up to the elbow were already numb but with a wheeze the scent of burning leaves filled the enclosed space and the death eaters cried out as their wands dissolved to ash her magic was dissolving as well the wall behind her crumbling like the tower of babel she couldntfeel her arms at all now and they hung lifelessly at her sides stumbling every step it was a wonder she made it back at all but she did there was the splatter of blood and there was the unconscious torso and head all that remained of the death eater tripping over the bars on the floor she collapsed to the floor of her cell and was unable to get up her legs were useless now and the icy chill that came with every abandonment of the fire was spreading through her veins faster than the blood they carried eyes rolling upwards she strained to look into the corner see she whispered i can still help voices were shouting from the entrance she hadntreally expected the battle to go unnoticed her eyes were only for harry and ron dontforget the voices and footsteps stopped outside her cell but death lashes had closed over the honey fire that was already fading from her eyes she never saw them the breath dying on her lips completed 1 22 05 2 42 pm posted 1 22 05 6 00 pm a n oh so glad my sats got cancelled for this weekend yay bad weather anyway so sorry it been ages but school been murder i thinking that

you have some time to think about it too i hoping that tr will be done sometime around early mid march remus woke to the annoying chirping of his muggle alarm clock and with a great deal of mental protest rolled over and turned it off he d lost a perfectly good alarm clock to james the week before when his speed in turning the loud object off hadntbeen to the seeker liking he d since moved it to the other side of his bed and out of reach of anyone save himself rolling back onto his stomach he buried his head in his pillow and began the daily ritual of convincing himself to get out of bed this morning however it just didntseem worth it and he d just decided that he would very much like a day of sleeping in when a soft sound like a sigh caught in his werewolf senses another debate should i look up well that would take an awful lot of effort you know yes i know but i really am quite curious but what if you get up and cantget back to sleep that what will happen are you daft dontdo it i know i really shouldn t but i do have classes anyway with a groan and a little more kicking of his legs than was necessary to push back the heavy covers he finally extricated head from pillow and stretched slowly up onto his knees after allowing a rather long winded yawn he smacked his lips together and cringed at the taste of his morning breath vowing to go straight for his toothbrush he shifted onto his bum and turned around to scan the room james was wrapped up in his bed next to him huddled around his snitch pillow just past the edge of the wardrobe sirius bed stuck out with its curtains closed but a tan foot sticking out over the footboard then there was ron bed pigwig was still asleep in his cage atop the trunk at the bed end and his owner more precisely a lump of blankets seemed to be as well what he saw at harry bed however made his jaw drop in the space between the two beds a rudimentary mattress had been transfigured most likely out of some stray sock judging by its ugly gray color and wrapped in the fleece maroon and gold checked throw that the dormitory had a dozen of was harry his glasses were still on albeit a bit skewed which meant he d gotten up sometime in the night and put them on to make the ramshackle bed on which he was now sprawled and now the sixty thousand galleon question why wasnthe in his bed another sigh revved his curiosity and he saw the blankets on harry bed shift alllright if harry wasntsleeping in his bed then who was leaning slightly over the edge of his bed he was able to see around the curtains bunched in the corner of harry and over the footboard where the faint outline of a shape beneath the blankets was visible despite the bulgy comforter he could still make out the slight frame curled underneath it and so before he even saw the pale arm wrapped around a lump of sheets or the fan of toffee curls across the white pillow he knew exactly who d joined the boys dormitory hermione shifted again mumbling something in her sleep and throwing an arm back against the pillows as she unconsciously resituated herself she must have been coming out of rem sleep to be moving so much and therefore near waking since his alarm had just gone off he knew it was only a little after seven and if she was waking up on her own this early after such a busy day and after everything she d been through he wondered how early she d trained herself to wake up on a normal day uhhnn moony what time is it remus turned sharply at the sudden distraction james provided with his head beneath his pillows he glanced back at the clock raking his bangs back so he could read the digital letters 7 10 we have to meet tonks in an hour ehh great was the grumbled reply before james finally popped his head out into broad daylight to converse like normal people another fun filled training session with sirius goggling at his baby cousin all growed up remus laughed but it was half hearted as his attention and his eyes were being quickly drawn back to harry bed harry harry wake up whump one of remus pillows hit the sleeping boy squarely on the face and he sat up with a start james saw the shaggy head pop up over the foot of his bed and clambered over to the edge to peer at harry sitting disjointedly in the spill of maroon and gold and tassels oi wotcher doing on the floor was sleeping he grumbled but ran a hand over his face to dispel his earlier grogginess mmm the curtains around harry bed billowed outwards as a hand stretched sleepily against it thus gaining the trio attention good morning a slender hand it was that parted the curtains and hooked the folds behind the ring attached to the bedpost for that specific purpose buried from the waist down a very disheveled but smiling hermione looked out into the dorm hermione james choked out of the corner of his eyes now locked on the young girl remus watched his friend hastily stuff the worn snitch toy back under his pillow hermione didntseem to have noticed the unmanly object for she was arguing with harry how did you end up on the mattress i told you to take the bed really hermione harry scoffed did you think i was going to let you sleep on the floor it a mattress she corrected loudly no longer asleep in any sense of the word and that where i started ah ha harry held up a finger to signify a revelation of sorts and he waved it teasingly at her winking behind his crooked glasses but you made the mistake of falling asleep before me and ron we levitated you into the bed hermione spent a good minute scowling at him before she kicked back the blankets a bit too forcefully and climbed on top of the sheets it ron and i she muttered snippily under her breath then proceeded to slip over the edge of the bed on harry side and none too accidentally land on his legs ow he yelled and if the rest of the dorm hadntawoken earlier they had now you deserve it you slytherin twat she reprimanded kicking him lightly onto his side she had an evil smirk on her face you re as bad as a marauder three hey chorused throughout the room from each marauder respectively ron however was with lips twisting back a laugh as he rolled over and hung above the squeaking side of his bed morning hermione jane he drawled propping his elbow up on the bed and supporting his jaw on a fist she jumped off the lumpy mattress her bare feet hitting the wooden floor with a slap and stretched her arms high above her head her hair was an unkempt mess that bordered on something from remus original time of the seventies and several curls were caught beneath the collar of the oversized dress shirt that was quite obviously not her own there was a long v of her throat and chest revealed before the tip showed the pale cr me colored fabric of her tank top the middle three buttons were all that held it together so that the sleep softened fabric of the shirt hung loosely off her shoulders and brought the cuffs of the sleeves down past her fingertips the rolled up waist of her shorts was a lighter blue than the rest of the cloth and the whole piece was probably only visible when her stretching arms lifted the shirt tails out of their obscuring position and hey were those his boxers yawning hermione wanded her hair into an even messier pile atop her head and stuck her wand through the rubber band all the while with remus mouth hanging practically unhinged harry was the first to notice oh sorry for snitching your skivvies remus but you re the closet fit to hermione and she needed something to sleep in he wouldntlet me go back to my room hermione defended obstinately she crossed her arms across her chest and they continued bickering as if remus wasntstaring at his own boxers on someone else body open mouthed in embarrassed disbelief it was two in the bloody morning harry shot back with a roll of his eyes i couldnttrust you to sleep if my life depended on it probably have gone right back to your books you would ve i not the one who needs a babysitter her look was pointed we offered our own shorts ron reminded her oh yes she gushed clearly about to engage in a debate yours would probably reach all the way down to my ankles and merlin only knows how long it been since harry were laundered honestly remus is the only one out of you lot that can be depended on remus pushed aside his curtains and swung his legs over his bed footboard you remember me his bewilderment was buried beneath the wary tone the annoyed face that had been bantering with harry and ron softened into smooth elegant lines as she turned to him and she smiled in the eye crinkling cheek dimpling way only she could no matter if the sun was barely up or she d just left a grueling double period of potions of course she laughed lightly i not as slow as harry you know hey i think that was all just an excuse to spend the night in the boys dormitory hermione turned to the far bed where sirius was lounged against the corner post and winking roguishly at her having to lift curly bangs back from her eyes with the back of her palm to see him properly you re right sirius i so terribly madly in love with you i just couldntstand to be apart for one night glad you ve finally come around shall we have an extravagant wedding or just damn it all and elope she tsk ed discouragingly at the boy and turned to help harry clean up his temporary bed while he retransfigured the bed back into one of vernon dursley smelly tube socks that were usually used to line hedwig cage she levitated the pillow back up onto his bed and charmed the throw to fold itself back up neatly and disappear back into one of the wardrobe drawers i never going to get that shirt back am i ron commented dryly heaving himself out of bed and moving to get dressed i think she just stock piles them harry replied he d finally corrected his precariously situated glasses they re comfortable hermione interrupted when ron laughingly focused his gaze on her she pouted and wrapped her arms around herself just in case he happened to be thinking off ripping his shirt right off her besides i only have one or two i ll give them back as soon as i have time to get them pressed look at me hermione ron instructed with a flamboyant gesture that involved jabbing his fingers at his chest do i look like i care if they re pressed or not you look a great many things none of which are kind enough for me to say out loud ron stuck out his tongue and made a rude gesture i gonna go get dressed and you lot had better do the same because i ll have your heads if we re late she swore fisting her hands onto her hips well arentyou demanding in the morning ron teased pulling the r embroidered jumper out of his trunk i here why not command you she said back logically go james growled though the outburst came out odd sounding through the cottony fabric of the t shirt he was attempting to pull over his head hermione giggled to watch him finally worm his way out unless you re planning on dressing right here you can get going we dontlook half as good changing as you do he mirrored her outlandish position with dramatic flair sticking his hips far to the side and slapping his hands onto his waist hermione in turn copied him even going so far as to ruffle her hair in that i think this makes me look rougishly handsome but really is just annoying way that made upstanding young ladies like lily evans cringe sirius gave a loud bark of laughter at the display and they all listened to the numerous banter as they got ready for training and how would you know the way i look when dressing mr potter she countered have you been sneaking into the girls loo he raised one hand with a ho hum smile guilty at least hermione was laughing when she chucked a pillow at him you re lucky i know you wouldn t she warned you re not like sirius hey the object of insultation objected he threw the set of trousers he d been about to change into on the bed and shook a fist at hermione who d sought refuge behind harry bed i resent that he had to shout to be heard over his dorm mates loud guffaws you mean represent remus corrected sitting back down on his bed sirius glared you d better hope you re not my partner today lupin a giggle you too granger hermione bit her lip to keep from laughing and attempted to look chagrined all she managed was to turn her face hot red from lack of oxygen oh just hurry up and get lily harry finally declared by throwing his hands up in exasperation blowing an apologetic kiss in sirius direction who grinned and made a quidditch show of catching it the brunette scooped her diary off the nightstand and headed out the door it was ron who jogged to the open doorway after her to yell down the stairs i think remus might actually like his clothes back damnit potter both identical boys looked up from the chocolate frog cards they d been passing back and forth looked at hermione then at each other then back which one of us is she talking to harry asked the one i about to decapitate she growled slipping out of the portrait hole after the group another shared look no seriously james grinned who are you talking to to say that she leapt at them was an understatement it took both sirius and ron to restrain her from attacking them but as it was with all her squirming she dragged them quite a ways down the hall you were in the bathroom for half an hour she jabbed a finger painfully into harry chest what the hell were you doing he was cleansing sirius answered moving his arm from restraining her bodily to linking it with her own arm confident that she wasntabout to go banshee on her best friend it true james said solemnly i dontcare if he was meeting with lady sheba we re late she reminded with an unnecessary tapping of her watch which was at an awkward angle due to the hooking of arms with sirius now we donteven have time to eat ron bemoaned he rubbed his stomach pitifully and looked to hermione for sympathy it his fault she said blandly looking pointedly at an amused harry ron narrowed his eyes at his friend and solemnly drew himself up to his full height which in all honesty was very tall if harry hadntbeen so amused at hermione and inwardly overjoyed at her regaining her memories he might have been intimidated or maybe not thou art a stealer of breakfast sir an undisciplined sacrilegious hooligan and no friend of mine a pox on your children he decreed come on hamlet finish your breakfast soliloquy and let go remus sighed giving the significantly taller boy a good shove down the hall and following after guys wait up lily who had heretofore been trapped in the portrait opening while they mingled up front jogged to the other side of james and huffed her bangs out of her eyes as she fell into step i have food ron looked as if he would kiss her right then and there future husband and son be damned with her often seen kind smile lily pulled a miniature basket from her jeans pocket and enlarged it barely in time before ron snatched it greedily up sirius was practically hanging over the redhead shoulder the only one tall enough to accomplish such a feat and he looked positively doglike salivating over the well stuffed picnic basket in ron hands it beautiful since i saw that we were gonna be late i had the house elves send up some food through the floo oh you re wonderful hermione exclaimed flinging her arms around lily neck lily who had been informed of hermione return to normal as the girl ran past the dorm steps in someone boxers and shouted the news to her before rushing to get dressed found that the girl flinging herself at her wasntdoing much to lessen the shock my she exclaimed dumbly to james as hermione bounded over to sirius and ron she certainly has a lot of energy this morning mmm food hermione moaned exaggeratedly i love food i think i shall abandon my plans of the ministry and become a professional eater ron thumped his chest proudly and held up the basket so she and sirius could dig through it while the circus troupe headed down to the grounds already taken both he and sirius laughed loudly sharing a joke only true connoisseurs of food could wholly appreciate while hermione remained bent on her breakfast time mission did you get any sticky buns hermione asked they re my favorite you know lily looked interested no i didntknow the house elves didntsend any though i d be happy to go with you to the kitchens after training oh here they are james looked toward his girlfriend in surprise shock making her jaw drop in an unnatural fashion hermione resurfaced from her scavenger hunt with a sticky bun in each hand and left sirius to continue deciding over what out of the varied selection he would eat there just so much to choose from and you know how famished i get when walking so maybe i ll just take a little of everything sirius keep that bottomless stomach of yours out of our food you re no fun when you re hungry remus you canteat it all if it already in my stomach an evil cackle shut up ron do you hear something certainly it cannot be the famed breakfast betrayer ah no it just the wind i love sticky buns james lily hissed dragging him down the hall from the group by his shirt collar when she released him he gave his neck a grateful rub but it was hardly any competition for his concern while lily serious face was beside him what got you all worked up lily he asked anxiously james there were no honey buns in that basket she whispered fretfully jabbing her finger back in the direction of their approaching friends he looked right back at hermione who was either laughing at something one of the boys had said or at herself for after wolfing the first bun down in an instant she was tearing off dripping pieces of the second and dropping them into her mouth but leaving her fingers coated with sticky honey he was staring open mouthed until lily elbowed him painfully in the chest dontstare she hissed james turned back to her and jerked his head in hermione direction do you think its he widened his eyes suggestively and waved his hands eccentrically and hardly discreetly in front of his face lily shrugged but it was clear by the expression on her face that she believed the unspoken thought to be true you remember what happened with remus and we all saw the papers she trailed off i think we re just lucky that the skeeter woman published a rather favorable report james reminded her starting to walk again as to avoid the group behind them getting within earshot i suppose she might have felt indebted or something she was at azkaban when it happened you know lily sniffed disdainly i dontthink that old cow feels much of anything except fear that hermione might come after her next lily she d never we dontknow that for sure james lily whispered fervently she glanced hastily back behind her and picked up her pace james matched her speed after a few seconds of watching her tense back stalk ahead of him you cantbe serious she sighed loudly and he was surprised to find her fidgeting with the hem of her t shirt lily never fidgeted i feel so terribly awful for even thinking it but james she looked almost forlornly out the windows streaking by james she doesntknow the kind of power she has and the fact that she has no control over it it terrifies me a heavy weight settled on her elbow and drew her upset gaze from the high arched windows james hazel eyes were locked hard on hers like the grip of his hand on her arm you sensed this lily nodded her head stiffly are you sure james no lily he looked positively freaked out and lily wished she had never said anything at all dumbledore called you in when the aurors brought hermione back after the raid you were there she was unconscious without any shields up to stop you from sensing her and you told me she was still near impossible to read you know we still haventdiscovered all the qualities of our powers i was frightened and lily it not just my sense james cantyou see it she pulled a honey bun out of bloody nowhere aside from fidgeting cursing was something lily rarely if ever did james was once again reminded of the affect of this time on those closest to him one look at lily strained face however and he curbed his own fears he knew she was already regretting having voiced hers and piling his own worries on top of hers was something he d learned to think before he acted about since getting together with her i dontthink she d mean to do anything but the truth is hermione has probably the most powerful point of the star and no idea that she has it that dangerous she our friend lily but that just it how much do we really know about her about any of them lily rubbed her hands down her arms in an attempt to bring heat the goosebumped flesh hermione was only with us for a few weeks and even then she was hardly around even sirius and remus know nothing about her and she spent all her time with them you donttrust her it was a statement for lily who d been brought up to believe that treating others with kindness was the only acceptable way to act no matter how high her intelligence she simply couldntfathom hermione radical swings in personality i never said that lily amended i simply said we dontknow anything about her i mean how could a person be so wonderful and kind one minute and then completely ice the next have you met remus her lips pursed he different james i know he changes when his with you and sirius but at least with everyone else he just indifferent he not harsh his secret isntsomething most people could deal with he didntlook at her but instead watched the dusty rafters pass over head with his hands stuffed into his trouser pockets an infallible sense of direction keeping his feet walking a straight line then he answered why canthermione have her secrets too lily looked away and didntanswer a good distance behind them hermione walked with harry by her side as she licked her fingers having completely forgotten that they were running late why are they so far ahead she asked probably appalled by your atrocious eating habits harry jibbed biting into an apple she stuck out her tongue and moved to walk beside remus hey she said warmly hello hermione i wanted to ask you about the potion i left for you she said jumping right in her hands now damp after their bath were rubbed dry on the back of her jeans did it work all right remus thought back to the night of the full moon it had gone just like any other night but when the customary unbelievable pain of his monthly transformation had subsided the wolf had retreated to the back burner as well and his human consciousness had taken over he had seen with human eyes the five of them standing across the room from him seen and recognized he d taken control of the beast hermione was looking at him with the friendly patience one might have if they had just inquired as to the weather much less a werewolf potion and he in all honesty didntknow what to say running a hand through his shaggy hair did little to stall for time i dontknow how to thank you what you did for me was nothing she finished for him i care about you remus and if there anything at all that will help you then i ll do it no questions asked he couldntbelieve what he was hearing hermione you donthave to we re friends she said stoutly linking arms with him and i sorry but i going to continue to do nice things for you that what friends are for and you my dear remus terribly sorry by the way are stuck with me he laughed and let her bright mood set him at ease as they walked across the grounds after sirius and james you shouldntbe too much of a trouble she laughed too but it was a far cry from its usual bell like quality the observation made remus wonder if hermione would ever completely recover i really wanted to be there with you that first time i know the potion didntexist in your time dontworry about it hermione you re er welcome to come next month he let the invitation drop talking about his lycanthropy was never easier and it still overwhelmed him that so many more people knew about it than before but all his inhibitions were set aside when hermione smiled at him and made no sign of acknowledging the reassuring squeeze upon his hand but let it remain unspoken and discreet wouldntmiss it she said maybe i ll even read you a bed time story red riding hood or the three little pigs red riding hood definitely he answered right away honestly who would want a career where all they do is go around blowing down houses all the time now me i d much rather fancy a pretty girl in red hermione grinned impishly should lily watch out only for james that ponce ll be the death of her remus chuckled at his own joke but hermione was a bit slower on her own laughter and it seemed all the more forced than before was it something he had said he was saved however by the climsy appearance of a green haired witch as she tripped out of the dark forest oi hermione it good to see ya on your feet again completed 1 24 05 11 56 pm posted 1 25 05 12 09 am a n only one person guessed it right well sort of dancing in rain you get a cookie and i dontcare if you think the last part is random i liked it a lot and it made me a bit teary next chapter dontwanna say if it all doesntfit etp again not sure hopefully by this weekend hello tonks hermione greeted in return the last time she d seen tonks had been at grimmauld place the precious summer and the shapeshifter had been complaining to her about mad eye moody hermione hugged the slightly older woman and asked how the boss been treating you tonks lime green hair darkened to a nauseating sewage shade in order to match her disgusted expression been running me ragged he has driving the whole department up the wall send him my regards tonks grinned all pearly white teeth and her long hair turned neon again will do but hopefully you ll be seeing him before i do the young auror certainly looked hopeful why do you say that once i done helping you lot dumbledore has me on order work over in germany finding new recruits and whatnot the old bloke schedule it so i ll already be knee deep in bear and bratwursts by the time of the next meeting meeting hermione interjected tonks looked at her oddly for the order ya know it almost a month since the last one hermione lips formed a soft oh and she shifted the weight uncomfortably between her feet right of course she said with a forced smile but tonks was rambling on again must ve known moody was driving me nutters good man dumbledore another short smile yes his is behind hermione back ron and harry exchanged glances right tonks rolled up the sleeves of her robes and with a wiggling of her nose her hair shrunk back into her head til it was only short spikes jutting out from her head the sooner we get started the sooner hermione can catch up and the sooner i can get away from moody who ll be training us when you leave lily asked still worried from her conversation with james the ever cheery tonks beamed brightly and clapped hermione solidly on the back why little hermione here you can handle it can tcha remus saw how her eyes had widened when tonks had touched her as if already knowing what her answer would be though her head was lowered to view the grassy ground he saw her empty honey eyes close tightly shut and her jaw clench as she fought to keep her entire face from shaking her eyes were still closed when she whispered of course turning out of tonk hold she walked away from all of them and didntstop until she was at the very edge of the lake not a single set of eyes didntwatch her go but it was harry and ron who turned away from their friend and standing close together stuffed their hands in their pockets and stared into the dark shadows of the forest but remus couldntlook away her tangled mess of curls was longer than he remembered it and without any binder it reached nearly to her elbows but despite its length her hair could not shield the way her white jumper hung off her bony shoulders or how the baggy material hung bunched across hipbones that jutted painfully above her jeans themselves looking two sizes too big skeletal fingers the color of snow caught in those harsh knotted curls as she raked them shakily back from her face she was shaking all over when she turned back around to face a confused tonks there was a brilliant smile back on her face the energetic and happy hermione was back all because of a simple smile it was such a sight that one almost didntsee hollow body or the absence of light from her eyes at least they hadntseen it before maybe harry and ron had seen through her mask or perhaps they d been played for fools as well or maybe they d turned away to keep from dispelling the illusion they wished so desperately to be true but no matter how brilliant her smile remus saw the traumatized and broken girl beneath her smile was so painfully wide he feared her skin would crack and her lips would split spilling a trickle of blood down her milk white chin there were bags so heavy beneath her eyes that no amount of charm or muggle makeup could conceal though he saw she d made the effort most likely for their sake she looked pained as she walked back to their disfigured circle but her voice was clear and sweet as she talked to tonks well let get started shall we he opened his mouth as she neared to whisper if she was alright but to his disbelief she walked straight past him and came up behind her friends they parted to accommodate her between them without turning to look as if sensing her presence were some unconscious thought she pressed herself between the two boys who remus had watched turn their backs to her and within an instant she had reached out to take ron hand as it sought out hers as well fingers intertwining the muscles in the redhead arm tightened and he squeezed her hand on her other side harry turned a bit to face her and his hand came up to touch her lightly on the smooth place between her shoulder blades she looked to him as well and remus caught her lips moving to say thank you and then she smiled she was thanking them for ignoring her when she was hurting and needing their friendship more than ever remus couldntbelieve it and yet there she was standing between them smiling truly and thanking them for what they d done not knowing what to think of this he wondered how much he really knew about their new friends a few meters away james grabbed lily hand and said you were right just then hermione turned around grinning and harry followed her motion a less than believable smile on his own face hey sirius the black haired marauder was surprised at her sudden greeting to him and he was startled out of his own thoughts harry here was just telling me did you really punch a tree recovering quickly he gave a suave toss of his long hair and flexed his arms only because it attacked me first alright alright tonks interrupted enough namby pamby messing around let get down to business the chatter stopped and they all turned to the witch for instructions i ll be taking hermione today to show her the ropes sirius and harry you ll be sparring again and the same for you lily and remus work on your shielding and infiltration together james i want you working with ron today try and get as many unicorns out of the forest as you can they ve gotten terribly wary of humans lately so you might need to exert a bit more force behind your powers james alright they all nodded and split off for their separate assignments save for hermione who stayed behind with tonks to start her training so the auror said rather conversationally dumbledore told me you ve been working with something like bombarda hermione nodded and watched tonks pull a duffel bag out of her robes pocket and enlarge it hunkering down beside it she started riffling through it well in the interest of is good china we re gonna be using clay disks instead muggles supposedly use em at things called firing ranges hermione had a goodly mental picture of what she was going to be working with just from tonks blatantly wizardy description of the muggle devices even before the green haired woman was pulling them out onto the grass when she was finished the heavily loaded duffel was banished back to an inner robe pocket how good are ya at it tonks inquired hermione shrugged she didntreally know what qualified as being good or bad alright alright let have a looksee tonks held up one of the disks and instructed her to blow it up as she had done with dumbledore tea saucers when hermione looked at the disk being held only by two fingers at the very very bottom she saw only empty space above tonks hand only a tiny pile of dust on the ground representing what had once been there the clay disk exploded instantly not caring that her hair was riddled with pottery dust tonks grinned wildly and shook her head to knock some of the rubble loose brilliant can you hit em when they re moving she asked eagerly again hermione shrugged i ve never tried first time for everything being blown up she joked right here we go hermione followed tonk arm as it lowered in preparation of the throw her curls spilling over her shoulders as her head moved along with the woman hand but as soon as the disk was released flipping wildly up into the air only hermione eyes moved with it it was hard to see something as gone if it kept moving out of sight at it peak where it froze for the briefest of seconds at a complete stop hermione tried to shatter it but it was gone before she could complete the act and she blast the top branch off a tree instead as it shot back downward turning end over end hermione tried something else instead of seeing it broken she imagine the disk was slowing down like a mosquito trying to escape from the oozing sap of the tree it had fatefully chosen to rest upon and then it stopped completely tonks stared at the immobilized disk stuck in the air just above her waist with something that was very likely awe brilliant the metamorphmagus breathed can you still blow it up hermione eyes narrowed a touch and a long spidery line cracked the plate through the middle before the entire disk crumbled toeing the mess growing on the ground tonks tapped her chin thoughtfully and looked blankly at hermione while she puzzled out the last bit of her thoughts do ya think you could do it ag in lips drawn in a stern line hermione nodded stoutly good on ya tonks praised as she tried to kick one of the clay circles up into her hand unfortunately she ended up breaking five or six in her attempt to stay balanced bullocks i dead clumsy she muttered finally she had a few more disks in her hand ready now try n blow it up faster this time hermione nodded her understanding and waited for the throw after a half hour time she d gotten good enough to shatter the disk without having to completely stop it and each minute that passed she could slow it down less and less and still be able to find her mark and then she could blast it without any slowing of it at all now tonks was working to hone her sharp eye by throwing the disks out in all directions rapid fire eyes the only part of her that didntseem turned to stone she followed each disk and destroyed it quickly before darting to the next and the next she felt as if she were standing on the edge of two entirely different realities on one side the air positively hummed with magic and like a spectator she watched clay disks twirling lethargically through the air turn to earthen dust on the other she heard the soft whinnying of unicorns the soft groans of mental exhaustion and the whistle of steel as it contacted with swings of pure strength like wind oi hermione do you know the spell they put on snitches hermione stepped back across the line and blinked her eyes to focus on tonks excited face yes she answered wizards invented it specifically for quidditch after using real snidgets became illegal feel up to a challenge her face suddenly became concerned oh no haventrun you down have i hermione shook her head quickly oh no i fine phew tonks grinned i really wanted to see how you d do against a disk with the snitch spell on it it was certainly a good idea and she was no where near in danger of exhaustion in fact she felt as if she d never have to sleep again she felt absolutely buzzing with energy and her skin burned in an almost painfully delightful way overtaking the poor replacement of her white jumper that she d donned in the frigid cold of the morning when every one else had gone for t shirts and tank tops let do it she agreed and found tonks had already bespelled half the disks while tonks finished her spellwork hermione adrenaline levels subsided to their normal standard and the burning heat in her hands and forearms faded as well for a good minute hermione was able to feel nothing at all as she waited patiently for the exercise to begin but then the anticipation began to grow as the pile of disks remaining to be bewitched dwindled the scalding flames rose inside her until she felt as if the very edges of her vision were afire her fingers were senseless appendages that she could only tell were still attached by a glance all feeling fled her legs but still she remained standing with the dizzying sensation of being nothing more than a head and torso floating above the ground as if it were a sentient being the heat or more specifically magic sang in excitement of the coming events it was like the signals being sent to fire her adrenaline hormones was acting as a stimulus to whatever it was that directed the flow and release of her power and as her energy levels spiked the fire enveloped her the first disk zipped up into the air and as the others quickly followed its example she crossed the brink the other world was gone as well as the line that had divided the two of them all that was left was the world of flying disks with its off red scheme of color trapped in the crimson world the color of passion and fire hermione felt a pushing and a pulling in her abdomen as if something was trying to release itself she looked down at her pale pink hands splayed across the ruby fabric of her jumper though still in some incomprehensible fashion following the clay saucers and watched the cloth and the skin beneath stretch impossibly outward in a beastly shaped face fear above all else gripped her in its clawed hands and in a panic she pressed her hands across the straining animal that was pulling away from her and struggled with all her might to press her flesh flat once more the world around her darkened to the mahogany hue of dried blood and the heat and magic cried out oi hermione tonks ducked a kamikaze disk and walked back towards hermione who hadntmoved an inch since the snitched plates had been released the brunette was standing oddly stiff arms locked down by her sides and as tonks neared hesitantly afraid that she might be breaking the girl concentration and get herself blasted instead she was able to see hermione eyes clearly they were widened so far her lashes disappeared into her brows and the whites of her eyes had all but drowned the honey irises tonks broke into an all out run hermione there chorused a half dozen cries of surprise as the shout wrecked the focus of the other trainees and then a loud high whinny from the startled unicorns the fanged jaws snapped at her shoving hands the beast refusing to go back inside it strained and twisted and pulled so hard from her stomach that her back bowed all she could see were a hundred masked faces their black gloved hands reaching for her and she was terrified the flames inside her had reached an all time high and though she knew it was burning her away from the inside out she couldntstop the gasps of pleasure as it rolled through her with its fatal desire she was losing control again and she knew it some distant corner of her mind that had yet to be rendered babbling and useless by the addictive heat kept screaming the names of her friends over and over again they were there she couldntlet her powers hurt them but at the same time the pulling at her abdomen was too much to bear and her magic was screaming at her to let it out both demanding to be sated she had the vague sensation of being forced to her knees and looking out across the swarm of slowly flitting disks she watched two amber eyes distinguish themselves from the burgundy backdrop like a shot had been fired or some unknown signal gone off the thing that face imprinted her jumper roared and burst right from her body in a gasp rendering surge of magic she caught its distinctly emerald eyes as its ghostly apparition form bounded away towards the first set of eyes long tail swishing behind it remus remus gasped as a force plowed into and through him with a feline scream echoing in his ears it hit the part of him that was the wolf with enough power to make the monster inside him awake and roar in return and for a moment remus thought hermione had forced his change to come early it was the intoxicating flames consuming him in the great metaphysical cat wake that made him not want to care then a slender hand gripped his shoulder and all the fire and bestiality inside of him was sucked out to the sound of lily gasp the magical world flared bright red again nearly bordering on fuchsia in its sudden exuberance the color of fresh strawberries she was back on her feet the disk nearest to her was encompassed by a ring of fire that quickly duplicated itself around surrounding clay disks and as the magic leaked out of her the first ring marked disk disintegrated followed by the next and the next no matter how the snitched disks moved the rings stayed with them and were destroyed in domino like precision with an almost hyperactive gaze she followed the moving plates in their destructive process until they were all gone the final clay saucer made a last ditch attempt to avoid demise by soaring over her head fiery circle streaking the air in its wake hermione turned with infinitesimal agility in this world of slow motion and locked her darting eyes on the fleeing plate it exploded in a shower of tan powder the red pink world begin sliding away giving way to the technicolor world of her reality as the energy began to subside the line reappeared invisible but noticeable all the same and she crossed gladly over it into the realm where everything was the color it should be and moving the correct speed and just before the last piece of her left the magic dimension there was a low growl and something plowed straight into her back making her arch and stumble the final step the beast was back inside as she blinked her eyes to clear the haze from them she looked around at the training grounds she was the only one left standing remus was half on his knees staring up at her with a look that was in the same family as awe and amaze the others were lying in different states across the grass tonks was recovering the fastest pushing up off the ground with such a strain in her arms one would think her robes were made of lead sirius was the next to start rising though he seemed loathed to do so and equally unaware of the doofy smile on his face james and harry lying in ironically identical positions just off from him followed next leaving ron and lily still down ron took such a painfully long time in regaining himself and pushing onto his knees that the others asked if he d hurt himself in the fall lily lay just behind the now crouched remus hair angelically halo ed around her head looking absolutely comatose james ran to her and pulled her into his arms quickly brushing the silken ginger strands from her cheeks to look down into her face thanking the gods as her eyelids fluttered and then opened james kissed her quick and assisted her in sitting she smiled and weakly lifted a hand to his cheek that felt wonderful hermione skin itched she twitched her shoulders but it did nothing to alleviate the pestering need to scratch it was an odd sensation like that of tiny ants running up and down her flesh and not entirely pleasant she was slowly regaining the feeling in her legs and her arms had fully reconnected to their respective nerve endings but continued to burn are they all right her voice came out slow and flowing it was thick and rich like liquid honey her tongue felt odd and unwieldy and sounding as if she had trouble forming the words she wished to speak what the hell was that hermione ron asked he sounded as if he d just run a marathon hermione brow creased and though slow in answer she responded truthfully i am not certain that was her magic backlash tonks answered now on her feet and wiping her forehead with the back of her hand a right powerful one too we all have backlashes just never enough actual magic to create a properly noticeable one good show turning to face the now bright red haired witch hermione was confused when the auror took a step back blimey hermione what the crike happened to your eyes hermione made move to look at herself in the lake but as she turned her friends who by tonks comment where now looking specifically at her eyes made varying signs of surprise slowly placing her barely felt feet one before the other she crossed the grass clay rubble crunching under foot and peered down into the glassy waters the honey brown color of her eyes had darkened a shade and bled outwards to stain the whole of her eye within the swirl of depthless color a hundred white stars glittered and twinkled in her aquamarine reflection this has happened before she murmured and reached up her fingertips falling just short of touching her lashes she d never been near a mirror at the time of high magical output but just like she remembered the hot flashes of fire she remembered the glittering night sky appearing in her eyes she straightened and turned back the group it will pass well how did this backlash reach all of us sirius asked assisting james in getting the jelly legged lily to her feet tonks scratched her head beats me how it started you touched me hermione star ridden eyes locked on remus he shifted and looked almost defensive you looked like you were having a fit er something he hastened to explain to his actions the wolf called out my backlash hermione clarified now tonks looked truly interested she didnthave any more idea than they did over how their powers worked but being a metamorphmagus had made her the only reasonable choice for the job of figuring it all out despite how dead clumsy she was so instead of reabsorbing all your backlash went into remus she reasoned out and then when lily touched him she got the whole lot of it plus some of moony s james continued it was wonderful lily repeated needlessly and sirius rolled his eyes and lily was obviously overwhelmed by it and i guess inadvertently funneled it off to the rest of us harry finished then it came back to me hermione added tonks lower lip jutted out thoughtfully and she nodded her head at the theory eventual conclusion sounds bout right yes hermione affirmed in her syrupy voice hermione remus spoke up is that what you always feel when you use your power i mean the lethargic mode she seemed to be stuck in was quite aggravating to hermione as it took her a good four or five seconds just to blink her eyes yes she answered and his eyes widened in surprise sirius laughed barkingly and moved to clap hermione on the back you can share that little experience any time she smiled a bit but stepped away from his hand perhaps it is better if no one touches me for a moment his handsome face fell a moment but then quickly brightened as he scampered off to tease lily lovely evans you seemed to enjoy that her eyes narrowed wasntit positively or dontsay it black she hissed be decent for once grinning roguishly he held a hand to the side of his mouth as if to ward his little secret off from the world than contradictorily proceeded to finish in a loud stage whisper positively orgasmic sirius james yelled as lily turned red in the face though he was having trouble as it was holding back his own laughter while harry tried to hold sirius for lily to properly attack and remus stood back scolding the lot of them hermione was listening to the whispered words of tonks leaning close to her ear but making a conscious effort not to touch her i think so the tussling teenagers caught hermione saying her voice almost back to its normal tones and they turned to look as tonks gave an excited leap and consequently almost came tumbling straight down on hermione the brunette quickly pulled her hands beneath the cuffs of her jumper and used her woolen encased hands to catch the graceless auror sheepishly scratching the back of her head tonks face blushed to match her hair and the high energy young woman bounced off to the side as clay fragments began to shake against the ground this is bloody brilliant tonks exclaimed clapping her hands together pieces suddenly started whizzing through the air finding their companions and matching debris over a hundred clay plates began rebuilding themselves from the bottom up segment by segment and some even speck by speck so destroyed had they been once every mote of clay had found its home again the cracks thinned and then disappeared entirely leaving each disk whole again before they all flew into a neat and orderly pile at tonks feet well you know hermione ron said with a bit of a laugh trying to break the silence with a joke she hates waste a few days later hermione watched the digital letters of her clock change to midnight it had been hours since she d retired for the evening but since then she d been able to do nothing but stare at her clock and watch the minutes slowly tick past time is certainly a queer thing isntit it was supposed to be this steadfast constant that the entire universe revolved around and yet it allowed humans to change it it could be sped up or slowed down altered and disrupted if time was a steady line from a to z than how was it they were able to go from point l back to n or bring four teenage witches and wizards from f to point q hermione had been questioning the abstract theory of time since she rolled into bed earlier that night and caught sight of her unobtrusive clock with its red block numbers and it hadntbeen until just that moment the poetic change into midnight that she d settled on an explanation she liked best she d decided that it was all relative from the human perspective it would seem as if time was as inconsistent as the wind jumping forward then doubling back and repeating itself however if one were to step away from it all and see through the eyes of the powers that be they would realize that time was indeed one long straight thread it wasntletting humans to change it it was letting them think they had control over it when in cosmic truth every event throughout time had its place and occurrence even if that event repeated itself hermione sighed if that were true than she d been meant to bring the marauders forward in time and that was a comforting thought slightly less comforting however was the freezing temperature of her room and though she was curled up beneath as many blankets as she could find she was still frigidly cold insisting that the bright glow of her clock and the subzero atmosphere of her personal quarters were the cause of her latent insomnia hermione rolled herself out of bed and headed for the common room comforter still trailing behind her she shuffled out from beneath the girls staircase and stopped just short someone was already curled up on the couch firelight catching on their unruly black hair harry she called out softly venturing a guess the boy looked over surprised by her sudden appearance and shook his head james he corrected sorry she apologized in chagrin nah s ok he waved her over and scooted to the far side of the couch to show her he was serious come have a seat i certainly dontneed to hog the whole common room hermione hesitated a moment but the fire did truly look wondrously warm obligingly she waddled over to the plush couch and when james caught sight of her he started to laugh surreptitiously ignoring his chuckles hermione burrowed farther into the puffy down comforter she d draped over her head and shoulders and wrapped it tighter around her oh shut up she complained sitting down it cold aww he cooed babyishly come on out little flobberworm it a bright new world he reached over and brushed the blanket back off her head and a very frizzy haired hermione scowled back at him from a pool of blankets around her waist very funny she retorted sardonically reaching her hands forward palms out she tried to soak up some of the fire warmth so what are you doing up anyways he shrugged couldntsleep you she smiled the same been thinking too much she trailed off but james didnthesitate to pick the conversation up again no one would accuse me of that he joked and she breathed a bit of a laugh her eyes moving from the fire to his face you dontgive yourself enough credit you and sirius she amended you could both do just as well as remus if only you applied yourself thanks mum so what were you thinking about anyway he drew a knee up his chest and wiggled down into his corner of the couch as if settling in for some lengthy story telling it was her turn to shrug silly things come on he goaded and she looked at him through the corner of her eye in mild surprise you can tell your big brother jamesie jamesie she made a face they both laughed during which james solemnly swore that he had been quoting sirius she forgave him for the atrocious nickname he d given himself and before she could stop herself had agreed to tell him about what she d been thinking earlier that had been a solid minute ago and she d made no move to explain it any further with one of the golden pokers elongated to reach from the couch to the hearth she absentmindedly stirred the ash and logs concentrating on making a certain series of pops and crackles rather than on the boy sitting next to her now i all curious hermione he finally said what keeps a lovely woman such as yourself from getting her beauty sleep boys he added the last bit with an overly exaggerated waggling of his eyebrows tch she made an offended sound what kept you up she shot back i ll have you know i get mad awful indigestion he smiled winningly hermione paused on this tidbit then promptly frowned hey we didnteven eat dinner tonight too late he interrupted cheekily i answered now it your turn shaking her head hermione shifted under her swaddle of comforter and stabbed at a charred log what keeps me awake at night she repeated slowly this time james wisely kept quiet i think about azkaban james was silent and hermione didntdare look at him for fear that she d find his eyes on her to be full of pity she couldntbear that look directed at her you know there isntmuch else to do there except sleep she murmured i suppose i still rather wired from it all the flames waved cheerily in their stone bed and she despondently dragged the glittering poker through the ash it an awful place everyone there is mad half starved rotting corpses that by all logical means shouldnteven still be alive the jailers they make sure you re always holding on to that last bit of life they keep you as fodder for the dementors her eyes were showing a bit too much white as she talked and her grip on the poker was knuckle popping but she was determined to finish speaking they re the reason i cantsleep at night the dementors james asked quietly it always hurt less if the sucked you dry in your sleep at least that way you couldnthear the others screams when you woke up you d wake into a dark despair but you wouldnthave to relive those terrible memories here her voice cracked i would watch the people i loved dying over and over and over and then then i hated them for making me their witness hated them for suffering for dying for the dementors making me suffer that much more and then i hated myself it was cruel and disgusting but i i just wanted it to stop she didntknow when the tears had started rolling down her face because all she felt lately was a hollow emptiness where hermione granger had once been she smiled twistedly through her tears and it was malicious and disparaging in azkaban i slept to avoid them and now now i fight to stay awake because they haunt my dreams the tears slowed to a stop and began drying in the heat of the fireplace upon her stone like face she prodded the hearth and stirred the fire to a brighter life besides the death eater i put in a coma is sleeping enough for the both of us dontyou think james winced and uncurled himself from the corner moving closer to her on the couch hermione i not stupid james i know you all tried to hide the papers from me but i read them cover to bloody cover as the saying goes he was never any good at this comforting thing and it was rather awkwardly that he patted hermione shoulder listen twenty seven seriously injured that pretty good for a starving convict without a wand she was refusing to look at him i ripped off all four of a man limbs did you know that now james grabbed her sternly and gave her a forceful shake i dontknow what you re trying to do hermione but you have to stop it tearing yourself up about this isntgoing to undo it i ve meddled with time too many times to count she muttered bitterly what one more time i ll just pop back into my cozy little cell and this time i think i ll take a nap instead of saving innocent lives no matter what you say to me hermione you know you did the right thing that night you know it more fiddling with the fire no one else does i do your friends do now hermione finally set down the poker she picked listlessly at the smooth material of her comforter now soaked with the heat of the fire and continued to look downwards are we really friends she said emotionlessly now she did raise her eyes and meet his i d like to think so he answered honestly i know nothing about you she countered on the contrary you know a great deal about me you re miss future girl his attempt at lightening the conversation fell short i know your name your family history none of it because you told me and none of it what really important to know she shook her head at him and dropped her head again i donteven know your favorite color you know he said slowly as if unsure whether or not he should say what he was about to lily said the same thing to me a few days ago hermione following chuckle was lifeless she a smart witch i not surprised she noticed it james scrutinized her digging his elbows into his knees as he sat cross legged and setting his chin on his fists are you really serious about this she made a strange noise and in tossing back her head her chocolate curls caught the firelight and turned auburn as the spilled down over the straps of her nightgown i must sound crazy she laughed and it was depressing sounding you know i haventeven told ron or harry that i haventbeen sleeping i mean i guess they figured it out but i haventtold them why she shrugged maybe i just shared it with you because you look so much like harry and i needed that friendly face but a different reaction than the one i knew would come from him that hardly what i d call a friendship passing you off as my best friend hermione sighed and fiddled with the golden poker handle as if considering resuming her fire tending maybe you used your power on me maybe it was just the right time and place and you just happened to be sitting there instead of an empty couch or maybe james countered it because you knew that one of us needed to take this first step when she didntsay anything he looked up at her obscured profile and not until he leaned to the side did he see her crumpled face and the saline trails he touched her shoulder knocking back some curls and kneeled over her in concern hermione what the matter i a bad person she sobbed throwing herself at him but i dontwanna be i dontwanna be baaaad her hyperventilating breaths were punctuated by alternating sobs and hiccups as she tried to get out the words through her hysterics what are you talking about he exclaimed unsure of whether to pat her on the back or hug her or what you re not a bad person i am she insisted crying into his shoulder i do terrible and and wicked things a and that why that why she sobbed the loudest ever and james threw embarrassment to the wind and hugged her tightly that why god sent me to t that awful place i a a s sinner she whispered thickly i dont deserve t to be saved james felt his own eyes inexplicably watering this amazing young woman who had done nothing short of miracles to protect those around her thought god had abandoned her because of something that was beyond her control if god had forsaken her then what hope was there for the rest of them i didntask for this she insisted through her tears just hermione that all all i wanted i d dontwant to be alone james her sobs came full circle again and she nearly screamed i dontwant to be bad anymore he rocked her in his arms over and over again as if there was nothing else in the world to do but that he rubbed her back and whispered comforting sounds into her ear as she cried out in blind desperation for the god she believed to have forsaken her it hurt his heart and stung his eyes and all he could make were sounds through the lump in his throat i never meant t to make him angry she choked n never m meant to be something evil no james hissed fiercely squeezing her painfully tight no hermione i dontever want to hear those words out of your mouth she cried wordlessly into his shoulder you are not evil do you understand me voldemort is evil hermione and you are not him her heart wrenching sounds had died out but tremors still shook her body and her silently crying face pressed wetly against his t shirt do you understand me he demanded emotion making his jaw lock for a long moment hermione did nothing but cling to him and tremble but then very slowly she nodded against him good his throat stuck he held her until she pulled away and then handed her the corner of her comforter to wipe her eyes on with subdued sniffling she cleaned herself up and wrapped the blanket around her feeling suddenly colder neither of them said anything until hermione had leaned herself against james and murmured a soft thank you he smiled and reached over to tuck the puffy covers tightly around her chin making her look all the more ridiculous in her blanket cocoon everything gonna be alright you ll see that a marauder promise hermione smiled wanly at this and looked softly up at him does this mean we re really friends now his face broke out in a wide grin that made hermione sad heart lift and a smile to grow on her own face if not then i just let some random stranger leak all over my favorite t shirt she giggled and patted his damp shirt apologetically sorry james he gave her a winning smile and waved it off as nothing do you think i could become friends with lily she asked i think she d like that a lot james answered sincerely and tweaked her nose you guys are pretty similar you know hermione thought of harry mum and smile widely that more of a compliment than you know she murmured james shrugged indifferently deciding not to press her on it and threw his arms over the back of the couch enjoying the view of the fireplace that had drawn him from his dorm bed in the first place hermione was enjoying the playing flames as well the blasting furnace was comforting in more ways than one and she was glad it was there in addition to james she was imagining the fire dancing to the sound of its own pops and sizzles when james voice broke through her thoughts and their camaraderic silence green wiggling her head out a bit from her comfy blanket she looked at him curiously green what that my favorite color completed 1 29 05

the septuplet day of fun and it not where you d expect etp again i loathe to estimate this week is full of tests so my best guess is saturday the 5th pray for earlier hermione wake up she groaned at the sudden infiltration of a dream that had until that point been quite lovely and snuggled deeper into the warmth of her comforter in hopes that by simply ignoring it the voice would go away dreaming about me i understand why yes of course hermione mumbled patting blearily above her head for her pillow to bury her face under always dream bout you it was then that she realized there was no pillow this was not her bed and she must have fallen asleep last night after her conversation with james i hope you ve cast me as the dashing hero i have much too much talent to be a mere cameo the voice was saying quiet seriously no she grumbled pulling her blankets around her head right now you re the terribly wicked antagonist keeping the mansion maid from her beauty sleep maid what maid the voice mocked offended i only see the gorgeous princess wake up sleeping beauty wake up hermione cracked one eye open already starting to smile and then the other to take in remus lupin grinning face crouched before her still clinging to the faint hope that there was still a chance for her to sleep longer she remained huddled in her blankets on the couch as she regarded him you do a lovely sirius she complimented and her voice was a bit hoarse from sleep remus bowed gallantly as well one was able when balanced on the balls of their feet and folded his arms over the edge of the couch why thank you i can do lily too if you d be so kind as to find me a mop and a banana hermione laughed maybe another time she sat up finally giving up on the possibility of actually sleeping in on a saturday seeing as how that was an outlandish and foreign practice here at hogwarts and yawned loudly and unselfconsciously as she stretched her arms over her head what are you doing up she asked patting away her yawn ha ha i myself have mastered the wonders of a muggle alarm clock he boasted though looking ridiculous with his soft brunette hair falling all over and in his eyes how ingenious of you she laughed and then promptly covered her mouth with her hand i so proud came out in a muffle through her fingertips remus quirked an eyebrow in curiosity at her odd behavior and gave her a poke in the stomach in hopes of stimulating a response or explanation i have morning breath game the garbled reply half crawling over the arm of the couch and with quite dexterity as she refused to take one hand off her mouth hermione finally grabbed her wand off the side table and while still at an obscure angle of remus sight scourgyfied her mouth when she slid back down into her seat she was smiling all teeth and puckering dimples he gave her a silly double thumbs up making her laugh i understand your wanting to boast of your newfound sleep controlling powers but why was waking me up part of the plan remus pouted and it caused more of his hair to fall over into his eyes i figured you d wanna help me wake the others mischievous thoughts entered her head and her grin was mirrored on remus face let go have some fun with em she decreed wrapping her blanket around her to hold in the rapidly escaping warmth and standing up looking utterly ridiculous in her gold fluffy comforter cape hermione shuffled towards the boys dormitory steps and remus fell into step beside her trying his hardest not to laugh if hermione heard the bit back snickers she either didntcare or was pointedly ignoring him hey remus she said as they started up the winding stairs her hands clutching her blanket shut and his stuffed in his trouser pockets yeah did you know james favorite color is green remus looked sidelong at her with a puzzled expression but her eyes were stubbornly fixed on the stairs above them shaking his head a bit he shrugged and looked upwards as well yeah i did when he sneaked another look at her then he found her to be smiling softly her cheeks flushed with rosy color and the corners of her eyes crinkling me too she said quietly and disappeared into the dorm he hadntrealized they d reached now with a slight curiosity he pushed open the half shut door and followed hermione in he was just in time to see her fling herself onto ron bed to be followed by groggy death threats from the redhead sprawled out beneath the covers come back for more eh pigeon hermione rolled laughing off of the griping ron and onto her side to face the bed beside hers she pushed the curtains back and looked at sirius who was already up and about and getting dressed he sat with his back to her as he tugged on his boots but at the sound of the curtain rings clinking he looked back over his shoulder at her with a melting smirk i tried she insisted in a wistful voice both my bed and the couch but nothing could compare sirius snapped his fingers at remus and the half asleep james then pointed to hermione are you listening to this hermione tossed her head spilling a few curls over her eyes and giving him a seductive look one only saw in the movies licked her coral lips i cantsleep without you sirius black eloping it is then sirius declared jumping to his feet frankly i d have preferred it that way but it was of course the lady choice hermione fought to keep laughter from wiping clear her come hither look as the shirtless sirius plopped down next to her and before she could sit up had propped his elbow up on the curve of her side as she lay still facing his now abandoned bed this only proves out timeless love sirius batting eyes and flipping of his long hair made remus gag and walk over to james bed where the raven haired boy was turned completely around under the sheets his head hanging over the footboard and his snitch toy hugged humorously between his feet he d fallen back asleep while sirius was attempting to sound poetic hermione was ever down to earth and analytical but honey bunch she cooed what happens if the spell wears off and you get sent back i d be ever so devastated she sniffed pathetically nonsense darling sirius waved the doubt away it one of your spells they dontcome any stronger you re stuck with me pigeon those words struck a cord in hermione mind and she recalled a conversation with remus that contained promises very close to those shifting under sirius bony elbow she glanced back searching to find remus standing on top of james bed he looked as if he d just been in the middle of casting a most likely revenge worthy charm upon his sleeping friend but when she found her eyes drawn to his face she saw him already looking back she grinned at him and he smiled warmly back in a way that actual made the tips of her toes curl and tingle with heat she rolled her eyes in sirius direction and he laughed silently what ho hermione attention ricocheted back to sirius in surprise at his outburst he was looking at remus in such a pompous fashion that the next words hermione expected out of his mouth would be shall we duel instead he said oogling my fianc e remus my own best friend she was the one oogling remus explained i was only oogling in return so as not to be rude sirius looked down at the giggling hermione aghast and she tried to quickly school her features into one of innocence is this true i canthelp it uh squishy bear behind sirius remus made a face at the nickname i mean just look at him he so lean and handsome hermione lowered her voice a bit as if divulging some hidden desire and i ve always sort of had a thing for brunettes sirius clutched his cut as if he d been spitted by a sword he gasped and a pained look came to his face oh he breathed dramatically i see where your affections lie motion behind her caused hermione to look back at remus and she found the young lycan to be winking roguishly at her and making a show of flexing his arms then he incorrigibly mocked his friend by silently sniveling and rubbing his fists babyishly into his eyes hermione could not help the giggle that escaped her what this sirius exclaimed and when he whirled around remus was grinning cheekily at him hermione saw this and pulled her comforter up to cover her laughing mouth here i am trying to work out the problems in our relationship and you re drooling over another man sirius ranted though hermione and remus were laughing too hard for the situation to be remotely serious oi came the disgruntled noise from behind them all of you can shut your gobs pushing a clingy sirius off her and in the process calling him a big oaf hermione sat up and though hugging the large lump that was ron may have been awkward it looked quite amusing aww did we wake ickle ronniekins up and he should be came a voice from the doorway lily appeared in the archway as she pushed the door back against the wall the door was open by all means come in ron said sarcastically head now poked out from beneath his covers we re having a regular old party hermione frowned and swatted at him someone sure is cranky in the mornings remus get down from there lily demanded of a sheepish remus who obligingly hopped off the bed that idiot boyfriend of mine might have deserved whatever you were about to do to him but we have a schedule to keep remember and hexing him will only result in him hexing you back and by the time you re all through proving you re men we ll have lost have the day hermione stared at the pretty redhead standing with her hands on her hips as she lectured remus and though amused by the proceedings her curiosity had been piqued schedule she said with a questioning lilt are we going somewhere just go and ruin the surprise lily james was now awake too giving a suspicious look at his hovering friend who quickly stuffed his wand back up his sleeve he kicked back his covers coincidentally covering up the stuffed snitch and swung his feet over the side of the bed to sit up lily looking a bit flustered crossed her arms now over her chest and huffed she was bound to find out anyway not a single marauder can keep a secret sounds to me like you re the one who cantkeep the secrets remus quipped though his mouth closed with a click as the redhead turned a full blast glare on him ponce sirius muttered under his breath harry hermione called to the one boy not yet awake i up the curtains behind her shifted and she saw the messy haired boy sit up looking as bright and fresh as though he d been awake for quite some time she frowned a bit at the intense look he was giving her we re going to have a day of fun sirius cut in slinging an arm over her shoulder any suggestions hermione gingerly picked his hand off her shoulder and placed it back on the bedspread i d love to really you guys she insisted crawling off the bed and knotting her blanket around her waist but there a head prefect meeting and it likely to take all day oh lily frowned a bit and turned the discouraged look on another remus never mentioned that i forgot he mumbled stuffing his hands back into his pockets to avoid lily evil eye tsk james sounded our scholarly friend is following into disrepute to this remus sent him a solid glaring frown and contemplated hexing him after all hermione however cut through it all with one look at remus muggle clock actually i ought to go be getting ready she mused aloud kicking back the train of her dragging blanket so that she was able to walk without tripping and quite embarrassingly hurting herself she patted sirius head in passing as she moved to the door hey remus she said after a sudden thought stopped her halfway through the doorway do you think you could stop by my room when you re done getting ready i want to run through a bit of the itinerary and sort a right portion of the information i want to present out sure remus agreed nodding his head as he did so thanks she grinned and disappeared out the doorway when remus arrived at hermione head girl rooms a while later the gold be decked room was empty though he could warrant a guess at hermione location judging by the sound of steady water flow coming from her bathroom door setting his bag down on her still mussed bed he discovered a folded piece of parchment with his name scrawled on the front in her distinct cursive he flipped it open to find it contained less than he d anticipated make yourself at home stuffing the note into his pocket he looked around for a chair and found the nearest one to be placed in front of the currently unlighted vanity he d already gripped the back of it and had started pulling it back to hermione bedside when he spied a book cracked open in front of the high mirror he knew he shouldn t but in hermione own script he caught his name just as he began to turn with a quick glance to ensure that hermione wasntabout to come bounding out of the bathroom any time soon he set the chair back down and leaned over the makeup table i know harry and ron wouldntever bring it up but i feel there still a gap between the seven of us after the incident with sirius i couldnthelp but want to be alone with just them and not have to work at including the four of them i suppose i compensated for the fact by just being myself with harry and ron without worrying about how they d think right now i cantseem to make myself care about their opinions of me because they re just not important in comparison to my friends after all we re not really friends are we oh i dontknow ron and harry both think i ought to give remus and sirius the chance but there just so many complications and what with everything going on i hardly know either of them it was clear after tonight that they knew nothing of me either i assume they misinterpreted my relationship with harry judging by the way they were glaring like angry chimeras at me i dontthink they could ever understand how much ron and harry mean to me remus jumped as there came a crash from inside the bathroom and he hastily stumbled back from the vanity dragging the chair it knocked the vanity drawers and made bottles on the tabletop rattle he could hear hermione cursing from behind the door but it sounded as though she d merely gotten her brush caught in a knot there was an insistent desire to read back to find out what the incident with sirius she d mentioned had been about but with his adrenaline now racing and the sound of the shower now gone he forced himself to sit down by the bed and get busy with the papers she d set out the leather bound book taunted him sitting wide open beside the make up containers that seemed hardly used and he couldnthelp but wonder if she d miss it if it were to suddenly disappear he was saved from temptation however when hermione finally emerged from the steamy bathroom running a towel through her damp curls completed 2 6 05 11 59 pm posted 2 7 05 12 05 pm hermione had thoughtfully remembered to bring her clothes into the loo beforehand and thus save the both of them from quite an embarrassing scene and became increasingly proud of her foresight upon exiting the steamy room and finding a surprisingly devoted remus already digging through the parchments for the up and coming meeting it being saturday the school uniform had been requisitioned by the doting house elves and hermione was in charge of dressing herself ginny would probably have had a fit but hermione didntthink she d done too terribly bad this time her jumper was a rather flattering rust color even if its thickness made it a bit bulky and her white corduroys fit so absolutely perfect that she thought she ought to petition for them to become part of the standard uniform her hair however was another matter and she cursed it even while binding it to a pile atop her head i gonna cut it off i swear she muttered sinking down onto the bed excuse me remus asked in surprise my hair she groused trying to insist through her voice that it wasntthat big a deal so i see you found the papers what wrong with your hair he was clearly not to be deterred and he did seem generally interested going so far as to lay the stack of papers back on the bed and prop his chin up on his hand it always in my face cantsee anything properly she huffed her bangs up exasperatedly in demonstration remus laughed at her pout as the damp locks fell back over her eyes i thought you didntlike people being able to see your face he commented contemplatively remus shrugged at least that was the truth when you said it at the three broomsticks bringing her legs up underneath her hermione stuffed her fists into her leg folded lap and quirked her head at him can you really tell if someone lying or not she asked curiously uhp uhp uhp remus reproached waggling a finger at her stop trying to change the subject fine she griped me first then you fine he repeated echoing her tone if you re a good little gryffindor i ll tell you all the best tales of my great and wondrous power fine she grumbled one last time while shifting to readjust herself and pull free the parchment scrap she d inadvertently sat upon leaning back on one hand she tapped her finger to her chin why do i want to cut my hair off yes that was the question remus quipped cheekily well you see i was thinking of donating it to newborn babies they re quite bald you know all they get are those little hats hermione remus warned her to stay on track but a smile was working its way onto his face freezing babies remus she shot back he had to fight not to laugh hermione he tried on insisting you know people would kill to have my hair one long finger jabbed him pointedly in the chest yeah he laughed who hermione eyes narrowed what wrong with my hair it too long apparently the prefect shielded his face from the head girl stony glare oh yes she said instantly brightening i d forgotten so what is your power like she was forcing the topic change and remus knew it he was also fairly certain she knew it as well he was about to tell her off for trying to distract him again but there was something in the way she was looking at him beneath her wide smile and cheery fa ade was a raw need and desperation for him to to just let it go and he did well not to shortchange yours or anything he drawled but it is pretty fantastic she giggled but rolled her eyes good naturedly let hear it then i can tell when you re being truthful and when you re being false so you know when i ve been bad or good she repeated for clarification remus nodded trying to look wise before he went and ruined it by cracking a wry grin i can also see you when you re sleeping he boasted funny she smacked him on the arm you re saying you can sense what i say remus looked a bit apprehensive and the reason was revealed as he went on and what you do and think hermione was silent fiddling with her hands in her lap as the moisture from her hair rand down her neck and soaked into the thick woolen weave of her jumper collar so you can read my mind she ventured slowly no no he professed quickly waving his hands in front of his face as if the knock her misconception out of the air nothing like that i cantsee what you re thinking only find whether that thought is false of not she eyed him a moment and then in a startlingly loud voice answered riiight settling back she wiggled a bit and rolled her head around on her neck what am i thinking right now recovering from her reaction of unexpected comedy remus frowned a bit at her request but as he so often found himself doing in the strange girl presence a smile was tugging at his mouth as hermione let out a great large breath and placed her hands on her knees as if meditating i ready she said in a deep bass and laughed herself at the sound of it what are you thinking yes that the question she mocked peeking one eye open impishly but now now dontcheat dear remus stop asking for clues she had closed her eyes again straightening her back in preparation of whatever it was she thought was coming but her lips pursed and twitched upwards in a wry grin as she waited you re thinking about abandoning this whole head business and taking a walk with me down by the lake hermione eyes opened and the look in those honey orbs was soft as they focused on him and is this thought of mine true or false she asked with a smile remus leaned against the side of her bed folding his arms over the replaced comforter coming just short of touching hermione bare feet i ve done my share he said i think i ll let you take this one hermione let her hands slip into her lap as she regarded his patiently awaiting face those insufferable bangs had fallen back into his face again but hermione found they made his face all the more endearing for it but that thought that made her fingers itch also made her stomach knot and reminded her of the consequences she d forgotten with sirius it seemed she had forgotten them again because it was not for fear of the rest of the world that stopped her but the doubt inside her mind in matters of the heart her strength was dismal at best when the marauders left and they would hermione cleared her throat and the smile she gave him was wane at best we should get to work remus pulled back his arms and moved off the edge of his seat yeah he pulled a sheaf of parchments into his lap and began sorting through them yeah a half hour later when the slightly more subdued pair made their way through hermione adjoining door down the spiral staircase and into the heads common room they met with an all too familiar sight the three years of prefects for hufflepuff fravenclaw and gryffindor were sitting on the floor taking up the scattered armchairs and davenports were the slytherin prefects leaving no room in their lounged states for the others stretched out in the center couch was the ringleader draco malfoy himself who had regrettably been instated that year as head boy stop being a prick malfoy hermione said as she crossed the room and set her load of papers onto the coffee table malfoy didntsay anything he never did he merely lifted his head a bit and gave her a look she d figured he d created just for her a threatening look that made her instinctively watch the shadows as she walked through the corridors however as he was already on probation from dumbledore for accidentally leaving a crate of red caps destined for hagrid in the hallway he straightened up and moved to one side of the lounged couch so she could sit it wouldnthave been so bad for malfoy if the crate lock hadntbeen undone somehow they d broken loose and stormed a first years charms class hermione sat down primly crossing her legs and looked pointedly at the slytherin prefects pansy hissed at her malfoy did however snap his fingers at his two fifth years and they obediently slinked off their respective chairs unlike malfoy hermione held no preference of who should get the chairs and they were quickly filled by colin creevey and parvati patil everyone else conjured themselves floor pillows and got comfortable let begin with the house totals hermione dictated in a loud voice hufflepuff the fifth years were the ones in charge of the most dimple and menial tasks so the two rather shy hufflepuffs looked between them before the boy luke princeton answered eighty nine house points do you have the recordings draco icy voice made the scrawny boy blanche i do the hufflepuff female ashley mccoughlin handed over the rolled parchment to hermione who gave it a quick cursory scan before laying it on the table slytherin a girl with a pixieish face said a hundred n twenty proudly with a coquettish look to draco who gave a minor smirk her partner handed over the recording parchment that showed what had been done to gain or lose points hermione scanned this one a great deal longer looking for discrepancies when she found none she calmly set it down beside the first ravenclaw evan carter the ravenclaw fifth glumly announced the secondary score of a hundred n one and hermione accepted his parchment with a sympathetic smile his partner ivy hart patted him comfortingly on the back gryffindor gwen harken a young spitfire that hermione was quite proud of tossed her dark brown hair over her shoulders and handed hermione the parchment without a word hundred eleventy she murmured looking apologetic at hermione sudden expression of surprise the girl shrugged and sat back down beside ares vanmar malfoy was beside himself a smirk so wide upon his face he looked nearly demented the prefects were whispering mockingly between one another hermione gathered up the recording rolls and placed them in her bag taking enough time to set her off of killing malfoy well slytherin wouldntbe in the lead much longer right she cleared her throat the next order of business is the up and coming halloween ball suggestions a costume ball ashley suggest brightly masquerades are so trite jezabelle meyer the slytherin sixth argued drumming long black nails on the arm of her overstuffed chair but romantic ginny countered i agree with jezabelle hermione said causing the younger redhead to pout the tradition of masquerade balls is outdated and overused and we wontbe using it again but ginny protested think of something else weasley draco snapped irritably thank you draco hermione said dryly are there any other suggestions if it a theme we re going for justin finch fletchley spoke up then we should decide on that first before doing anything else draco nodded brusquely and beat hermione to the punch in levitating a clean piece of parchment and bewitching it to transcribe he may have a soul blacker than soot but he took his position seriously prefects began shouting out ideas venice was the first from the flirty slytherin fifth preston linae great idea prissy pansy complimented before delivering one of her own palace not wanting the slytherins to dominate the list of a ball they d all be forced to attend the other houses joined in a forest was livia callistan input the ravenclaw sixth from her partner antony minas tropical island nice italy spain ooh ancient rome squealed hannah abbot yes but you ll be putting up all those pillars personally hermione muttered under her breath clearly not favoring the idea france maybe paris i heard from my cousin that new york was really cool colin animatedly suggested fishing out a wizarding picture of the big city to show remus sitting next to him haunted house theodore nott growled at the young weasley with disgust do you even know what the word trite means you weasleys are as lacking in brains as you are in money hermione ground her teeth and her nails dug into the trousered calf that was folded up beside her let it go ginny her voice hard with authority stopped the rising girl and her solid stare lowered the seething redhead back onto her floor cushion fingers crushed her hand back as draco berated his subordinate keep your mouth shut nott if you keep me here any longer than necessary i ll break your legs hermione frowned at malfoy thanks for your positive encouragement he shot another of the looks at her using it to bite back his retort instead he said let get on with the vote then she nodded holding up her hand to gather their silence a sharp look from draco quieted the slytherins as well they each played a part hermione read through the list pausing at each idea to count the number of hands in the air when she reached the end the themes had been narrowed down to two new york and the enchanted forest draco and i will discuss it and make the final decision we ll have another meeting monday after classes to announce the theme and decide on the details hermione announced right now to make the best of our time we re going to move on draco explained the prefects nodded their understanding now he went on who the fuck has been skipping patrol meeting adjourned as the prefects filtered out of the heads common room and out into the hallway hermione motioned for remus to stay behind and turned back to draco to finish things up deciding to make himself useful remus began gathering together all the papers and banishing the rumpled cushions off the floor all the while keeping half an ear open to the conversation going on behind him what your pick hermione was asking they both suck hands massaged throbbing temples well which one sucks less no need to be tart granger he admonished they re both terrible suggestions but i vote new york for the sake of forgoing furry woodland creatures i agree hermione concurred it also gives us more options to work with whatever you can deal with the plans draco toed the stack of scrolls by his feet over to her side we still need to present the revisions on the hogsmeade policy and the budget analysis hermione reminded him she gave remus an aside thank you as he shrunk the growing mound of paper work and deposited it into her satchel i can take the hogsmeade bit draco said finding more interest in scrutinizing his nails but dumbledore will want us both there for the budget meeting alright and hermione slung her bag onto her shoulder signifying the end of the meeting if you need something for the presentation leave me a note on the board the board was the standing tack board positioned upright in the corner of the vast common room where the prefects left notices and questions for the heads and was used to avoid any direct contact between hermione and draco their entire business was conducted through notes and owls save when they were required to preside over the prefect meetings it had worked well so far hermione walked to where remus waited head bent as she searched through her pockets for the note ginny had handed her before she d left she scanned it quickly and then stuffed it back into her pocket we need to talk about the marauders ron i see you haventgotten over your infatuation with the mudblood lupin malfoy casual tone carried silkily across the common room there was no room for embarrassment beside the pulsing anger that hit the gryffindor prefect malfoy was the sole focus of his attention and not even hermione restraining hand on his shoulder kept his fists from clenching take that back malfoy remus hissed through clenched teeth hermione whispered for him to let it go but draco voice was louder please you think i afraid of you personally i d be worried about standing so close to that demon of yours hermione hand slipped so suddenly from his shoulder it caused remus to turn to her in concern what did you call me she whispered in disbelief draco stood up hands slipping into his pockets as he adopted more of a pose than a standing position nothing you haventalready heard in the halls i sure when hermione incredulous appearance didntchange draco barked a cruel cold laugh it seems our fellow students have done a better job of hiding it than usual he sneered at her you didnt really think they d just welcome you back with open arms did you if you did then i ve sorely overestimated your intelligence granger and i ve underestimated your callousness hermione replied bravely in remus opinion you d say anything to spite others his half lidded eyes gave him an almost lazy and relaxed look but the sky blue hue in his eyes was lined with ice a hidden danger he licked his lips to wet them before curving them into the elongated s of a smirk and replied with a morbid sense of amusement and isntit always the truth that causes the most pain remus tensed beside her but before she grabbed his hand her last words were directed to the smooth faced malfoy fancy being a ferret again she hissed making for the door with remus hand in hers one eyebrow rose tauntingly when in contrast the ice over the blue eyes beneath thickened warningly is that a threat the tone in which the question was delivered sounded light but the implications beneath it were clear to the retreating hermione she wisely reigned in her temper and delivered the two gryffindors to the safety of her bedroom leaving a smirking malfoy behind with a slam of the door for once the soothing golden hues of her room did nothing to comfort her instead mercilessly leaving her with her troublesome thoughts remus was far better at concealing his emotions at the moment than her and he took up his stance in the space between her bed and dresser looking infinitely less burdened than she as she paced across the room unable to dispel the feelings that plagued her through sheer walking hermione settled back upon the bed using the ornately carved post as support for her head the truth she murmured almost to her herself it seemed i cantbelieve malfoy was telling the truth not knowing if he should comfort her or give her space remus hesitated in his movement towards her and chose words over contact you dontknow that for certain besides there arentany whispers that get by me hermione sighed in her despondence she laced and twined her fingers in odd patterns then requiring her to stuff her palms between her knees to stop her own fidgeting please dontlie remus it unbecoming hermione was back on her feet again but they would not carry her farther than remus i saw your reaction when malfoy said it you were reading his words i know it i truly haventheard those things hermione i swear it he insisted hermione nodded into her chest i believe you she said looking up now he did reach to comfort her placing his hands on her shoulders it probably just the slytherins anyhow you know they werentgoing to make this any easier for you yeah i know not wanting to step out of the remus reach hermione had to worm her arm up between their bodies at an odd angle due to their close proximity to rake back the wisps of damp hair that had fallen out of the knot on top of her head i d feel better if i had any more idea of what was going on but the way things are now maybe they re right looking down into her wide brown eyes set in a face that was so much more innocent now than he d ever seen it remus lost himself here in her bedroom her sanctuary far away from the prying eyes of her peers and her own friends and the troubles of the real world her entire soul was laid bare and vulnerable for little more than a stranger in that moment remus felt so angry so so angry angry at the world that had corrupted this childlike innocence rotting it away until it had flaked off like dead skin and left her hard and desensitized to the horror he hated whatever is was that had made her into a girl who could switch between whatever persona best fit the situation and not care about the pieces of herself that slipped between the cracks this hermione was good and pure above all the hatred that filled this time she deserved better than what fate had dealt her deserved to be the innocent young girl that had walked through those huge doors six years ago she deserved the chance to be an eighteen year old girl no hermione he growled only having to duck his head a bit to meet her eyes i dontwant to hear you ever say that again do you understand me hermione just gaped at him thinking quickly he looked around the room and came to a decision come on he said as he grabbed her hand we re taking that walk by the lake his tone left no room for argument and hermione would have let him drag her across the country but she dug her heels into the carpet yanking them both to a stop still the boy pulled at her but she clasped the wrist of the hand that held her own and begged him silently to stop please she said i dontwant to see them right now he looked back over his shoulder hand on the doorknob with a gentle smile that asked her to trust him then get ready to run remus hermione yelled as he shoved open the door and yanked her out from beneath the girls stairwell at a dead sprint faces whizzed past in a blur of color and indiscernible features though hermione was mostly trying to concentrate on not running into anything it had been a fair span of time since she d gone running and having her guide as a werewolf didnthelp things much then they were out through the portrait door and down the corridor back in the common room everyone was staring at the fat lady as she swung back shut in mixes of disbelief and surprise ginny jaw was dropped and she was still holding her hands up as if the witch weekly magazine she d just been reading hadntslipped from her fingers and spilled over the floor putting a crease in the face of broderick the handsome what was that their laughter bounding off the walls hermione and remus finally slowed their head first rush by the fifth floor and strained to keep their sides from splitting it was hard to even say what had caused the laughter more that they were laughing for sake of it it was started by the hilarity of their run through the common room but once it had started the laughter continued endlessly almost desperately trying to brighten the spirits of the two teenagers you re crazy hermione told him holding her stomach with one hand as the other was currently occupied by remus it got you laughing at least he pointed out leading them through a tapestry that would take them down to the main floor yeah she dryly answered in the dark of the secret passage she punched his leg with their joined hands thanks for that oh my jaw aches big baby he teased besides she went on i not sure i agreed to any moonlit trysts with you remus rolled his eyes though she couldntsee it and lifted aside the painting that blocked the end of the staircase holding it so that hermione could follow him out it was awkward with one hand but he wasntgoing to be the one to let go first it four in the afternoon and i hadntplanned on snogging but if you really want hermione blushed and had he been feeling particularly gentlemanly he might have looked away but as it was we ll save that thought for another day eh the october air was cool and crisp against their cheeks and carried with it the poignant smell of the lake down the grounds from them the damp grass soaked straight through their stocking feet neither having taken the time or forethought to find shoes before their romp out into the corridors and as their toes turned numb and cold they picked up their run again holding tight to one another hand and their arms flying behind them as they tried to maintain their balance down the steep slopes of hogwarts grounds they were laughing in mirth at the overcast sky as their ridiculous run was ended by the great trunk of an oak tree overlooking the lake remus attempted to slow down first but hermione slid straight into the tree laughing bracing herself with the palm of her hand and nearly falling right over this is my favorite tree her voice was nearly breathless her cheeks were rouged red from the cold wind the run and her giggles and when she spoke to him through a grin he watched those pink cheeks dimple her gaze upon the old tree was fond and she ran a palm across the rough bark before looking back at him how did you know remus moved up beside her and grabbed one of the low hanging branches to support his weight this hermione love just so happens to be the official marauders hangout oh really her face scrunched up impishly and then she disappeared leaving his hand empty and cold he turned around in confusion but saw nothing of the brunette hermione he called out some wolf you are her disembodied voice giggled look up he did so and found her grinning face peaking out of the autumnal shaded leaves of the oak tree can you make it up yourself or does wittle remmy need a boost she taunted in a babyish voice rising to her challenge with a smirk remus grabbed hold of the branch over his head and with a strong move of his arms swung himself up into the air with acrobatic ease his feet hit the bobbing branch in a crouch and he prolonged his grip of the thick limb until his balance was assured impressive hermione commended from her perch slightly higher than his own you re regretting not snogging me now arentyou her hazel eyes danced in shadows of the foliage but she didntanswer him we have to go higher canthardly see anything from down here remus let her take the lead and watched her movements from behind she d discarded her wet socks by the trunk and her now bare feet were as much an asset to her climbing as her hands she started out with a jerky mechanical sort of rhythm but as her body remembered the old oak tree remus watched the young woman transform into an agile cat before his eyes not a single unnecessary movement was made not a single muscle straining more than required to fulfill its job her back arched and the muscles in her thin shoulders rippled beneath the thick wool as lean arms pulled her to the next branch and her strong legs climbed up the trunk and swung up after her upper body to give her a better balance and purchase once in a while her feline grace would falter seen in the violent whipping of a branch or the hissed intake of breath as her feet scraped painfully against the bark but then she d remember herself and do his own climbing skills shame by slithering straight up the tree with seemingly no effort at all and when they both reached the top it was the wolf who was out of breath hermione settled herself into a v shaped crook in the branches and bounced the branch beneath her feet to knock loose the bushel of red leaves blocking their view she couldntstop the goofy smile from appearing on her face from her vantage point she could see nearly all of hogwarts grounds the lake was a stormy gray in the absence of sunlight and the wind made the waters choppy and wild each break upon the shore throwing up tiny bursts of white waters on the far side the tall sky scraping evergreens of the forbidden forest rose like black shadows into the wispy clouds and their tops were reflected in the agitated waters on the eastern side where the lake diverted into a small willow lined inlet hagrid hut could be seen pumpkins already reaching an impossible girth and the slightly lopsided smokestack spewing a steady charcoal train into the air oppositely the southern corner of the castle could be seen from the small viewing hole to the west of the lake and the flag of the school flapped briskly in the wind atop the tower that sure is one hell of a view the voice was so close it could have been whispered into her ear hermione turned to look and saw that remus had settled in to the v beside her and was now adjusting himself properly so he could sit and not fall out of the tree yeah it gonna rain probably he grabbed an overhead branch for balance and leaned half out of the tree to look up at the sky stop that she admonished you re giving me the willies laughing remus acquiesced with her request and settled back in beside her it cute that you re worried about my safety he grinned and threw an arm over her shoulder she snorted hardly i just dontwanna have to be the one to explain to james how you broke your neck so cold he sulked sullenly remus when he looked at her he was met with her profile scraggly curls falling over flushed cheeks why am i here remus she turned her gaze to him and her honey eyes were dark in the half light i want to help you hermione i here to talk if you need me he told her sincerely hermione gave a dry humorless laugh and shaking her head looked back out over the lake instead of looking into those kind blue gray eyes what do we possible have to talk about she kicked the branch again albeit a bit more violently than necessary and a shower of autumn hued leaves rained down onto the slick grass there isntanything i went through that you could possibly understand no offense she added as an afterthought as if she d subconsciously worried over hurting his feelings i know that remus answered without the slightest bit of hurt or anger in his voice but the offer still there hermione pulled one leg up to her chest and rested her chin over her knee again i ask about what anything whatever you want he offered i like talking with you very much giving a sigh that sounded more frustrated than relenting hermione head sagged forward and she ran her fingers wildly back and forth through her hair in an effort to work through her anxiety the action only succeeded in breaking the band that held her hair and the wet mess fell down around her shoulders and into her down turned face she was just growling in annoyance at the great misfortune that seemed to have befallen her when remus reached out to help her comb back the thick locks with an effortless gesture he tucked the hair behind her ear and then withdrew his hand like he hadntdone anything more than hand her a quill we could talk about the ball she suggest finally remus made a face boring hey you said anything she exclaimed shoving at his chest and by anything i meant anything that not boring he said remus she frowned at him whatever you want that what you told me you going back on that he pouted a bit and hermione bit the inside of her cheek to maintain her straight face no he finally grumbled hermione smirked that better remus grinned back hermione folded her arms behind her head and leaned back against the tree branches and the arm remus had stretched around her earlier blocking out everything else she concentrated hard and watched the leaves around the window she d created twitch spasmodically and then fall off the twigs until she was able to see everything she was getting the hang of this power that had been granted her though she was still wary about using it she looked over at remus and wondered if he felt the same way of course not she told herself he seemed to have no qualms about reading malfoy earlier and his hesitations over truth seemed just as minimal she smiled at him even if she had to force it at first and went with a topic far safer i grew up in manchester with my mum and dad muggle dentists she told him splaying her hands out in front of her for inspection and my favorite candy is sugar quills remus laughed loudly and uninhibitedly flashing two rows of perfect white teeth you do know those are pure sugar right he chuckled wiping at his eyes the corners of her eyes crinkled and she held a conspiratorial finger to her lips just donttell my parents chocolate better you know you wish it didntrain and as the sun peeked out of the clouds long enough to begin to set hermione and remus climbed out of the oak and headed for the castle in tune to their grumbling stomachs dinner had just started when they walked into the great hall and took their seats at the end of the gryffindor table with their friends still continuing their conversation on potion ingredients and why cantyou combine essence of mugwort and porcupine quills remus demanded as he sat down between james and sirius reaching to take the mashed potatoes out of the latter hands technically they should double to strength of the potion no hermione was saying as she took the seat across from him beside lily technically they should blow up and they do harry pass the biscuits would you well why would they blow up that doesntmake sense hermione lifted an eyebrow as her knife slathered butter across her roll it would make sense if you were any good at potions ouch sirius patted remus sympathetically on the back harsh mate i thought you were supposed to be the smart one remus she teased that would be me james suavely intervened leaning across the table to smile charmingly at her hermione was unimpressed you hide it well arentyou the wit master today ron commented to which she stuck out her tongue and your tie is dragging in the gravy an equally apathetic lily informed james before savagely beheading a stalk of asparagus while james cursed bullocks and implemented an emergency strategy where his plan of action was to bury his school tie in a cast of napkins sirius turned to interrogating the late arrivals and where have the two of you been he asked snogging in the astronomy tower the library more likely harry amended there you go blabbing my secret fantasies again hermione joked to sirius she said we were just talking about some things and the ball meeting ran kind of long malfoy being a prick and all and that makes you a maiden in distress his dark blue eyes winked at her suggestively and she laughed with a flush in her cheeks i hardly a maiden in any sense of the word and i fine now though i sure there ll be more distress later on if you d like a show actually he drawled twirling his fork in his hand and glancing casually up at the every changing ceiling i was thinking more along the lines of overwhelming devotion and gratitude hermione smirked and why is that what have you done for me lately he tucked his hands behind his head and gave a smirk of his own only worked out a few of the kinks in that prophecy you sent my way really she looked surprised forgive me if i dontshower you with gifts right away i d like to see what i getting in return first i ve got skills hermione nearly choked on her spaghetti she was laughing so hard james tell you friend he gonna drown in his ego pretty soon if he doesntlearn to dam it up hey i am in the middle of a tie crisis here he gestured to the assuredly ruined tie tell him yourself you re in the middle of an idiot crisis sirius shot back excuse me you heard me i dontknow why lily bothers with a complete airhead like you well at least i dontlook like a woman you nancy boy hair all the way down to my toes i ll have you know chicks love my hair really do they have fun braiding it does lily still spell out words when she doesntwant you to hear what she saying are you calling me stupid are you calling me a girl i think this friendship is over i concur let us duel then draw your weapon while james and sirius fought with their spoons over a madly grinning remus making side bets with harry and ron and lily started mumbling about what she ever saw james hermione sat back and watched it all with a smile on her face she was home a n2 marquerida here we go mornings yes the wake upings seem to be getting a bit repetitive dontthey i dontusually plan on them all ending up in the boys dorm they just sort of gravitate that way what i have planned for the rest of it doesntinvolve wake ups so if it does wander back in feel free to beat me memories why you intuitive little ducky you how did you know i was bringing that up next chapter i think you just have magical powers the thing of it is that with all those other things going on ie azkaban the reader focus was on that though all the while things were happening in the background that werentactually brought forward and told to the readers bit sneaky that we ll be finding out in the next few chapters just exactly what was going on wand oops even jk makes mistakes that was just a bit of a faux pas on my part thanks for bringing to my attention though to clarify she is wandless completed 2 24 05 5 31 pm posted 2 24 05 5 36 pm a n sorry it took so long but you know busy and stuff but i got some drabbles and stuff up so that counts right next chapter trio meeting shazaam major clearer upper etp uh no class tomorrow so if i can get my butt in gear since i have nothing else to do sometime this weekend saturday or sunday maybe hermione had completely forgotten about harry and ron note to her until she was changing into her pajamas for the night stuffing the folded parchment into her bedtable drawer she picked her bathrobe off its peg in the closet and shrugged into the warm terrycloth she still hadntregained her original build and weight so the flannel hems of her pajama pants dragged on the floor behind but there wasntanything she could do about that so she simply ignored it and stepped out into the common room it was late enough that nearly everyone had gone up to their rooms hermione sat down beside ron and said a few quick words to him and harry who was leaning over the back of the couch between them concerning the note they d given her then the trio laughed as if a good joke had just been exchanged before going their separate ways harry went over to talk to remus while ron and hermione remained seated he hurrying to come up with prophecies for divination and she delving into a thick volume on temporal translocation she only needed to wait a few more moments longer until the common room had emptied and lily and sirius came through the portrait hole to complete the group clearing her throat hermione tucked her book under her arm and stood up on the cushy couch cushion i have an announcement to make she declared though looking hardly commanding in her overly large red flannel pajamas you re going to get your day of fun so be ready by ten tomorrow morning giving both harry and ron a kiss on the cheek goodnight hermione hopped off the couch and towards her room where are we going sirius called after her hermione laughed and winked at him before twisting the doorknob and stepping into her head girl rooms it a surprise everyone ready the seven of them were all standing in the middle of hermione bedroom cloaks fastened tightly around their necks and anxiously wondering just what the brunette had in mind each of them nodded in affirmation and hermione swept her cloak to one side and procured a cracked earthen vase she held it straight out in her palm everyone get a finger on it she instructed and by forming a tightly packed circle with one another they were able to do as she d instructed how did you get an unauthorized portkey harry asked brow furrowed he d seen enough of what his friend had once hidden to wonder what exactly she d had to do to get this and whether it was legal or not oh it authorized she insisted simply as they waited for it to activate her maple syrup eyes met harry emerald ones with something akin to defiance but he was unable to press her further before ron interrupted who he asked dumbledore she said and it was irritating when they indiscreetly looked to remus for confirmation dumbledore signed off on us ditching the school james exclaimed in awe cool sirius echoed and at exactly that moment the clock struck 10 03 and the group disappeared they reappeared in a very different place hermione stepped away from the circled pack and when she looked back at them they noticed she was different too spreading her arms wide she spun in a circle grinning widely welcome to old beijing paper lanterns hung all around them waiting until nightfall to be lit and from the alley in which they d appeared they could see nothing but a symphony of red buildings it truly did seem as if they d portkeyed back to ancient china hermione drab apparel had been replaced by color and texture a green chinese silk tunic that reached to her thighs went over the matching green silk trousers that capped off just below her knees thin black slippers laced up her bared calves and tied somewhere unseen beneath her pants the tunic however was by far the most beautiful piece the sleeves stopped just past her shoulders and were thinly lined with golden cord that also went around the hem the gold went around her neck in a mock turtleneck and formed two loops for ornate jeweled buttons that clasped the collar shut the whole tunic was decorated with tiny intrinsic chinese symbols in gold and silver her bushy hair had somehow been contained as well and twisted up into two buns on top of her head wrapped in emerald ribbon heavy kohl lined her eyes giving an illusion of them being wider and deeper than they truly were and onyx pendant earrings dangled by her cheeks she posed for them and the bangles on her wrist jangled old beijing prides itself on its noble heritage and they continue to hold to the old ways no matter how the world changes around them the city is exactly the way it was hundreds of years ago the more we fit in the more they ll accept us as better than tourists she explained gesturing to her outfit feel free to change your clothes i was a bit rushed having truly not noticed they d changed as well the marauders and her friends looked down at themselves in surprise the boys all sported the same gray half trousers as hermione emerald ones with thin white socks tucking in underneath and flat black shoes they were separated by their shirts sirius had one of pure white that was short sleeved and crossed over his chest and tied at the side like a bathrobe it was cut a few inches up on either side and hung down over his waist his long hair had been pulled into a high ponytail on top of his head by a thick white ribbon without any tails ron had no sleeves to his yellow tunic but it seemed to compensate for the fact by hanging low over his upper legs cut on both sides up to his hips for unhindered mobility a red sash tied around his waist and the tassels on each end were gold james wore white with long sleeves that went over his hands and a neckline that hung over his shoulders the cloth crossed twice over his chest and looped through a wooden circle in the back in some precise way that kept the entire thing fastened underneath the heavier over shirt he wore a silk tunic that came sleevelessly up to his throat and stuck out a few inches longer around the bottom than the white harry standing beside him wore a shirt of black that inelastic sleeves reached his elbows it crossed in the front as sirius had done but tucked into the waistband of his trousers with a billow of extra silk cloth hanging over the edge that it obscured the transition and had a green cord for a belt beneath his unruly bangs a green bandana that matched both his eyes and hermione tunic covered his scar and tied in a knot behind his head lily was a vision in red as she spun around in her full length kimono it cut off around the shoulders and neck as hermione had done but the red silk was trimmed in black rather than gold and it reached far past the taller girl waist and all the way down to her ankles embroidered with beautiful flowers golden gauntlets incased her lower arm as well as a short length of leg above her ankles and she wore on her feet low red heels her lips had been painted ruby and her pretty hair was twisted into an elegant bun atop her head and fastened with a jeweled lily comb and black chopsticks remus wore white silk that came down tightly just past his elbows and over that he wore a tunic of light brown the sleeves hung loosely short and the neckline crossed lower than the others showing the white again the edges of the crossing material were outline in thick darker brown and the knot they tied in hung long tails down his side i feel all dressed up lily admitted a shyish smile played on her painted lips as she played with the twin tails of her dress whose slits bared the skin of her legs all the way up to mid thigh james whispered something in her ear to which she flushed and giggled madly and made sirius roll his eyes where are we off to first pigeon he was tugging thoughtfully at the end of his ponytail the style which in all honesty hermione found rather cute why dontyou guys take a look around and then we ll find someplace for lunch she suggested and the troop started on their way stepping out into the bright sunlight of the square the chinese weather proved itself to be far warmer than the climate they d left behind in scotland hermione led the way but was quickly over passed by the marauders as they ran from shop to shop peering wide eyed at all the wonders like children in a candy store she amused herself by talking lightly with harry and ron about this and that none of them so enraptured as the others having been in the city already once before then harry and ron stopped to talk to a young girl whose mother was in the chinese outpost of the order and hermione found herself walking alone through the gilded stone square stopping beside the fountain she was allowed only a moment of peace to bask her face in the warm sunlight before she was converged upon on all sides isntthe fountain lovely lily gushed from over her shoulder come look at this street performer i swear he putting a stick on fire down his throat sirius insisted tugging at her arm you can flip like that cantyou hermione james said grabbing her other arm and gesture in the direction of an acrobatic show going on down the street hermione you remember mei ling dontyou harry laughed setting the beaming child at her feet who then promptly latched onto one of her legs we have all day you guys she insisted laughing but allowed herself to be dragged off all the same lunch came and went at a small out of the way restaurant in the wizarding section of old beijing where it seemed hermione knew the owner personally the food was good everyone having chosen the buffet to be able to try as much as they could it was when the boys were all slouched in their seats patting their stomachs and lily was hiding an unladylike burp in her napkin that a sudden flashing caught their eyes hermione remus started your chest is glowing hermione looked at him in surprise before she became suddenly serious and looked down at the small lime green circle that was flashing between her breasts she touched the light with the tips of her fingers and like rising out of molasses a golden chain and its attached golden coin pulled up and through the silk of her tunic the coin looked ancient and it had odd symbols scratched into the surface but it was the diamond shaped emerald in the middle that was emitting the earlier noticed glow she touched it again and the glow vanished but her head was turned slightly to the side as if listening to something the others all looked around curiously but there was no sound other than the soft chattering of the restaurant other patrons she ready to see me hermione murmured the pendant flickered and disappeared again wha hermione pushed back her chair and stood up smiling all the while but it was forced for the sake of looking apologetic sorry to have fun and run but i ve got a meeting to attend to you booked order business harry exclaimed disbelieving his chair falling back forward onto all four legs waste not want not harry she chimed kicking her chair back underneath the table i haventgot the time to spare i should ve known that why you picked beijing he growled and looked away he seemed genuinely upset with her and the thought made hermione casualness falter that how you got the portkey james concluded snapping his fingers she nodded damn i thought dumbledore was cool he grumbled dropping his pouting face on his fists lily hermione turned to face the redhead i gonna need you to come with me is that okay she glanced uncertainly at james who grinned then back up at hermione of course she managed trying to sound as casual as the brunette without knowing what the merlin was going on hermione can i talk to you first ron asked looking serious a quick peek at harry found him to be staring solidly at her rolling her eyes she sighed her okay and pardoned herself from lily allowing her childhood friend to pull her a few tables down from the group anticipating the lecture that was coming hermione promptly folded her arms over her chest and glared at him ron looked at her blankly for a moment before he shrugged i honestly dontknow why we re over here hermione had to bite down on her lip to keep from bursting out laughing harry just kept knocking me in the ribs and you know how bony his elbows are he commented offhandedly hermione who d been positioned so that she was facing back towards the table and harry had to muffle her snort of laughter lest their lack of a serious talk be discovered frowning at her goofily grinning friend was almost impossible but she somehow managed and changed her position so that she was standing beside him her back to their table you re an idiot you know that she giggled ron hands stuffed into his pockets gave her a discreet shoulder bump he just worried about you ya know she scuffed at the floor with her slippers and signed in acceptance i know i know i still have a lot of explaining to do and i sorry about that we gonna have that meeting tonight hermione was absently twisting one of the curls that had fallen loose around her finger of course you bringing the popcorn ron chuckled only if you bring those fuzzy slippers of yours a snort you wear those more than i do they re comfy he insisted not even caring what harry would say once he realized his best mates had not been having grave speaks with one another hermione went up on her tiptoes and kissed ron on his freckled cheek thanks ron she murmured i needed a laugh the lanky boy jutted out his chest proudly then was promptly deflated by a smack from hermione we ll meet up with you in an hour or so she waved lily over and the pretty redhead waved goodbye to her boyfriend before walking over us boys ll be fine on our own he told her starting towards the table hey ron hermione called deciding last minute he spun around to face her continuing his walk backwards this is my business she told him not the order s he saluted her with a grin an hour have fun both she and lily waved goodbye before stepping back out into the bright sunlight so what secret mission are we running off on now lily asked jovially shielding her eyes from the glare of the sun as she looked off up into the sky hermione chuckled i think you ll like it hermione took a deep breath before starting off down the street she truly did need lily to come with her but this was also her chance to do what she d told james she d wanted to do become friends with lily and she couldntlie to herself the thought seemed a rather daunting task there was something about the other girl that amazed and intimidated her at the same time maybe it was the earthy beauty she possessed but wasnteven aware of or maybe it was that hermione knew she was powerful enough to keep her infant son alive against an unblockable curse it startled her then when she felt another arm link with hers hermione must have looked as if she d swallowed a flobberworm the way she was gaping at the slightly taller girl lily just smiled at her closed eyes crinkling around the edges thanks for bringing us all here she said sincerely it couldnthave been easy for you to get the seven of us out like this i it was nothing hermione insisted waving her hand in front of her face besides we all deserved a break lily nodded thin orange tendrils caressing her cheeks they walked a few more blocks in pleasant silence before lily turned to hermione and asked may i say something hermione all but laughed at her prudence of course harry didntseem to think you were taking that much of a break pearly white teeth gnawed anxiously on painted crimson lips fearing she d overstepped her bounds hermione shrugged he ll get over it probably lily stop walking perplexed the redhead did as she was asked reaching out she placed a comforting hand on hermione shoulder and ducked her head to look into her shaded eyes what is it hermione swallowed forcefully what you have to know is harry been doing this too long he just cantdo it anymore that why i have to she reached up and clasped her hand over lily wrist i ve watched too many of the people that i care about beaten down and nearly killed or worse i swore a long time ago that no matter how i felt or who stood in my way i was going to do whatever it took to keep them safe hermione sighed but her strong gaze was unwavering i cantask you to understand that then lily squeezed her shoulder and those beautiful red lips curved into a warm smile like a switch had been turned by that simple expression a familiar emotion clicked on in hermione brain without a word being said hermione felt the other girl gratitude thanking her for telling her what she had hermione had only felt remus power before and this was completely different than that lily wasnttrying to force her own emotions on top of her but merely blowing them in her direction like flower petals caught in the wind it was a soft caress a whiff of lavender a subtle taste of chocolate you look tired lily said in a voice filled with kindness her brilliant green eyes so like her son s were awash with compassion not sympathy she may not have understood hermione but she understood what it was she was fighting for relief so strong washed over her and hermione thought she might have cried if she werentstanding in the middle of a street in old beijing sniffing quickly she said you know what they say there no rest for the wicked lily laughed and hermione gestured at a building down the way we re almost there let go hermione led the way through a small back street and up to a tall bamboo constructed door there was no latch or handle that lily could see that would open this large door but hermione was one step ahead of her with a press of her fingers to her chest the medallion resurfaced and the emerald shot out a beam of light onto the middle of the door like powder blown over an infrared laser in those muggle movies in the steady light of the emerald a shimmering doorknob appeared the two girls grinned at each other and hermione nodded for lily to go ahead and open the door with a sure hand lily placed her palm over the near invisible handle pale fingers curling around the knob and twisting it to the side the door swung open and hermione necklace disappeared again she likes her privacy whenever she vacations here hermione said guiding the surprisingly light door open further so they could step inside they were stepping into a wide open square flooded with sunlight that seemed brighter than the one they d just stepped out of smooth red pillars held up the stone awning encompassing the bright courtyard and provided a slender strip of cool shadow before leading out into the warm day sakura trees and bonsais had grown straight up through the cracked flagstones and a scattering of pink blossoms littered the path they walked to the trickling fountain that served as the courtyard centerpiece seated along it was a middle aged woman her hair swept back and secured with a tortoise shell comb her asian features were awash with white sunlight as the woman looked up from the folder spread open before her and looked towards the sound of their soft slippered footsteps hermione her english was fluent vera hermione smiled in return walking up to the fountain this is the friend i told you about lily evans this is vera wang are you serious lily exclaimed reaching out to shake the woman hand she may have only been in the future for two months but living in a dorm with a bunch of other girls she knew exactly who vera wang was both hermione and vera laughed she going to help us with a bit of a job hermione explained she sounded as if she knew the designer well i didntknow you were a witch lily remarked jade eyes wide impressed the woman reply was a smile and a soft voice my clients didntlie when they said my designs were magical hiking up her tunic a bit hermione settled on the stone bench of the fountain and curled her legs up underneath her shall we get started then vera nodded and tapped the papers of her folder with her index finger i have a list of all the witches who ve ordered gowns for samhain right here do you have yours yes reaching up under the sleeve of her green tunic hermione retrieved a tightly folded piece of parchment she unfolded it and handed it to vera all the while lily peering interestedly over her shoulder from her own seat on the fountain vera said her incantation in her native tongue then zigzagged the end of her wand down hermione scrap of parchment the names inked upon it lifted up into the air as flat and one dimensional as they had been on paper and she guided them with her wand down onto her own stack of parchments the names scattered to find their matches and each pair found emitted a red glow when the spell was finished there was not a single name that returned to hermione parchment matchless anyone who anyone is wearing your designs for samhain hermione praised that works out perfectly perfectly for what lily asked curiously and hermione remembered that she hadntexplained what they were doing there saying a few quick words to vera who began putting the files back together hermione turned around to face lily sitting with one slender leg pulled up to her chest samhain is a night of big activity for voldemort forces but they re doing a very good job of keeping the order spies from finding out about them vera and i think we may have come up with a plan to change that hermione smiled briefly at the designer as she passed by then went back to lily every female death eater and every death eater wife the order knows about was on that list i gave her each one has ordered a dress by vera wang you ve put tracking spells on them haventyou lily exclaimed in sudden understanding hermione nodded very complex ones at that i going to have to lace my enchantments through vera to solidify them and the order doesntknow about this she shook her head no sensing another question coming hermione moved to explain the situation further this plan is very dangerous lily if any of them discover that their dress has been tampered with they could trace back the magic signatures to vera and myself i want to make sure this works first before i tell the order lily lips quirked oddly and her pupils dilated accordingly to adjust to the bright sunlight as she looked upwards well you can bet harry and ron certainly wouldntapprove her tone wasntreprimanding she was merely stating a fact hermione smiled but it looked as if it pained her to do so yes i sure you re right she agreed but made no indication that lily was now sworn to secrecy or that the world would end if she told anyone else of the secret plane what she said was i trust your judgment on this lily patting her lap hermione let out a gush of air and stood up beaming brightly she offered her hand to lily and pulled the redhead up off the fountain bench let get you to the fitting rooms so vera can start taking your measurements while i work on the dresses lily stumbled in the wake of hermione exuberant pace but her longer legs quickly closed the distance fitting rooms she repeated as her companion pushed open another light bamboo door hermione looked up at her in mild surprise oh didnti tell you vera doing our dresses for the ball an hour later the two girls were saying their goodbyes to vera and stepping back onto the street where lily was surprised to find dusk beginning to settle on the ancient town i didntrealize so much time had passed she said conversationally you wouldn t hermione replied vera ceiling is enchanted she likes the sun thank you for taking me with you i know you do not give out your trust easily the brunette face colored a bit for it sounded all the more embarrassing coming from lily who trusted everyone we ve grown up in two different worlds she shrugged perhaps she replied cryptically but your friends are not so protective of their trust as you hermione shook her head though not in denial of anything for me it nothing personal and ron trusts you because harry does there was a pause in the conversation though lily lips parted as if she were near to speaking then very slowly she turned her face to meet hermione and when she spoke it was with an odd sound to it and why does harry trust us buzzers and alarms and red flashing lights went off in hermione brain as the deliberately pronounced words reached her ears their eyes were locked and hermione gradually stopped walking staring at each other hermione internally praised the redhead for her intelligence but condemned her tact then looking up at her through her lashes with hard eyes hermione said quite clearly i think you already know lily a smile spread across her fading red lips and lily inclined her head to hermione as if to say touch hermione let a ghostly smile of her own appear before changing the subject do you think you could find james she asked i could try she offered and like being dunked in molasses hermione felt lily power wash over her hermione waited patiently for lily as she tested the bounds of her power she d suggested james because he was the one lily was most connected to emotionally hoping that it would work so they wouldnthave to go apparating all over the place looking for them hermione had no problems settling in for a long wait ten minutes later lily was blinking back the focus to her eyes and pointing down the street that way we should hurry if we want to make it back for dinner hermione suggested and in agreement the two girls took off at a run with lily guiding the way when hermione caught sight of the boys at the far end of the bazaar she quickened her pace so that she was running alongside lily no longer needing her to lead they ran neck and neck throwing up their hands as they dodged street vendors to wave at the boys that was why hermione was completely taken aback when while grinning widely and waving at james lily said to her i trust you hermione because we re not as different as you think hermione stopped dead in tracks startled and amazed as lily continued on to jump into james arms he spun her around laughing and kissed her on the tip of her nose hermione had heard of decision altering moments but never had she witnessed one quite like this standing in the middle of china thousands of miles from home with harry still too upset to give her a hug of her own she stared at a tiny puppet show performing just down the street she d already calculated it in her mind hermione remus was calling to her breaking her attention let get back before these neanderthals you brought with us start hunting for food shaking her head hermione nodded and with a narrowing of her eyes re enlarged the earthen pot that had served as their portkey to old beijing she d learned a fair few tricks with her new power though the tracking enchantments had took her a precious few days to master everyone get a hold on it because i not coming back for you if you don t she said in blas manner knowing full well she d do just that everyone crammed around in their bright silks and got at least a finger on the jar hermione had gotten the portkey with a set departure time but telling dumbledore she was uncertain as to the time of her return he d encoded the reversal so that it wouldntactivate until a predetermined word activated it and so after a check to make sure that everyone was going to get taken with it she said quite clearly cinnamon fifteen minutes later as lily brushed past her on the group way to dinner hermione looking as though she was smiling at remus joke whispered softly in the redhead ear nine o clock under the girls stairs completed 3 2 05 10 00 pm posted 3 2 05 10 07 pm hermione hermione rolled her eyes at harry tone and sprawled out on the armchair beside her bookcase one leg over the arm and an arm draped over the back harry she replied in a mockery of his tone honestly he was being so childish ron closed the door behind the two of them as they entered hermione room and in a fashion typically ron ignored the both of them he returned from routing around in her closet to find them both glaring at each other shuffling over to the bed in hermione pink furry slippers he tossed a few pieces of popcorn up into the air and caught them in his mouth maybe we should sort this bit out first he suggested and plopped down on the bed depends hermione commented think anything will make it through that hard head of his you re hiding things again hermione harry sighed he looked more frustrated than angry as he ran his hands through his hair hello kettle calling pot she muttered sarcastically it not as if you haventdone the same hey he was indignant that was to protect you and ron hermione fixed him with a solid unblinking look throwing up his hands harry growled out an aggravated sound what could you possibly have to hide that would hurt us hermione waved at ron and he obligingly chucked the bag of popcorn to her she caught it with minimal spillage of fluffy white kernels and dug out a handful of the salty foodstuff just before feeding it to herself she responded with well for that reason you wontever know now will you ron snorted but quickly stopped at the sharp look from harry you re being ridiculous the dark haired boy insisted listen harry she started around a mouthful of popcorn it nothing that would aid you by knowing it so let just drop it so why did you guys call this meeting her redirection of the conversation was given in a no nonsense tone ron cleared his throat and he became unusually solemn sirius was asking questions earlier they re going to find out hermione she paused and then slowly lowered the bag of steaming popcorn to her lap her jaw deliberately working to finish her last mouthful of food wiping at her mouth with the side of her hand she worked to clear the last of the persistent shells stuck to her teeth before speaking we haventdone anything to conceal their futures ron she said with purposeful slowness that was pointed in its deliberation they re smart i harbored no doubts they d figure it out eventually ron looked shocked but harry was the one who shook his head wontthat disrupt the timeline we have to do something ron added rather hysterically throw them off the scent they re not dogs harry shouted back you re the one that ran your mouth off when they first got here he reminded him in a voice that was much louder than necessary for conveying his words the short distance there no problem hermione shouted interrupting the fight now shut up the room fell into silence the bag of popcorn overturned all over the floor in hermione hasty sitting up and ron hands in his hair as he watched harry frozen pacing stop mid stride in the middle of hermione bedroom running her own hand through the top layers of her hair she ground her palm frustrated into her forehead with her fingers catching in her tangled curls nothing she swallowed and started again nothing they discover here will make any difference hermione harry brow furrowed and he took a step towards her is there something you know that we don t her eyes flashed dangerously i know more than you ever will harry face deepened with angry lines but before any words could escape his opening mouth ron cut them both off we re not starting this again you two sort your shit out later quite honestly it was freaking him out to see harry and hermione in a quarrel that had lasted this long maybe harry had reached the end of his patience with hermione secretiveness but whatever it was it hadntever happened before and it was screwing with the only sure thing in his life hermione he addressed her what do you mean it wontmake any difference i pretty sure the things they could find out wouldntbe so non timeline changeable hermione had slid off the chair and was on her knees picking up the scattered kernels she cleared her throat and tucked her hair back from hanging in her face and behind her ear settling back on her heels she gestured to her bureau in my knicker drawer there a book the two boys exchanged looks but the sole female was staring despondently at her bed pleated bed skirt like all of life answers were about to peek out from between the folds harry who was already on his feet was the one who crossed past her and pulled open the top drawer of the aforementioned bureau how he knew which one was her knicker drawer ron wasntabout to ask donttouch anything she threatened but it was hollow sounding and from a bed of lacy bras and cotton briefs harry quickly retrieved the book and closed the drawer the book was thick the kind hermione liked and it was a bit musty and smelled like a mix of the library and springtime fresh it looked a bit familiar but he was forever losing his friend nose into a book and the covers tended to blur together he trailed a finger along the pages and looked up at hermione it marked she told him sitting back against the front of her arm chair one leg stretched out on the carpet and the other bent up so she could drape her arm over her knee it was a good thing she d changed into her pajamas meanwhile harry was flipping pages until he found the two that were separated by a bookmark and not just some scrap of paper or a random receipt but a true bookmark it was paper thin red leather with the initials h j g embossed in gold at the bottom at the top a corded yellow tassel looped through a hole he looked up in surprise but hermione wasntlooking at him the door was garnishing all her attention it was the bookmark he d given her for her birthday last year moving it aside his eyes scanned down the old inked words his face furrowed again hermione this is go ahead read it ron was looking at her in concern for it wasntoften that such a defeated tone as this crept into the brunette voice clearing his throat harry began to read as she instructed moving with book in hand back to the bed time travelers that journey to the past when they return to their present and original time remember all those they meet in the past as well as every experience the person or person who had knowledge of the time traveler retain their memories as well until such time as they are reunited with the traveler or in the cases of great time differential until death i remember those words ron murmured hermione didntsay anything to that so harry took that as a sign to keep reading witches and wizards who travel to the future are surrounded by much different circumstances when such time travelers return to the past they and just as hermione had all those nights ago harry stopped reading what it say mate harry swallowed slowly and sunk into the chair in front of hermione vanity when such time travelers return to the past they lose all memories of their experiences for the future unlike travelers to the past their memories have not yet occurred and so they have no recollection of their time spent in the future until that time has come to pass hermione head was back her chestnut curls spilled out across the armchair cushions now you know she said but hermione they re all dead now ron said quietly the book hit the floor with a dull whump and hermione leather bookmark stuck disparagingly out from beneath bent pages my mum and dad harry throat stuck they re not going to remember me hermione turned to look at him and though her tone was apathetic her face softened no and just like that all ill will between them melted away this was going to be my chance his voice cracked and he could no longer speak hermione had moved to kneel in front of him though he hadntseen her approach and in a gesture he hadntseen in too long she reached up and carefully brushed his bangs back from his eyes harry your parents sacrificed their lives knowing what kind of person you d turn out to be she told him earnestly sirius knew too harry nodded brusquely and lowered his head to compose himself face emotionless hermione stood and left his side walking back to her bed what are we going to do he asked i going to send them back her tone was even there no telling what would happen to their past selves if they got hurt here or worse how harry lifted his head from his hands and folded them together hermione shrugged and lifted herself back up onto the high mattress i worked out a reversal of the original ritual back in azkaban she quickly cleared her throat it still on the walls how soon ron asked the atmosphere of the room had since taken a dramatic plunge and not even the gangly redhead could summon up any cheer depends about a week she looked over at him i wish i could but i cantget them out of here before samhain are we sure we should even be trying to get them back at all harry asked masking his growing anger by taking off his round glasses to polish the lenses on his shirt tails they dontbelong here harry hermione said thinly they cantkeep living their lives in two different times that not what i meant harry was on his feet now you could get sent back hermione is that what you want no one wants to go back she yelled outrage lining her face but i have to fix what i ve done the spell brought them here to help defeat voldemort so why dontwe use them no matter how angry he made his tone he was pleading with her plain and simple begging her not to leave them again they re unsuited for war harry she scowled you saw them they think this is a joke and you think you re the only one who as a say in all of this he shot back his anger deflated then and he picked hermione hands up in both of his pulling them to his chest he looked her beseechingly in the eyes losing you ron and i cantdo it again hermione please hermione face was as blank as a slate but she let him hold her hands as though it was some small token she was willing to be bestow for the moment what if the next time voldemort attacks he gets to lily she had to pause a moment to regain the deadened sound to her voice you might never be born harry what do ron and i do then in the silence that followed it was ron who finally broke it when did our lives become so painful hermione sighed and rested her head against one of the canopy posts harry still holding to one of her small hands as ron murmurs went on when did we stop being kids when did everyday life turn into a struggle just to survive to the next bitter day harry stared fixatedly on the carvings in the bed headboard and hermione eyes had returned to the door ron looked into the hearth as if there were flames crackling there that neither harry nor hermione could see when did i turn to ice hermione whispered and both boys fought not to look at her fearing what they would find harry spoke next when did being the hero stop being enough digging the knuckles of a fist roughly into his cheek ron propped up his head and blinked back the glaze that had settled over his eyes when did voldemort start winning he asked softly and to that no one had an answer they sat in silence for a very long time longer than they ever had before they did not speak because none of them could find the words to bring back a hint of joy to the deadened atmosphere choking the room and so they refrained from speaking at all preferring to keep the silence the way it was without risking further despair to work its way into their thoughts but then the trio could always count on ron what are you gonna do about your boyfriends he asked in a voice that was a bit too soft to be joking but he was doing his best hermione smiled and gave a short chuckle turning to look back at the two of them sitting on her bed get them out of my bedroom and up to bed aww that sweet of you to say harry reached out and tweaked her toes knowing she was ticklish there and she responded in turn by kicking him in the shins but i think best friend ron was meaning my godfather and our teacher they re not my boyfriends she said snidely turning up her nose not yet ron corrected with a grin dontyou think they re gonna be a little peeved about you sending them back yeah harry said how are you going to tell them hermione bit out a smile and forced her gaze not to wander i dontthink that ll be an issue i surprised you haventeven tried with either of them ron confessed and hermione was proudly able to hold back her blush that because they dontbelong here it wouldnthave worked you should try saying that to em harry laughed and ron snickered could you imagine their faces the redhead chortled hermione smiled faintly you know i bet ten galleons my mum ll be the first one to figure it out harry boasted confidently jabbing a thumb into his chest no way ron countered leaning forward definitely sirius if he keeps pushing one of us is gonna let something slip you mean you ll let something slip harry laughed loudly ron gave an indignant sound and chucked one of hermione good bed pillows at him the owner of said pillow closed her eyes and opened them just as slowly taking the time to gather herself together swallowing she bit the bullet and her eyes were on the door as she said twenty knuts says they re listening right now lily and the marauders were knocked solidly back against the stairwell and sat up nursing their bruised cheeks where the door had been shoved stoutly into them the knob above them twisted and the door swung inwards but when they looked up the trio was still sitting on hermione bed ron mouth was as wide as his eyes and harry looked like he was about to be sick lily face was blank but james wouldnteven meet their eyes sirius looked angry and remus betrayed hermione sat in the middle of it all hands neatly folded in her lap detaching herself from the situation hermione left behind her investment in the outcome of this play scene and simply waited for someone to say something anything when no one did seemingly quite content to continue their staring contest she slipped off the edge of her bed and padded across the carpet to the tune of six sets of eyes reaching up as she moved she tugged out the binding that held her hair in its ponytail and the wild curls spilled down around her shoulders seating herself in front of her lighted vanity she stared at her tired face before picking up her brush and beginning to run it through her hair as if there were no else around i cantbelieve you kept this from us sirius yelled into the silence hermione unaltered rhythm continued as she worked the mahogany brush around her head we had to overhear it she flipped her hair over her shoulder and selected a lock from the bottom layer that had seen particular wear and knottedness i asked lily to come tonight sirius hermione said quite simply you did what ron shouted you knew they were there all this time harry voice was strained though hermione attention was focused on working the tangles from her curls yes she caught sight of a dark head raising and clouded brown eyes in the curved arc of her mirror i thought we were friends hermione james said dolefully her hand brush held loosely in its fingers fell back onto the make up table and she looked at him through the reflective glass we are he shook his head and an unfamiliar dryness threatened to stop her words no friends dontkeep secrets from each other hermione closed her eyes they were going back in a week she had to remind herself even whisper it under her breath for the words to have any effect on her like a favorite cloak she draped her apathy around herself wrapping the mask of detachedness around her with so tight a fastening neither air nor light could slip through the cracks and when she d sealed herself off burrowed so far into unfeeling she felt cold when she opened her eyes again the honey orbs that reflected back at her looked dead how long did it take for remus to confide in you his lycanthropy she asked evenly thoughtless to the pained affect her question had on the quartet sitting in her doorway at least he told us sirius shot back angrily as have i she replied in that same cool tone without inflection her fingers worked deftly to wind her thick mane into a single corded braid that not the same hermione james insisted quietly isntit you betrayed me us remus whispered speaking for the first time i sorry you feel that way she said as she pinned up her braid but her voice was void of any sort of apologetic tone in fact she sounded anything but you can feel as angry at me as you like but in a week it wontmatter you cant be serious about that hermione said james she nodded and if it wasnther affirmation that cut them it was the words that followed it you re useless to me their pained and disbelieving faces hardly so much as scratched the surface of hermione apathy she simply no longer cared the only reason any of you know all of this is because of harry i told lily to come outside my rooms because i wanted to harry to know hermione eyes burned and her mind couldntseem to identify the wetness that was building up in them there was no emotion connected to it it was just there pricking at the corners of her eyes to know that for one brief moment his parents knew what a wonderful person he had turned out to be that they loved and believed in him that they were proud of him not a drop rolled down her face but she had to sniff to clear her throat to speak that all harry had turned away from the marauders resolutely staring at the open door to hermione closet as she d spoken she looked over at him as his eyes moved to hers tears like a thought that had been caught on the tip of her tongue she remembered them harry hadntbeen able to hold back his tears but they were ones only she and ron could see he smiled then and she knew her face must look a terrifying sight all cold and empty and he mouthed two words thank you hermione cleared her throat i ve actually been looking forward to a bath all day so if you ll excuse me it was as if her mannerly words were spoken merely as a formality for none yet held the customary tones or sentiments behind them it looked as though she wouldnthave listened if they hadnt excused her as even while she was saying the words she was giving them her back and walking to the door that separated her bedroom from the heads common room a shrug of her shoulders and her robe slipped down her arms and pooled in a terrycloth pile behind her as she walked it was probably shock that struck the room mute until she d opened the door but the jumble of shouted words hardly penetrated her suddenly developed selective hearing and the door was pushed softly shut hermione on the other side fuck remus jumped as sirius fist dented the plaster along the frame of the door with a canine snarl the dark haired wizard pushed himself onto his feet and was running through the gryffindor common room before lily speaking for the first time since the interchange could reach him sirius dont hermione had almost reached the sanctuary of the prefects bath before the swift sirius caught up and was upon her he spun her around with one of his substantially larger hands clamping tight around her wrist the cold stone wall made close acquaintances with hermione back as it seemed she wasntgoing to be bathing in the near future judging by the bruising grip on her forearm sirius you re hurting me she told him dully the pale white of her arm looked all the more brittle and thin with his fingers curled around it and the baggy flannel sleeve of her pajamas scrunched down around her elbow she for one did not like looking at it and being reminded of how such things had come to pass no i not his voice was dangerously low in its surety no more lies hermione stopped her pathetic excuse for struggles and gazed heavy lash d at him honoring his request for an end to her falsehoods it seemed her dream of a bath was going to go unrealized this night you lied to me about everything he hissed not everything she said evenly and not even on this particular matter i merely held my tongue if dumbledore did not see fit to tell you then it wasntmy place bullshit dontyou start acting the model student now you run more of this school than he does hermione forced her gaze as stony as it would go but his hot angry breath on her cheeks was distracting and flustering if you had come to me and asked me do i die in this time i would have told you the truth well sorry if that particular question never crossed my mind he raged he couldntbelieve she had to the gall to say something like that to his face hermione reached up and with slow but unflinching strength pried his fingers off her wrist there were bright red marks where the pads of his fingers had squeezed too hard i would have told you the truth she repeated evenly his glare was hard and fierce but hermione did not falter instead when it became too difficult to maintain her apathy she fixed her gaze on a fissure in the wall opposite the one against her back her hand still held sirius wrist but the other was pressed palm against the stone her entire arm flush with the wall at the moment life pretty much sucked if she had thought for a second she d be calling for anyone aside from the founders with that ritual she never would have done it respectable witches and wizards such as them would not have thrown hissy fits over being sent back to their time nor have caused her so much inner strife for some reason hermione couldntimagine she would have developed any personal feelings for say salazaar slytherin sirius heavy sigh startled her enough to realize that she d completely spaced off in her inner discussion and she reluctantly moved her gaze back to sirius face mentally berating herself for not being able to remain detached as she used to she never got the chance to steel herself over because sirius was leaning over her and for the most panicky of all seconds hermione thought he was surely going to try and kiss her head twitching spasmodically in which she felt like a demented bobblehead doll hermione fought between facing him down and turning her head to put her lips out of his reach she wasntaware she d been holding her breath until sirius forehead found the cool stone beside her own head and the pent up carbon dioxide slipped passed her lips in a hiss his hand had gone limp in her grasp thumb dragging its edge along the back of her palm and his long hair was clinging to her neck and pajama sleeve with crackling static electricity they stood together that way sirius leaning dejectedly against the wall and she keeping her breaths shallow so as not to close the infinitesimal distance between their bodies you thought i was gonna make out with you didntyou laughter bubbled just at the edge of his voice hermione shot him a sharp glare out of the corner of her eye trying to look disapproving but flushing slightly at being caught i not completely sex driven you know he said wryly hermione considered a multitude of different sharp and rather abrasive comebacks to this but she was just too tired you re sweet she murmured lifting her hand off the wall she braced it against his chest and guided him back but i cantlet you and the others stay in this time sirius groaned hermione i tired sirius she sighed i just want to take my bath and go to bed there nothing you or anyone could say to make me change my mind not even if you trained from dawn til dusk or did something equally ridiculous to try and prove yourselves hermione looked him straight in the eyes and repeated herself quite clearly you cant prove yourselves to me she patted his shoulder and said if a bit awkwardly i sorry sirius he watched her step into the bathroom and close the door softly behind her and only after he was left staring at the fissure that had earlier caught hermione attention that her words really sunk in i have to tell them he muttered disjointedly to himself as he pushed off the wall and sprinted for the gryffindor tower he just hoped he could explain what had happened just now completed 3 14 05 10 47 pm posted 3 14 05 10 54 pm a n i terribly sorry for the delay but as you know my computer was dead for a good week but it okay now unfortunately i going to be in cozumel mexico the 16th 24th it probably not fair that it been a week since i last updated and now it ll be another week before another one but it not my fault trust me there will be heaps and heaps of updates the day or so after i return once i get everything onto i will be bringing the laptop with me so there wontbe any delays for typing up so anyways here it is james sirius shouted tripping over the portrait doorway in his haste to share his revelation james james james james jaaaames what the bloody hell has gotten into you padfoot james exclaimed appearing over the back of the couch he looked bewildered as to what had caused the sudden surge of franticness in his friend everybody to the roof let go he demanded making wild rushing motions with his hands come on come on come on james lily in hand warily started walking towards the painting of godric gryffindor but was spurred on by a careening remus who d been shoved that way by sirius let go said shover hissed following up the train with his hands constantly pushing at remus back james barely got the portrait open before they were all frantically pushed up the stairs they made it to the roof of gryffindor tower with a fair share more bruises than they d started with and in much fouler moods from the scene outside hermione bedroom they circled up in front of sirius shivering in the cool autumnal air and scowling at him what did you do to hermione was the first thing out of lily mouth did you hurt her was the second sirius for a moment forgot his excitement his anger answered the accusation i would never he roared we all know how you get sirius lily yelled back finding herself easily swept into the high tension of the moment she didntdo anything wrong and neither did i pads lily please stop this james pleaded stepping in front of his girlfriend he held a stopping hand out to sirius remus cleared his throat loud enough to get their attention but still delivered with subtlety hermione is fine lily he assured her quietly he telling the truth but more than that i know sirius here his eyes darkened a bit and lily tasted the bitter tang of jealousy you need not worry for hermione safety where he is concerned right james exclaimed a bit breathlessly now that that s er settled why in blue blazes did you kidnap us up here sirius covered up his chagrin at forgetting by crossing his broad arms over his chest hermione not gonna send us back remus turned his head away in disbelief lily looked down at her feet and james groaned we donthave much of a choice in the matter mate the shaggy haired boy reminded him trying not to initiate another shouting match no i mean she not going to send us back she never planned to sirius threw up his hands in hallelujah finding an unrecognizable semblance of sense in his own ranting were you listening to the same hermione we were remus asked sounding skeptical of his friend mental soundness we re useless remember james bit back his bitterness it all for show sirius insisted really you guys lily made clear her unbelieving stance so it like a game she spoke slowly so sirius might realize how truly stupid he sounded i talked to her lily sirius said flinging his arms out to her she said we couldntprove ourselves this isntfunny sirius remus exclaimed he spun away from the circle to stalk to the edge of the tower balcony sirius growled ferally in frustration and ran both hands through his hair you guys have to believe me he insisted if you had heard the way she said it james feeling as though he had to stand up for his best mate in some fashion stuffed his hands in the front pockets of his jeans and decided to throw sirius a rope and how did she say it sirius waved his hands around eyes looking up as he tried to sort out hermione words wait i think yeah her exact words were nothing you or anyone could say to make me change my mind not even if you trained from dawn til dusk or did something equally ridiculous to try and prove yourselves and sirius had apparently chosen to take james graciously donated rope and strangle himself with it ya know it a good thing you ve cleared this whole thing up or otherwise i might be wanting to hex you right now lily told him with dark sarcasm sirius looked down quickly in surprise and found that he couldntsee one of lily hands and that worried him he d been on the receiving end of the redhead quickdraw enough times to know that he d like to avoid encores lily lils sirius held his arms out to her beseechingly hermione repeated the same thing twice i just know she was telling me something and that something was that i dontthink hermione wants to send us back what are you suggesting she snorted we train all day long sneak down to the library at night to read up on defense and by doing all of this convince hermione whom i might remind you is as foolable as professor mcgonagall to let us stay what do we have to lose hermione was already awake when the knock came on her door she moved to wave it open blouse raggedly untucked over her skirt then stopped a moment her hand was even partially outstretched for more complicated spells she d found that the physical act of hand gestures helped to channel her power and manifest it in the way she wished so for this spell which she hadntused since her wand was broken she raised a hand and made a swiping motion across the air like rubbing the molecules out of her line of vision the solid tan coloring of her door smeared with each motion ron and harry faces were visible in the translucent oblong shape that had appeared in the middle of the door leading to the gryffindor common room hermione what the devil are you doing harry exclaimed looking right at her she cursed and snapped her fingers returning the wood to its natural opaqueness and swinging the portrait open you werentsupposed to see me she grumbled as they walked in on her tucking the tails of her blouse under the waistband of her skirt well then your mirrow window spell needs a little work ron criticized oh shut up hermione quipped what do you guys need breakfast is over in a few minutes you didntwake us up this morning ron commented sitting on her vanity chair with a bed pillow in his arms i figured i wouldntbe that welcome she said simply as she leaned over the redhead to pin back the sides of her hair in the mirror didntstop you before ron said in a sing song voice breath hissed above him and a hand went to the side of hermione head she d scraped herself with the sharp edge of her barrette let just drop it ron harry said firmly his eyes darted to hermione s but she was stubbornly as ever looking down we thought you should know they i mean the boys at least didntcome back to the dorm last night this morning hermione asked turning around and leaning back against the vanity table harry shook his head their beds werenteven slept in she nodded her understanding of the situation here what going to happen if lily wasntwith them there a good chance she down at breakfast right now you two will go down to eat and if she there she there i ve got an idea of where the boys are so i ll go and check there first before i come and meet up with you nice battle plan general ron said with a teasing smirk he was twirling hermione brush over in his hands and if you dontmake it in time for the food then i ll meet you in potions hermione dropped her satchel over her shoulder and harry and ron were shocked to find that she d finished getting ready without their realization let go hermione stepped into the library as if stepping into her own bedroom the musty smells were all familiar the towering repetitive shelves like old friends her robe was off because it was rather warm in the school and from prior experience knew it would be doubly so in the library a warm smile and short nod was exchanged with madame pince in the manner of true library goers before hermione moved on into the deeper bowels of the cavernous room she found them as expected in the farthest corner behind the stacks they looked an odd mess harry invisibility cloak tangled up around them and obscuring random body parts it was a good thing hermione had found them first lily was missing most of her body below the shoulder line and both james and sirius had sacrificed arms and hands remus roman nose looked as though it had rather savagely been cut off taking a good piece of his cheek with it they were all asleep black what have you gone and done now molly weasley bellowed up on the landing fifteen and fourteen year old hermione and ginny respectively stifled their giggles behind their hands as two sirius loped into the kitchen the matriarch of the weasley family had long since banished them to their beds for the night but the prospect of gleaning information from the order had emboldened them to creep down the stairs in their nightclothes and slippers oy they heard fred exclaim he thinks he as cool as us poor show old man george tutted the two siriuses grinned and proceeded to stalk the flustered mrs weasley around the kitchen which one the fake ron demanded if hermione lay diagonally down the staircase she could see harry and him prodding the clones in the shoulders and testing the lean muscles in their arms for inconsistency before hermione could stop her ginny called loudly down the stairs sirius shouldntyou be sleeping the wizard closest to them turned around and found a face hanging down off the landing that didntmatch the voice hermione giggling churlishly with the younger girl blushed red and disappeared back out of sight a hero knows no bedtime he boomed jutting his elbows out and resting his fists on his bony hips a chorus of ah ha echoed across the tiled room much to mrs weasley dismay and she hurried to shush them all and keep the portrait of mrs black from waking the second sirius groaned and slapped his forehead you idiot a female voice insulted words thick with a distinct northern england accent the clone appearance shifted and shrank until it matched the slighter feminine frame of nymphadora tonks ya blew it she muttered what a doof i have for a cousin sirius waggled his finger up at the two girls knowing they could see him though he was hard pressed to keep his wide grin rueful tricky girls he pouted and the two young schoolgirls hands over their teeth bitten lips raced up the stairs and flung themselves onto their beds giggling the sixteen year old hermione tightened the knot of the afghan she d flung around her shoulders to ward off the fading march chill she d forgone a shower that morning for fear of waking others in the house and so her inordinately frizzy hair was combed back into a ponytail that looked like a kneazle had perched on her head but neither of these things were too bad and she even managed to ward off some of the cold by standing in front of the running oven it warm air venting along the backs of her black tights she stirred fitfully at the bowl of frosting spurred on by the chiming of the clock above the refrigerator and the snores of ron and harry passed out at the kitchen table they d been far from helpful the loud maddening beeping off the timer cut through the silence and she jumped on it to silence the noise charming the wooden spoon to continue stirring the frosting she levitated the two cake pans out of the oven and onto cooling racks blowing on them softly to ensure she wouldntburn her fingers hermione popped both chocolate tiers out of their metal confines and deftly stacked one on top of the other wiping her hands on the back of her jean skirt she reached for the frosting bowl only to find that it had disappeared did you make this for me came a warm voice over her shoulder professor hermione cried in dismay she turned around to find remus lupin leaning against the counter in a pair of slept in jeans and yesterday cardigan scooping frosting right out of the bowl with his finger i tried not to wake you he smiled warmly and gestured to the still lit oven with chocolate covered digit i could smell something baking it does smell delicious by the way we wanted it to be a surprise she complained throwing her dishtowel down onto the counter with a huff we hermione flushed as ron gave a particularly loud snort from the dining area the boys were really excited about it but the twins kept them up real late last night playing quidditch and they ve never really been morning people she trailed off he laughed quietly why dontyou go and wake them and i ll finish frosting the cake i cantthink of a better way i d like to start my birthday than to have chocolate for breakfast hermione smiled and relinquished her reign over the small kitchen of grimmauld and moved to do as he suggested though unable to withhold one small tease and will any of that frosting actually make it on to the cake professor the lined skin around his mouth crinkled into smile lines as he grinned almost impishly at her he brandished the mixing spoon like a flag i cantmake any promises you know miss granger when the time came for the staff and myself to choose which exemplary student would receive the honor of head girl there was no other candidate who met each criterion with above and beyond distinction as you did hermione flushed and duly so it was a rare day indeed when a student received such high praise from the headmaster of hogwarts thank you sir i have never felt prouder to be a member of this institution than i do today he smiled brightly blue eyes twinkling and i have never felt prouder of this institution hermione flushed again and looked down at her lap feeling uncharacteristically abashed dumbledore chuckled tucking his beard under the desk as he reached for a lemon drop in the dish at the desk corner minerva was a bit worried you know he told the seventeen year old girl conversationally despite how she may act she is very fond of you miss granger and she was worried that we might have to pass you up for someone more sociable hermione honey eyes were as wide as saucers as if she d never even conceived the notion she might be looked over for the position a weathered hand patted her own that gripped her tea cup dontworry child you pulled through for minerva in fact your growth these past two years reminds me so very much of two heads i once had the pleasure of overseeing hermione followed his gesture with curious eyes but when her gaze landed on the picture of his warm admiration she felt sick to her stomach she d been with harry enough seen the poured over pictures so much that she knew those two faces as well as her own the potters sir she choked out in her own disbelief oh yes they were very into their own groups just as you once were with their son but then they met despite their friends better efforts he chuckled here at memories hermione couldntfathom and never were they more happier than the day i saw them married compared to lily and james potter hermione couldntfathom how ever they would be on the same scale lily was so powerful powerful enough to stop an unbeatable wizard without ever lifting a wand and james he was a leader through and through inspiring hope and commanding respect in a way harry could never amount to with such histories hermione felt severely insignificant scarcely holding up her end of the comparison they would be proud to know that their son has a friend like you miss granger hermione swallowed slowly though she wondered how she was able her throat was so dry and she thanked him as she left the headmaster office she swore to herself that she would make them proud that she would never accept the absolute limit and that she would find every way and use every last ounce of herself to see that the son they never got to see that they died for made it out of this war alive they were the memories she treasure most memories that she told herself werentimportant all the while knowing that they d never leave the niche she d created for them in her heart and in her soul but the people in those memories no longer existed two she d seen die firsthand the others she was glad she hadn t but dead was dead and her soul was a little less complete without them they werentsimply names but faces she d seen in photographs and standing across from her at christmas parties they were people people with loves and interests and dreams and ends that had come before their time it was one of the few things that hermione granger just didntunderstand the people that surrounded her now had the same hopes and the same laughter the same light but the faces that sat beside her at breakfast or partnered beside her in charms they didntmatch the memories she treasured and did that mean her love in them was misplaced she knew she cared deeply for them but was it because of the people she d know before or because of the people she knew now and if it was the first was that a wrong reason to care for someone in matters of the heart she was substantially inept and that was why she found it so much easier to just close it off entirely hermione looked down at the lot of them and sighed a melancholy sound they would never understand she moved about quickly closing books and collecting scattered notes and doodles her footsteps were quiet her movements catlike and she considerately banished the crumb scattered dishes that should never have been near so many priceless books in the first place she frowned at lily who had chosen to use the rise and fall of he who must not be named as a substitutionary pillow and deftly removed the invisibility cloak from all of them folding it up and tucking it into james satchel she wiped the comical drool form sirius mouth with her sleeve and brushed back the thick bangs from remus forehead then she stole back away as quietly as she d come lily awoke to the sound of a female voice drifting back through the stacks she lifted her head to the sound and the page of the book she d been sleeping on stuck to her cheek pedia of the old ways come in yet yes it already on the shelf madame pince replied you ll be the first but lily didnthear the rest of the conversation james she hissed shaking the sleeping boys james wake up ungh he groaned and looked up blearily his bedraggled black air was smooshed all to one side gnhk lily assumed this meant good morning lily how lovely to see you this morning whatever is the matter and answered appropriately hermione here james was now wide awake and following lily finger with his eyes hermione was indeed standing at the front desk conversing with the librarian in surprisingly above whispering tones i thought the plan was to be secretive she jibbed while james moved to wake the other two lily stuffed their stack of notes into her knapsack and began banishing books what hermione doing here remus whispered keeping his voice low in its sleep husky tone what do you mean what she doing here sirius hissed you guys practically live here both of you shut up james hissed elbowing the two boys apart as they started to trade good natured punches she coming this way from their vantage point crouched behind the stacks they could see her curls touching her shoulders the head girl badge that shared the same initials as her name as she stepped aside and into one of the aisles sirius led them out of their hiding spot and they raced as silently as they could to the other side of the room the quartet froze when hermione cleared her throat they could see her face a moment before it disappeared she d magicked the library ladder over to her and was climbing up it to one of the topmost shelves pressed single file along the stone walls of the room the marauders held their breath as they moved down the way praying all the while that they could reach cover before the brunette decided to look around from her perfect view spot the click clack of her mary janes as she descended might as well have been a screaming child yelling run run now for the four escapees took off running for the exit they darted around the door then reopened it a crack to see how close their potential discoverer had been she was walking slowly head bent down over the now opened book that she had gone to such lengths to procure lily was the only one to see her close the book with an inaudible sigh and after a pregnant pause tuck it under her arm the redhead nose wrinkled in confusion and bewilderment at the signs she wasntsure she was seeing she looks so sad she whispered and then james was dragging her down the hall and to the relative safety of the potions classroom completed 3 21 05 7 00 pm posted 3 24 05 10 05 pm a n whew this is definitely a long one and hopefully it ll explain a lot of what going on and did someone ask for a fight sequence a n2 for the sake of ff being gay segments that are written as being crossed out or stricken through are underlined not the same i know the air between the two groups was uneasy a raindrop hanging off the edge of the roof waiting to fall and splatter across the pavement it was a problem that hermione had made clear would not be confronted or challenged but it was also too important to simply ignore this was far different than ignoring hermione chilling mood swings it was a decision about four teenagers fates the days that followed were tension filled a barrier in the air so strong even the emotionless hermione was affected by it she was jittery and skittish whenever she didntlook as if some rampant thestral had just run over crookshanks and her jumpy movements made any who approached her temporarily twitchy as well like her behavior was contagious harry and ron becoming worried of her increased melancholy agreed that the presence of the marauders should have been advantageous to her condition but the solution had a tiny flaw the marauders were never around they skipped meals were out until all hours of the night and up before the sun rose hermione had even once commented under investigation that lily and remus had been arriving late to arithmancy ron thought there was some sort of conspiracy and harry rationalized that if it had been him he would have been avoiding them like plague too both made it a point to be there for their friend with only one day left before the marauders were returned to their time the boys had teamed up to get hermione through her day without mishap losing herself in thought was becoming far too common for the head girl and she was often found wandering the halls with a dazed look upon her face most especially when she was supposed to be in a class she d refused to eat breakfast and was now sitting with dumbledore through the trio lunch break that was why harry and ron were sitting outside the tall gargoyle statue that guarded the staircase of the headmaster offices long legs stretched out before them they slouched and leaned against the wall idly bouncing a small ball of light back and forth to one another what the time going on now ron asked prompting harry to check the magically spinning watch he d pulled off his wrist and laid next to his knee blimey harry muttered knocking the ball back with a swat of his hand nearly an hour if she doesntshow soon we re all gonna be late for care of magical creatures old nutter said ron darkly cantbelieve she still trusts him harry just shrugged he wasnthermione nor could he fathom or explain what kept drawing her back to the headmaster door for advice and counsel the minutes ticked by to the odd snapping sound harry watch made as the animated hands chased one another around the circle chomping their jaws in anticipation stone on stone grinded out a painful squeal and boom show as the gargoyle lifted itself up and hobbled off to the side revealing an already spinning staircase harry staggered to his feet knees cracking from sitting too long on the unforgiving stones what was that about he asked brushing off his now dusty trousers hmm hermione blinked a few times before her eyes could lock onto his face without drifting or glazing she d stepped off the staircase and walked a good ten paces all without realizing either of them were there that right she was murmuring to herself you walked me here hermione she made a noise of startlement and looked back up at harry oh yes i asked what it was you went to see dumbledore about you wouldnttell us earlier she smiled and harry wished it was a true one oh nothing she said which seemed to be her answer for everything these days just some head business without malfoy ron asked he d banished the ball with a wave of his wand and was now standing as well i had a few of my own questions about the ball hermione clarified clearing a few things up you know ron and harry exchanged looks well we better hurry if we re gonna make it to ron can you do me a favor she asked ineterrupting him uh sure well you see she began as they walked i need someone to set up the entertainment for the ball maybe you could get fred and george to help i dontknow the person i had before is uh no good he groaned more in annoyance than that he was doing her a favor what lazy prefect am i covering for this time harry elbow connected painfully with his chest can you just do that for me thanks hermione said without waiting for an answer her pace had picked up hermione harry called out noticing she d started to wander again the entrance hall is this way wordlessly she changed direction and headed down the first flight of stairs on the way down to the bottom floor ron held harry back from following and punched him solidly on the arm what was that for harry exclaimed why d you hit me hissed ron because you were being an idiot as usual the dark haired wizard mocked she was talking about remus you ponce ron groaned and threw up his hands people need to tell me these things he griped the red head scuffed the floor with his shoes i still dontsee why she wontlet them fight with us against you know who you mean voldemort harry corrected blandly to which ron glowered at him she has a point though if one of them dies here but that the thing she also said they were still continuing to live in the past while they were living here like two bodies or something harry was surprised i didnteven remember that he confessed if that true then the body that dies here wouldntmatter would it or would that kill the body in the past ron made a face and harry felt a headache forming between his eyes i have no idea how any of this time traveling works harry sighed ron sighed too but hermione does you ve both done it but she been researching it since well before she performed the ritual i sure all we can do is trust her harry reasoned you can believe she researched this backwards and forwards if the marauders cantdie in this time then they cant die ron was fussing with his tie still that not to say they cantstay a while longer voldemort has no reason to specifically target them he doesntrecognize your parents you ve seen how good we are at changing her mind distractedly cracking his knuckles ron gritted his teeth in frustration if we can t then who can harry frowned a bit then said grimly the marauders ron eyebrows shot up into his hairline really you think so if they stopped avoiding her and us and actually set their mind on changing hers harry shrugged ron stopped walking harry lifting one eyebrow harry regarded his friend sudden stop with an odd inquiring expression what ron ron pointed down the grand staircase where all the shifting stairs could be seen straight down to the bottom and harry followed his gaze though not sure what exactly it was he was supposed to be looking at where hermione behind closed doors hermione faced off with the one who d pulled her off the stairway and into this abandoned classroom that smelled as if it had once been used as a potions storeroom with nothing but their soft breathing filling the room they could hear the low melancholy melody playing in one of the neighboring rooms most likely muggle studies remus if she sounded surprised it was because she was hey having carried out the actual act of yanking her into this classroom presumably to talk he d reverted back to the remus she d known as a child contemplative and careful in his speech instead of reverting to her original demeanor as well hermione newly established anxiety only got worse making her fumble over her words if it yesterday arithmancy notes you need i i have them right here routing through her satchel remus had to actual grab her hands to make her stop no no hermione i didntcome for no the aforementioned papers fell out of her bag and spilled in a mess across the floor hermione didntmeet his eyes and remus sighed and stepped back away dropping her hand it not like i ll be needing them anyway he murmured passively under his breath hermione ran a distracted hand through her hair look remus but he held up a hand stopping her attempts to explain herself or whatever she had planned on saying i sorry it wasntmy intent to argue that particular subject with you either he began digging in his own bag and hermione admitted that her curiosity was peaked not surprisingly it was a book he lifted up in his hands but it was not the kind of book she d have found in the library it was a journal dark tan leather with a tong clasp along the side that held it shut he held it out to her then and she actually feared for half a thought to take it then her own fingers curled around the edges and when he was sure she d firmly decided to take it he let go read it or don t it your choice either way i need it back by tomorrow the others dontknow i ve taken it or that i giving it to you but he stopped the busy work of re closing his satchel and just stared at the floor as if frozen by his own indecisiveness in words you at least gave us the respect to tell us of our future before sending us back it my personal belief that you should learn something in return hermione nodded what else could she do and slipped the book gingerly into her knapsack i have to go harry and ron will be looking for me with that weak excuse she pushed open the classroom door breathed in a long draught of fresh air and hurried off down the grand staircase only after she d left did remus realize that she d forgotten her arithmancy notes going down to his knees he neatly restacked them in their rightful order by the numbers inked into the lower right hand corner of each parchment he d leave them back in the common room for her when she came back from dinner he had reached the ninth in the series of notes on numerology in the 1800 s when he found the tenth page covering an odd bulge in the paper pile setting aside the notes he d already collected he brushed off the tenth page and uncovered a most peculiar thing an envelope he assumed it had merely gotten caught in the shuffle to hurry and get her notes out for him it wasntunthinkable that she kept a steady correspondence with her family or maybe it was that krum fellow he d overheard ron complaining about all those thoughts fled his mind as quickly as scuttling acromantulas when he turned it frontways and his own name appeared along the centre in hermione precise flowing script remus john lupin the letter hadntgotten caught up in the notes it had been planted there for him to find not even able to think about waiting to read it back in the common room remus lowered himself down onto the floor and after brief hesitation slid his finger beneath the flap breaking the wax seal harry and ron assuming hermione had gone on to class without them had to run the whole way but they made it to care of magical creatures just as the third bell was tolling not that it would have made much difference anyway hagrid wouldnthave taken house points hermione troublingly wasntthere lily james and sirius were though and they seemed just as anxious about their missing companion as the duo both groups looked around scanning the vast grounds with their gaze and even broke the stalemate to inquire if they d seen remus or hermione but hagrid drew their attention back to class as he started them on the long march into the forbidden forest to observe dryads neither gryffindor came hermione sat by the edge of the bath she d drawn up in the prefect bathroom and traced the diamond emblem embossed in the cover of the leather journal sitting in the lap of her terrycloth robe unhooking the tongs she brushed them off to the side and out of her way well worn parchment crackled under her fingertips as she dragged them along the edge before flipping open the cover the first page was filled with varying scripts though a majority of it was in remus handwriting at the very top in fact the first thing written was a single sentence all in capitals harry is james and lily son it was circled beneath it were various theories some crossed out and others with explanations scribbled beside them in the margins at a later date she flipped through the pages not really surprised at how much they d let slip or what the marauders had managed to garnish out of other people on their own the questions and speculations ranged from their own personal lives to obscure topics like what had ever happened to their crazy astronomy professor there was even one voicing the thought that perhaps she and remus were related someone had doodled a stack of books beside the words the journal was nearly halfway full of these writings but hermione stopped where she was and flipped back to the first page beneath the first line was a sentence declaring james and lily dead a bullet point beneath gave the evidence that harry had said himself he was an orphan remus and sirius were listed below as still being alive they hadntyet gone back and changed those hypotheses a quill materialized in her hand working itself into existence from the tip upwards dipping it into one of the ink wells that had appeared beside her she circled the first most line again and the bold green ink blared obtrusively out from within the all black page her hand then hovered over the next line james dead after a moment of silent deliberation she added two words murdered voldemort at an achingly slow pace as if her own hand sought to betray her three more words were forced out after the first two and they were the words she wished she didnthave to be the one to tell they read betrayed peter pettigrew she continued down the page as such crossing out the falsehoods with red and writing her own notes in the green it seemed to take forever just to finish that first parchment but when she had finished she realized that the process had been more than just putting words to paper the subject of those words had left her emotionally drained lily dead murdered voldemort betrayed peter pettigrew love for harry saved him destroyed voldemort sirius alive dead two years murdered bellatrix black fell through veil in department of mysteries remus alive dead 5 months captured voldemort set loose on muggles exterminated beside her the bath water had grown cold the single sheet of parchment was folded into thirds creases strict and harsh in their uniformity hermione letter had been written in dark blue ink though it only spanned the length of half a page leaning back against one of the desks he quickly began to read dear remus i writing this letter to you because i feel that you would be the one most receptive to what i have to say not only that but there is a more personal reason that i write this out of all the marauders you were the one i was closest to the point of this letter is this it is not for trivial purposes that i must send you back in fact my main motive is rather selfish when i knew you you and sirius were friends of mine lily and james people i admired and aspired to be like and for the past two months here the last line had been stricken out i ll probably never say this and you can see i finding it difficult to write as well but i care so very much about all of you as well as the people you become the altering of the timeline affects me a great deal less than the thought of losing those four people in my life and for that i do not apologize you trusted me when i was younger so trust me now it was signed with an h and nothing more he didntknow what to make of the letter it almost didntfeel as though it had been written by the hermione he knew but there the characteristic loop of her t that was hermione and that faint smell of vanilla that was dispelled into the air each time the folds crinkled that was her too still in a daze he reached for the envelope and another object slid out onto the floor it was squarish with a glossy sheen but only when he flipped it over did he realize it was a photograph there was hermione sitting at what looked like a dining table and though he realized it must have been taken when she was younger she looked nearly identical to the way she appeared now her bushy hair was as unmanageable as ever bound up in a pony tail and though one hand held a ridiculously burnt orange afghan knotted shut around her shoulders the other was typically holding a book she was reading open on the table there was something going on at the other end of the photo and when he turned to look he was stunned at what he saw there was ron and harry and him he looked so old his hair was a lighter brown and flecked with gray especially along the temples when his picture self turned to look at the picture taker he saw three claw scars stretching across the side of his face and far too many age lines for someone in their late thirties was this genuinely the man he turned out to be the one hermione and the others had truly known the photo was moving as all wizarding photos did and he paused in his thoughts to watch the scene that had been caught on film there was a cake sitting in front of his older self and he could piece together what was left of it to determine that it had once said happy birthday remus it was all chocolate and he was starting to salivate just by looking at it the pictured ron and harry kept trying to snag bites but the older remus proved quite possessive at the other end of the table hermione shoulders were shaking and it was quite obvious she was laughing shaking her head she licked the spoon of the frosting bowl sitting next to her and went back to her book what hermione had said had been true they had known one another and judging by the light atmosphere of the photograph they d been on better than good terms the photo was well worn and bore a stronger scent of vanilla that made his wolf senses tingle and him want to sneeze she must have looked over the photo just recently the back bore a line of hermione cursive march 10 1997 it had been taken only six months before their arrival through time his birthday and yet hermione had stated firmly that his future self was dead no wonder she felt so strongly about their possible deaths when his own had just occurred sometime during the six months prior he wondered if their arguments had brought up the image of his death in her mind remus decided he didntwant to know when at last hermione closed the book and set down her quill the bath beside her was ice and the candles had all melted down into their stands looking down at the pool sized tub colored a murky brown from the green bubbles that had dissolved in it by her neglect she decided a bath didntreally seem that soothing after all and pulled the drain it was late she knew that and she d definitely missed all her afternoon classes and most likely dinner as well she d have to owl the professors for her homework though she was pretty sure she d already done her astronomy up through sunday sighing she got dressed and when she left the bathroom it was with the journal tucked securely under her arm as she started down to the grounds for training with harry and ron her paces shifted between excited and hesitant a match to her conflicting mind she d already set everything in motion but was she prepared for whatever outcome occurred harry and ron sat on the two large stones beside the lake idly taking turns skipping smooth stones across the glassy surface night was beginning to fall and both cast wary glances to the castle lit up in the distance if hermione didntshow for training they d go for the map hey ron nudged him and harry stopped looking for new rocks to throw is that her harry looked back over his shoulder and felt an instant wave of relief the silhouette had caught sight of them and was now picking up their pace to a run bushy ponytail whipping behind them yeah he said that hermione they watched her run closer without any sign of slowing and when he realized she wasnt going to harry gave a shout and pulled ron flat against the rocks hermione still in her school uniform vaulted off the ground in front of them and after months of training in extreme gravity leapt high into the air spinning end over end arms folded tightly over her chest and legs pressed flush against one another she cut short ron annoyed show off flinging one arm out and flooding the clearing before her with light show yourselves harry and ron exchanged looks as if to say has she gone mental then quickly scrambled off the rocks to stand beside her serving as backup for whatever ghosts she d imagined then movement flickered in shadows behind the illuminated trees that lined the edge of the forbidden forest and both boys went into high alert wands appearing and bodies in position to attack faces and then bodies moved out of the forest cover and stepped out into the clearing the blinding light obscured their faces hermione herself looked menacing the light that hid the intruders features found every line and bend in her face and filled it with shadow set with the grim expression she wore and the raw power streaming from her fingertips she was a fear inspiring sight to behold hermione closed her fingers then and so too went the light leaving the clearing illuminated only by the power of the sinking sun remus james sirius and lily stood in a line before them each three paces apart your presence is no longer required here hermione told them lily stepped forward yes it is we re not going to let you send us back remus swore stepping up as well ron felt hermione stiffen beside him and cast a sidelong glance her way but her eyes were narrowed fiercely oh really her mocking tone was cold and flat we ll fight you if we have to but we re not leaving sirius said and hermione fixed him straight in the eyes prove it if there had been something to say that would have spurred them on that was it for even as she spoke all chaos was breaking loose from behind each of their backs the four teenagers produced a weapon as well as the wand that appeared in each of their hands at the first glint of steel hermione was shouting out orders to her own fighters a cacophony of roars rose from the forbidden forest as ron called the creatures of the wood to his aid and the marauders scattered to keep their backs from the forest lily ran for high ground where she could better use her bow remus took up a stance on the edge of the clearing with his staff james and harry circled one another with their swords testing the other and sirius came straight for hermione she dodged once twice then leap frogged over him as he lunged for her she was taunting him he knew knew that there was a mocking smile hidden just behind the firm serious lines of her face hermione dodged again prancing backwards a step than darting just out of reach again all without ever trying to land a hit then sirius saw his opening and as she was jumping back to avoid a kick he pushed off hard with his grounded foot and punched her hard in the stomach she took to the air like a ragdoll out of a slingshot his magical strength propelling her across the clearing she hit one of the sitting rocks along the water edge with an explosion of dirt and rubble and when the smoke cleared around her sprawled body a crack wide enough to slide a galleon through had split the stone in two as sirius advanced on her unmoving body harry and ron were experiencing problems of their own while harry would always be his better in swordsmanship james courage proved infallible urging him to take risks and attack maneuvers that didntpromise a positive outcome but while his twin continued to fight him physically using his ability on himself he was also turning his inexplicably mastered power on harry who felt his own bravery faltering blocking a downward swing from james harry held him back as his wand came up in a split second movement and exploded the ground at james feet knocking him off balance harry leapt upon the opportunity and brought his sword down to pin him but not only was james already rolling out of the way with an agility he had hitherto not possessed but harry was brought down by one of lily enchanted arrows that pierced him perfectly above the heart with magic not iron with lily watching his back as well remus had launched his full powers upon ron who was now struggling to focus and control the wild beasts that were now circling them both where the three most powerful abilities of the seven had obvious uses for evil the lesser four had found their powers darker sides to be more hidden more sinister sirius could melt muscle and shatter every bone with a single touch james could suck every last drop of courage from a body and fill them with such fear that it either paralyzed or killed them lily could cut off the flow of blood in a person and completely stop their heart from beating and he remus could fill another head with every awful horrifying truth millions of voices driving them to insanity he used this power to dredge up the truths ron had tried to forget feeling all the more evil for his was a personal violating attack he chose to only scratch the surface stealing ginny prefect badge failing advanced potions but when one of the grindylows bit down on his jeans he was forced to go a bit deeper throwing both hands out voldemort was growing stronger they were losing the war all these he coupled with horrifying images that brought ron down to his knees a pair of unicorns whinnied from the fringe of the forest and reared up shaking their silvery manes they came back down pacing fretfully across the dirt before one became so distressed that it stopped trying to decide what ron was attempting to tell it and galloped into the unsuspecting remus sirius dodged a round house from hermione and was startled to see when he straightened two balls of fire hurtling towards him he rolled out of the way and though he missed the fire attack he was caught on his knees when the lake reared to life and with a swing of hermione hand crashed over the lip of the clearing in a giant wave of frothing water sensing what was coming next a waterlogged and sputtering sirius barely got onto one of the sitting rocks before a bolt of lightening crashed down onto the flooded clearing and made all the water boil and crackle with conducted electricity you ve been practicing hermione was levitating herself flying above the dangerous waters so as not to endanger herself before the electric current wore out and seeing sirius appearing helpless stranded on his rock she swooped down on him arms outstretched for his throat too fast for her to react to the dark haired wizard had grabbed one of her forearms ending her levitation and was throwing her over his shoulder with a shriek of surprise her free hand found his hair and her nails sunk in pulling them both down into the electricity charged waters lily arrow had brought a splitting pain to his head and most of his left side was now numb but harry still fought on with his wand sword hand now hanging uselessly at his side he swept james legs out from underneath him as he charged and shot a stunning charm at his back a last minute protego deflected most of the attack but james was still disoriented as he got to his feet as his opponent tried to get his bearings back harry decided it was time to us his own power the bow was taught the glowing arrow held perfectly straight between her fingers and her eyes were sighted perfectly down the shaft but lily was suddenly finding herself unable to fire all her attention was focused on the heart beating so loudly within harry chest she wondered how no one else could hear it and then it wasn t her aim was shifting with her attention and the person she was now sighting to hit was james a thought was worming its way through her consciousness telling her to shoot and she had a feeling that the thought made perfect sense but she loved james she would never want to hurt him her own thought was barely a whisper as her fingers slipped off the feathers of the arrow and she let it fly james the word that she d had to force from her lips barely reached her love in time he twisted to the side and the magical projectile missed his heart and struck him in the shoulder instead both potters were now on their knees remus struck ron in the stomach with the side of his staff but with only one good arm it was barely enough force to knock the wind from him the unicorn ride had left him with a dislocated elbow ron temple bleeding from an earlier strike to the face sent a swarm of snakes upon the other boy having found the magical beasts were harder to control while remus was invading his mind they wrapped themselves around his legs causing him to stumble back and only maintain standing by using his staff to brace himself with the hissing and biting of the snakes non poisonous but still painful ron threw up his wand and shouted the disarming spell sending remus staff spinning into the woods you cantbeat voldemort without us remus sent the thought screaming through the red head mind and at ron yell of pain the snakes fell to the ground and scattered the brunet accio ed his weapon back and directed it hurtling towards ron whose shabbily constructed bombarda shattered the wooden instrument and rained the oak shards down upon himself splinters embedded painfully all along his arms which he d thrown up to protect himself ron collapsed from his knees to his side and laid half conscious on the grass remus haunting truths reshuffling through his head remus was unable to claim victory however for a glittering arrow had embedded itself in his back his body arched a soundless cry opening his mouth and then the sickness tipped arrow flickered and disappeared and he fell forward onto the ground a rush of fever already beading his forehead with sweat and draining out his strength a battered sirius and an equally haggard hermione stumbled around the clearing both clutching at the others throats not only was it hard for him to breath but hermione hands were channeling pure ice and frosted crystals were gathering around his frostbitten skin growing tired of their scuffle he directed his strength not to tightening the grip on her windpipe but on pulling her back slowly dragging her forcefully away hermione fingers slipped off of his neck and she clawed and scratched at the exposed skin in an attempt to resume choking him with a grunt he threw her to the ground and she bounced on the damp bed of wildflowers she growled up at him from her crumpled position and actually bared her teeth ferociously at him before he was thrown up into the air and then dropped as unceremoniously as she had been something cracked broken she gestured with a hand to repeat the action but this time he grabbed her first and before he was even five feet into the air he d launched her bodily forward like a shot put she broke straight through one of the solid evergreens lining the forest and disappeared into the dark shadows of the woods another crack marking her fall followed by the crash of the tree top half as it landed in front of sirius bisecting the clearing lily had had enough of being controlled and the headache only got worse as the amount of oxygen reaching harry brain lessened james weighed down on one side as the petrifying charm of lily arrow turned his shoulder and his arm to stone continued to clash swords with harry though the condition of them both made the fight a pitiful one sirius was hobbling over to help his fellow marauder and with lily spreading the numbing spell faster through his veins harry was running out of options as both his legs gave out he gave one last ditch front and exploded with raw power sirius had gained too much momentum to stop and so as lily jumped off her rock and flung herself right into his path he smashed straight into her with his full strength still raging they both went down but it was the petite frame of lily that went skidding across the grass like a skipping stone and rolled to a stop against one of the trees james body had turned completely to stone but as the gray cement crept up his neck he managed one last crack come on harry i can still take ya you wish harry slurred his mouth had gone numb with one last lopsided smile he fell onto his side and was unable to control the muscles that held his eyes open so he looked as if he d merely fallen asleep in the grass ron had fallen hermione had fallen harry had fallen lily was slowly picking herself up off the ground and sirius called an apology seeing as he was the only one still able to get to his feet he stumbled over to james the now nicely posed statue and performed the complicated counterspell as the stone chipped off of james face sirius heard something that made him whirl around it was lily strangled enervate and it was ron springing to his feet ron immediately counterspelled harry to return the favor of controlling lily to revive him and with a whistle was immediately astride one of the unicorns and charging straight into the band of survivors gaping at the quick turn of events sirius cursed harry loudly enough for the recovering wizard to hear and demanded that james de stone faster a quick blast from ron wand knocked sirius back off his feet but that was all the farther he got because in a daring maneuver lily had leapt up and tackled him straight off the unicorn the two of them tussling rolled down towards the lake where ron summoned merfolk were throwing rocks let switch partners shall we harry exclaimed in exhilaration as the fight got back under way true to his word he circumvented the still thawing james and leapt with sword in hand upon the prostrate sirius their swords met in a clash of sparks and screeching metal james counterspelled remus and burst free of the cement encasing his legs as the shorter boy came running up to aid him lily had ron in a choking position with her bow but his birds were swooping down and grabbing great clawfuls of her hair as the merchildren rained pebbles down upon her sirius had been disarmed but he was with his bare hands moving harry sword point away from his chest and tilting the blade to harry throat instead with a nod to one another the two remaining lifted their wands high in the air and charged down into the separate battles james to ron and remus to harry the air ringing with their adrenaline laced yells stop a seismic shock ripped through the ground churning the soil and uprooting the grass in a devastation ripple that tore apart the combatants and flung them across the ruined clearing from the shadows appeared a specter eerie in the soft glow it emitted and the shimmering sphere around it it took them all a moment to realize it was hermione drifting in her magically crackling bubble to the clearing center her arms were flung out like a cross and the blood of her beatings ran down them and dripped off her wrists like black teardrops the droplets hit the bottom of the energy sphere in which she was suspended and hovered there a moment before sinking through and staining the grass ebony in the darkening sky we are finished now she said and her voice boomed across the small space like it had been projected through a loud speaker the light around her flickered and she fell the short drop to the ground on all fours she convulsed pathetically and retched blood upon a bedraggled clump of dandelions appearing weaker than they d ever seen her the six sets of eyes watching remembered just how small a person she was she stayed that way head bent without moving then she cleared her throat without any rasp or catch and stood up to brush herself off as if nothing had happened ron was the one who thought to cast the lumos spell upon inspection from their relative positions they all saw that though quite bloody hermione face and all other parts were undamaged she moved to the edge of the lake and sent up a ball of light that was far more effective than ron pitiful glow and served to illuminate the clearing for them all looking at one another they were relieved to find each other unmarred as well in the heat of the fight they d forgotten about the decantalus spell the confusing part was that their fight had lasted much longer than five minutes i made sure to recast the spell when needed hermione explained reading their expressions she turned back to the lake and lifted a handful of water to her face pink rivers dribbled down her throat couldntlet the lot of you go back all black and blue just because you wanted to pick a fight they d all stepped up to the waters edge now and she could see sirius deeply engrained scowl we should all clean up wordlessly the others kneeled down alongside her and there was only the sound of hands splashing the water for a long time then remus voice broke over the sound of water hermione he made sure to get her attention before he pulled the slender box out of his pocket and handed it to you um call it a farewell gift hermione sat back on her haunches and regarded him stoically she took the box but said i thought you were going to stop me from sending you back adorably remus smiled at her though there was a line of dried blood across his nose that he d missed he shrugged just in case she snorted but pulled off the lid all the same the backs of her hands were still caked with trails of blood and there was dirt and worse stuck under her fingernails but her palms were relatively clean and as it was she couldntresist picking up the object nestled inside the modest white box it was a locket the linked chain was heavy and bore on its end a goodly sized oval shaped casing that promised to hold a picture within she opened the clasp and rather than finding a picture a light beamed out in front of her and like a little projection it played the same short scene over and over again it was the scene in the wizarding photo she d given him hermione watched it as if mesmerized and then quickly shut it again as if the extra eyes watching it made the gift and what it contained somehow less personal doing so she noticed the words engraved on the back i understand hermione pooled the heavy chain in her hand and closed her fingers around the precious locket thank you she whispered throatily and remus knew enough not to say anything in return or the moment would be ruined hermione cleared her throat and added in a low voice your book is over there uh she had to cough to clear her throat again on the rock oh he said what else was there to say okay hermione having pocketed the locket then shoved her arms under the water up to her elbow and deeming herself satisfactory got up and made ready to leave re sheathing her wand she fixed her hair and said without looking back you should all get to bed we have classes in the morning harry and ron ran up to her but lily and the marauders were left frozen almost as though they were afraid that speaking of it would make what had happened just disappear they exchanged shocked looks do you think really more looks does this mean we get to stay lily called out but hermione was already halfway up the long trek back to the castle the redhead turned back to the boys with eyes a bit wider than normal and said in a clearly dazed voice i guess we passed sirius of course took this moment to boast i told you i was right yeah bet there some pretty red faces in this lot padfoot you cantsee our faces lucky for you prongsie think of your pride stepping back from the light banter remus quickly jogged over to the rocks hermione had indicated and felt around in the weak light for the notebook he found the soft leather after a few seconds of groping and pulled the book into the protective confines of his jacket once it was secure he hurried to catch up with the others who d already started for home it was later that night when james had gone to check on lily and sirius was embarking on a solo kitchen raid when curiosity called to remus in the shape of the familiar journal he supposed he was just wondering if whether or not hermione had indeed looked at it but whatever the case he found himself leaning over his bed and digging the book out from one of the crates he kept there meticulously he packed his transfiguration homework away but really it was a vain attempt at distracting him from the temptation the book provided finally all that was left in his lap was the journal he undid the tongs but left it shut remus swore he was just going to open it to the middle of the pages to see if she d left her characteristic vanilla scent thereby proving she d read it with a quick jerk he opened it to a random page but got no further than that the page was filled with green writing hermione cursive disbelieving he flipped through the rest of the book and it was all the same he turned back to the first page his own name catching his attention and he was physically unable to stop himself from reading remus alive dead 5 months completed 03 25 05 10 50 pm posted 03 25 05 11 18 a n think i can finish tr in a week let go for it peoples the marauder belief proved correct when they were brightly awoken the next morning by hermione who seemed to be running late herself as she only stopped to shove coffee at harry before making her apologies and all but falling back down the stairs bare feet slapping on the marble steps while harry and ron satisfied their bad caffeine habit and a squeaking neville realized he d slept in the three other occupants exchanged stupefied looks as if they d half expected to be sent back in time while they were sleeping make that two occupants come on moony wake up sirius said loudly slapping remus bed the bunched up comforter deflated under his hand and through the blankets he hit mattress a rather unnecessary flinging of the sheets off the bed confirmed it remus wasntthere sirius made a face at james who only shrugged and began digging under his bed for trousers lily sweeping her bangs to the side in a barrette couldnthelp but laugh as hermione tried to run about the common room with what seemed to be her entire room on her back and get ready at the same time just when it looked as though she was going to head right out the door lily felt she had to speak up hermione the one girl disaster stumbled around and almost dropped her coffee eh lily pointed down shoes hermione looked down as well her stocking covered toes wiggling up at her if she had a free hand with which to slap her forehead she would have done so twice as it was she just sighed right hitching her satchel higher up on her shoulder and shifting her substantial stack of library books to one hand she might have actually tried to balance her cup on top of her head if lily hadntjumped in to save her with a wave of her hand hermione mary janes came whizzing through one of the open windows of the common room lily assumed because they couldntget through the password locked portrait the brunette tugged the paten leather shoes on with an amusing to watch little hop dance and then she was retrieving her beverage and downing quite a significant amount in relation to how hot it must have been what would i do without you lily hermione chuckled pushing open the portrait and stepping out into the tower hall lily quirked her head to the side the comment had been so odd hadntshe just been ready to send her back some fifty years shaking her head lily followed her out letting the still dozing painting of the fat lady drift softly shut hermione granger was certainly a puzzling character when they reached the great hall hermione excused herself from lily saying that she needed to get the homework she d missed from the professors the redhead smiled and went and took a seat beside remus who was already eating nose deep in his restrained monster book of monsters with a bit of a skip step hermione picked up her pace and with a rapid tip tapping had mounted the short flight of stairs that raised the platform from the rest of the great hall and was approaching the teacher table she waved to hagrid and was about to head for the opposite end when dumbledore caught her eye miss granger he exclaimed warmly lifting his drinking chalice in hello good morning professor she responded in kind with a short curtsy i trust everything is well i should be asking you behind those famed half moon spectacles his keen blue eyes were glinting with hidden knowing rumor has it the ever punctual head girl was absent from her afternoon lessons this day prior my apologies professor during lunch yesterday i seemed to have come down with something of a chest cold such things are common this time of year so i didntwant to bother madame pomfrey with something so trivial and after all it seems a little rest was all i needed dumbledore beamed that is good to hear i myself developed quite an itch in my chin just last ni albus minerva mcgonagall shushed miss granger is here to collect her homework i sure she said this with a pointed tone we mustntdetain her oh quite right quite right the headmaster crowed he smiled at the young girl again you ll forgive an old man his ramblings minerva here didntthink my itch was that serious but i think it might be a sign i coming down with a case of the polskies albus stop making things up minerva hissed jabbing him sharply with her elbow really quite inappropriate behavior for a headmaster of hogwarts dumbledore winked at hermione and with a grin she made her escape down the table when she saw the professor she needed getting up from his place and moving to leave she picked up her pace once again and deftly slid herself into his path remember what lily said she told herself and in fact managed a true smile as he approached good morning professor snape her smile widened as he jumped a bit not having noticed her before did you have the baked ham this morning i heard it was particularly good what he snapped black eyes narrowing are you doing granger i was only making light conversation sir she insisted demurely snape flicked his voluminous black on black robes beyond him probably preparing for a good billow and sneered down at her with a particularly intense distaste five points for your cheek granger and a further five for needlessly detaining me from my work hermione bit the side of her tongue to keep from blurting out something that would without a doubt result in further point deduction from gryffindor or possibly detention instead she took a more serious approach one snape could connect with it is not needless in fact i need your assistance the glowering professor raised an eyebrow at this i seem to require silk worm chrysalises you must have some silk worm chrysalises he hissed snape eyes darted searching for any onlookers whose ears might have wandered from their own conversations yes two he regarded her with a dark countenance before his lip curled back in a superior sneer what project is the pet of the headmaster ensconced in now he said contemptuously hermione bristled her pride now pricked but again held her tongue an order experiment she told him in a voice hardly above silence experiment he snickered derisively no experiment requires something as rare as chrysalises silk worms no less fresh chrysalises she corrected you foolish girl hissed snape this is no mere parlor potion you re working on it sounds to me like dark there no such thing as dark magick hermione interrupted only magick more powerful than others he finished with a smirk you ve been talking to dumbledore hermione was getting impatient the chrysalises i have not heard of any potions experiments for the order and i sure you d be the first one they d contact sir she told him tersely but as of yet no one in the order knows about it in fact you are the first so in fact you have heard will i be forced to take more points from your house granger or has your tongue tired from its impetuous wagging he threatened with all due respect professor you do not seem to be a man who could be forced to do anything he does not wish to do hermione said truthfully snape stared her down folding his arms into the folds of his robes and attempting to intimidate her with his superior height and stance hermione didntbudge though he hadntresponded well to her attempts at cordialness she respected the man enough to at least be truthful impertinent girl he said finally the reasons for albus favor in you are clear hermione fists clenched but she needed those chrysalises again she said nothing i will inquire with the headmaster of your request he sneered i need them tonight she said no you don t while foolish you are far from the incompetence of longbottom if you couldntget the ingredient from me you d leave yourself enough time to get them by other means i dontknow what you ve heard professor but i cantsay i have other means the next hogsmeade trip is two weeks away she said do not insult my intelligence granger snape answered darkly i will speak with you tomorrow with a whipping of his robes over his shoulder the tall potions professor stalked around her with bat like billow of black clothes and a sinister scowl and descended through the great hall side door into the dungeons blending in perfectly she thought with the dark dank shadows and fly stuck cobwebs collecting herself she turned on her heel and marched smartly down the stairs and to the gryffindor table where the rest of the boys had already arrived and begun eating what was that all about with snake ron asked through a mouthful of hash browns as she sat down across from him making a face at the disgusting display she set down the platter she d just picked up deciding she didntwant hash browns after all and moved instead to grab a few pieces of toast oh nothing she said and harry frowned just out of her line of sight she bit down and scrunched up her face cold she detested cold toast we re going to need to get ten points back by the way she told the group with a napkin wiping at her mouth as she finished chewing nice going ron complained and hermione stuck out her tongue at him you re wearing a ribbon hermione laughter died off and she looked at remus for it was he who had spoken with a look of confusion excuse me the brunet smiled kindly and pointed to her hair you ve put a ribbon in your hair i just noticed a hand went to her hair automatically where she d tied a bow of soft blue ribbon around the rubber band that held back the front of her hair oh she said rather lamely embarrassed that she d forgotten i just had some of it lying around so remus chuckled should i take it out she asked putting a hand to her hair again she made a face i look silly donti no no he insisted waving his hands in front of his face leave it it very pretty hermione flushed and lowered her gaze oh um thank you she turned back to her plate lifting her golden goblet to her lips to try and cool the unfamiliar heat that was rising in her cheeks by the second remus coughed and when she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and over the rim of her glass she saw that his face was almost completely hidden by his care of magical creatures textbook over the pages remus watched her reach across the table for the milk pitcher and as she did so a glimmer of gold spilled from the open collar of her blouse you re wearing the locket he murmured remus didntthink she d heard him but she immediately answered hmm oh yes well it very beautiful she told him cupping the tail of the necklace in her palm instead of allowing the blush to rise in her cheeks again hermione turned to wit instead and it was given to me by a good friend whom i care a lot for so it is an honor for me to wear such a gift she cast a sidelong long at him through her lashes and he laughed softly at her cheeks rosy then he shook his shaggy head and picked up his own goblet what a handsome friend you must have to give you such a handsome gift hermione laughed loudly this time and let the locket fall back against her chest it is a pretty gift from a pretty friend remus attempted to look wounded calling a man pretty what a cruel heart you have hermione snorted a man are you she shook her head curls bouncing whose being the funny one now before remus could answer sirius had stolen away her attention with a call of her name hey hermione yes sirius was leaning over the table a bit his tie coming dangerously close to hanging down into the honey saucer you werentreally planning on sending us back were you all eyes were on her she was silent for a moment and remus could only imagine what it was going through her head then she smiled but to the lycan beside her it seemed to strain her eyes a smile not quite real no she said softly and that was it no ron exclaimed dumbledore wouldnteven let me go back to azkaban to retrieve the return ritual hermione explained i dontthink you needed it james told her honestly i think you could have sent us back a wane smile you overestimate my abilities and my memory without the ritual there was nothing i could do that what you were talking to him about harry questioned to this hermione murmured an apology i know your feelings are less than amiable for the headmaster but you should know that he is obsessively persistent in doing whatever is in his power to keep me out of azkaban again hermione told her best friend in a voice that was itself less than amiable remus could only watch as the young girl who d just moments before been teasing him and getting embarrassed over so silly a thing as a hair ribbon began to retreat receding away like the midnight blossoms of nightshade as the sun crept over the horizon he wanted to intercede to stop the conversation that was having such a negative affect on her but for all the gold in gringotts he couldntthink of a thing to say of course he should harry exclaimed you dont want to go back do you hermione remained seated but she seemed in that instant to grow three feet taller if you had been there you would not throw such a question so carelessly about her voice even as stone would have slapped its way across harry face if it d had the hand to do it if you could have seen harry face in that moment your heart might very well have broken it was hermione heart that did or so it looked her posture deflated her shoulders hunching and her eyes finding their way down to the silverware i sorry she whispered i didntwish to fight with you you re different hermione her head snapped up in shock but harry was looking down at his hands you hardly sleep hardly eat and every time i talk to you i have to wonder if your telling me the truth what do you hope to gain by keeping everything a secret what can be greater than everything you re losing to it you think you have to take everything on your shoulders to take care of everyone but you re killing yourself because of it what happened to my best friend whatever this was it seemed a long time in coming harry did meet her eyes this time but he could be as emotionless as she and it was hermione whose face was red and her hands trembling she stood up with such suddenness that the tabletop rattled and the bench scraped backwards with lily and remus still on it i ll just stop pretending then shall i she said hotly her hands were clenched so tightly into fists that they shook at her sides with a fierce yank she ripped the pretty blue ribbon from her hair and wiped what little lipgloss she d worn from her mouth with a napkin she threw both upon the table in front of harry whose face now clearly bore his shock if you dontmind she said curtly reaching up to grab a hold of the chain around her neck i ll keep my gift with her free hand she scooped up her satchel and stepped back over the bench if you ll excuse me i d rather not finish this in front of everyone unlike you i dontbelieve our personal problems deserve an audience she walked vehemently out of the great hall without a single look back harry was staring hatefully at the tablecloth hoping any minute it might burst into flames then he shoved back from the table and stomped off in the opposite direction ron looked absolutely sick lily and the others positively shocked remus had made up his mind he may not have been able to say anything to prevent the scene from happening but he was sure as hell going to try and make it better snatching up the forlorn ribbon he ran out of the great hall waving off his friends confused outcries he found her sitting beneath the large willow tree he and the other marauders had so often occupied in their own time as he approached he watched her vent her frustration on the innocent river rocks that had washed up on the edge of the lake with one hand she motioned them flinging up into the air and with the other she pulverized them into irreversible specks of dust nice shot he commented quietly taking a seat on the grass beside her one of the first tricks i learned she replied with this curse remus drew one knee up to his chest making himself comfortable now that he knew hermione wasntgoing to try and blow him up next that no curse he said lightly i know curses and let me tell you that my friend is no curse what do you want she demanded never taking her eyes off the rocks his attempt at lightening her mood had failed most miserably i came to listen hermione snorted in contempt you mean you came to talk nope remus merely shook his head i said what i meant i here to listen she looked sharply at him and it was the first time she d even looked at him at all since he d gotten there then she went back to what she was doing with a frown then your wasting your time you wonthear much of anything you re talking arentyou he pointed out plop the stone hermione had flung up had been neglected and left to fall back into the lake there was a disgruntled tremor in the water as the giant squid protested to having things flung at it but then the lake was calm again and the two teenagers had nothing left to look at but each other what did you think you d come here and be all perfect and supportive and i d just pour my heart out to you she accused in a murmur good try but you re out of luck remus just raised his eyebrows hermione scowled oh you re just gonna sit there and listen i forgot remus didntsay anything if she wanted to be mad at him then she could go right ahead he didntcare if all she needed was someone to sit there and serve as a target for her anger then that was what he would do for as long as she needed him to he watched her blow up rock after rock with patient silence then on the next round instead of the usual shower of rubble a sparking fireball flew from her palm and arced up into the air landing after the plopping pebble with a sizzle into the water hermione was staring down at her hands as if they d somehow betrayed her who is he to judge me she whispered suddenly her forefinger traced the lines of her palm remus said nothing it not as though wanting to protect people is the worst desire to have she wrapped her arms around her legs and set her chin down between her knees i did it all for him and ron ginny neville luna and now you four as well she didntcry but there was still a cloud of utter sadness about her choking the air around them who will help the helpless protect the guardianless who if not me there is a threat here that needs to be faced stood up against so i am to be punished for doing what is needed what is necessary i do what i have to and i suffer what i must because if i the only one who has to then it all worth it she turned her head to look at him her small face buried in a mountain of tangled curls she smiled despite herself at his devoted silence and murmured thickly you can talk now if you d like you can be a listener and a talker he shrugged and turned to face her a little better i have nothing to say she scoffed softly at this though he was glad her anger had dissipated and now it seemed her sadness was lifting too nonsense everyone always has something to say about anything remus smiled all be it a bit lopsidedly hermione smile widened a stitch i a funny girl you know she told him softly you might not have noticed i noticed i just saying because not a lot of people do i sure you re wrong i not hermione looked out across the lake and remus sighed picking his words carefully he said i think you should tell harry what you told me just now hermione actually laughed at the absurdity of the thought that whole speech i wouldntget a whole sentence in before we started arguing she sighed and tucked a wind swept lock of hair back behind her ear no harry isntthe listener you are remus remus shrugged he could be you donteven know us her words hurt they cut especially more deep because he knew them in his heart to be true swallowing slowly he said look at the back of the locket hermione did as he asked and once again read over the words engraved there she shook her head with a bittersweet smile and what is it you understand he caught her gaze and held it everything not me she said you donteven know half the things i do i donthave to remus said simply i understand anyway it doesntmatter what you do or who you become just read the back of the locket remus he opened his fist above his head and the ribbon she d thrown down at breakfast unfurled into the cool air they both watched it flutter bravely in the light wind you are a remarkably ridiculous gryffindor was what she said remus rolled his eyes but took it as a compliment and scooted over in the grass so that he could tie the ribbon back into her hair her breath was hot against his arm as he worked to duplicate the perfect bow she d had earlier and he too was aware of how close they were together there he said when he was satisfied he lowered his arms but was still kneeling beside her if we hurry we can still make it to transfiguration on time hermione took his outstretched hand and he hauled her to her feet hermione sought out harry to partner up with in class and though he couldnthear what they were saying over james loud boasts of his mad skills remus hoped she d found the words to help him understand it was a tense time for all of them and patience was wearing thin on all counts lily herself seemed particularly on edge as halloween approached though he couldntfigure out why he did know one thing though no matter what she d said in the great hall hermione had fully intended to send them all back she wouldnthave written the letter otherwise why hello to all you conscientious readers who doesntlove a good bit of trivia can anyone remember why hermione might have spare blue ribbon lying around go super sleuths go completed 3 30 05 10 25 pm posted 3 31 05 3 26 pm computer note oh geezus while i was

ignoring me if you re looking for hermione she not here lily was leaning over the balcony banister of the girls staircase the ink well in her hand giving the suggestion that she d run out while doing her homework and just recently gone to fetch more or she not here harry added nonchalantly as if that had been his second guess all along where is she it was ron who answered surveying the chessboard as his little sister struggled to comeback tongue jutting out of the side of her mouth not knowing she d lost ten minutes ago with remus in the library ugh she always with remus harry whined and the library so far you re a woman you know that james called from the window seat apparently harry hissyfit had woken him from his nap we are not related why did you need her lily stopped halfway off the bottom step and having finally gotten a good look at him started to laugh what did you do blushing bright pink he tugged ineffectually at the black knot cutting off the circulation in his neck i d tried to figure it out on my own what how to make your own noose she exclaimed with a laugh the pink flush deepened to a hearty red and harry glared at her at having been so easily embarrassed no i dontknow how to tie a bowtie he grumbled i need hermione to teach me how before the ball because once she harry jerked his head in ginny direction gets her claws into hermione i wontbe able to get her to help me lily stepped up and using her superior fingernails got the black cloth unwound from his neck and harry took a few grateful breathes you never asked me if i knew how to do it she said after looking quite put out with her fists on her hips you do harry asked hopefully no she laughed but it polite to ask still laughing she headed back her seat beneath the window where all her books were spread out and a riled harry made several faces at her turned back before james shot him a threatening look and for his own personal safety harry moved to put the couch and most of the common room between them holding the black strip aloft harry cleared his throat and shouted quite unnecessarily does anyone here know how to tie a bowtie a chorus of no s and the continuingly theatrical harry looked as though he were one step away from hurling himself off the astronomy tower the library is like two whole floors away he bemoaned throwing a hand to his forehead in a woe is me manner why are we dressing like muggles for this again ron asked checkmate over ginny cry of despair at being beaten for the twenty seventh consecutive time a door slammed from up the boys dormitory staircase though that didntgain nearly as much attention as the loud decree that followed seconds after ladies avert your eyes my stunning good looks have been exceedingly reinforced and the resulting sexiness is not for the faint of heart padfoot what in the blazes are you doing james shouted up sirius had donned his ball tuxedo for whatever reason that was unbeknownst to everyone else and was now sitting on the railing of the stair balcony finely pressed pant legs dangling he d actually braided the back of his hair and so tightly in fact that with his messy top hair and bangs he looked just like james from the front and in that sense harry too the names black he said suavely sirius black just what we needed lily sighed with a shake of her head another potter why are you wearing your suit james asked giving the clearly looney teenager a bizarre look because i wanted to try it on said sirius in a child like voice he attempted to look bashful and by his very nature failed miserably hey sirius harry cajoled wandering over you want to help me tie this dontyou waggling his eyebrows sirius popped off the pre formed bow and waved it teasingly in the air clip on mate harry groaned and when i do this he pressed some hidden device with an ease that made it embarrassingly obvious he d been practicing and the bowtie started spinning madly around like a berserk sneak o scope ta da james shielded the side of his face as if he were declaring no affiliation with the escaped mental patient sitting on the banister and the only retort lily could think of was you re an idiot lost in sirius world of madly pretty spinning shiny things he sighed wistfully i love muggles now purposefully trying to strangle himself harry dragged himself across the common room stopping only long enough at the portrait to declare that he was hunting hermione down and would be back eventually harry walked straight to the back of the library knowing already that the incorrigible bookworm would allow no other table to support her research than the one the three of them had first used to save hogwarts before it had become routine to do so obviously the large oval table was tremulously sustaining a mountain of books methodically stacked and probably organized in some inane but particular fashion leaning against the table leg was hermione seam popping satchel its blue ribbon tied to one of the rings on the side and beside it was remus equally well worn looking carrier bag what he didnt see was either library goer a thought struck him then and it was so absurd at first consideration that he almost completely dismissed it but of course he d fought an epic battle with his tie and witnessed sirius obvious mental deterioration so why couldntsomething equally absurd include hermione reeling the thought back in like a fish given too much lead harry realized how very possible it actually was were hermione and remus snogging in the stacks covert mode harry looked hastily around then pressed his body against the nearest book shelf he began serpentining his way through the shelves peeking discreetly around corners and humming the muggle theme song of mission impossible under his breath when he did find them and without their noticing covert mode harry was sorely disappointed they were sitting side by side at one of the smaller tables positioned under the window their backs to the beam of sunlight logging the sun position on their astronomy charts not only were they not snogging but they didntseem to be doing anything at all they werenteven sitting that close to one another they were just studying grumbling about nerds through his teeth harry admonished his overactive imagination and banished it to a time out in the corner before reverting to his mild mannered alter ego civilian harry and walking up to the table upon hearing his story and chiding a snickering remus who couldntcontain himself hermione sighed and agreed to a quick demonstration her quick demo as she d termed it had to be repeated twice more before harry could do it all from memory swearing he d name his first born after her hermione shooed him back to the common room threatening that if he didnt stop interrupting her work with such trivialities then he wouldnt have a neck to wrap his bloody tie around when harry was finally well and gone she turned back to her work but not before a hand sought out her own beneath the concealment of the table feeling utterly lavender ish in her mind but aflutter all the same their fingers interlocked and his thumb resumed its earlier idle motion of ten minutes ago across the back of her palm neither said a word fearing that to mention it would make the gesture lose its innocence or that calling such open attention to it would fill the amiable silence between them with awkwardness who could say as it was hermione resumed her schoolwork with renewed zeal and a tiny uncontainable smile playing on her lips let get out of here sirius complained tiring of trying to balance his quill point down on his nose let go do something james looked down at the potions homework he really didntwant to be doing and then over at lily who d fallen asleep on the couch her half open book was held open by her knee though it was precariously jutting out over the edge of the cushions then back to his crumpled textbook pages bleh alright pads i ll get the cloak you lead the way when she d discovered how late it had really gotten and informed remus that she had some extra energy she was going to expend by training hermione was pleased when he offered to accompany her repacking their things and placing books no longer needed back onto their respectful shelves they extinguished their lanterns and left the library past the long unmanned desk of madame pince how late do you think it is hermione shrugged her shadow on the dimly torch lit walls distorting after ten eleven maybe past your bedtime he teased and she snorted if it past my bedtime she said then you re a merman remus pouted his steel eyes shining in the flamelight i heard the sarcasm there i ll have you know being a merman has always been my dream hermione smirked and raised an eyebrow but no just go on and dash it i just did crushing my childhood hopes you know he continued he probably would have kept going too if hermione hadntpunched him solidly on the arm ow he exclaimed she shushed him that hurt he cried in that same loud voice that was sure to draw peeves only when hermione threatened to hit him again did he lower his volume you punched me remus said with all the disbelief he could muster stuffed into that one word you deserved it she shot back remus shushed her this time all be it a bit more dramatically and she glared at him watch yourself when we get outside she threatened or i might just hex off something important crossing her arms haughtily over her chest she picked up her pace and left remus behind her the hard heels of her mary janes had a furious melody against the stone floors as her strides became more forceful remus laughed and shook his head he caught up with her again once they d gotten through the large entrance door upon which time they both gravitated towards one another at the sudden wave of freezing weather and temperamental wind hermione did as best as she could stepping slightly ahead of remus she lifted her fists up to shoulder height and channeled her magic as she flung her fingers out simultaneously the weather harsh attack on them lessened somewhat as if they were feeling it through a thinly woven screen door and they both deemed it tolerable enough to continue on still mad at me he asked with a grin hermione only response was to turn up her nose and ignore him she nearly never acted this way but it felt good teasing and joking and laughing were a rare precious occurrence in her life a glance out of her eyes caught remus pout and her shoulders started to tingle smile he commanded he clapped his hands together as if expecting a prompt response easily maintaining a stoic face she gave her walking companion a blank look worthy of a slytherin i can tell you re smiling on the inside he said nodding knowingly hermione laughed but to cover up for her failure in maintaining a straight face she nudged him with her shoulder and he slid sideways in the damp grass he shouldered her back and the ground squelched beneath her shoes both of them were grinning all out now as hermione shoved him and he tried to pick her bodily up he actually got halfway through the act and probably would have managed just fine with his lycan strength if hermione hadntbeen squirming like a possessed flobberworm remus john lupin she shrieked laughing put me down this instant he lost his grip on her and she collapsed to the grass but remus wasntso lucky slipping backwards he went over the edge of the hill and disappeared from her sight shrugging out of her knapsack hermione crawled over to the edge careful not to let the slippery ground pull her down too and watched him somersault the last few yards and slid to a stop on his back her giggling died however when she waited but remus never got up he wasntmoving remus remus she started to run down the hill but only made it so far before her legs were pulled too far ahead of her and she was knocked back and slid the rest of the way down with her robe bunching up into her skirt her momentum dragged her farther down than he d gone and she had to dig her palms into the muddy ground to stop herself from drifting further scrambling up to his prone body wind howling in her ears but heart pounding in her chest she d almost reached him when he sat up hermione her limbs gave out and she collapsed from all fours onto the grass smelling musky and strong and rolled onto her back her head was reeling and the taste of blood had risen up from her veins into the back of her throat she felt him slid down next to her even before he reached out to touch her shoulder she smacked him hard you idiot she hissed furiously i thought you d gone and broken your neck covering her face with her hands she realized too late that they were covered in wet grass but ignored it anyway and tried to ignore too the uncomfortable feeling in her gut conversely remus was now sitting up beside her and seeing her perfectly in the darkness as he swallowed his shock you were worried about me he managed to strangle out i didntthink you cared that much he expected her to laugh or say of course but neither of them were really ready for the soft i do that breathed past her lips in a low voice usually saved for whispered words in the common room or dark shadows of the hallways not in some conversation laying wet and muddy at the bottom of a hill not hermione or remus took the initiative to break the silence that followed and after a moment the young woman turned her face away and stared off into the distance had it been the letter and the book his listening beneath the willow tree or did it go all the way back to when he d first gotten here and professor knoll had let slip just how extreme their memory altercations had been when had hermione begun thinking of what remus might have said to one of harry comments or how he would have launched into a lecture when sirius did something stupid when was his face the first thing in her mind when she woke up it seemed all so sudden and maybe the realization of how close remus had come to being sent back had played a part in the whole affair but as the cold seeped into her clothes all she could seem to recall was memories of remus that had before slipped through her fingers remus sitting beneath her window seat as she read aloud remus supposed love letter or so ginny said remus racing her to dada remus walking her back from a quidditch game remus had she really brought him to azkaban with her magic remus face staring back at her from the hospital bed the first thing she d seen remus at the prefect meetings remus climbing the oak tree with her remus boxers sitting on her dresser remus wolf calling out the beast of her power remus locket she was going nuts she decided somehow she d accidentally taken a polyjuice potion and since she d never executed properly before she must ve somehow slowly begun transforming herself in parvati she wasntsupposed to be thinking about boys especially not one boy but focusing on her studies and trying to figure out how to end the war not a tall order by any means yes that was it she was just going block out all the faces and all the smiles and just just not let it happen anymore hermione you re going to catch your death of cold lying like that we ought to go back inside hermione turned back her face to look at him and was met with caring gunmetal eyes remus was considerate and kind and there was no way hermione could just ignore him softly she said it your fault i down here anyway stupid marauders she added as an afterthought she sat up and remus started to laugh blades of grass had dried and stuck to her cheeks and along the line of her hair you look ridiculous he told her unsympathetically licking his thumb he tried to rub roughly at her nose like mrs weasley was fond of dosing but she swatted him off she couldn t she shouldn t but he was smiling and then she was smiling and wondering where the hell her self control had gone she let him brush the grass from her face her eyes doing a nauseating dance between his and her lap like they couldntmake up their mind between what they d rather watch and which was safer to remus her lips brushed the underside of his wrist as he moved to dislodge a blade of grass from her hair they both froze the hand that was so soft holding her own was now pressed against the side of her face and a healthy blush was rising to hermione cheeks wasntthis how kisses happened in the muggle movies she hardly dared breathe if they kissed what then would dates and cuddling in the common room follow she couldntimagine herself in the place of all those actresses she d watched in her summers and remus didntexactly fit the persona of dream date he d go back to his own time and forget all about her and whatever they might do together but she d be left in the cold future empty and alone and with all her bittersweet memories still intact remus would never live long enough to see his own memories restored and hermione would be the only victim after all wasntthat why she d denied her and sirius the chance or was it no it had to be or else she wouldnthave this ache in her heart with remus face so close to her own how could she say that now she was willing to throw the rules to the wind after she d turned sirius down their friendship would be over and irreparable damage would come down upon the marauders as she d known them but that didntmatter either did it sure things would be wrecked now but all it would take was a single spell to send them back to their time without a single memory of the future and still the same people they were before they were brought here hermione pulled her head back and remus quickly took the hint and retracted his hand she sighed there was certainly one of the reasons time travel was forbidden it was just too damn confusing to sort out but hermione stuck with her earlier instinct bad things would only happen if deeper relationships were allowed to be formed by anyone come on she said standing up i still owe you a few good hexes for sassing me remus recovered quickly sass i sassed not as the two teenagers headed for the clearing they werentwatching to see the two forms suddenly appear beside the oak tree a shimmering bundle in one arms catching in the half moonlight that was certainly worthy of passing on to lily james commented lightly clapping sirius on the back let follow em james rolled his eyes i dontwanna follow them it cold what if they try and do something again sirius demanded peeking through the foliage to watch them go they didnteven do anything this time james was clearly exasperated sirius shot him an annoyed glare look james reasoned neither of them are very easily involved and they know it wouldntwork out cuz of the time difference and stuff didntstop me from kissing her james jaw dropped and he gaped at his long haired friend as if he were some other entity entirely with a growl sirius pushed off the tree and stalked back up towards the castle he was betrayed and hurt but mostly disbelieving they d been her bloody rules let go he snapped i freezing my tail off when hermione and remus returned a little before midnight the group was crowded around the fireplace their customary seats and lily was just signing off on a very large package that had been delivered by a team of owls those are our dresses hermione said matter of factly and alerting the group to their presence do you want to see them lily exclaimed excitedly hermione laughed and held her hands palm up they were caked with mud and grass i should get cleaned up first the redhead nose wrinkled up and she muttered something about unladylike and for the sake of getting her shower sometime soon hermione decided not to reopen that particular argument just now still trying to keep her hands from touching anything she walked over to ron and asked him to dig the necklace out of her robe pocket blech hermione jane you smell like something worse than what the kneazle dragged in he said as he routed through her pocket thank you for the glowing compliment she huffed be careful i took it off for a reason you know ron gave her a rather viscous pinch through the soggy cloth of her robe and she jumped got it he declared when he pulled the gold chain free now both of you go shower before harry here gets physically sick it true harry apologized i very sensitive you know hermione made sure to leave a nice brown handprint across his cheek before heading into her room twenty minutes later when she was sure she d gotten all the nature off of her person she found that she was actually feeling rather exhausted grinning wryly as she ran a towel through her bushy hair she thought that maybe ron was right all that thinking was bad for her digging her most comfy flannel pajamas out of her bureau she pulled them on and was surprised to find that they were close to fitting her again she was slowing putting azkaban behind her propping open her door so that she wouldnthave to re enter the password hermione padded out into the openness of the common room when she came to a stop in front of ron he automatically reached to give her back her necklace but instead she held out her arms and pouted like a little girl he obligingly unfolded himself from the couch and got up to give her a hug i gonna head in for bed she said when they pulled apart she took her locket back and refastened it about her neck she moved to harry now and he got to his feet to give her a goodnight hug as well we ve got a big day tomorrow halloween actually hermione james voice stopped her sirius was sitting silently beside him we were just divvying up dates between the group he gave her a winning smile now i know you had your heart set on going with me but i already going with harry hermione hid her chuckles behind the cuff of her pajama top any preference james was careful to not let his gaze slid to either sirius or remus lily of course hermione laughed sorry you guys but she prettier than all of you lily laughed too tossing her wet hair back over her shoulder hermione brought her amusement down to a smile and said actually the heads are required to go together so i ll have to meet you guys there harry face darkened and he made a face i forgot he grumbled dontworry she said easily malfoy i can handle i ll ditch him as soon as i can and find you all but for now i going to bed as i sure the infamous marauders have devised something to consume the day tomorrow at this sirius finally seemed to perk up out of whatever slump he d fallen into and the three boys exchanged gleeful looks while lily adamantly claimed to taking no part in their childish games halloween would certainly be something to remember this year aw come on now super sleuths jenn was the closest but still not close enough a ribbon a shape is it not perhaps you might find the answer in one of the shape titled chapters from earlier completed 4 7 05 9 43 pm posted 4 7 05 10 15 pm a n yes it been ages but you d be surprised how long writing 1 667 words of an original story takes i already behind a couple thousand cuz of track and sickness looks sheepish just remember i not abandoning tr eta who knows i have the novel going on plus i just found out i have a stomach ulcer bleh i shall do my best to get it out in a week but now you see why this one took so long i had to do extra composition for it poetry no less enjoy it as thoroughly as i enjoyed writing it sunlight streaming in through the tower window infiltrated the sleeping senses of hermione granger and brought her out of her rest before her alarm could but that wasntunnatural sitting up she pushed the covers back and stretched her arms high up over her head music was filtering in from somewhere and the low rhythm of it began rising in volume as hermione neared total alertness every morning hermione melodic voice rasped a bit from hours of disuse while sleeping and she stopped to conjure herself a glass of water she sipped the cool liquid and then placed the already condensing glass on her bedside table the music began again and hermione climbed out of bed every single morning it the same i wake up and feel as though she walked to her window and looked out to where the sun was just beginning to light up the lake nothing even changed she slumped against the wall and drew the draperies across the cool window pane i ve got nothing to show for all the work that i do and each sacrifice i make nothing gotten better softly she closed the shutters completely blocking out the sunlight have i made some mistake my actions are futile a wreck a mess people still in danger but yet i digress as she sang she hurried across her bedroom to the glinting vanity table and fell into a graceful lounge upon the cushioned pedestal chair long legs trailing out over the floor to the side every single morning it the same i see your face in place of mine her fingers caressed the cool glass as her reflection shimmered and warped into a familiar face with sandy brown hair and warm gray eyes the mirror offers me a smile and i smile in return but still i decline the chance the possibility she splayed her hand over the mirror and remus face disappeared she was back on her feet the opportunity between us for something that could be much mooooooooore the crescendo died off and she found herself pressed against her bureau arms folded across the curved top laying her head down upon her forearms her curls spilled out in a sleep tousled mess around her face and her song dropped to a soft sad near whisper i feign oblivious then her hands found the spindle of ribbon she d left there and in moments the shiny blue trimming was woven around her fingers and draped around her arms but oh to hold you in my arms and twine you about me like this ribbon i gave you so long ago tied round your gift for quick recovery i wonder if you ve forgotten her voice softened thrown it away as nothing but it was something i think and it meant everything she smiled dopily and began to spin around and around she turned the skirt of her pale pink nightgown flying up around her in a swirling circle of soft cotton she wrapped her arms about herself and great spills of blue silk hung down around her as she danced and sang and there a softness in the way that you hold my hand our fingers interlocking in a silent promise to never disband like the rest of the world the unfortunate ones around who had nothing to hold to a loneliness so profound that i imagine life without you hermione fell back against her bed irreparably tangled in ribbon and threatening to be swallowed by the voluminous white of her bed sheets chestnut hair spread out above her like a tarnished halo and the little girl designed nightgown artfully posed as if her collapse had been choreographed she placed a hand against her cheek and dragged it down the line of her body until her arm was fretfully clutching at her stomach and i feel physically sick i say it doesntmatter but the words dontseem to stick tossing and turning with the music neurotic rhythm hermione finally relinquished her position and crawled to the edge of her bed picking up the topmost book of the substantially high stacked pillar she flipped idly through its pages eyes not stopping to read the inked lines books my companion you hid my fears so well i pretend lawfulness when it my heart voice i cantquell she clutched the book to her chest i strong enough in magic but not strong enough in love when you go back i ll be alone and still thinking of everything you ve forgotten the only one who hurt then she looked down at the book its well worn cover and musty smell denoting it as some ancient and most likely valuable text and threw it onto the floor the music crashed over the room in furious waves no i wontlet this happen the face reappeared in her mirror as she strode past it but she shielded her eyes from it and the image disappeared no i ll just fall back and revert as the song reached its finale hermione flung open the portrait door and raised her hands up above her crying out to what i used to be before you came alooooooong the final note hit and the music vanished hermione nightgown reverted to her red and green flannel pajamas and her luxurious curls were once again tangled frizzy knots her bed sheets became gold again and the blaring of her alarm clock echoed out into the eerily silent common room hermione face flamed to a brilliant scarlet as dozens of shocked eyes settled on her standing tangled in ribbon with her arms still ridiculously held aloft now sirius drawled standing up from his seat in one of the maroon wing backed chairs that w as a show stopping number black the door slammed shut with hermione on the other side laughing sirius looked up at james who d been posed on the boys dormitory stairs camera in hand i dontthink she likes the festivities we planned hermione was finally coaxed out of her room if only to put a stop to ron terribly awful crooning whatever spell the marauders had cast on the school causing him to burst out in a rowdy country song mid sentence hermione actual flung open the door and violently shook the redhead cowboy wannabe knocking him free of the spell put a cork in it ron she exclaimed and he flushed couldntyou have fixed his singing she demanded of the marauders hands on hips remus grinned that would have ruined the whole thing hermione pinkened as she looked at him for reasons obviously unbeknownst to the others and she sighed in relief that they hadntheard the rest of her musical outburst earlier alright she said anxiously you three have had your fun now no more singing for me fraid not pigeon hermione punched him but sirius continued we re not in control of this the spell picks its own singers victims you mean she muttered under her breath i dont sing on the contrary harry outburst voice like a nightingale you ve got eyes narrowing she wished for a sudden catastrophe to drop him dead on the spot die she hissed and pushed through them arms swinging at her sides hermione strode briskly to the portraithole ooh hermione hermione whirled around cheery 60 sish music was siphoning into the common room and the gryffindors inside began looking around in confusion when they realized what was happening they watched eagerly as harry stepped up onto the coffee table a leather jacket materializing over his t shirt ooh hermione he repeated and the frozen brunette looked horrified pulling down the large black shades that hadntbeen there before harry looked at her debonairly over the rims ooh listen up here and just like that a dozen more voices were added to harry baritone and a wave of magic rolled over the common room turning it into a 70s bedecked penthouse the beats are alive and school positively lyrical harry sang and everyone singing it hogwarts the musical the common room roared a spotlight blared on over ginny who d climbed up onto the balcony of the girls stairs with her shiny golden go go dress and firecracker hair sweeping down over half her face she flung up a hand and took her solo stop and drop everything she pointed her finger and rolled her hips leaning over the railing the spell a coming for you eats you up spits you out and guess what you re gonna do seamus jumped up onto one of the couches and flicked up the long collar of his paisley shirt james gave the other singers a smoldering look beneath the spotlight and strummed at the guitar hanging over his knee matching the odd music that seemed caught between two decades you re gonna sidle on up to the guy playing bass get all dolled up lily dressed in a svelte lounge singer dress rang out in her soprano as she came down upon james leg propping up her elbows on her knees and pick up the pace cuz the music turnin up and the mood electrical harry picked the song back up again the room joining in at the chorus get on your dancin shoes cuz it hogwarts the musical the walls are shaking the volume gettin higher sirius bass came from the chair in which he was suavely lounged add your voice to the mix another member in the choir came remus near tenor he was sitting in front of sirius chair bright blue shirt rolled up to his elbows and red tie knotted loosely and wrapped in his hand the portrait door was flung open and students from all the other houses began pouring in presumably having been drawn in by the spell while walking the nearby halls get your props and find your pitches cauuuuse there nothing better than rocking wizards and witches harry finished a snap of his fingers started off all his back up singers snapping as well and he hopped off the table like a predator stalking his prey harry closed down on her snapping but hermione was backing out of the tower the dancing singers followed her en masse the music followed too the high beat slowing down harry grinned his lopsided smile and began his own solo it halloween day and it may seem trivial but let start singing hermione couldntstop herself and she answered him in her own rich alto it hogwarts the musical in a loud poof everything was restored the hufflepuffs ravenclaws and gryffindors were laughing and cheering the good fun and the slytherins looked disgusted and high tailed it out of the hallway hermione herself groaned as her friends bore down on her laughing and teasing it was going to be a long day they went to breakfast only to walk in on pansy parkinson dancing on top of the slytherins table and both she and draco sitting on the bench in front of her singing the horrendously terrible muggle song barbie girl you can brush my hair undress me everywhere imagination life is your creation i a blonde bimbo girl in the fantasy world dress me up make it tight i your dollie pansy sang in what might have been a seductive voice if her pitch wasntan entire scale too high and tossed her long hair around and around you re my doll rock n roll feel the glamour in pink kiss me here touch me there hanky panky the hall was in an uproar and hermione swore if she heard malfoy say hanky panky one more time she could die happy fortunately james had appointed himself the official documenter of this momentous occasion and was taking pictures like mad while dean thomas and a ravenclaw reenacted the display on top of the hufflepuff table hermione had to admit it was a good idea dumbledore waited for their epic musical finales before standing up to give his morning announcements he was chortling to himself and looked to be enjoying the marauder handiwork just as much as everyone else except maybe the slytherins my my he began wiping at his eyes i must say that this year halloween festivities have been quite enjoyable thus far an ingenious use of talent of course i wontdelay you much longer from your meal but i wished to remind you that the halloween ball begins at eight the music was light and childish in its flute harmonics and sounded like the background music to a nursery rhyme picking up the sides of his robes the aging wizard broke out into an amusing jig in front of his chair the ball begins at eight try not to be late you mustntwait to find a date or try and bait one of your mates it will be great that just fate the ball beings at eight the students broke out into cheers and clapped loudly at their beaming headmaster as he retook his seat after his dance oh that was rather pleasant he chuckled and the marauders exchanged well deserved if idiotic looking high fives you guys came through alright hermione told them digging into her eggs sirius gave an inane cackle and rubbed his hands together wait til you see what happens at the dance hermione dropped her fork and looked at him with growing horror what did you do no we will not ruin the surprise james exclaimed haughtily sitting down beside them and putting his camera on the table in front of him and quite frankly hermione it very rude of you to even ask groaning she looked down the table and pointed an accusing finger at a surprised lily this is your fault excuse me lily choked out you need to control your men hermione warned now shaking an egg y fork at her my men the redhead snorted yes hermione declared definitively drawing a line with her arm on one side of james seated beside her she motioned down to the other end of remus you are responsible for them she made an air circle around harry and ron and these are mine lily pouted how come i get three and you only have two because i didntkeep going back to the store for more i ll give you remus for harry lily propositioned hermione gaped at her and looked as offended as she possibly could no you can not take harry you picked em you deal with em drats boy do i feel loved james said conversationally pass the butter padfoot right here ya go sirius handed over the butter bowl and dragged some jam over for himself makes you wanna go through yourself in a lake eh what butter hermione snickered sirius gave her an odd look no he said as if she d lost her mind the jam pigeon oh she said trying to look serious i had no idea you were so easily offended by breakfast condiments yes well traumatic experience and all that after a potions class which was rarely anything better than mind numbing nails on a chalkboard torture wherein the surly professor snape was witnessed and widely photographed warbling the lyrics to a weird sisters rock ballad and it might have been air guitar he was doing or perhaps he was just flailing his arms about and some boys from all the houses doing an a cappella number with the suits of armor the golden trio was coming out of their own group number as they left the ancient runes classroom it been seven long years since we met on the train they sang together to a oldish pop beat dancing down the hall with their arms linked you were just a pair of boys hermione shot out ron and harry answered with and we thought you were insane alto baritone and bass but we were just kids at this big bad school there was magic everywhere and potions to brew wasntlong before we got together paranormal gravitation hermione soloed with a coquettish wink on her close up they called us the golden trio we were earth sky and sun hermione hands on harry wrist stopped the procession pulling him around in a circle she hummed along with the magical music before harry pulled her to him and they took each other hands in a slow waltz spinning around and about the hallway clearing out an open circle in the mass of watching students that had forgotten entirely about their next class hermione rich alto sang harry with your jade eyes you make my soul complete in knowing me best no one else can compete the spotlight that had fallen on them morphed to include only harry and hermione like a dramatic pantomime laid her head down and fell completely silent in the cloaking shadows that had descended upon her they continued to dance but the light had diverged to encompass ron as well ron you re my mate and we ve become like brothers if we d never met my life would be much emptier hermione spun out of harry arms like cracking a whip but ron was there to catch her and dip her low gradually lifting her back up onto her feet and dancing a faster paced two step while he serenaded her you re beautiful hermione always and forever i proud of your sacrificing heart wish i could say it out loud she was looked up at him with a bright shining face and a megawatt smile a piece of hermione they hadntseen enough of lately oh ron you re a part of me too she sang i feel stronger by your side if harry soul then you re my blood there a comfort only you provide hermione you re our heart harry interrupted their moment walking towards her baritone dropping to a husky tone you re courageous and strong and you hold us all together without a doubt this is where you belong harry locked his fingers with hermione and they shared a look before ron clapped a hand down on the other boy shoulder harry you re always the hero but i dontmind side kicking if it means we ll be friends til the end of everything oh the end of everything the three teenagers looked at one another and broke out in identical grins linking their arms they backed up together for a running start and moved down the hall in a parody of the wizard of oz cast going down the yellow brick road we ll be friends forever nothing gonna tear us apart sun earth and sky this trio was destined from the start our fates are intertwined and our harmony is perfect if voldemort could see us now he d show a little more respect cuz we re unstoppable together man beast and magic each calling out their respective names a triumverate of power watch us spout another limerick they d reached the grand staircase and the magical structures which had never before obeyed anyone other than their own fleeting wishes snapped to attention and spiraled straight down to the bottom of the castle on hopped harry then ron then hermione the music peaked as the three of them went whizzing down the banister without any thought towards saving their necks or just how many points they could lose for such recklessness as their velocity increased and the sharpness of the curves became greater the safeguards of the musical spell kept them from falling off and hurting themselves mid number by the time they were nearing the ground floor their hair was whipping around their faces ties flapping around their chins and robes billowing out behind them the students on their way to outdoor classes stopped in amaze to watch and the trio gave them their final stanza at the end of everything we ll all still be together coming out of war alive you can count on us being friends forever their grand finale was somewhat dampened however when harry was launched off the banister flat onto his face only to be landed on top of by ron and then hermione groaning and with hermione mumbling apologies they rolled off one another and found themselves back up on the seventh floor looking up at the fat lady what the hey as long as i donthave to climb back up all those stairs the spell can do whatever the hell it wants to us ron cut in sitting up to rub his back which had apparently had a slight disagreement with hermione knee meaning to shoot a self righteous glare at the owner of said aggressive joint ron face morphed into confusion at the odd look on his friend face she was looking longingly up at the portrait of the fat lady her shoulders sort of jerking forward as if something was trying to pull her guys she growled i dontthink i done singing just yet cackling gleefully together the boys rubbed their hands together oh goodie harry said and just then the portrait door was swung open the music was picking up but the looks on the faces of hermione sprawled across the floor and remus frozen in the doorway were identical in their horrification oh no they said simultaneously uh ron looked between them if this is gonna get personal i suggest you two take it out of the hallway hermione didntneed telling twice and she picked up her heels and sped past remus and into the hallway her still entangled and much clumsier companions following a short moment after hermione had wedged herself into one of the uncomfortable straight backed wing chairs her fingers clutching painfully to the armrests and her heels digging into the small space between the chair bottom and the floor she looked as though she were having a fit hey everybody harry yelled over the head of an equally ashen faced remus they re handing out free chocolate frogs down by the lake in a rush and stampede those that had been milling about the common room abandoned their schoolwork and books and even dropped their pack of exploding snap cards resulting in a resonating bang and a significant patch of scorched carpet ron was crouched down by hermione in concern when harry finished assessing the damage are you holding your breath a quickly blue turning head girl shook her head in denial you re a big girl now answer with your words not with your head the redhead insisted another shake of her bushy head and a garbled string of sounds that might have been words if her mouth had been allowed to properly form the words if you keep trying to fight the spell like that you might well just explode ron told her dramatically already noting that she was running out of stored oxygen then harry got tired of it all and poked her smartly in the side not happy til the sadness comes to keep me company oh but what becomes of fools who love like me hermione belted out before she could stop herself and her outburst broke through to the struggling remus another night another dream but always you it like a vision of love that seems to be true he sang her music was slow and melancholy but his was fast and adrenaline filled mixed together the two melodies harmonized and found an unprecedented but alluring balance with the barest scrap of self control remaining hermione was yanked to her feet and removed of her school uniform dressed from shoulder to floor in a sleek navy evening dress and more diamond jewelry than she could ever afford hermione reacted helplessly along with the lyrics unable to stop the spell from baring her private thoughts who gonna dry my tears when i crying who gonna hold my hand when i dying here she buried her face in her gloved hands who gonna set me right when everything is wrong she lifted her head from her palms loose tendrils falling from her chiffon and lowered them though one still hovered near her chin that was close to trembling pressing a hand to her heart hermione turned to look at remus impeccably dressed in a silk crimson shirt and black trousers who gonna love me when you re gone remus took a step towards her but as always stopped just short they stood facing one another music rising and falling close enough to touch but neither moving any distance at all that would shrink the gap between them the two of them just stood there and sang because they couldntstop it from happening just another night another vision of love you feel joy you feel pain cause nothing will be the same just another night it all that it takes to understand the difference between lovers and fakes both of them were pink in the cheeks because it was one thing to make a confession it was quite a different thing to do it with an audience and with some club mix waltz dictating your every word i talk talk i talk to you in the night in your dreams of love so true remus reached out with a shaking hand to touch her face and when the rough pads of his fingers made contact with the smooth plane of her cheek the entire tension between them broke down and crumbled away and for hermione it was as if the entire world was spinning away around them in the night in my dreams i in love with you cause you talk to me like lovers do just another night another dream another vision of love with me i here to set you free oh we do all the things that only lovers do vision of love that seems to be true harry and ron watched this exchange with something akin to amaze on both of their faces they watched spellbound as their friends fought the feeling that was inside them all the while the marauders spell pulling the words from their lips far more easily than any veritaserum ten yards away from them stood the last three of their group rooted to the floorboards of the boys stairs james and lily were both looking up at sirius but the boy wasntgiving much of a show only able to gape at the emotion ridden scene going on below them sirius hermione would never have admitted any of this if it hadntbeen forced out of her lily told him gently she not the kind of person who d intentionally hurt you sirius just shook his head and let it fall against his chest still in too much of a shock to be able to form a coherent word i figured a few things out about hermione james said firmly brushing his rugged locks out of his eyes she would never have said anything until we were finally sent back home and she probably denying it all anyway she didnteven give me a chance sirius monotoned his hands were holding the railing with knuckle popping force ever the mother figure lily touched his arm lightly in hopes of comforting him perhaps the two of you werentmeant to be no one knows that for sure he insisted looking at her fiercely padfoot now james was serious the forceful edge in his tone that had made him the unquestionable leader of the marauders there will never be the chance for the two of them if you dontgive her permission to try she thinks that to be with remus is betraying you but rise above pads jame cut off getting irritated he gestured down to where hermione and remus were standing he serenading her while his fingers held her chin fondly damn if they ll admit it but there something between them something i think that was there before we were even brought here quietly sirius answered that not fair no lily admitted readily but it may be fate if you wanna leave i wontbeg you to stay and if you gotta go darling maybe it better that way folding his arms over the twisted banister he bent down and situated his jaw in the crook of his elbow dark blue eyes watching the scene below as harry and ron whirled around startled and hermione and remus twitched slightly in his direction as though they d wanted to whirl around as well but the spell hadntlet them that was okay i gonna be strong i gonna do fine dontworry about this heart of mine just walk out that door yea see if i care go on and go now but he stared at the back of hermione curly head and sighed dontturn around cause you re gonna see my heart breaking dontturn around just walk away it tearing me apart that you re leaving i letting you go but i wontlet you know lily was smiling softly but he couldnttell if it was meant for him or not he looked to james and his friend nodded once he was doing the right thing i know i ll survive sure i ll make it through and i ll even learn to live without you hermione unable to turn and face the lamenting sirius and equally incapable of hyperventilating and passing out was forced to look nowhere else but into those grey eyes she thought were more familiar than her own this trick of the marauders was no longer funny it was intrusive and making for a hell of a more difficult ball than she d planned on having but still there was something in remus voice in the night in my dreams i in love with you cause you talk to me like lovers do i feel joy i feel pain cause it still the same his thumb rubbed against her cheek and a small piece of her heart gave a girlish squeal remus breath was hot on her cheek when he whispered when the night is gone i ll be alone i wish i could scream out loud that i love you i wish i could say to you dontgo but i wontlet you know sirius voice drifted over them as he retreated back into the dorms and then all that was left was hermione ending sure as winter goes and comes around again i will be my own undoing in the end she wrapped an arm around her waist i ll find the answers i ve been searching for in your goodbye kiss her hand reached up to touch his just a soft press against the back of his palm the silk glove sliding cross the skin and then she stepped away her beautiful dress already melting back into the drab grays of her uniform hugging both arms now around her stomach she lowered her gaze from startled grey eyes as her hair sprung free from its twist and obscured her face with curls cause i dontdeserve you and you dontdeserve this as the last chord died hermione walked into her room and shut the door song notes barbie girl by aqua when you re gone by richard marx another night by real mccoy dontturn around by ace of base all other songs used within were created by me shazam yay super sleuths you got it just needed a few clues some of you were close but congrats to moonynz pet peeves shading in grey laura windborn and ducks rule world

application have never been used before a n2 did someone ask for multiple remus x hermione scenes cuz they re here note 4 28 2005 due to persnicketyness by the song fever and its lyrics were removed from the chapter a s will denote where the lyrics once were i think the story lost a good piece of it to this but it cantbe helped hermione ran from the other side of the door as fast as she could she didntwant to hear what they had to say or sing didntwant to feel that head splitting pain wrenching through her chest again not anymore she stumbled into the common door fumbling in her hurry to get it open only to finally fling it open and run blindly into the arms of draco malfoy oh look he drawled fingers convulsed around her upper arms with crushing force it my date let go malfoy she growled through her teeth he sneered or you ll call potter looks to me like you wanted out of your friends company pretty bad seeing as how there was a very good possibility that either or both of them might suddenly just burst into song hermione really wanted to be somewhere else isntthat what drives every other girl into your arms she scoffed desperation go ahead granger his voice slithered silkily into her ear and just its tone made her feel violated i know you want to let see this power of yours hermione stiffened a total locking up of her body and malfoy laughed maliciously it could be our little secret he coaxed it wonteven make the papers this time she looked defiantly up into his face though internally she was cursing her own short height and flipped the switch in her head that wiped clean all the emotions from her expression malfoy sensed the sudden change in her but the only sign of his sudden alertness was the tightening on her arms and the all but imperceptible narrowing of his ice blue eyes back off she hissed out and what if i don t his challenge was darkly serious now and it frightened hermione how badly he wanted her to use her magic but she wasntabout to give him that she just wanted to get away i ll scream she swore vehemently she turned up her nose at him and said in as superior a voice as she could manage then who ll be the one in trouble he might have had a threat coming but they were both interrupted from their deadly staring match by a hooting owl that came swooping in through the window and began flapping madly around hermione head wings catching in her frizzied curls malfoy snarled and shoved her back as he let go of her arms and she tripped backwards into the wall as a result of it clutching her letter in her hands halloween not over yet granger he warned before stalking out of the common room when the door at last clicked shut behind him hermione let out a long shuddering breath and was glad for the wall cool weight at her back serving to sooth her nerves she wasntsure what malfoy was after who was but without a doubt it would not bode well for her she picked at the edge of the unsealed parchment as her thoughts played leap frog around her mind and then finally settled on thinking about malfoy behavior later the letter her chosen topic of thought distraction proved wholly unhelpful the letter was totally blank frontways and back she continued to stare at it in confusion until she noticed a spell contained in the parchment had levitated her locket up from underneath her blouse and into the open air eyes crossing slightly in the effort to look down at it so close she watched it turn onto its belly and reflect the inscription up at her the wrenching feeling was back in her heart and hermione groaned cupping the golden locket with her fingers if it was possible she only felt worse why did remus have to be so perfect sighing heavily she tucked the necklace carefully back under the collar of her uniform and headed for the hallway her encounter with malfoy had ironically served a useful purpose as in his parting line he d reminded her that her potion still remained to be picked up from the room of requirements and at least neither of them had started singing hermione returned twenty minutes later with the entire cauldron shrunken down into a single flask and tightly stoppered she carried it through her bedroom with slow deliberateness and a protective hold on the top and bottom of the glass though asll these precautions and minutiae seemed a bit excessive when the liquid in the flask looked to be nothing more magical than ordinary tap water she had planned on returning as quietly as possible but while she was preoccupied with the potion the heavy door joining her room to the heads common room drifted closed on its own with a noticeable bang hermione winced setting the flask on her work table she pulled out the white cube from its floorboards beneath her bed and set it down near the middle of the room a tap opened the top side like a lid and she scrounged around inside with three fingers until she pulled a bookshelf effortlessly out with a yank it hovered there above the cube for her to pull the books she needed and then give it the tap that would send it back inside she pulled a few more things out in the same fashion before closing the lid and tucking it into a nook on her workbench she d barely set down to work when there was a knock on her door she contemplated for half a second over not answering but the decision was made for her hermione it me now that was not fair she no reason to be upset with harry most importantly she couldnt not let him in simply for the reason that it was harry her harry making sure the burner under the flask wasnttoo hot she pushed back her chair and walked to the door a deep breath and she was ready to open the door harry gave her a stern look when she did and promptly shoved a resisting remus straight into her knocking them both back into the room you two are going to work this out and you cantcome out until you do he declared firmly then slammed the door and donteven think of trying to escape he yelled through it lily at the other door a sheepish lily said sorry guys from the other end of the room hermione threw out a hand and was cruelly avenged as the door bowed out of its frame and whapped harry on the nose who cried out in pain she let the wood bounce back to its original shape and looked up at remus kneeling over her they both flushed and he quickly crawled off and stood up offering her a hand hermione got up on her own readjusting her reading glasses that had gotten skewed in the sudden attack i have work to do she muttered pink faced and reseated herself primly in her chair remus hovered uncertainly in the corner of her vision but not particularly in her way and the fact that he wasntannoying annoyed her the thermometer stuck through the stopper was filling with two many numbers and she forcefully turned the gas crank to lower the burner flame she looked up the needed page in one of her books and seeing as it was written in italian hermione wasnttoo worried about him trying to read over her shoulder as per the book instructions she prepared an ice bath for the potion to go into when it was done slowly boiling when remus pulled up a chair beside her unobtrusively reading her transfiguration textbook hermione bit the inside of her cheek you can leave you know she said trying to look occupied that alright he said quietly hermione wouldntmeet his eyes we re not going to talk she said a bit smartish ly her anxiety was rising each moment they were alone together one more ditty between them and she wouldnthave any secrets left that your choice he answered calmly looking back down at his reading hermione stopped mid word in the notes she d been copying and threw down her quill and tore off her glasses can you just stop being perfect and understanding for one minute she exclaimed hotly remus closed the book and shook his head i dontwant to fight with you the sincerity in his voice brought back that wrenching feeling her defense mechanism involved a lot of yelling and hand gestures well maybe i do want to fight she exclaimed childishly and totally unfairly the only crime remus had committed was being perfect perfect for her she was forced to admit especially during this time when hermione was being forced to do things she would never burden her friends by knowing he didntask any questions he didntargue or yell at her act offended by her silence or press where he wasntwanted she had told herself night after night that nothing could happen with any of them remus had never confronted her with his feelings until a no longer amusing musical spell had forced it out of him that made him perfect too he was kind and quick witted honest and intelligent not only could he stand being in the library for more than five minutes he enjoyed going there he liked reading you think i perfect he asked with a bit of a smile that not the point she huffed but she d blushed pink all the way up to the tips of her ears doing the weasley family proud hermione i didntmean to tell you like that he insisted apologetically oh yeah note to self i killing all of you for this stupid spell she slammed her book down on the table and the entire thing rattled her potion bottle angrily taking into consideration the amount of time she d invested in said potion she took a deep breath and forced herself to calm down look remus i enjoy being with you and i value your friendship but that it she insisted no he reached out for her and she let him holding her breath as he gently pulled the chain out from beneath her uniform collar he opened the locket and the projection of the picture inside appeared between them we were better than just friends he said gently and that was before i d even gotten here hermione throat closed up as she watched the movie completely ensnared she hadnteven realized how often she d watched this photo play itself over and over again and wonder what had happened to that happy life she d led only so short a time ago remus had been more than just a friend and they had in fact been close in a way that most people wouldnthave been able to understand given their ages and societal differences but oh they d been so much more alike than that their losses had been great and they had found solace in each others kindred spirits his birthday party had probably been the only time they d both been truly happy since sirius death the werewolf death had hit her harder than she remembered thinking it would with harry on one side ron on the other and ginny owling her every day from home she still had felt completely and irreparably alone sometimes when the sorrow seemed greatest she would sneak down into the parlor where they d always shared tea and cry into his favorite chair she d often asked herself if this was how he had felt when he became the last marauder when his closest friends had all passed on and left him behind to deal with the world alone the thought that he d probably believed himself the least deserving of such a long life only made her cry harder into the soaked corduroy of the chair she d made herself be the one to pack his meager belongings away yelling outright when someone suggested they be given away they d never been much but whatever he d managed to keep with him had been things of importance that meant something they were his things if he wasntable to keep them safe any longer than she would be the one to do it because she couldntbear to see that picture of sirius he d kept on his nightstand thrown in the trash or stripped of its frame see the watch lily had given him for his fourteenth birthday too long broken to be of any use pawned away so she packed up everything sealed each item tightly inside their boxes and placed them safely inside the closet of her bedroom at grimmauld when she had finished the emotionally devastating process she remembered falling to her knees in front of the closet that held everything that was remus and sobbing into her hands she d cried hoping that he d found james and lily sirius and even poor misguided peter but still knowing they were all happy and whole again it didntmake her hurt any less she restrained herself from reaching up to touch all of their laughing faces but the hole that was perhaps forever in her heart burned and made itself known again even as the tears burned down her cheeks that had been her last perfect moment oh please dontcry hermione i didntmean to make you sad remus begged taking her face in his hands and wiping softly at the saline tracks i only want you to be happy the tears flowed harder at this but she didntmake any noise to accompany those long withheld tears her throat felt too tight to speak through but she made the attempt lips sticking together as she opened her mouth to form the words you do make me happy her voice rasped i i dontwant you to leave again remus knew she was referring to the death of his future self but didnttake offense by it she was blinking her eyes rapidly beneath his fingertips trying to staunch the flood of crystal droplets rolling from her lashes i wontleave if you dontmake me hermione she shuddered under his hands and pulled away i have to she choked clearing her throat to try and dispel its tight hoarseness we re good friends hermione but i can do better than that remus voice was evenly serious this isntsome spell you re trying to perfect in charms said hermione you can keep trying but this is a spell that doesntwant to be cast maybe it just wants you to give up and go and try some other one she valiantly tried to focus on her work quill clenched near the breaking point in her hand but her face was tilted back into looking at warm blue gray eyes maybe the spell has just been waiting for a wizard in shining robes to come and try hard enough to cast it but just doesntknow it yet maybe the spell just being silly remus offered maybe the wizard is too stubborn for his own good she mumbled back half heartedly looking down remus waited for her to bravely lift her eyes back up and she saw the subtle sadness that lined the smooth planes of his face even before he began to speak words that hit her more forcefully than she d imagined i meant what i said and if you want to go back to the way things were then that what we ll do he said quietly looking at her caringly through sandy bangs heart wrench after heart wrench but hermione bit back her breath please let me keep holding your hand it was the only thing he d ever asked of her something so simple and so utterly remus that she nearly began to cry again peering fixatedly into her watery eyes he cautiously found the hand lying limply across her lap and inched his fingers beneath it hermione lifted it slowly just enough for his hand to slip beneath hers and closed her eyes as warm fingers twined with her own her heartbeat quickened waiting for her to breathe and she tentatively squeezed remus hand he didnthesitate to squeeze back a long breath escaped her lips longer than it took her to open her eyes again her head tipped unconsciously upwards and she had a thought that remus hadntbeen so close where she could smell the earthy smell that was the wolf inside him a moment ago the timer she d set earlier went off with a high pitched muggle ding and her eyes slid to the side to glance at the large clock hanging on her wall it was six o clock remus chuckled softly and surprised her by leaning forward as she d imagined him doing a second ago and kissing her lightly on the cheek you have to get ready for the ball he told her she nodded distantly lily and gin will be waiting for me she murmured remus smiled and wiped away the last bead of moisture that had caught in her eyelashes then stood up well let get you up there then he waited for her to move the potion to the ice bath with one hand and then grab her dress box off the bed before leading her across the room each step hermione wanted to drag her feet however ill mannered it was wishing to stop that door from getting any closer reach it they did however and wordlessly they pulled back their hands fingertips lingering close together before breaking all contact completely save me a dance he whispered hopefully always like a gentleman he opened the door for her and she thanked him stepping out into the common room harry who d been sitting with his back to the wall next to the door quickly scrambled to his feet looking a bit wary as if she d try and hex him any moment ron looked up from the couch where he was picking up a game of wizards chess and sirius was beside him going over the quidditch play book until he looked up at them too it was ron idea harry blurted out immediately shielding his face with his arms as if he d anticipated a blow you re all too dramatic she addressed the room now i have to go get ready or gin will do something drastic with a sweep of her black school robes the young witch was hurrying up the girls stairs white dressbox tucked under her arm the odd sounds they caught in their range of hearing were identified as ginny annoyed yelling when the door to the 6th year dorm opened above them and hermione hurried inside nearly two hours and a great deal of painful hair styling later hermione was following ginny downstairs with lily behind her together they made a nice line of blue gold and red up the girls stairs there was a bright flash before hermione even made it off the stairs and she was blinking back stars as james camera spit out the picture everyone going to be so flipping jealous of our women he said proudly handing off the picture to harry who began implementing the absolutely necessary process of blowing impatiently and shaking wildly the still developing picture and look at little red sirius cajoled throwing an arm over a boldly beautiful ginny bare shoulders she all growed up and looking like james red a bloody morphing butterfly she is james agreed with a sage nod craning his neck to kiss lily temple everyone wait right here hermione instructed still blinking like she had a spasmodic twitch as she tried to get read of the odd light patterns still bobbing in front of her eyes from the camera flash i have to get my gloves lily already had her black ones pulled on up to her elbows and ginny had opted for black as well but hermione had left hers in her bureau drawer she slipped into her bedroom after a quickly whispered password and standing with her back pressed to the closed door she stared at the potion waiting for her when hermione reappeared a few moments later it was with simple white satin gloves up her forearms and a smile on her face let make sure everyone here the majority of the assembled group rolled their eyes but cooperatively stood still as she went down the line touching their shoulders and counting them all off when she got to seven and harry she groaned and tutted motherly at him didnti show you how to do this just a few days ago she sighed in exasperation and began redoing the bowtie that looked as though he d fed it to a hungry hippogriff thanks mum said harry cheekily ron snickered and she sent them both irate looks well kids you go and have fun i ll meet you down there going off to face the big bad dragon i sympathize ginny said if he tries anything harry started threateningly hermione rolled her eyes i have your permission to beat the bloody pulp out of him thanks for that she snorted derisively if you hadnttold me i might have just let him do whatever he pleased remus coughed into his hand but the others werentas discreet in their laughter guffawing outright at the glaring harry as hermione made sympathetic faces at the butt of the joke damnit granger hurry up growling in annoyance hermione picked up her gold skirts and jogged for her room in thankfully low heels how the hell did you get into my room she yelled back leaving the others to shake their heads you left the damn door open you ponce get out the door slammed shut over much more muffled yelling and with no sign of it ending soon james shrugged and lead the way out into the hall to join the growing throng of muggle dressed students filtering down to the great hall a sea of black and white with smatterings of bright color from the witches given the state they d left them in the septet was shocked as was the school when the head boy and girl came down the grand staircase her arm resting over his and bright smiles on their faces the crowd parted with no difficulty whatsoever to make way for the heads to ceremonially open the large doors they both pushed at the center and the two slabs of wood swung open revealing the completely redesigned hall as the theme was a new york night club the walls were painted dark the floor polished wood and the magically weather oriented ceiling had been convinced to turn solid for once and from the rafters hung great huge spotlights and strobes and spheres that slashed great whirling streaks of color across the room on one wall was a bar at which rosmerta had taken up a post closing the three broomsticks early to come and help out and on the dais which hitherto had supported the teacher table now served as the set up platform for a plethora of magically animated instruments loud house music was blaring throughout the spacious hall as soon as hermione and draco stepped across the threshold however the music died out and the scene began to change white marble covered the walls and great stone pillars built themselves up out of the corners the floors turned back to stone and the lights overhead all dimmed save for one blaring white spotlight fixated on the pair a slender golden tiara appeared in the curls ginny had piled atop hermione head and a thicker crown materialized on draco head moving to the room center both all smiles draco bowed gallantly she curtsied and he took her hand as a flowing waltz began emanating from the string section of the band hands smiles and magical headpieces firmly in place the two started their inaugural dance waltzing across the palace ballroom all eyes were on them students and staff alike hermione looked as though there wasntany place she d rather be as draco spun her around and around again and he was smiling at her in a way that made it look as though they felt no one but they were in the room it was amazing and absolutely frightening all in one hermione granger and draco malfoy did not get along ever but there they were just waltzing away when the song ended to much applause from the waiting audience hermione and draco curtsied and bowed respectively and lead each other off the main section of the dance floor and out of the spotlight with great big smiles and waves like something out of a miss america pageant as soon as they were in the shadows however the both of them flung away from the other as if they carried some disgustingly contagious disease and quickly moved as far away from one other as possible each seeking out their own personal groups a new rousing house beat started up that made the restored wooden floors thrum and the walls shake as the lights exploded back across them again hermione reached up tentatively and found that her tiara had disappeared from whence it had come perhaps it was for the best no need to match malfoy all night she found her fellow gryffindors hovering near the bar so seamus and ron could flirt up madame rosmerta and was promptly received by gratuitous applause rubbing at her cheek she opened and shut her mouth a few times before wailing that she d broken her jaw smiling like that that was pretty freaky deaky james said bluntly with the spinning and the smiling and such you noticed that too huh she replied dryly and had to duck to avoid a good natured swing nice job on the place though she laughed james puffed out his chest despite lily reprimanding swat to his stomach and boasted i take all the credit as if keep your pride tucked potter sirius scoffed stepping in on the conversation he winked roguishly at hermione and she was immensely relieved inside that he was at least acting like his normal self cantanimate inanimates to save his life he stage whispered conspiratorially to hermione she laughed behind her hand and james looked affronted hey a lot of people can t all right he defended aww jamsie bear lily cooed taking a piece of the action herself you donthave to be ashamed about your widdle problem i assure you there is nothing bloody little about me he proclaimed if a bit shrilly his date promptly boxed him on the ear and clapped a gloved hand over his mouth as he cried out in pain james francis potter she reprimanded hermione bit down on her lip to keep from laughing francis she mouthed to sirius who snorted with restrained laughter there are impressionable youth here she concluded aw come on lils he complained through her fingers sirius has heard it before hey all three of you get on the dance floor now before you hurt yourselves hermione laughed shoving the lot of them into the crowd only to be promptly shoved forward herself by another set of hands you really ought to take your own advice more often mione hermione whirled around into ron broad chest and rubbed ruefully at her banged nose ow ron she was choosing to blame him for her impromptu whirling causing her a knocked into face what with the shoving didnt spect that the shover would become the shovee didja he teased constant vigilance i am not going to dance with you if you keep up those mad eye impressions she sniffed and lifted her nose which she swore was now lopsided haughtily into the air time to dance he said as the songs switched and i promise no more impressions the both of them walking to a more open space they watched and waited as the room switched to fit the new song the walls bleached to a bright sunny spanish yellow and the ceiling lit up like a summer day the instruments blared out a fast paced beat and the pulsing mob of students began dancing wildly ron grabbed her hips and they began a slightly altered cha cha dance expertly weaving in and out of other pairings he gave her a suspicious look how do you know this dance you didntcome to the school lesson a mandatory one i might add i was with dumbledore she answered flippantly besides i learned how to ballroom dance when i was six the lanky boy raised an eyebrow impressive they did an impressive job didntthey hermione pointed out looking out over his shoulder at everything sorry i didntneed your help after all dun worry bout it you make a lovely girl by the way hermione looked down at her dress glittering with beads across her chest and waist lacing up the sides and trailing across the floor before it began to change to fit the song she supposed she did look rather decent and then she was wearing a bright rainbowish flowery summer dress with a stiff skirt and a bright hibiscus flower tucked into her curls ron had been not so fortunate in his wardrobe change and now sported seriously wide legged black trousers and one of those blue shirts with the ruffles on the sleeves hermione had to stop dancing she was laughing so hard oh sod off this is yule ball all over again he griped picking dejectedly at a cheery ruffle while he waited for hermione to collect herself i not ever dancing with you again ya know i sorry she gasped holding the back of her hand over her mouth just short of touching she held out her arms to him for them to start dancing again though her shoulders kept shaking from residual laughter and her cheeks were a healthy rose pink you look fine it doesntmatter you sound like you re feeling better he mused pushing her forward slightly and getting them both on tempo she rolled her eyes falling into step with her new strappy sandals as long as i never have to sing ever again in my whole entire life ever she stressed nothing good came out of it the red head pressed with a grin hermione to her credit gave him a malfoy worthy dirty look i just saying why are you dancing with me when lupin is sitting at the bar you shoved me onto the dance floor hermione exclaimed earning the pair quite a few surprised looks still she couldnthelp the quick expository look over her shoulder towards the direction of rosmerta bar besides i planning on dancing with everyone first off i only shoved in retribution for those you unjustly shoved beforehand secondly you are totally full of shit ronald bilius weasley hermione gaped sounding uncannily like lily had only a dozen or so minutes earlier more looks i your blood mate he winked i know these things dontlet it go to your head she mumbled turning slightly pink telling harry she thought they were soul mates when she thought they d never see each other again was one thing belting out to ron that they were blood mates in the middle of a sassy pop number was a completely other story entirely then the song ended and she was being handed off to harry for a tango as the lights dimmed to dusty red and all the walls and floors darkened whatever spell that was working the transmogrification deemed her original gown decent enough to tango in though the poofy tulle skirts beneath the silk disappeared and the dress became more svelte harry lost his tie which was a benefit to him and the line of buttons on his shirt got a tinsy bit of ruffle but nothing so bad as what ron had gone through he grabbed her hand and waist in the traditional tango position and led her straight across the dance floor with dramatic flourish too many clubs in new york that they couldntpick just one he joked i suppose so hermione agreed though she was getting slightly dizzy with all the sharp turns guess they ve got people of every flavor in new york he dipped her down and her lips were suddenly pressed around a long stemmed rose she spit it out with a disgusted sound while harry laughed heartily and steered them around the disappearing flora i thought the men did the flower teethy thing well lily did say you were unfeminine he reminded her hermione jerked her head slightly do you see this hair a painfully long process forced upon me okay i have the femme hair at least in no small part due to ginny attacking me with her wand and a good deal of pins time flew by as hermione moved between dance partners she danced to more house music with the other girls and gwen attempted a swing dance with neville to the distress of her trodden feet slow danced with sirius and then harry again and was snatched by james for a rowdy foxtrot somewhere in the middle of all of this she managed to get one glass of the customary punch which she hoped hadntbeen inappropriately altered so early in the evening and stopped by snape supervising with a surly attitude to thank him for the ingredients he d begrudgingly given her thanking terry boot the ravenclaw prefect for the lovely dance with a quick hug and quicker word to say hello to hannah his date she watched him walk away and sighed rubbing her sore neck she turned around at the tap on her shoulder and came face to face with remus may i still have that dance hermione glanced around at the darkness that was descending around them then down at her feet shifting them anxiously as shiny black tiles spread out across the wood floor blue spotlights appeared along the seams of the walls and floor casting eerie glows on the tile she could see her face reflected back at her you like jazz she asked gesturing to the shadowed ambiance love it remus answered taking her hand he spun her sharply around and into the center of the dance floor and its dusty blue spotlight the bulky mass of her gold gown changed into a tight black dress with a diagonally cut hem at her knees that billowed up around her thighs in her spin remus jacket and bow tied shirt were traded in for a more sensual silk shirt in crimson red that felt cool and smooth beneath her fingertips the tempo began with low twanging bass strings and the bodiless sound of fingers snapping coming from somewhere within the throng of instruments they were totally within the centre of the dancers when they began to walk after one another in a circle remus hands settling high on her waist s sliding her palms down her sides she found his hands and pulled herself by them against his chest forcing his arms to wrap around her s hermione swayed her hips in time to the sultry music her arms casually draped over his shoulders as the other dancers took their cue and grabbed partners of their own in the dark blue spotlight hermione and remus danced close together completely absorbed in their dance s cymbals crashed and hermione was spun outwards with a snap as the lights flashed to passion red curls were tumbling down out of ginny artful creation but they gave hermione face a softened look and showed more of the wild sided girl remus knew she hid that same hermione reached out with curling fingers and hooked them through one of the holes between his shirt buttons their skin burned whenever it touched s hermione took a step back and then another each done with still a hint of the dance and a smooth sashay in her hips her hand on his shirt became taut and now with every step she took she led him after her s remus sped up his pace and hermione matched it teasingly keeping just out of reach as the music accompanied their cat and mouse game then he reached up and slipped his hand beneath the one holding him and pulled her back in his direction he gave the motion a subtle spin at the end and a whirling skirt hermione spun like a top into his arms her back to his chest and his arms crossed over her breasts s hermione pulled away growing frustrated with only the warm puff of his breath on her cheek and no face to look at as they danced she was surprised when his hands automatically found their way to her hips and she was pulled back closer before she could attempt to do so herself remus didntseem to be fully aware of what he was doing and neither did hermione as she placed her hands over his interlocking their fingers s for a moment the spotlight they d worked themselves back under was deep royal purple before it reverted wholly to its original blue as the atmosphere of the hall cooled the pair dance had been reduced to nothing but swaying twisting bodies yet it was enough s at the cymbal crash hermione was dipped back unexpectedly and her heart leapt into her throat but remus strong hands were on her waist holding her steady above the last few feet to the tile floor and his touch sent a calmness rushing through her s slowly pulling her back up to rights as the last line echoed again and again and it wasntuntil this thought that hermione realized there had been no band there to sing the song a hand slid up her back to cradle her head with considerate geniality but when hermione was able to look remus properly in the eyes the gleam in those gunmetal depths was far from genial hermione had thought it was hard to say what it was that made remus so much more appealing than sirius or anyone else for that matter but at that moment there was no doubt in her mind it was the sure caring hands on her back the shaggy blonde brown bangs that fell over his brow the burning look in his eyes it was simply remus her face tilted up slightly before she d even recognized what the fluttering feeling in her stomach meant right there in that moment standing in the circle of light that cast them in blue hues the rest of the world faded away in the safety of his arms hermione felt as though she could be as selfish as she d longed to be time be damned and to hell with anything looking even remotely like a rule right now she was just a girl and maybe she was in love but she was just standing there begging a boy to kiss her the light was beginning to fade her dress to melt back to normal they were losing the moment hermione gripped his hands and lifted a bit onto the balls of her feet how many times had they come this close hermione was aching to know what he tasted like we can just go back remus whispered down into her upturned face be just friends again whatever makes you happy hermione smiled he was sweeter than words and utterly perfect you idiot she chuckled softly the rush of the moment making her slightly giddy i happy here remus gaped in surprise only causing hermione to beam wider at rendering him totally speechless then the backs of his fingers were brushing a stray tendril aside from her cheek and tilting her chin up to meet his mouth hermione eyes fluttered shut but the kiss never came someone barreled into her with bruising velocity and a scream ricocheted off the walls it took hermione a half second to realize it had been her own as her attacker rode her to the ground her head impacted with the unforgiving stone and her eyes snapped open with spots streaking across her vision strong hands clamped down around her neck squeezing out every last bit of oxygen and as she choked and gasped she reached up to try and pry the fingers from her neck only to stare in horror at the snarling wizard straddling her waist as he strangled her dark hair and bright green eyes ha rry hermione wheezed in disbelief die mudblood whore oh yeah cliffhanger or what whacko jacko harry will be explained next chapter and i guarantee you ll never guess what up by the way if you hadntbeen keeping up

began to shake her each violent jerk slamming her head back against the tile and making lights dance across her vision people were screaming and though a dozen sets of hands were yanking at him it only tightened his grip around her throat and despite the bloody furrows she d clawed into his hands in her desperation harry was not letting go her fingers burned from her slow suffocation but she ignored the pain curled each one in a fist and with all the strength she had punched him right across the face harry rocked backwards dragging her shoulders up off the ground with him though the blow hardly fazed him at all how dare you lay a hand on me you filth his hissed harry pulled back a hand to hit her and that was all that was needed sirius came barreling into the shorter boy his magical strength and momentum rolling the three of them over and then ripping harry off of a flailing hermione and careening across the dance floor blood trickling down her chin hermione sucked in and out but no air seemed to be making it past her lips she was hyperventilating remus was suddenly kneeling in front of her and she latched on to him still struggling to get a breath past her frantically gasping mouth she knew she had to calm down had to breathe slowly but all she could think was that she was suffocating and going to die she needed air now i ve got her remus go help sirius cool gloved hands cupped her face and though the smooth satin cooled her cheeks it did nothing to stop her hysterics wide eyed hermione watch lily bite down on one of the glove fingers and yank the whole thing off by her teeth when the bare skin made contact with her own air flooded into her lungs so fast she thought they would burst rather than collapse are you alright lily asked trying to get a lock on hermione darting honey eyes we need you to breathe okay we need your help s sirius hermione gasped re acclimating herself to the concept of breathing an explosion rocked the great hall blowing a half dozen of the lights and raining rubble down on top of the two girls as they threw themselves to the floor seconds later sirius body came skidding to a stop in front of them sirius getting caught up in her thick gown hermione only made it a few feet on her knees before she came tumbling down and had to crawl to him gods sirius she whispered leaning over his chest and picking his head gingerly up off the hard ground his face bore a few minor scratches from flying debris but there was a long gash drawing a line from his temple to his jaw come on wake up she murmured lightly tapping the uninjured side of his face while she lifted the hem of her gown to her teeth and tore a strip of the expensive silk free another explosion sounded from the opposite end of the hall and hermione prayed that whatever was going on behind her could hold on a few more moments wadding up the silk she pressed it against the wound to try and staunch the bleeding and somewhere in between he d opened his eyes you re hurt sirius wheezed and coughed a bit and hermione brushed back his hair with a soothing hushing sound ignoring the dried blood on her chin and you re an idiot she tried to make it a joke but it was hard to hide her distress as the blood had seeped through the cloth and was now dribbling down her arm i had everything under control sirius chuckled weakly at her joke and the action made him dissolve into a fit of coughing she shushed him again and grabbed his hand placing it over the makeshift rag justin hermione gestured to lily who reached out to take sirius free hand lily going to stay with you just keep holding that to your cut it should stop the bleeding she told him quickly sounding surer than she felt i have to figure out what going on hermione sirius said as she got to her feet and looked down at him that s n not harry hermione nodded grimly i know the dress had to go she could hardly move in the thick tulle dragging her hand across it a jagged line sliced through each layer around the circle of her knees and the excess material of her once beautiful vera wang dress hit the floor keep him safe lily kicking off her heels hermione ran into the opposing flow of students trying to reach the doors elbowing and shoving her way through the throng with sirius yelling after her i dontneed a babysitter he huffed sirius tried to sit up but lily pushed him back down with a hand on his chest you ve done your part lily insisted hermione the one that has to face harry no shit he muttered knocking off her hand but what about the others others suddenly there were no more people to push through and hermione staggered out into the open clearing the students had flocked to abandon and for good reason harry completely unmarred from his fight with sirius was holding a flailing girl in a white dress above him while james and ron tried to fight their way through justin finch fletchley and some younger girl who were battling back with a strength neither were capable of harry that got his attention a pale panic filled face surrounded by strawberry curls cried out to her in terror before harry re hefted his burden it was ivy hart he was holding over his head the fifth year ravenclaw prefect put her down hermione eyes narrowed and her hands were up in position to attack did you enjoy the beating i gave your thrice damned toy harry laughed maliciously he flew a long way just like this pretty thing ivy screamed as she was hurled through the air james the little girl he was fighting squealed as he kicked her off of him and ran for the falling prefect he dove into one of the bordering tables to catch her and the pair rolled through a stand of candles then fell onto the floor as james began violently trying to beat out the flames creeping up her pretty dress harry drew his wand on hermione and the doors to the great hall slammed shut all the students were now trapped inside i will enjoy flaying the flesh from your bones harry told her twirling his wand he was holding himself in a completely different fashion taller domineering and more sinisterly not even his emerald eyes retained the spark that was harry do not think that because you wear the mask of harry potter i will hesitate in killing you because i won t hermione swore with complete apathy you are evil ahahaha the high pitched shrieking giggle came from the young girl a second year by the name of chrissy her golden blonde hair all curled into ringlets her pink party dress neatly pressed and a bloody handprint across her breast death death she cried how good to see you again hermione recognized that fanatical laughter it was the voice always ringing in her right ear the one that haunted her sleep even now and just like that everything fell into place bellatrix she hissed chrissy clapped her hands excitedly together bellatrix black insanity turning her young childish demeanor into a haunting parody of na vet that was eerie to watch oh auntie death you remember me you re dead now mm hmm good silence black harry snarled at the little girl the dark lord may have killed you for his divine plan but at least then i thought your damn babbling would stop who else would riddle send in his front guard hermione said if she kept them talking long enough then perhaps snape and flitwick could break through the locks on the doors and get the innocent students to safety bellatrix lucius her eyes settled on justin cowering behind harry and her blood began to boil and pettigrew grudges grudges mudblood harry said toying with the end of his wand chrissy giggled inanely in the background time to die they leapt at one another simultaneously and their fight began with flying fists and explosive bursts of magic though it was lucius soul now in control of her friend he had gained all the abilities and strengths that harry had as well as his absolute raw power the gravity training she d put them both through gave their fight an inhumane agility and fevered pitch hermione swung at his face while bringing back her forearm to block the punch intended for her gut harry blocked her as well and they shoved each others hands back only to try and make bruising contact once again as they exchanged rapid fire combos to breach the other defenses she watched remus break the banister off of the bar and use the heavy makeshift staff to join the fight against justin and chrissy harry palm caught her fist and began to squeeze she aimed to bring her elbow down into his face but he caught that as well and with a grunt of force lifted her up off the ground and threw her back over his head hermione readjusted her grip to hold him now and she twisted to put her feet at his back and dragged him down with her kicking upwards harry was slammed down onto the cobblestones above her head but before she could pull herself back up he d dug his nails into her hands harry didnthave the strength no human did but from his own back he lifted hermione off of hers and threw her across the room with a shout she flew through one of the hanging house tapestries getting tangled in the thick green cloth and broke through one of the tables in a heap of rubble leave her lily shouted as ron tried to break away from justin to go to her she fine remus protect the students while the professors get these bloody doors open prefects ginny yelled shooting an array of sparks into the air rally to me form a line of defense the floor began to tremble the goblets quaking across the tabletops and clattering to the stone the sounds of james and bellatrix magic ricocheting off one another dominated the hall and then the pile of debris that covered hermione exploded upward in a column four meters high like a string pulling upwards at the crown of her head hermione rose up onto her feet but she was changed there was a strange phosphorescent light in her eyes and she suddenly seemed more than the frail eighteen year old girl she d been before malfoy her voice boomed through the great hall warped and with a deep echo that made it seem as though many different voices were talking over one another the self satisfied smirk fell from harry face ava hermione flung out her hand and a pulsing blue whip of magic shot out from her palm and lashed itself around harry neck cutting short his curse as he struggled to pull the noose from his neck with a flick of her wrist she grabbed a hold of the whip end and gave it a swift yank harry dropped to his knees i will not bow to your kind he gurgled degradingly spittle falling down his chin hermione pulled herself to the struggling wizard by keeping her magic rope taught between them i dontexpect you to bow her voice echoed chrissy hopped down off the table she d been standing on her ash wand held in her chubby fingers i think she wants you to die uncle lucy hermione slashed her hand through the air and chrissy shrieked as four bloody furrows cut through her cheek naughty death she howled and waved her wand viciously at hermione deep gashes broke the skin on either side of her face snapping her head back grunting with the effort hermione spun around dragging harry and lifted him up off the ground as she turned back to her original orientation she let loose the whip and harry crashed into the blonde knocking them through the band stand through all this she d paid no mind to the sniveling spirit of peter pettigrew that had enslaved the prefect justin and so she was caught off guard when his spell exploded in her face she screamed in pain and lifted her hand to strike but lithe arms wrapped around her own and held it back hermione no justin hid behind his hands as he slunk around the broken stand to hide from the witch wrath the light in hermione hand sparked against the restraint but slowly as if in a daze she turned to look at remus holding tight to her hand that justin under there he whispered whatever happens here wontchange my feelings for you but for the sake of the others do what you can not to harm them hermione just stared at him the thundering noise of static roaring in her ears the world around her had gone completely red the warm tingling feeling that pulsed through her veins only felt before with such intensity that day on the training grounds with tonks and the others the beast inside was pushing clawing searching for a way out magic exploded in front of them both as hermione stepped in front of remus with her arms outstretched to deflect the spells launched at her by a recovered harry keeping remus behind her she vaulted herself forward and into a front handspring chrissy nose broke with an audible crack as her foot impacted it and then she was riding harry to the floor harry broke most of her fall but as she righted herself across his chest his fist came free and cracked her across the face she recoiled from the blow and then backhanded him across the jaw splitting his cheek against the cobblestone what is your purpose here she demanded our purpose is his purpose harry snarled showing the snake of malfoy inside of him hermione punched him again he laughed at her sending a dark trickle of blood down his chin you can do what you like to this body harlot the dead feel nothing you re only killing your little friend malfoy loosened his hold on harry soul for the briefest of moments enough time for the expression on his face to change and harry bright green eyes to lock onto hers hermione he pleaded nearly out of breath hermione hand stopped halfway into the air and her blank face turned to his struggling every second of the way harry reached up to touch her hand and only managed the barest of grazes by his dirty fingertips along her palm kill him harry whispered lucius took control again with a guttural scream of rage no he bellowed reaching for her throat hermione knocked both his hands aside pinned them with her knees and blinded him by unleashing the light of an exploding star in front of his eyes his pained writhing offset hermione and her back hit the stone harry reared up into a sitting position eager to be free again though he still could not see properly disgusting mudbl harry choked and gagged as hermione magic wrapped its invisible fingers about his neck and squeezed the breath out of him she herself staggered up onto her feet and with a shuddering effort shot equally strangling nooses around justin and chrissy she d never cast a spell to this extent before but somehow she was managing with the physical gestures of her hands as she lifted the paralyzed but struggling trio into the air above the trashed band stand truth she called not taking her eyes off them what are you going to do hermione ginny asked kneeling on the steps beside her i going to save them with a shuddering breath the beast found its freedom in slipping through her lips because she couldntwait for remus to come to her the leopard roared in her head and she watched through its eyes as it darted around students sprinted over tables and leapt straight into remus he staggered forward clutching his bronze staff for balance and when he looked up his blue gray eyes had bled to gold her metaphysical beast slipped back inside her through her legs carrying with it a link to truth and the musky after scent of the wolf the rush of energy exploded the pleasure centers flaming through her body and she gasped loudly her fingers convulsing a moment on the invisible ropes and choking the suspended trio further all she needed was a look up through her lashes and she could see the blackness festering inside harry and the others she could see it slinking outwards through their veins like cursed ink poisoning their bodies with its evil taint the wolf and the cat were curled around one another in her belly pulsing with light and energy and heat mewling in her ear to take those dark seeds and rip them out so she did reaching past their true souls she found each of the evil spirits and snatched them right out through the layers of flesh and bones and into the open air a torrent of wind cocooned hermione whipping her sheared dress inappropriately in all directions and yanking curls all about sending their restraining pins shooting off to the sides like miniature missiles the three bodies were slumped above her unconscious from the metaphysical drain and the souls of peter lucius and bellatrix writhed in the air above her like fish caught in a net watching their limp translucent images jerking spasmodically mouths open in wordless profanities hermione felt herself regress to something pre civilization controlled by primeval urges she wanted to tear them apart with her eyes rip the metaphysical substance into so many pieces that they d finally explode like a million shards of glass and disappear forever hardly enough of them left to make it past limbo and she knew she could do it too or she could squeeze them like oranges through a juice grinder lock them up in boxes from which there was no escape and bury them a thousand miles under the sea where they would never be able to cross and would spend eternity with the fishes she could do that too they tasted so good like honey and cotton candy she could just swallow their souls whole and for a long time the tense situation ground to a halt with a windblown hermione standing with arms outstretched to the captured souls hanging over everyone head the entire hall was caught in hermione indecision no one aware of the dark thoughts and even darker ideas plaguing her consciousness magic roared over all other sounds creating a wall of white noise that tried to block out the world around her not even lily moving mouth beside her ear made it past the barrier but a warm hand on her shoulder did wordless but screaming the emotions rocketed straight to her heart hope love and utter surety in hermione clinging to the strong convictions lily had reinstated in her hermione pushed back all thoughts save one and brought her palms together in a stinging clap i cast you out hermione went down onto her knees and brought her palms slamming down onto the hard stone a deafening boom echoed throughout the great hall and a physical shockwave accompanied it staggering back the crowded students the unconscious bodies of harry chrissy and justin all floated lethargically down to the wrecked bandstand and were laid gently out as if some great hand was putting its dolls to sleep but hermione was only conscious long enough to sever the link between magic and truth before she collapsed face first atop the steps of the dais and lifelessly slid down them to a heap on the dance floor the doors slammed open and there stood dumbledore with mcgonagall and the other professors right behind him get the wounded to the hospital wing he boomed the rest of the students are to remain in the hall until the rest of the castle is secured hermione the trio and a few other students were placed onto magical stretchers and sent whizzing up the grand staircase to madame pomfrey care while the other students huddled in masse at the great hall center the prefects forming a protective circle around them severus you and the head boy stay with the children everyone else split up and search the grounds the staff followed dumbledore out and diverged down the two corridors and up the grand staircase wands held aloft the large doors drifted back shut on the smirking face of draco malfoy and the lights went out some of the easily startled students screamed and the prefects hurried to calm them down when the lights flickered back on the great hall was empty hermione hermione wake up harry hermione groaned and rolled over on the starchy sheets gentle hands were running through her hair and she took a moment in the comforting silence to rub at her eyes before opening them harry was sitting up on the floor cot beside her own and idly putting back some semblance of order to her ruined hair he or madame pomfrey more likely had fixed his glasses after the second hit to his face had finally cracked the right lens hey she croaked and rubbed at her throat i so sorry hermione harry insisted profusely i tried to stop him really i look that bad huh she chuckled humorlessly harry held up a mirror for her to see into hermione probed the bruised flesh of her neck marked with the ten purple imprints of harry fingers examined the dried but bloody gashes along her cheeks and gently fingered the puffy circle across the left side of her jaw well she said finally guys dig scars right harry gave a short laugh and hugged her tightly to him softly kissing her temple as though he thought her entire face was one big bruise madame pomfrey should be back any minute he swore since none of us were actually dying she hurried down to get the students with the smaller injuries while the professors secure the castle uhn hermione groaned a pain jolting through her skull is sirius here he uhn got hurt helping me harry was more worried about the pained expression on her face then her question no he didntmake it in the first wave he rushed out what wrong are you hurt do you need to lie down she smiled i think it s yes it probably a concussion i ll live running his hands edgily through his already mangled locks harry let out a pent up sigh of frustration well you were right voldemort did try and pull something a dry chuckle i always right whoop whoop whoop what going on harry shouted the hands they clapped over their ears did nothing to lessen the booming siren sound pulsing through the hospital wing red lights began to flash spasmodically and the entire hospital wing was filled with pained cries as the injured were awoken by the commotion something wrong hermione yelled over the noise that impossible harry was fumbling for his wand out of the back pocket of his jeans i put the ghosts into the astral dimension to pass on the hardest part was to get herself moving again and her joints creaked groaned and protested but she eventually got up to her knees this is something else what i dontknow hermione following harry frantic pointing hermione looked down and was shocked to be able to see the tight knit of the floor cot through her feet from her toes to her knees her dirty legs had taken on a translucent tone which was only growing clearer by the second the toes of her right foot were already completely invisible the night was anything but over exhausted and overcome with stress hermione shouldered it all aside knowing that to do so would result in a complete and total breakdown at the end of it all because time was now a precious commodity and for the sake of her friends lives she needed to stay focused with a great fistful of harry dirty tux she tugged him up to her level and put her mouth right beside his ear he had to hear every word harry you have to listen closely she said quickly something big has happened and our friends are in trouble there was i brewed a potion it works like a portkey with a few altercations i slipped it on the seven of you before the ball it was on my gloves it it hermione frantically rushing brain hurried to find the words to explain if one of you was in the same place as a dress vera and i put trackers on it would bring me there as well harry struggled to comprehend her rushed speech but her translucency now up to her ribs had him rightly distracted dresses one if not all of our friends are with death eaters now hermione finished in a pained tone you re in no condition to go harry exclaimed clutching her arms and turning his head to look into her eyes his were wide with worry and fear i donthave a choice she insisted i ll do all that i can to help them but if i cantreach sirius then my strength wontlast long you have to get dumbledore dumbledore i i hermione i harry hermione said firmly his stammering stopped as she grabbed his face between her hands her fingertips were gone dumbledore she repeated you must get dumbledore how will he find you he questioned eyes darting down her invisible body the medallion hermione exclaimed with sudden insight find my medallion from vera on my bureau harry nodded frantically but there was no longer the solid weight of her hands on his cheeks in fact her face was already fading away the last part of her left you re coming back alive he told her earnestly and you have to stay here hermione insisted the order needs you i ll bring back our friends i promise harry reached for her but his hands passed straight through nothingness she wasntsimply invisible she was physically gone hermione stay hidden her voice was like a shallow breath of wind barely heard over the alarms keep yourself safe her eyes vanished hermione harry cried desperately hermione she never answered deep in the bowels of malfoy manor where the cobwebs were so thick they choked the air and the rats were afraid to leave their dark chinks in the wall for fear of the spiders there had been built a dungeon for use in the crusades when the moors were flooding across england in their fight against king richard cells lined opposite walls of the long rectangular room with bars an inch and a half thick and slick with grime algae and other things that brought such thoughts to mind as werentworth the horror of naming them there were dark stains across the stone floor equally unnamable in their appall that had been there for countless centuries or just a few days for despite the filth and appearance of disuse these dungeons had seen their share of recent prisoners and on this halloween night at a quarter to midnight the cold dampness of the underground room was replaced by the frightened heat of hundreds of young bodies as the entire student body of hogwarts was portkeyed into the cells first and second years were screaming in terror and huddling in teary groups by the older children whose own fear made them hardly braver the prefects and seventh years were discovering the magical shields round their prison as their spells came rebounding painfully back upon them snape the only professor that had been left in the hall and a handful of students the majority of them slytherin appeared on the other side of the bars walking free in the long hallway i knew it malfoy you snake ron yelled from one of the cells pushing through the frightened students in their fancy ball outfits he reached the bars wand in hand you knew and yet still i win draco sneered unthreatened by the wand pointed at him that makes you even more pathetic weasel prissy the fifth year slytherin prefect and dressed in a lime green gown preston linae elbowed her way through a ravenclaw and theo nott drawing her wand with dangerous glee her honey hair hanging over half her pixie face and her heavily kohl ed eye wide with anticipation she resembled the dementia of bellatrix expelliarmus she cried waving her wand sharply the jet of magic hit ron squarely in his chest blasted him back off his feet and bowled over a dozen of the students behind him ron ginny screamed but she was on the other side of the room and out of reach mister malfoy snape hissed drawing the younger boy aside i was not informed of these plans draco glowered at his professor and wrenched back his arm our lord has recently discovered dumbledore gifts in invading the mind you were too much in the old fool company to risk telling severus perhaps you would care to inform me now the sallow faced man said darkly and for a moment draco actually looked afraid he going to kill them draco said their blood will give him new life and no one will be left to oppose him snape no lily cries interrupted james held her back we trusted you james sirius yelled from the other side of the room keep her quiet in the cell beside him ron wasntmoving he d seen first hand what happened if you didnthold your tongue you d do well to listen to him potter draco said silkily twirling his wand learn to control your women he snapped his long fingers and pansy glided to him like a dog on a leash her pink ruffled dress whispering across the disgusting floor draping her arms over his shoulder the currently dark haired pansy hissed at the red faced girl struggling in james grasp i told hermione to trust you lily yelled traitor draco murmured something in pansy ear and the smirking prefect lifted her wand at lily eyes widening in surprise james finally clapped a hand over his girlfriend mouth and dragged her back into the swarm of students and out of sight pouting pansy began to advance but snape grabbed her wrist and yanked her back enough of your party games mister malfoy he ordered what of dumbledore he ll be too late to stop anything he still searching the castle as we speak draco laughed as the dungeon doors opened and death eaters in their own halloween livery began entering not even the mighty harry potter is in any shape to take on the dark lord his own mudblood whore took care of that remus sighed in relief and the painful grip he d set on sirius arm lessened hermione not here he whispered and the taller boy sagged against the bars in equal gratitude to the powers that be thank merlin sirius whispered into the darkness moony i padfoot if i dontmake it out of this sirius looked over at him in disbelief his mouth parted in an o of surprise remus hands found their way to the bars and he gripped them tightly looking down to hide his eyes in a curtain of honey brown bangs please take care of hermione moony swear it remus demanded he glared up at sirius stubbornly sirius mouth was pressed into a thin firm line looking down into remus fierce eyes of course i will he answered finally you know i d do anything to keep her safe remus nodded albeit sadly and said i know sirius clapped his friend solidly on the shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze dontworry mate she ll have you for that i ll make sure of it narcissa malfoy widowed but no less devoted lifted up the skirts of her gorgeous emerald dress with its black lace accents and strode gracefully but with purpose across the dungeons to the gathering followers mother draco greeted reverently he bowed and kissed the back of her ebony gloved hand everything has gone according to plan excellent she praised you are on the right path to following in your father glorious footsteps her sharp eyes caught on something behind her son and narcissa pushed him roughly aside to confront it is something wrong jezabelle she demanded suspiciously of the sixth year prefect the blonde quickly cleared her face and corrected her posture no my lady she curtsied swiftly in her svelte black dress that laced up over baby blue sides she looked warily over at snape and then back down to the monitor display where images of every room in the manor were exhibited your lord has just arrived oh james lily whispered what are we going to do he rubbed her back comfortingly and shook his head i dontknow yet we ll think of something we ve got to but with two of the star strongest points missing and the third unconscious we donthave enough power to do anything well we re not going down without a fight are we he smiled despite the bleakness of their situation lily smiled back and hugged him tightly i think i know now she whispered know what he asked quietly why i married you ronald ronald wake up head aching and his back throbbing ron warily opened his eyes and was met with the curiously scrunched face of one luna lovegood w what happened the blonde settled back on her haunches so he could sit up and twirled a particularly frazzled looking lock of hair around her finger you lost he glared at the odd girl i can see that as if his probable concussion wasntnauseating enough luna dress was poofy and pastel rainbow the water colored streaks of pink to lavender repeating themselves over and over you re friends in the next cell over said hermione wasnthere i dontthink harry got portkeyed with us either she mused flicking the wand she d stashed behind her ear it up to us then ron swallowed hard he d always been the sidekick right first harry had been the hero and then hermione had come into her own but he d never had any problem being backstage was this his turn he could handle it no problem we re so screwed he whispered the dungeon door drifted eerily open and the sudden chill that descended on the crowded cells instantly silenced the prisoners and everyone turned to watch voldemort descend into the dungeons he wore heavy robes of the darkest black upon which were designed nearly invisible serpents and symbols of evil and darkness in every imaginable tongue the hood hung low over his face to obscure all his features and not even the skin of his hands was visible for he wore thick dragonhide gloves and when he called to narcissa his voice was almost human everything is ready for the ritual my lord narcissa informed him curtsying low and abasing herself before the evil wizard well done narcissa voldemort acknowledged lowly the killing of your cousin bellatrix has opened the gateway to the realm of blood narcissa nodded her blonde head low and ignored the image of her cousin bloody body voldemort slipped into her mind the black dress with its blood red roses and overlapping tulle had suited her perfectly even if she was still pale and emaciated from her stay in azkaban narcissa had helped her with her long hair herself and all it had taken was a word from voldemort that bella soul was needed for his plan and narcissa had taken an athame to her cousin back are they all fresh he demanded in that same low voice that was just soft enough to send chills down your spine narcissa rose from her curtsy no sign of reaction to her cousin dead image on her perfectly porcelain face yes my lord after the first phase of your plan was completed we waited for the severely injured ones to be removed including potter and for dumbledore and the other professors to abandon the hall before activating the portkey as the face beneath the hood turned to survey the cells remus in his panic grabbed sirius roughly and yanked his body against his a startled sirius bent down awkwardly in his friend sudden embrace stood stiffly against him until remus whispered for him to relax voldemort eyes passed over them like a tangible weight and remus held sirius head between his own and his hand keeping his face between sirius and the bars remus shh the brunet hissed insistently hugging him tighter and trying for all the world to look as if he thought he was about to die it wasnthard to imagine perfect voldemort murmured and his gaze moved on you have far exceeded your late husband worth narcissa my only wish is to serve you remus released sirius with a breathless thank merlin and looked down at his hand it was smeared with coppery blood that was already trying to drip down his arm sirius gaped in surprise remus had been hiding his wound from voldemort wincing as he did so remus tore a strip off his wonderfully new and un patched tuxedo jacket and used it to scrub at the drying blood with a frantic fervor whatever this blood ritual voldemort has planned for us it keeping us alive a little longer he explained as if demonstrating how to properly pot a mandrake as long as he doesntsee your gash he wontfind the need to kill you before we figure a way out of this mess he was cut off by sirius wrapping his arms around his shoulders and hugging him gruffly hermione deserves you he said huskily in his ear you re a good friend she deserves you too pads remus insisted then he stepped away sides she d kill me if i let anything happen to you narcissa everyone in the room turned to watch jezabelle who was furiously tapping away at the monitor console what is it narcissa demanded picking up her skirts and striding angrily over to the blonde the prefect fingers flew across the board as she relayed the message someone breached the manor gate what narcissa shrieked they ve entered the building sending guards to intercept find them jezabelle face snapped to the side as the back of narcissa hand met her cheek a tiny trickle of blood oozed down her jaw from a cut made by the ring on the woman finger gritting her teeth jezabelle ignored the stinging pain and went back to her work attempting to track now she imparted and then shook her head they re moving too fast i having difficulty locking onto them she grabbed an odd looking set of headphones and held one of the speakers up to her ear continuing to type rather hastily across the keyboard they ve cleared the first floor confirmed the intruder is now on the ground level sending more forces to intercept dumbledore voldemort growled furiously and a collective wave of hope spread through the prisoners no jezabelle argued suddenly pressing a series of buttons with the tip of her wand she touched the wooden end to one of the display screens and the room image it displayed projected itself up into the air for the whole dungeon to see it granger five prisoners lost their breath an audience of two hundred plus watched in rapt attention as the brunette witch blazed her way through all opposition on the screen her appearance was a sorry sight but her actions belied her downtrodden looks the two death eaters that dared try to stop her met with a blazing fireball she conjured over her head and bowled into them when it was the size of a bureau it was just as well the display carried no audio for the open mouthed charred black bodies of the death eaters writhing on the floor was graphic enough detach that camera narcissa ordered keep her on that display jezabelle typed in a short sequence and the image wavered a moment before moving by entirely as whatever device that had been transmitting the picture sped off down the hall after hermione the breakneck speed at which she moved through the hallways had never been witnessed by most of the students though all had seen how fast she could fight from the battle in the great hall and they stared in wonder and amaze as her bare feet seemed to almost disappear beneath her furiously pumping legs she swerved off to the right and before the video probe could follow she was skidding back out again and resuming her earlier path down the hallway it followed closely after whirring and spinning around her head hermione shot a jolt of electricity at it but the probe was already flying back around her and the lightening bolt fizzled out against one of the walls she kept trying to zap the annoyance but her pace never slowed she knows where we are dagon the slytherin fifth said and she knows we re watching her jezabelle added what she doing narcissa commanded leaning over the monitors console jezabelle fiddled with another display checking on the progress of the guards she d dispatched she systematically sweeping through the entire floor she may not know how to get to us but she going to find out kill her hissed narcissa you incompetent woman snape roared stepping up for the first time since his words with draco are you watching the screen you cant kill this girl she breaking right through your defenses like tissue paper as narcissa reared up to answer snape insult voldemort lifted a warning hand effectively staying both their tongues severus is right this girl blood will be rich with power and magic bring her to me alive bosom heaving beneath her tightly laced dress narcissa turned her sharp face to jezabelle though her husky blue eyes were still sparking with the angry sting of her counsel being replaced by a snake like snape you heard him she snapped and jezabelle quickly moved to comply lest she be slapped again another screen was projected beneath the first but this one displayed a green grided outline of the entire ground floor with coordinates mapping out the sides granger is currently moving through sector beta a white flickering blip appeared on the right side of the screen your guards have taken up a position to capture at the coordinates alpha 9 and alpha 0 a significantly larger red circle came up onto the screen at its far left the white dot though darting into side corridors every so often was quickly closing the distance between the two lights estimated time til contact a death eater demanded another sequence of keystrokes at her current speed seventy one seconds hermione must have seen them waiting because she stopped checking hallways and used the extra time to utterly demolish a heavy antique table from the rubble she grabbed the long ornate banister that had served as a connector between the table legs and spun it over her head to test the weight of it satisfied with her weapon she shifted it to one hand and ran straight for the waiting death eaters jezabelle looked over at the prisoners pressing their dismayed faces against the bars and bit her lip back at the console she clicked a button with one long black nail and held the headphone closer to her ear ten nine eight the death eaters completely blocked off the end of the hallway standing eight abreast and three deep seven six they raised their wands five four hermione mouth opened in a ferocious battle cry and the magic gathering in her free hand sparked and crackled with equal fervor jezabelle raised her eyes to the screen three two one the white blip collided with the sea of red and disappeared the guards have engaged the intruder hermione barreled into the twenty four masked death eaters and all the visual probe reported back was a blinding explosion of brilliant yellow light when the dungeon was able to see again two of the death eaters already lay dead or dying and the fight had begun with the girl in gold at its center she swung her staff in front of her like an arc knocking back three guards then shoved it back behind her catching another one in the face with its end as he came at her back hands grabbed her arm and she swept their legs out from under them with her staff but still they held on and when they were lying at her feet with the arm they desperately clung to pointing down at them she cast a petrification spell and the blast turned them completely to stone another swipe of her weapon kept the other death eaters back as she wrenched her arm free from the stony grasp and the petrified guard arms crumbled with it every spell imaginable short of avada was being thrown at her but most fizzled out before reaching her the spells that did appear to make contact had no effect other than to slow her down for a half second or more stumbling back after one such barrage hermione stopped her attackers from rushing her by giving her staff a forceful throw like hurling a javelin the blunt object pierced the stomach of two rushing death eaters and knocked a third one into a wall a kick at her back sent her flying forward and nearly skewered her on the staff as well a bombarda spell exploded the stone in front of her face and the force sent her flying into the air her flailing hands found the chandelier and as she swung forward she kicked in the face of a guard and sent him crashing through his swarming comrades one of the death eaters she d beaten down earlier reached up with torn and bleeding hands to try and pull her down but she let go of the light with one hand to blast the offending man off of her magic exploded above her severing the chain that held up the chandelier and she screamed as the giant crystal monstrosity crashed to the floor with hermione buried beneath it everything stopped the younger children began to cry and some of the older ones even began to yell obscenities at voldemort who took no notice of them james was holding lily hand as she cried into his shoulder and luna sat wordlessly beside ron as banged his fists into the ground and said nothing of the tears in his eyes sirius face was buried in his arms and remus was staring deadly at the floor ginny was sobbing openly she had better be alive voldemort hissed at narcissa while one or two of the guards began dragging their fallen comrades down the hall the rest converged on the mound of twisted gold and shattered glass in a circle and began digging through the debris narcissa and snape had resumed their scowling match but voldemort had moved to stand beside a stiff jezabelle at the console and was peering intently at the screen have they found her yet jezabelle shook her head long blonde ponytail swaying not yet there voldemort pointed at the screen and jezabelle moved to zoom in on the space at which he was pointing a pale hand streaked with blood was sticking out of the pile the death eaters had seen it too because they swarmed to that spot and began levitating off the hunks of warped metal and ceiling plaster one grabbed for her wrist to pull her out and the onlookers watched fixatedly as his mask fell off revealing a mouth open in painful screams and his entire body melted into a steaming pile of goo that dripped off hermione immobile hand with syrupy consistency the pile began to rise and fall knocking loose debris clattering down onto the stone floor the hand began to move it twisted and turned to widen the opening around it and was joined by a second hand the massive remains of the chandelier parted like a sliding door and a bloody hermione tumbled out she was exhausted and beaten but she kept fighting as the guards resumed their attack on her the first two she merely punched aside while she regained her strength and the next met with a roundhouse kick that sprayed a stream of blood from his jaw behind him both her arms were seized and she fired blast after blast out of her palms but the guards were holding them tightly away from themselves trapped between them two more death eaters fired glittering red streams into her stunning spells each one sapped her strength but by no means knocked her unconscious as they were intended to their stunners are having no effect my lord jezabelle reported needless what do you suggest i dontcare how they do it just bring her to me grimacing in pain hermione pushed off the ground and flipped herself backwards thus wrenching herself from their grip and when she came right side up again she kicked viciously out at the one on her right the heel of her foot connected solidly with their throat breaking their windpipe and cracking their spine grabbing the fist coming at her back she heaved the attacking death eater over her head and slammed them down onto the stone in front of her denting it she sagged against the wall breathing heavily and blasting off anyone that came near her with weak bursts of energy the visual probe whirred overhead taking in the entire scene as she finally pushed off the wall with a few staggered steps and began to lope down the hall towards the dungeon doors a red burst hit her in the back and sent her sprawling face first onto the ground the six black robed bodies that remained literally fell upon her pinning her to the ground as she fought and flailed to knock them off the probe zoomed down for a closer look as hermione broke free from the hand holding down her head and screamed golden light exploded across the screen and after there was nothing but static and then a black screen the probe has been destroyed jezabelle announced into the following silence and granger snape inquired lowly her fingers flew across the console for a second and then she shook her head the registered camera for that section has also been destroyed waiting for audio confirmation all eyes were on the blonde as she pressed and held a key lifting the speaker back up to her ear she listened intently to a message only she could hear while voldemort breathed down her neck and the prisoners waited in tense apprehension then she lowered the headphones and said capture complete confirmed the intruder is under secure custody jezabelle had the distinct impression that voldemort was smiling underneath the shadowing cowl of his robes bring her to me she nodded and lifted her finger off the key abandoning her post at the console she warily moved to stand beside pansy and draco her eyes on the door it opened moments later to accommodate the four surviving death eaters as they dragged a still struggling hermione behind them a thick iron collar was fastened around her neck so tightly that each forceful yank from one of the four chains held by her captors drew blood and sent her crashing down onto her bruised knees there was no way for her to catch herself either for her wrists were also bound in iron chains she was dragged down the stairs on her side and barely managed to get back onto her feet before she was forced down onto her knees in front of voldemort gryffindors are always so valiant he mused dryly circling the prone girl did you really think you could save the day all by yourself when she didntanswer he crouched in front of her and tipped her face up with the end of his wand she spit into the shadowed expanse of his face and the mix of blood and hot spittle dripped down the collar of his robes how dare you narcissa screamed in outrage and several death eaters had to hold her back voldemort wiped his face with a gloved hand and then pulled back his hood to the startlement of all he looked completely human breaking off one of the manacles over hermione wrist he grabbed it with a gloveless hand even as she was reaching out with clawed fingers for his throat hermione glared up at his smirking face and tried to rip her arm free but he only tightened his grip hermione cried out as his nails broke the surface of her skin and blood welled up over her bruised skin you may not be fresh he sneered but the magic in your blood will more than compensate eyes widening in horror hermione struggles became more frantic you re crazy she screamed yanking back only to be choked by forceful pulls on her collar she twisted around onto her back and managed to get a leg out from underneath her despite the best efforts of her containers and kicked upwards at the side of voldemort face he caught her ankle only inches away and held her in that poor offensive position as his nails continued to bite into her flesh with her now free hand clawing vainly at the iron collar the guards holding the chains all yanked backwards simultaneously bringing her head slamming back onto the stone floor hermione screamed and screamed but there was no one to help her the death eater all stared down at her pitilessly watching eagerly for their lord to regain his power unicorn blood cursed me he murmured sadistically to her as she kicked her held leg vainly and yanked at her arm but bathing in the blood of these innocents will restore me with a sharp pull that nearly dislocated her arm from its socket he lifted her bloody wrist to his mouth his foul hot breath burned the cut skin and hermione whimpered but your i ll drink noo the prisoners were screaming in protest and beating at the bars more light exploded as they tried again to break through with magic however nothing distracted the evil wizard from his ritual and he d nearly covered her flesh with his mouth when a persistent beeping cut through the din what now preston wailed stomping a green heel jezabelle moved to retake her stance at the console but snape pushed her aside and billowed up to the monitors long spindly fingers traced over the screens and searched through the probes with quick strokes of the keys we have a problem with a growl of frustration voldemort shoved hermione back and stood put her in the cells with the others he ordered with a wave of his hand i ll deal with her later as the black robed wizard stalked over to the monitor display the guards holding hermione dragged the bleeding witch across the room and shoved her up against one of the barred walls unlatching her collar they gave her a swift blast to the back and her body was knocked straight through the bars as though they d completely lost their solidity some of the students rushed the cell wall hoping for escape but whatever spell had allowed hermione to pass through was gone now someone was binding the cuts on her wrist and hermione struggled to sit up but was finding it hard to do so now suffering from multiple concussions that same person or maybe it was someone different moved behind her and propped her back up against them holding her with an arm around her waist a hand took hers and familiarity washed over her as her fingers were interlaced with another s remus she groaned and forced her eyes to open he was kneeling beside her all bright gunmetal eyes and warm smiles as he squeezed her hand softly and brushed the hair from her face hermione hadntrealized how much of her had thought she d find him here dead and seeing his face again alive and whole flooded her with relief i so glad you re alright she cried and flung her arms around his neck the arm slipped from her waist now that remus was there to support her remus hugged her tightly and buried his face in her wild curls i thought they d killed you hermione was crying he d rarely ever seen her cry but the hot droplets of liquid splattering on his check and collar were unmistakably tears she pulled back only far enough so that their foreheads were pressed together but it was enough that remus could see the saline tracks down her battered face dontcry he murmured though he wasntsure she d heard him i not going to lose you again she whispered throatily and somehow through all of this they found each others lips it wasntthe first kiss little girls dreamed about remus lower lip was split and hermione were bruised and cracked and both were cold and tasting of iron but they were together again and quite probably near death and it was the kiss they d been waiting forever for i alright she breathed against his chin when they parted with shuddering gasps and gripped his shoulders to brace herself i can stand sirius help her up remus asked as he held her arms the arm was back around her waist and the three of them got her standing again reaching down a bit wobbly hermione grabbed the hand on her hip and squeezed it gratefully thank you she said smiling over her shoulder at sirius after a pause he smiled back i just glad you re okay rubbing at the lump forming on the back of her head she gave him a rueful look before moving forward through the crowded students your definition of okay and mine are vastly different at the bars she caught james attention and waved weakly he ginny and lily all smiled in relief and he blew her a kiss making her smile too elbowing his way through the frightened students ron fell against the bars that separated their two cells and grabbed her hand dontworry she hushed soothingly reaching through she brushed back his ginger bangs with loving care we re going to make it out of this i swear that why i came and harry he asked anxiously at hogwarts she assured him safe ron let out a long low sigh and they gripped one another hands with painful desperation each equally grateful to see the other still alive bringing his white strained knuckles to her lips she kissed his hand softly and they both smiled hermione she looked up at sirius as he placed a hand on her shoulder something going on he whispered and pointed towards snape and voldemort a second intruder snape was muttering hermione could see the grid display from her cell a white blip was moving hastily up the screen how did they get through the defenses too narcissa demanded pink splotches were staining her ivory cheeks in her embarrassment and outrage behind her back preston and another girl were snickering snape collected as ever scarcely granted the hysterical woman a glance as he worked on detaching the magical cameras he came up through the sewer pipes you donthave any more guards left to stop him narcissa him she hissed snape scowled down at her and projected the desired screen up over the blackness of the probe hermione had destroyed he turned to voldemort it harry potter my lord no hermione gasped it wasntpossible and yet there was harry still in his torn tuxedo sneaking along a grimy wall somewhere in the bowels of the manor around his neck hung hermione gold medallion you idiot she whispered in dismay you were supposed to bring it to dumbledore not use it yourself voldemort began to laugh blatantly nonplussed about the whole affair and looked back over his shoulder at a hopeless hermione clutching fretfully to the bars of her cell why do you heroes insist on coming alone it only makes it that much easier for me to kill you no she screamed blasting the cell door with the intent of charring voldemort body to a crisp the magic burst rebounded on her and only remus lupine reflexes kept her from being thrown flat on her back for the umpteenth time flinging herself back at the bars she clawed for the laughing wizard between the gaps if you touch one hair on his head she snarled passionately i wontstop until i kill you brave words for a girl i about to suck dry he reached for her outstretched arm the blood from her wound seeping through the makeshift bandage of remus dress shirt and she recoiled reflexively before steeling her nerve she turned her wrist upwards catching voldemort gaze on the crimson stain and shuddering in disgust as the sight of it ensnared him sirius tried to pull her away from the bars as the evil man stepped closer but she only tightened her grip on the cage and it was remus who pulled his friend away the unspoken words i understand hanging in the air between them testing his bloodlust hermione moved her arm slightly his eyes followed it she repressed another shudder and took a deep breath voldemort reached for her hand and she lashed out raking her nails down his cheek but missing the throat as he stumbled back this time it was remus hands on her shoulders pulling her back within the safety of the cell as voldemort smirked and touched his fingers to the cuts filthy mudblood draco roared how dare you touch our lord voldemort lifted a hand silence draco he ordered to hermione glaring defiantly back at him through the bars he said arentyou the insolent one i wontleave a single drop of blood left to color those pretty cheeks of yours my lord snape said insistently which led one to believe he d been trying to get the wizard attention for some time what shall we do about potter voldemort turned towards the potions master with a sneer let him come after all it the hero s job to save the prisoners isntit he looked over his shoulder at hermione we ve also got her he working his way through the servant quarters snape reported he glanced briefly at hermione and then back down flicking back the long sleeves of his heavy robes voldemort clasped his hands together and turned to survey the cells just how shall we occupy our time waiting for the young mr potter to deign us with his presence it seemed he d taken particular interest in tormenting hermione for each word seemed to be directed towards her he crossed the room and headed straight for one of the cells extending one of his hands he gestured into the crowd there was a shout of surprise painfully familiar and then lily was being pulled straight through the bars as she had been lily james the couple grabbed for one another but voldemort cruelly yanked her out into the hallway just seconds before their fingers touched he left her sprawled on the floor and trying to regain her breath as he moved on to the next cell i was always rather fond of red heads he told hermione silkily she knew exactly who he was pulling out next before he even did it ginny scowled at him as his outstretched hand dragged her up to the bars despite neville and dean trying to hold her back i remember you he smirked charmingly he moved to tip up her chin but she snapped her small white teeth and nearly bit down on the flesh of his finger you ve grown into quite the beauty it almost makes me glad i didntget the chance to steal your life force all those years ago he motioned upwards and ginny hands went to her neck as if some invisible hand was squeezing her throat and lifting her up off the ground she passed through the bars and dean and neville collided painfully into their solid surface still holding the struggling prefect aloft he turned to lily who d pressed herself up against the bars and into james arms he flicked his hand upwards and her knees left the stone to the tune of her hysteric cries trying to clutch to james shirt through the bars stop it hermione screamed as lily cries were choked out by that same invisible force hermione do something james yelled holding tight to lily hand with both of his hermione lifted both her hands crackling with energy and remus could almost see her step into her world of red it wontwork sirius yelled but the brunette couldntstand there and let voldemort do whatever he was planning to her friends ron the redhead fell to his knees and slammed his palms into the stone floor even as hermione began the first of her violent barrage the cell wall was perpetually alight with her energy as every spell she sent at the bars exploded in a stinging blast of sparks and bowled back over her this time she was ready and as each blow hit her stronger than the first she dug her heels into the stone floor and pushed right back beside her ron hands were starting to glow golden orange get down remus ordered with all the authority of a prefect and the students in hermione cell all went down onto their knees and bellies they threw their arms protectively over their heads as the embers that made it past hermione rained down on them voldemort was walking towards the room center the two flailing girls floating in front of him and waiting for him at the edge of a dark smeared circle was narcissa athame in hand it was still coated with the blood of bellatrix black snape hovered anxiously behind her hands folded into the sleeves of his robe the first scuttle went unnoticed as narcissa lifted the knife in anticipation for the first strike as lily was swung tantalizingly in front of her the blonde shrieked though when the second scuttle sent a fuzzy body across her foot she jumped and the dagger dropped to the stone what voldemort demanded something something a across my foot narcissa stammered she whirled around searching for the culprit but there was nothing only when she bent to pick up the athame did the black bodies came scuttling out from the shadows in a great ebony wave of legs and beady eyes she screamed and stumbled back into snape who seemed to only catch her out of reflex as the flesh fed spiders of the malfoy dungeons swarmed up over their legs pinching and biting with sudden vehemence the students instantly began to cry out in fear but it was without reason as the large spiders seemed quite content to stay in the open hallway and crawl over the disgusted death eaters the arachnid focus seemed to be on voldemort and he was invisible up to his chest in scuttling black bodies before he finally flung down the two girls to attack the annoying pestilence the two spots where they fell were instantly cleared of spiders as if they d sensed their descent and the two girls lay in clear gray circles among the throng of wild creatures narcissa silky blonde hair coming out of its once sleek chignon as she frantically blasted off the disgusting spiders she hadnteven known were breeding in her own house summoned the dagger out of the swarm of bodies with a spell and handle clutched white knuckled in her hand she shoved snape away from her and began wading with fanatical determination toward the immobile ginny what is going on voldemort roared but his minions were too preoccupied with their own problems to answer and hermione had just noticed narcissa ron she yelled fervently and in the blink of an eye rats the size of quaffles appeared out of every crack in the wall and scurried up the skirt of narcissa dress she cried out in pain as they bit into her but she only swatted them off before continuing again remus hermione tried desperately tiring quickly off the magical beating being waged on her stop narcissa bring her down what can i do remus exclaimed whatever it is sirius said do it quick the brunet nodded and set to work even as hermione collapsed from the strain of her futile endeavors and fell back into sirius waiting arms remus was awarded with a welcome distraction as the door swung open and harry barreled in sword in hand and wand in the other he surveyed the scene quickly and lifted his wand in ready defense is this a bad time just one drink and i ll break your bones with my bare hands voldemort swore and whirled around to face hermione behind him narcissa began to scream and clutch her head i sorry bella she wailed pitifully and staggered into one of the walls remus gaze made a straight line to her forehead hermione too weak to defend herself turned into sirius and hugged him waiting for voldemort to snatch her out of her cell and continue his barbaric ritual of blood you stay away from her hermione looked up in surprise as harry leapt at voldemort back riding them both to the ground only to be flung back into the spiders that parted for his collision by an outraged burst of energy from voldemort both wizards got to their feet and went at each other with ferocious abandon and deadly spells as they fought ron continued to aid remus power by flowing all the creatures towards the psychologically distraught woman as the lycan bent all his will and truth upon the fragile mind of narcissa black malfoy it was for the cause cousin she moaned clawing her nails down her face and staggering about always the cause what going on with narcissa pansy trilled in her high screechy voice as draco fought to keep the painful spiders and rats off the both of them dontlook at me like that the sharp faced woman screamed into thin air you would have done it too she totally lost it preston exclaimed viciously exploding a rat with a wave of her wand hermione slipped out of sirius arms and pressed herself flat against the floor the creepy arachnids with their hundred faceted eyes skittered out of the way of the arm she extended out through the bars the vibrant mound of orange curls was still a foot or so out of reach lily she whispered desperately lily the body shifted and slowly a face turned to look across the dusty floor at her lily listen to me she whispered lowly i know you re tired and i know you re hurting and i sorry i didntdo a better job of training you but please i need you to do this take my hand lily moaned and lifted herself painfully off the ground to pull her arm out from underneath her she collapsed back to the stone in a poof of dust and dirt and could only manage labored breaths for a few precious seconds achingly slow her hand started to slide towards the bars hermione glanced up at narcissa wildly waving around the dagger and then over to harry now bleeding profusely from one arm as he squared off against voldemort lily you have got to take my hand what are you trying to do sirius asked leaning over her in concern a girl screamed oh my god and remus fell onto his side beside her sweating and trembling hermione didntdare take her eyes off of the struggling lily but she heard enough to piece together what had happened draco my god she dead pansy wailed hysterically she stabbed herself jezabelle voice was disbelieving hermione was pressed so hard against the bar that the metal cylinders bruised her cheek and her shoulder screamed in protest lily was straining her fingertips to reach hermione hand reach i ll slit her throat preston had pulled the athame from narcissa breast hermione was stretched as far as she d ever thought possible and it was now up to lily to bridge the distance between them hermione was marshalling the last bit of magic left inside her all she needed was a millimeter of contact tears of pain leaking down the corners of lily beautiful jade eyes she dragged herself that last half centimeter and the two girls met in the merest grazing of fingertips it was enough their fingers stuck together instantly as if cemented together and hermione sent her power coursing through their very skin and into lily where there were no force fields against her magic sirius instantly grabbed her hand and the flow of energy increased tenfold lily body was quickly filled to the brim and the excess magic seeped out through her very skin and flooded the dungeon in a flesh prickling ripple though steadfast and sturdy for countless centuries the cell walls had not been designed with even the smallest imaginings of such a power buffeting it on both sides only a handful of seconds under the assault and the wall of hermione cell was blasted clear off its hinges dangling off the brink of consciousness hermione fought to ride the wave of power to its completion like a row of dominoes the cell walls exploded outwards down the line of her wall and then back up along the opposite james leapt out of his prison and covered ginny unconscious body with his own as the heap of metal blasted over his head and collided with preston standing knife raised over him and with a screech she was batted across the room remus shielded the immobile hermione as sirius lead the charge of students out into the hall ron and his group not far behind the death eaters were overwhelmed and despite their greater experience the sheer numbers beat them and then to the surprise of all there jezabelle fell upon draco with her wand as he moved to attack james in the back right behind her was snape wand ripe with purple magic that he blasted into voldemort side and he and harry forced him back traitors the dark lord hissed how dare you jezabelle looked up at him defiantly as she helped sirius carry lily across the room to james you re a washed up old fool she snapped callously i was never part of your cause voldemort snarling in rage launched a crucio at her but snape stepped in the way and deflected it with a powerful protego spell it over voldemort he sneered and raised his wand to attack again and then something odd happened as lily was deposited into james arms a white pillar of light consumed them and sirius buffeting jezabelle gently to the outside ron jostled back by the crowd of students rushing to escape the dungeons was suddenly stuck in a similar pillar of light that ensconced remus hermione and himself between the two beams of light harry was covered in a spotlight of gold snape stepped back warily beside jezabelle and the two watched in confusion this is it sirius said the aureus prophecy hermione unconscious body and lily were levitated up into the air and in a flash golden beams laced out from harry to the both of them and then between one another pinning voldemort in a triangle of ancient magic it hadntbeen the golden trio after all but the golden points of the star that fulfilled the prophecy they d been fiddling with since the beginning of term man heart and magic hermione was the most powerful witch in this age and lily awesome power in protecting her young child proved her to be the most powerful of her age harry filled with lily powerful blood and bonded through souls with hermione was the link between them not to say that he was merely standing about while all this happened voldemort was truly fighting to break free of the invisible triangle that held him prisoner the ritual however once enacted was impossible to breach he roared and cursed and filled the space with the sparks of his dark magick but nothing could save the dark wizard now sirius and james were pulled to each side of lily as her mouth opened and she chanted love james light flickered power sirius flashed child the trio light was sucked into harry beam and its intensity doubled poor hermione who d given so much of herself in the last few hours was now unwakeable at the end of it all making all her long and psychologically painful hours of training seem all for nothing arms and legs dangling downwards as a thread appeared to suspend her by her waist she hung like the dead above their heads despite her immobility both remus and ron were bumped to the sides as their friends had been without moving her lips or even appearing to stir from her stupor hermione voice echoed eerily over the proceedings heart remus glowed and blushed blood ron pulsed soul the trio lights twisted into harry and the gold light around him was blindingly impossible to look at wand outstretched voldemort charged at harry the sickening green light of an avada sparking at the wood tip radiating calm and tranquility harry lifted his arm and touched the tip of his index finger to voldemort forehead freezing him mid charge consecrate was all the bespectacled boy said and all the pent up light flowed down his arm in a rush and into that single point on the evil wizard forehead a thunderous right noise filled the room in such a blank roar that all sound was utterly blocked out and hermione and lily were set back onto the ground white light inked in voldemort outline from his feet to the crown of his head as though his evil visage was being whited out and then he was simply winked out of existence all the paranormal light and sound vanished just as suddenly as he had gone restoring the dungeon to its original shadowed darkness and the six remaining points joined hermione in blissful unconsciousness not a single life had been lost on the side of good that halloween night and though the events at the evening climax seemed some fanatical myth to those who had not witnessed it no one else was stepping up with a different story the line of students outside the hospital wing waiting to deposit their meager offerings of candy on the bedsides of seven recuperating patients was inexplicable otherwise their names were spoken openly in the hallways and there was even word of special awards being prepared in their honor but to the seven it was enough to simply be together and the week they spent in the infirmary was a pleasant one the hard choices still ahead between them were left undiscussed and unmentioned it was a silent agreement that they would at least have this week in one another company joy and laughter voldemort was gone forever and though the horror and tyranny he imposed over two generations could never be undone or repaired the people of the world both magic and non were now free to begin picking up the pieces of their broken lives they were free to see their families again or seek out the scattered members or even start one of their own they were free to laugh to learn and to live without fear but most of all they were free to become the carefree teenagers they d been before the war had stolen their childhood full of light hope and a vibrant love completed 5 11 05 3 50 pm posted 5 11 05 4 00 pm a n here it is sorry for the

perhaps a few sneak peaks winkwink enjoy and go out and read a book today right now hermione granger hadntleft her home for an entire week not even the children racing through the halls at dawn woke her until her standard rousing at a quarter til noon dressing gown always hanging off her shoulders baring her slip of a nightgown she d morose around her bed chambers for hours until her own frizzed mop of curls frustrated her back into the warm tangle of her bed and into another half day of sleep on this particular evening in the third week of november she d ransacked her bed and taken on her disorganized wanderings the pale blue comforter from it with it wrapped around her waist she was sprawled alongside the grate in her floor waiting for the sounds of movement through the vents harry she ventured at half past three shuffling and then the familiar sound of harry desk chair being dragged underneath the ceiling vent hermione are you coming down to tea today hermione groaned feeling the metal pressing into her cheek as she turned to her side i detest tea a snort then harry echoic voice you love tea babe she sighed well i detest it today you haventcome down all week hermione chest burned and her fingers curled in the tiny slots of the grate i i miss them harry her best friend was silent for a long time but hermione waited patiently for the words she heard every day this wasntthe first time they d exchanged these thoughts but like a slat being wiped clean hermione awoke each afternoon with renewed gloom and lackluster outlook they had to go hermione he told her for what must have been the billionth time and yet his voice was still sympathetic and kind they could have stayed she argued vehemently she frowned at the grate as though it were the culprit i we were here arentwe good enough harry chuckled and she automatically flushed you alone were reason enough for them to stay much less ron and i so you agree with me then this was a new twist to the tired conversation must i always remind you my soul you were the one who told them to go hermione rolled frustrated away from the vent and sat up with her back to the window her robe was falling down into the crooks of her elbows and the glass was freezing cold even through the thick downy layers of her blanket her silence had caused the young wizard in the room below hers to begin calling her name up through the vent but for the moment she couldntbring herself to move much less speak fact she had been purposefully secluding herself opinion she was being dramatic fact she wasnt theory being her best friend and accepted soul mate no matter how often they repeated the scenario harry was supposed to be supportive and understanding each time complaint harry was being a meanie and totally dashing her logical theory couldnthe see there was no reason for her to leave her bedroom much less her home granted her home was now exceedingly large and there wasntmuch she needed that wasntprovided for her on some floor there wasntanything save for large zoo animals that she couldntfind within these sturdy walls without ever having to venture out into the world fudge after a fair deal of influencing from dumbledore had handed over the deed to malfoy manor to harry when presenting him with the awards and gifts of the wizarding world at graduation not only was it now their home but it was also a wizarding shelter for witches wizards and magical creatures to take refuge in for as long as they needed while the magical world underwent its post war reconstruction most had had their homes decimated during the raids and skirmishes others waylaid their quest for lost loved ones here to rest and regain their strength all were in need of a decent mattress and a hot meal of course she and the others did all that they could for each person and family using their vast connections and personal pull to find jobs homes and even missing persons hermione jane granger if you dontcome downstairs this instant i ll never speak to you again hermione rolled her eyes harry could be such a drama wizard some times that like a whole two flights of stairs she grimaced calling down into the vent like a petulant child a husky chuckle and then it rude for a hostess not to great her friends that was not harry voice comforter abandoned hermione was already tearing out of her bedroom and nearly falling down the stairs in her night clothes a couple smiled knowingly at her as she sprinted past them her bare feet slapping against the wood floors and a trio of girls playing dolls giggled as she took the final five steps of the staircase in a wild leap she d almost made it to harry bedroom when the door opened and the group inside began to exit she attacked the first one out with a near tackling hug but he grabbed her around the waist mid jump and spun her joyously around you re back hermione exclaimed happily wrapping her arms around his neck as if she d never let go crikey pigeon sirius teased we ve only been gone a few weeks oh right only just after we all almost died that not nerve wracking she complained as she was set back down on the solid floor that was months ago you crazy bird james opened his arms as hermione gave a gleeful cry and the two friends embraced ugh you re a mess hermione though it understandable you d fall to pieces without me here hermione punched him hard on the shoulder proving that she hadntlost her strong right hook after the war end while sirius openly mocked his whimpering best mate hermione was met by lily they kissed one another cheeks and hugged tightly before harry squeezed his arms around the both of them and the triumvirate stumbled around in a bubbly bout of laughter and smiling faces how was it hermione asked did you get any time to work on the wedding plans merlin beard no the redhead exclaimed when they all parted dumbledore would use his occulumency to bring more of our memories to the forefront then hestia jones would come and give us history lessons over everything that happened since the 70s then we d give some demos for the dada classes and then dumbledore would meet with us again to discuss anything we remembered over the course of the day oh it was so exhausting hermione frowned i still say you could have learned all that here three weeks was such a long time for you to be gone i believe you were the one who said we d be able to focus better if we undertook our acclimation to the future away from home lily winked knowingly as hermione face lit up and she spun around remus was leaning against the frame of harry bedroom door smiling she looked ridiculous in her shabby robe with rumpled hair and nightgown but still she attempted to frown at him why does everybody start listening to me now i am not the voice of reason here she exclaimed hands on hips so i dontever have to listen to you again the lycan grinned baring two rows of perfect white teeth it was enough to send hermione running into his arms and the couple stumbled around holding one another with a delirious sort of happiness and the simple contact between them seemed to totally restore hermione from her earlier moping mindset let go have some tea and let ron know you ve all returned hermione announcement was readily answered by sounds of eager agreement but as she moved to join the group headed towards the kitchen remus held her back only sirius noticed she wasntwith them and he stopped to look back feeling the warm hand clasping her own hermione felt surely her face was glowing like a silly school girl as she blew sirius a kiss and motioned for him to go on without her his return smile was a bit hesitant but he bowed gallantly to her request and turned down the hall gentle hands turned her face back and her lips met with remus in a kiss that left her mouth burning and tasting of chocolate and honey he held both her hands with interlocked fingers but it wasnthis hold that kept hermione body pressed against his you know i didntthink it was possible for someone to miss another person as much as i missed you this last month he whispered against her forehead then i saw you yes yes hermione grumbled i know i look frightful i would have taken a bath if i d known you were coming back today he chuckled a rumble that ran through his chest and through her thin nightclothes we wanted to surprise you i am surprised she insisted good he murmured and brushed back a russet curl with their joined hands hermione swayed against him with a sly smile and he shuffled his feet after a chuckle and all too soon they were waltzing smoothly around the wide hall they needed no music or rhythm because holding to one another was enough to glide them back and forth in their less than ball worthy apparel you know hermione grinned the last time we danced like this we didntpart exactly the way i d hoped remus smiled softly the look that thrilled her all the way down to her toes knowing it was just for her and made her give up on fighting her lovesickness remind me to rectify that at the end of our dance she blushed despite her better judgment and looked down with eyes aglow being equal heights hermione could rest her chin easily on his shoulder and as she did so remus matched her position and began to whisper into her ear sweet promises and verses that brought her so much joy she closed her eyes and let them wash over her when the warm breathed words lulled hermione was so filled with his heart racing sentiments that she couldntcontain her own any longer and the heavy words were spoken just as quietly as his whispers in her ear their verses were private and personal lines only for one another ears i so happy you stayed one hot droplet hit his neck and then other and that was it there would be no more tears from hermione granger as they danced remus pressed a kiss to her temple and rubbed her back the four of us were given another chance at life you gave us that chance the timeline is still the same as always so there no reason for us to go back his grip on her tightened causing her to look up at him curiously through the loose curls of her ponytail he smiled at her but there are so many reasons for us to stay you re mine hermione had no answer to that because she could not find the words she laid her cheek against his shoulder and was lulled into an easy relaxed state by the thrumming of his heart against her breast and the warm musky scent she could almost taste on his throat you re sirius reason too remus almost stopped their brilliant dance but hermione kept them going with a shake of her head into his neck where she d now buried her face no he stays because of james because you stayed the three of you are inseparable hermione you cantargue with me i truth remember remus sighed a rustling of her tangled curls besides lily already confirmed it sirius stayed because he still loves you hermione felt so warm and safe in these arms and she knew they would only perfectly fit around her here she was more at home than walking the halls of the manor she didntwant to think about such things such complications to this perfect moment the faintest movement of the hairs on the back of remus neck was the only disturbance that belied hermione soft sigh i know she whispered he stopped their swaying and not one of her subtle nudges could restart them again his hand hovered briefly over the locket she still wore clasped around her neck and then he looked down at their remaining joined hands you might not have believed me before but really i want you to do whatever makes you happy hermione kissed his cheek and goaded him into raising his head with more kisses along his jaw and under his chin there wasnta moment you were gone she said throatily that i wasntthinking about you and if that not love then i dontcare because i not letting you go she met his gaze with firm eyes while her hands moved to grip his arms i ll keep you until you walk away she swore and even then i ll never stop trying to get you back this was the moment both outgoing in friends but introverted in love the earth had had to go full circle to bring them to this point of openness and hope their trust was implicit their loyalty proven but it was their emotions over which they struggled to gain control of now the pair was long graduated and crossed into adulthood but for all their intellect not a single scenario they d theorized in their heads could have accurately foreshadowed this moment i believe you he answered in his even tone and i not going anywhere hermione let out a short cry as her elation overflowed and she threw herself exuberantly into remus perfect arms they were both laughing with too much happiness to make long of the kisses but that didntstop either of them from trying as they staggered around the hall remus folding his arms beneath her bottom and hers wrapped around his neck as she dropped kisses across his jaw and lips from her advantageous height they had one another and their combined strength would keep them both going as they figured out exactly what love meant and if that was what they felt or if it was something greater they had their friends shelter and a purpose an abundance of laughter life and an undeniable feeling that was perhaps this thing the movies called love the world was far from being perfect but to hermione and remus it was getting pretty close a n the voting booths have now opened because it a bit of a minor subplot at the moment i haventgiven much thought to hermione pairing i actually had a lively debate will the guy in my study class on whether or not an academic female would go for another academic male or for more of a bad boy well now you get to decide review and let me know whether you think lovable remus deserves hermione or if charming sirius needs to get the girl and yes sorry but those are your only choices i ve left opportunities open for the both of them so it could go either way true to her word hermione bounded down the stairs the next morning with boisterous enthusiasm checking the underside of her wrist for the time she hurried up the opposite staircase and knocked loudly on the door harry ron wake up she called in a phony sing song voice you ll miss breeeeakfast the door swung open revealing a very rumpled sirius in nothing but a pair of pajama pants hermione though an only child had spent the last five years keeping her two male friends on track and by now the sight of a shirtless teenage boy was nothing out of the ordinary she hardly even noticed sirius yawn turned to a look of surprise as he realized who was standing at the door morning sunshine she teased brightly and slipped past him into the room he made a grab for her but he was still groggy from sleep and his reflexes were a bit too slow to stop the unaware hermione hermione i dontthink good morning remus she said pleasantly passing straight by the red faced boy as he scrambled to find his shirt she approached the first bed remus hurrying to redress and sirius regarding her with an amazed expression and when she found its lumpy shaped occupant still asleep she frowned ronald weasley she called bouncing down onto the side of the bed when he didntstir she gave a dramatic sigh and flung herself back onto the lump beneath the blankets someone grunted from under her and there was a very distinct oy herm nee geroff you re heavy this comment was rewarded with a sharp prod from hermione wand and a bedraggled ron tumbled out of the sheets and onto the floor shaking his fist in hermione direction he heaved himself off the floor and blearily made his way to his trunk wearing only a pair of quidditch bedecked boxers i told best friend ron i d come and wake him up if he slept in didnti hermione said in response mocking ron earlier words he didntseem the list bit uncomfortable with hermione walking around the boy dormitory while he was half naked and hermione was ignoring him completely her job of waking him now accomplished and she moved on to harry while ron grumbled something inarticulate about her head stuck in his clothes chest luckily for harry the commotion had already awoken him and he was just emerging from the covers messy ebony head peaking out around his pillow when a well aimed disarming spell from hermione knocked him straight out of bed head first his t shirt and shorts were rumpled but he was fully dressed which was more than the rest of them could boast while her two mates stumbled around getting dressed she turned to sirius and remus who had since located his wayward pajama shirt oh she interjected pensively i dontsuppose you have any uniforms do you she asked though it was more a statement than a question her fingers clasped her chin for a moment and then her eyes lit up and she snapped her fingers easily dodging clothes and quills that lay scattered about the floor already she hurried to the large wardrobe against the third wall only stopping along the way to pick up books boys she could be heard muttering really it only the first day of term she said a bit louder when she returned from her excursion it was without books and two boys uniforms in her arms instead she handed the slightly smaller set to remus who answered with a small thank you so do you guys get to dress her too sirius asked buttoning his shirt hermione laughed you wish black ron taunted allowing hermione to brush imaginary lint off his robes ron and harry are completely hopeless she told sirius and remus wistfully i should have knocked them to the curb years ago she glanced back at them while she was talking and did a double take before tsking disparagingly sirius was startled when she was suddenly in front of him hands reaching upwards for his face but she was only fixing the mess he d made of his tie going up on her tiptoes to lift his collar and straighten out the loop and it seems mr black she said her eyes twinkling merrily as she tightened the knot all the way up to his throat that you are as hopeless as the rest he smirked down at her as she flattened his collar back down and as soon as she turned away he yanked the knot down past his shoulders i ll let you dress me anytime pigeon he responded charmingly sirius remus admonished in a hushed tone i have a name you know was hermione slightly irritated response sirius smiled winningly is that so love he asked the husk to his voice more prominent as he leaned against a bedpost in the way that made young witches swoon in their mary janes hermione merely ignored him remus here seems to be the only one of you lot who can properly dress himself she scolded saving a warm smile for remus he smiled back i do what i can he said and hermione laughter echoed up the stairwell behind her do you think we could get her to do that every morning sirius joked waggling his eyebrows suggestively as the boys followed after her ron groaned rubbing his head ruefully are you kidding he exclaimed try getting her to stop lily and james were already waiting with hermione in the common room when the four boys tumbled down the stairs they had on new uniforms as well though they looked much more awake than the rest they d slept in hermione room merlin beard hermione harry mumbled scratching his head what time is it quarter til eight the same time i ve woken you up the past six years she reminded him pulling her satchel onto her shoulder she smiled at the marauders sorry if you feel a bit rushed sometimes i forget ron and harry are the only ones who can eat breakfast in ten minutes i could wake you up earlier if you d like you donthave to lily insisted we wouldntwant to inconvenience you ron snorted and hermione shot him a look before waving lily comment away nonsense i ve been up for ages please tell me you haventstarted homework already hermione harry pleaded if you thought more about your schoolwork and less about saving the world you would have too she shot back defensively and pushed through the portrait out into the hall she a piece of work isntshe sirius smirked leaning against the door frame aye harry agreed but she a good friend she sounds like your type of girl moony james added thumping the smaller boy on the back remus flushed dontbe daft james harry and ron were trying to get their shocked expression in order as the marauder boys talked about their best friend like well teenage boys it wouldnthave been so weird if they hadntseen sirius and remus as men in their thirties and if lily and james werentharry parents ok so it could have been a lot less weird the conversation continued down the hall until they caught up with hermione at which point they were smart enough to change topics harry got a hold of her satchel and tugged her backwards by it until they walked at the same pace how could you possible have gotten your homework already he asked resignedly knowing he d have to hear it sooner or later hermione had the decency to blush i had all my professors owl their lesson plans with my term letter she explained quickly i would have started sooner but we were so busy this holiday hermione harry and ron groaned simultaneously what she exclaimed you know i assisting professor snape this term i had to memorize the lesson plans and snivellus james blurted out works here ron nodded darkly i still dontsee why you have to work for that git he hates gryffindors it ll look good on my transcript she shrugged indifferently to their arguments besides i really like potions and i good at it all he ll do is billow around and insult me personally no matter how broody he gets he canthurt my transcript because he thinks my hair is too bushy or that i an insufferable know it all she quoted the last with a rather good impersonation of snape nasally voice they all laughed at her accurate portrayal and ron threw an arm around her shoulders do i even want to know how long you ve been up he asked with his normally joking disposition present in his voice since half past she answered innocently enough ron eyes narrowed half past what best friend hermione five he groaned loudly and started banging his forehead on her shoulder she just rolled her eyes and kept walking we didntget back to the common room until past one lily recounted aloud with more than a little incredulity to her tone you dontlook like you ve only had four hours of sleep sirius declared appearing at her other shoulder and looking down at her the sides of her hair had been barretted back giving him a clear view of her face how do i look she asked evenly sirius literally stopped walking in surprise and she held his gaze for a second before turning back to ron as they neared the great hall doors leaving sirius behind james and lily passed by him james hands in his pockets and lily holding loosely to his arm she merely smiled in a knowing sort of way passing but james didntbother hiding his snickering smooth mate was remus softly teasing comment before he followed after lily and james sirius shaken out of his stupor jogged to catch up she feisty he remarked rubbing his chin he watched hermione laugh shamelessly at something ron had said to her sharp as a razor james affirmed he grinned wolfishly at sirius you think you re up to the challenge padfoot she certainly full of surprises was his distracted reply hermione ron and harry were waiting for them at the large doors ready harry asked they all nodded now we ll see if dumbledore was right he heaved the doors open and the group stepped inside casually imperceptibly hermione moved in front of the group while harry and ron slipped off to the sides centering the marauder in a dense triangle sirius wouldnthave noticed it if he hadntstill been looking at hermione she went to smooth her skirts and made a small movement with her wrist hermione wand was out from merlin knows where and by the position of her arm she held it hidden in the pleats of her skirt sirius knew without looking that ron and harry had drawn their wands as well but he wasntcertain his friends had noticed any changes in the three they really were ready for the worst but no one so much as acknowledged their entrance those who did look up went quickly back to their breakfast rushing to finish before class everyone memory had been modified the seven of them sat down at the end of the gryffindor table ron harry and hermione looking as normal and relaxed as ever sirius sat on her right and lily took her left sitting at the end of the long table with james across from her next to him were remus ron and harry mione pass the pancakes ron asked before he d even finished seating himself with both hands hermione lifted the laden platter from down by the end over to ron reach she d put her wand away and sirius hadnteven seen her do it helping himself to some bacon and sausage before it was snatched away by james for lily who was too polite to do it herself he leaned over to whisper conspiratorially into hermione ear dontthink i didntsee that pigeon hermione smiled into her goblet of pumpkin juice but not before she told him off for not using her proper name arentyou going to eat lily asked realizing hermione plate was empty as she tried to scrape the last semblances of butter from the dish already did but thanks she responded politely effectively stirred from her mental rant of stupid nicknames hermione eats whenever it convenient for her studies harry informed them swallowing a large bite of food which means never ron elaborated laughing at his own joke i did my work down in the kitchens this morning so i wouldntwake anyone she told them i ate there she pulled her book bag into her lap and pulled a stack of parchments out i got everyone schedules from dumbledore already she handed them out and i had a few extra minutes before i had to wake up harry and ron so i went back and compared the maps of hogwarts from both our times just to make sure none of your classes got moved she told the marauders they should all be the same except transfiguration is on the first floor not the third if you get in a fix ask a portrait and they ll help you out harry was shaking his head at her and he and ron exchanged a look but she ignored them well while i d love to stay and talk with such terrible friends she jibbed brusquely after a glance at her watch i promised professor knoll i d help set up today lesson lily glanced at her schedule brushing her long red locks over her shoulder defense against the dark arts we have that first we ll come with you ron suggested but it was more a spray of toast crumbs than anything else why dontyou digest your food first she suggested and stood up she was half turned to go when some sudden thought made her turn back you like defense against the dark art dontyou remus she asked would you like to come with sure he readily agreed smiling he wiped his mouth off on his napkin and pushed his plate back so he could stand his schedule he folded into a neat square and tucked into his pocket before coming around to hermione side we ll see you in a little bit hermione said in parting and she and remus head out of the great hall james was the one who said it but sirius was the one whose eyes followed them out looks like another challenger just stepped into the ring granger come move these cages hermione rolled her eyes at remus and left him to finish distributing the wooden stands to each table she d hoped that something familiar might make him feel more at home here in the future she wasntsure where to start for the others but harry might have an idea she d ask him when he got here she hurried to the front of the room where her professor was standing behind her desk professor knoll who now starting her second consecutive year held the record for holding the position the longest was a loud slightly crazed woman in her late fifties she liked wearing robes of various vibrant colors and pointy witches hats with large feathers and gems when she got excited her crinkly hair would begin falling out of the loose twist in graying brown wisps she also had a very long wooden pointer she was fond of waving around as hermione hurried through the aisle knoll took said pointer and rapped it along the bars of the metal cage on the pedestal up front it made a clanking noise like that of an inmate cup rattling across the prison bars come on come on the woman barked put that cage up there on that hook right up there the stick was flourished around in the air bumping every few swings the dangling chain from which the cage was going to be hung hermione dragged a stool underneath the hook and went to pick up the cage it was heavier than she d originally thought but she was reluctant to levitate it on the chance that it would leave a magic residual irritating to the creature that would be sitting in said cage tucking her wand behind her ear she shifted the gold gilded cage in her arms and climbed up onto the stool it had a bit of a wobble to it at first but it stabilized after a moment she had to prop the bottom on her hip to free the hand necessary to grab the chain and she hooked it to the top of the cage gradually letting go until she was sure it wouldntfall she brushed her hands off on her skirt and looked down remus was holding her stool steady unconsciously hermione felt her face flush soft red spreading across her cheeks it was true that ron and harry were never so considerate and it was an entirely foreign gesture but there was just the tiny hint of something else the something that had made her blush when she was confidant she could speak properly she thanked him and using his shoulders to balance herself hopped off the stool avoiding eye contact she skirted around him and busied herself with rechecking the supplies on each table everything there remus voice came from right behind her hermione jumped right right she stammered of course she saw his eyebrows go up in surprise and cursed at herself she probably sounded like some rambling idiot get it together hermione just giving it all its proper three times check over she justified pulling her wits back around herself he chuckled softly at something his eyes falling to the ground before rising back to meet hers they were gunmetal blue the color of an overcast sky i already did he said revealing the cause of his humor lips twitching at the corners hermione couldnthelp but smile softly oh was all she managed bloody hell both of them jumped at the booming curse professor knoll was brandishing her wooden pointer between them like a sword if the two of you beat around the bush anymore you ll uproot it she swore noisily to which hermione burned bright red and remus had a face to match the two of you have been going at it like this since last term we have hermione blurted out incredulously and i getting bloody tired of it knoll told them in a warning sort of voice so just stop flitting about and have at it will you her blunt demand was punctuated by the loud smack of wood on wood her pointing stick slamming onto the top of her desk they glanced awkwardly at one another and immediately looked away again turning even redder the spell hermione mumbled turning pink at the implications of her massive memory altercation sorry speak up dear he canthear you like that hermione had actually lifted a hand to shield her flushed face from remus and knoll when they were both saved by an entry into the room it was sirius followed promptly by james who was sporting a fine pair of ass ears probably courtesy of sirius sirius remus called i wanted to talk to about the thing that er the thing we were talking about earlier he rambled practically running to the other boy james let me help you with those hermione said nearly simultaneously though more articulately than remus she didntrun but the clicking of her mary jane shoes was furious against the cobble floors james had stopped chasing sirius and they both stared in bewilderment as the pair descended upon them james helpfully sat down in a desk so hermione could banish his donkey appendages but sirius ignored the flustered remus looking over the shorter boy to hermione what the matter pigeon stop calling me that she snapped cheeks still slightly flushed from her earlier embarrassment james shot sirius a confused look as hermione continued to fuss with his hair even after the ears were gone sirius just shrugged looking just as puzzled hermione james soothed slowly reaching up and taking a hold of her wrists he looked concerned they re gone the red flared back to life in her cheeks right sorry are you al james didntget to finish harry she rushed her relief a weight tangible to the rest of the room harry was now standing in the doorway ron and lily behind him hermione everyone seemed to be giving her that befuddled look today help me get this last cage up she insisted grabbing a hold of his sleeve and pulling him up with her to the front of the class along the way he deposited his bag on a chair and jogged to meet her pace so that she no longer had to drag him by the cuff he started to ask her what was the matter her flustered and antsy behavior an undeniable giveaway but she set about moving the stool to underneath the second hook and he had no choice but the pick the cage off the floor and carry it over to her as she took it out of his hands she leaned forward to whisper in his ear so that no one else would hear that stupid spell worked was what she said harry pulled back to give her a quizzical look the whole school thinks i secretly in love with remus she hissed mortified beyond belief he stared at her a moment and then he started to laugh hermione scowled and wrenched the cage out of his hands harry just doubled over with laughter a seething hermione climbed up and fastened the second cage on the hook glaring all the while at the wall across from her it not funny you re right he choked out it hilarious she jumped off with an angry clack onto the cobblestones as soon as she was finished and the first thing she did was give him a violent punch in the arm he wasntlaughing anymore ow i hope it leaves a horrid bruise she told him in frustration he dismissed her with a roll of his eyes well you dontreally do you dontwhat she huffed like him dontbe an idiot hermione scoffed crossing her arms over her chest she lowered her voice i knew him when he was twenty years older than me harry i mean come on you knew sirius in his thirties too he added by this time hermione had lost any semblance of understanding what their conversation was now about what does that have to do with anything harry shook his head and pulled the stool behind him and back beside the professor desk you can be as dense as ron sometimes he told her and shut your mouth he staring hermione looked back automatically sirius was staring at her intently bright blue eyes smoldering he smiled that lop sided half smile she d thought only harry could perfect and she was blushing yet again quickly she turned back to harry this is weird she whispered sirius and remus dontseem to share your discomfort he trailed off sticking his hands in his robe pockets he turned and strolled back to the room rear you re not going to help me with this hermione accused but she was talking to his back oh no he called back over his shoulder this is going to be fun i hate you she hissed vehemently glaring daggers at his back his response was then you wontmind if i sit with lily and james no harry but he was already sitting down next to his mum easily joining into the conversation they d been having before him he was ignoring her classmates were now starting to swarm in as the time for class to start drew near and she had to push her way to where ron was sitting with seamus finnegan there was still an open seat at the table thank merlin she hurried to occupy it but when she got close enough to hear their conversation she stopped short quidditch yuck unfortunately for her her moment indecision was all it took for dean thomas to step up and slide into her desired seat frell hermione there a seat open back here at remus and sirius table glaring at harry with every ounce of loathing she possessed hermione backtracked and headed for the last place on earth she wanted to be sitting the last table of the middle row harry was two tables up on the left and ron was two ahead in the same row both too far away if she needed an emergency rescue steeling herself up she walked briskly to the table where sirius and remus were sitting and just her luck was forced to take the chair in between them some days just suck and some days fate draws your name out of a hat and decides to make it a living hell hermione was thinking this just might be one of those days sirius voters had an overwhelming turnout after the last chapter and he now come from behind to take the lead putting the totals thus sirius 9 remus 7 and for those hoping for a threesome 2 i keep the vote updated on my bio if you re ever wondering oh and oodles of love to all of you who have so faithfully reviewed there should be two more posts at least put up over the weekend next chapter training hooah once again hermione was up bright and early the next day putting the finishing touches on the astronomy chart due next week she sipped the steaming cup of coffee the house elves had sent up and smiled at the scaled taste and then took note of the time packing all her parchments neatly back into her bag along with her book she went to go wake lily the only girl in their dorm still asleep lily hermione called shaking the redhead gently lily wake up there was a sighing yawn from the far side of the bed and lily rolled over to face her green eyes blinking steadily awake morning she yawned hermione adjusting the strap of her satchel stepped back so lily could swing her legs over the side of the bed and sit up she rubbed her eyes tiredly as she stretched and yawned again pathetic hermione rolled her eyes at her knew friend and started for the door i going to go wake the boys what she was certainly wide awake now i going to go wake the boys hermione repeated hermione lily stammered you cant you cantdo that honey colored eyes rolled it not like they ll get up on their own lily but it the boy dormitory lily persisted she was surprised when hermione actually laughed you re a bit odd arentyou me lily haw dropped you re the odd one oh come off it hermione snorted who cares if they re guys i ve been waking harry and ron up for years now do you want to come help or not lily looked torn apparently they were a lot more proper in the 1970 hermione could care less about going up to boy dormitory every morning she d learned very quickly that when they had double potions every morning harry and ron were going to lose gryffindor a lot of points if they kept sleeping in maybe if you re lucky james ll have his shirt off she called over her shoulder as she headed out lily was ready in two minutes flat when they knocked there was a long moment where there was no sound and then a loud thump followed by a string of curses was heard through the door until it was opened by a bleary eyed ron tcha hermione tsked taking one look at him you look awful morning her his own yawn cut him off mid word mione he caught sight of lily and craned his neck to look over hermione where the redhead was hiding oh he yawned again mornin lil she waved weakly have at em he mumbled and stepped aside so they could enter the room in a gesture of sympathy she handed him her coffee as she passed and his tired face immediately lit up while he gulped down her drink hermione moved on to harry lily clinging to the back of her robes and doing her best not to look at much of anything harry she whispered crouching by his ear slytherin just won the house cup he woke up screaming bloody hell hermione he yelled when he realized what she d done hermione on the other hand couldntstop laughing donteven joke he said ron got coffee he scowled you re forgiven he said and pulled his shirt on over his head before heading over to steal the caffeine for himself you can get james hermione told lily craning her head over her shoulder i ll get the other two bums she was surprised all three had managed to sleep through harry screams of bloody murder lily reluctantly pried herself off of hermione robes and headed towards the bed where james head was hanging off the side hermione next victim was remus dropping her satchel beside the bed she kneeled down alongside it and leaned forward onto the mattress shaking him gently as she had lily she murmured his name remus breakfast his eyes opened slowly and she waited until they focused on her he jumped herm she clapped a hand over remus mouth she was shushing him but he was looking frantically through the covers for the shirt he d neglected to leave on once again hermione eyes rolled in exasperation and she grabbed his arm to make him stop stop being such a ninny she admonished in a whisper i need you to help me wake up sirius slowly she pulled her hand away from his mouth and grinned mischievously before placing a pillow in his hand and crawling away she reappeared on the other side of sirius bed pillow in hand and motioned remus closer they both lifted their weapons of choice high into the air and on hermione silent cue brought them down on sirius sleeping form they thumped him relentlessly from both sides until the disoriented marauder rolled right off the bed the others had caught the tail end of the show and were laughing loudly along with remus and hermione who d fallen back on sirius bed holding her stomach just the boxers today she laughed when the battered sirius used the bedpost to pull himself up off the floor he smiled slightly posing for show i knew you were coming oh i bet she snorted contemptuously climbing back off the bed she threw her pillow back on ron bed from where she d snitched it and headed towards the large wardrobe lily was sitting on james bed as he wandered around trying to look as if he knew what he was doing with an exacerbated sigh hermione flung the wardrobe doors open and grabbed three fresh uniform sets she handed remus his new shirt right off and laid the remaining pieces on his tousled bed james she handed to him before he wandered right out into the hallway the last set she merely threw haphazardly onto sirius bed and then turned to ron and harry who were still standing half naked and huddled around the warmth of her coffee cup why are you so mean to me sirius could be heard complaining as she pulled ron t shirt right up over his head someone got to bring that ego of yours down she told him frankly arm she instructed to ron and he slipped his arms into the shirt she held open for him she crossed around to his front and with deft experienced fingers buttoned up the white dress shirt after she knotted his tie properly and patted it down she handed him his pants i trust you can put your own trousers on he made a mocking expression and hermione turned away laughing to repeat the process on harry he handed back her coffee cup so that he could get his own trousers on and she was disappointed to find not a drop left thanks she muttered and banished it with a flick of her wand lily was dealing well with james but when hermione passed by the girl face flamed bright red and she busied herself with making her boyfriend collar just right james on the other hand looked half catatonic remus was as well dressed as before and he gave her an overly exaggerated grin of pride that made hermione chuckle softly sirius was as always a mess he d managed to tie his tie properly this time and all she had to do was straighten it but his shirt was all scrunched and un tucked she smoothed it out by running her hands down his stomach and tugging on the hem making a quick circulatory loop she tucked the excess material beneath the waistband of his trousers i knew you couldntkeep your hands off me he smirked hermione made sure to trod over his bare feet when she crossed back around to his front flicking off a few traces of dust as he winced and flexed his toes experimentally to see if her mary janes had broken them she took a step back to appraise her handiwork she shrugged and headed for the door woah woah woah what was that sirius demanded he ran around in front of her walking backwards so he could look at her he mimicked her shrug that what was that you look decent she said with that some half shrug decent he gasped incredulously he stopped walking and hermione had to stop as well to keep from bumping into him i ll have you know i gorgeous her tone was bland now i know and then she was stepping around him harry and ron trailing after her demanding why the bloody hell classes had to start so bloody early remus and lily followed quickly after wanting to get some studying in while they ate breakfast leaving james and sirius alone in the now empty dormitory dude sirius growled in frustration dude i know sirius shouted james wasntthe least bit intimidated in fact the shorter boy was smiling as his friend turned away with scowl and ran a hand through his long hair she really getting to you isntshe james gave him a sly look get that dopey grin off your face prongs she is un swayed by your charms my good friend was james sage answer bobbing his head knowingly like some indian fortune teller no she not oh yes yes she is why is she un swayed sirius demanded throwing his hands up in defeat james seemed to be prepared for this and he wiggled his fingers to draw his friends attention before he began ticking off the reasons in a very its so obvious sort of tone she intelligent witty powerful and certainly no femme fatale he waved the reasons as represented by his fingers in the face of his friend all things very much not your type so you re saying i just go after slutty dumb girls sirius growled threateningly yep james had no hesitation sirius swung at him but the seeker dodged with quidditch honed reflexes and his agility proved too much for the beater to compete with sirius has to settle for glaring irately at him we should be grateful that she been so nice to us james told him and she given us this chance to do something good and worthwhile sirius wasntlistening i going to get her to like me he swore resolutely james crossed his arms over his chest and shook his head dontyou think you re trying a bit too hard have a little faith in your best friend sirius said easily waving off his friend uncertainties i think you re just pissing her off nah sirius if you dontget your arse down here right now i ll bloody well send you back where you came from hermione screams echoed all the way up the stairwell into the dormitory james gave him a look that clearly said i told you so coming darling he shouted back earning him a weary expression from his best mate you re an idiot james told him as they both headed down the stairs and into the common room where the others were impatiently waiting sirius could be heard grumbling why didntshe yell at you they were learning about phoenixes in dada that morning and after an enthusiastic demonstration by fawkes they were made to go through their books and write down the defining characteristics of the species while fawkes preened on his stand at the front of the class hermione table was working quietly their quills moving back and forth in steady lines across their separate sheets of parchment she was thinking of how to phrase the next line when there was a shrill squawk right beside her ear and she flinched away from it knocking shoulders with remus a tiny crane flitted around her head parchment wings flapping and folded corners catching on her frizzy curls apologizing quietly to remus she looked automatically to ron but the tall redhead was hunched over his book two desks up having to lean forward quite a ways to look around sirius hermione did so her head nearly laying atop the table and checked harry he was grinning at her books and parchments already tucked away sticking out her tongue she sat back in her chair and promptly swatted the paper crane away she was still annoyed that he d stuck her with sirius and remus she focused determinedly on her work and almost succeeded in getting some of it done when the suicidal bird careened headlong into the side of her face and got tangled in her curls throwing her quill down in exasperation she tried to get the squirming origami animal extracted from her hair but it only twisted itself deeper another set of hands pulled hers away and worked swiftly to separate the crane from her hair she waited for the witty commentary but none came and hermione looked up at sirius in surprise he was holding it out to her by one wing the enchanted parchment frantically flapping its free limb to keep aloft you might as well read it he said the tell tale smirk finally appearing on his face wouldntwant you losing an eye pigeon she kicked him under the table for calling her that annoying nickname and snatched the note right out of his hand she mumbled something to the extent of whatever and gave both wings a rather vicious tug in opposite directions sirius laughed and leaned back over his book the square ish parchment once unfolded proved to have no words on it whatsoever instead harry had tried his poor hand at drawing and in bright green ink was a crude picture that repeated the same three second span of action a stick figure that looked very much like hermione was holding stick hands with another stick figure that looked very much like remus at stick figure hermione feet there was a jumble of lines she couldntmake out but the head with its long hair was most undoubtedly sirius his stick arms were holding her robes or leg or something she couldntquite tell every three seconds the background would fill with loopy mismatched hearts stick remus would blush and a dog tail and ears would sprout from stick sirius what that remus asked hermione jumped snatching the note with one hand and roughly stuffing it into her satchel nothing she said hastily knowing her cheeks were turning an unattractive shade of pink she kicked her book bag under her chair she hesitated to meet remus eyes but when she finally did found she neednthave bothered he was looking past her she turned in her seat to follow his gaze seeing sirius turned as well and her disbelieving eyes landed on harry his face was turning purple he was laughing so hard holding his sides as if they would burst he looked to be doing everything to keep the laughter in but a few snickers were slipping through probably the only thing keeping him from passing out what are you doing she hissed harry couldntcontain himself he only got out your face before dissolving into forced back snickers at this both sirius and remus as well as lily and james who d been staring at the purple face harry with something akin to horror turned to look at hermione who swore her skin was about to melt right of her face cursing harry first born child under her breath she hunched down as far over her book as she could go and let her hair fall over her shoulders using her free hand to shield her flaming face as best she could the day had only just begun when ancient runes finally came around harry ron and hermione filed into the musty classroom and dropped their books onto a table off to the side of the room hermione dragged up a chair from one of the nearby tables because they only sat two fortunately professor harrison cared just about as much as knoll on what the students did or did not do in his class how was working for snape harry asked hermione she ignored him ron who had no idea what was going on turned to hermione hermione you cantstill be on about that harry laughed she gave him a pointed look that said quite plainly oh yes i can harry rolled his eyes and kicked his feet up onto their table hermione wand tucked in its place behind her ear heaved her book laden bag onto her lap and began flipping through the papers inside it hermione ron said again she huffed as if he d interrupted a very important riffling and gave him an annoyed look before giving in and turning to them both with her arms crossed over her chest harry seems to be under the very false assumption that sirius and remus are interested in me she quipped did either of them touch you ron demanded what hermione yelled no harry waved his hand at ron in a vanna white esque gesture he actually said i told you so why she asked bewildered why would you both think that the looks at meals harry said the pet name ron added studying together flirting passing notes they were more talking to themselves now than hermione herself did you know sirius offered to help with the aureus prophecy ron told harry hermione gaped you heard that of course i think he may have been looking down her shirt at the time ron murmured with a frown the whole school thinks there a thing between remus and her harry informed him really he murmured in interest stop it both of you hermione demanded slapping her palms down on the desk ron pish posh ed dontworry it cute harry face was a pull on apologetic it is kinda cute and just a little funny ron face cracked a smile though he tried to stop it harry held up his thumb and index finger and squinted through the tiny gap he made of them just an itsy bit it weird she said in a clarifying tone their mocking didntslack off at all as they exchanged looks as if to say nah it not weird ron said not even a little weird harry insisted that echoing thing was getting annoying he your godfather for merlin sake hermione exclaimed she threw her hands up in the air and remus was our professor that just shows how responsible they are harry pointed out they were thirty some years old in our time hermione continued plenty of time to gain knowledge and life experiences ron interjected they re like a fine wine harry added nodded sagely improving with age in case you hadntremembered hermione gritted out through her teeth they re also both dead in our time but they arentany more ron piped before switching to a tone that sounded very much like hermione pappy they re now strapping young men harry was nodding his head like some sort of bobble head doll resilient hermione uncrossed her arms with a sigh and laid them out on the table her nails clacking unconsciously atop the wooden top there are rules about forming relationships with time travelers hermione lectured our friendship with them may already be jeopardizing the timeline and how do we know this isntwhat we re supposed to do ron countered for once making a decent point what if by not forming any relations with them at all the timeline is ruined and this is all assuming that we re able to send them back at all harry brought up they might be stuck in this time forever but if there is a way hermione trailed off they might not want to go back ron finished dumbledore trusts your judgment about this and so by default mine too harry started hermione rolled her eyes so here my advice dontworry about it this made hermione smile though probably not in the way harry had intended has any ever told you you re right awful at giving advice yeah yeah go right ahead and laugh it up i being serious that name already taken ron interrupted cheekily we re not making fun anymore harry sighed ron grinned oops you want me to just go against all the rules and do whatever i feel like hermione repeated harry was overjoyed to hear her finally coming around yes you know i haventeven said anything about liking them she commented casually ron sighed loudly geez hermione you re no fun it not my job to be fun she teased no harry readily agreed which made hermione wary you re job is to attract the guys they re not going to like me once training starts she told them firmly looking up as students began to reluctantly enter the room as the bell ringing neared there werentthat many seventh years taking the class and the ones that entered took tables on the other side of the room slytherins yeah ron sighed hermione scowled he wasntsupposed to agree with her you can be a bitch thanks she grumbled going back to her earlier pointless riffling well you are pretty intense harry said slowly afraid she might punch him again i surprised you two donthate me yet she murmured morosely ron clapped her heartily on the back and she lurched forward knocking papers all over the floor dontworry we never liked you in the first place he teased ron harry exclaimed in surprised laughter hermione punched him ow ron cradled his injured arm to his chest that really hurt i told you harry reminded him resoundingly to hermione he said you really gotta stop going around punching people it not nice ron insisted harry nodded because it not nice the bell rang following his words and hermione began picking up the papers ron sudden thumping had made her litter the floor with how i got stuck with you pair of fools is beyond me she reflected snidely would you rather be stuck with two other blokes ron waggled his eyebrows suggestively hermione eyes narrowed the voice of their professor as he began the lesson buzzing in the background drop it she warned they wouldntmention it again until after dinner when hermione returned from the library with a large stack of books on time travelers and set up shop on the window seat perpendicular to the wall that housed the fireplace that how they found her when the returned from the great hall nose in a book hermione lily called across the half filled common room students just returning from dinner we didntsee you at dinner yeah some of us actually missed you hermione looked up long enough to frown disapprovingly at harry then buried her head back in the current book she had curled up in the plush window seat with its cushioned bench and throw pillows and the afghan she d pulled from the back of one of the couches the stack of books she d requisitioned from the library was piled beside the wall beneath her and a few of the more helpful ones were tucked between her feet and wedged between pillows unable to function past reading in the tight space hermione had enchanted her parchment and quill to work independently if she found something she deemed might be helpful she read the passage aloud and the quill would whiz across the parchment copying the words in hermione distinct miniscule cursive while she waited for her quill to finish the last words she d spoken before students had begun returning from dinner she looked up to talk to harry and was startled to find him crouching right beside her face even with her shoulder i told you dontdo that creepy silent sneakin thing she ordered voice a bit breathless from the shock we didntgo to those auror classes for you to scare the daylights out of your friends yeah mate ron called he looked like he was setting up for a game of wizard chess use your powers for good not evil did you need something harry pressed ignoring ron comment and hermione faint chuckles i borrowed your ink she informed him tweaking the feathers of her quill her parchment was half filled with green writing and there was a roll of filled ones piled beside her all presumably written in harry green ink does she just go into the dorms whenever she wants james asked in incredulity pretty much ron said through a mouthful of the dinner roll he d snitched from the tables ya hear that padfoot james shouted over the back of the couch keep your knickers in your trunk the boys all laughed heartily amidst the girls dulcet giggling all too quickly the noise died down and they all broke off to their separate tasks a great deal of first and second years were milling about prepubescent voices chattering at an almost unbearably high pitch while the upperclassman had a majority of their population absent from the common room still wandering the castle while they were able or perhaps it was just to get away from the first years hermione continued her research homework long finished comparatively she was utterly silent save for the subtle rustling of the books dry pages as they turned and the moments where she found a few lines worth recording time travelers are often sent purposely through time to complete a predetermined mission only once they discover their mission and complete it successfully are they able to return to their original time hermione gave her wearied quill time to complete its stenography and scanned several of the prior occurrences along the bottom of the pages witches and wizards who had gone backwards and forwards along the timeline with tasks as seemingly trivial as making a friend or helping an old woman across the street to extreme missions such as keeping a magical species from going totally extinct or saving a life remus was curled up beneath the window his back to the wall and wrapped in the comforter from his bed his arithmancy book lay open in his lap and he was diligently working on their assignment keeping her silent company every time she read aloud the dry scratching of his quill would stop and she felt as if he were listening curious she finally questioned him on it but his only reply was i like hearing your voice and she was far too pink in the face to form another intelligent sounding inquiry after that incident they both lapsed back into the silence of their work hermione only pausing when after an hour she noticed that remus had long since finished his homework he was leaning back against the wall arms supported loosely by his knees and the comforter bunched around his waist his eyes were closed and it was quite possible that he d fallen asleep in order to time travel one must possess strength of will and a soundness of mind both of which are essential to time adaptation so when james gonna crack sirius joked apparently remus hadntbeen the only one listening in james went for his wand but only succeeded in knocking over the tower of exploding snap cards he d been building with lily the entire pile exploded with a loud bang and james was buried in soot you just demolished godric hollow lily complained jutting her fists on her hips james wiped the black charcoal from his eyes so he could see godric hollow lily nodded that what our future home will be called he and sirius both burst into laughter which only made lily frown deepen i just feel it alright sirius made a face and she promptly swatted him with a pillow instigating a miniature couch war hermione met harry eyes across the room he smiled at her but she wasntso sure they should be happy that the marauder were gaining some of the memories of their future lives hermiiiiiione she craned her head at an odd angle and found ron laying despairingly on the oriental throw rug that sat in front of the fireplace she was surprised to still see him there i hungry he whined scratching his stomach he d discarded his robes and tie earlier and might as well have gotten rid of the shirt as well for all it was covering sleeves rolled up to his elbow top three buttons undone and the tails tucked out of his trousers we just ate dinner she reminded him holding up harry slightly depleted inkwell for her quill to re wet itself there was a groan from the floor as if the mere mention of dinner was making his stomach rumble so you re not gonna go life full of little disappointments she told him apathetically and went back to work it was getting close to midnight and the common room was slowly losing its occupants hermione looked around and counted nine other students besides their own seven she started to turn the page of her book when a line caught her eye and she backtracked clearing her throat she began to read aloud time travelers that journey to the past when they return to their present and original time remember all those they meet in the past as well as every experience the person or person who had knowledge of the time traveler retain their memories as well until such time as they are reunited with the traveler or in the cases of great time differential until death there was complete silence in the common room as hermione read from the ancient book every task gone mute so that her voice could be heard it was a low murmuring alto that when she spoke softly enough it had a humming vibratious quality to it like the tingling wave of heat that came with drinking hot cocoa on a winter day witches and wizards who travel to the future are surrounded by much different circumstances when such time travelers return to the past they hermione stopped talking remus eyes opened at the sudden stop and he like the others turned to look at hermione her brow was furrowed as if in deep thought and the book was frozen in her hands if one looked at her eyes they found them to be darting back and forth along the same boundaries reading one line again and again the enchanted quill hovered uncertainly over the parchment then she closed the book unwinding herself from the position she d long occupied on the boxy window seat she seat the book beside her and when she saw remus gaze drifting to it she tapped it with her wand and with a loud zap the books and parchment disappeared i think i will make a quick run down to the kitchens she smiled tightly and hopped down onto the floor beside remus really ron sounded surprised hermione nodded and moved quickly for the door ducking her head so that her bushy curls fell over her face ron sat right up and began rattling off things he wanted but hermione disappeared out the door before he d even finished and his long tirade was cut off by the slamming of the portrait door they waited until half past one when lily was no longer able to stay awake no matter how many times james exploded their future home but hermione never returned there was one week til training a n it really touch and go here in the polls sirius has fallen behind with 11 votes and remus now leads with 12 3 of you vote threesome perhaps keep em coming a n2 oh my god this story has a plot it like the tin man getting a heart you all had a lot of very good questions and rest assured that they will all be answered in time because i cool like that a n3 if you didntsee is going to be down from sunday to tuesday so i going to try and get at least one more long post in tomorrow to hopefully tide you all over much love to all those who read and those who read review training day are you quite finished yet granger hermione sighed almost professor this last essay was without a name that no excuse and snape came striding into the room his robes as always finding some way to billow ominously behind him i specifically demanded these be completed by a quarter past five hermione nodded patiently and kept her divided attention focused more on checking the potion assignment in front of her then listen to the ramblings of a teacher who despised her yes professor i shall finish the final parchment within the last five allotted minutes of my time snape placed his palms atop the table and leaned threateningly over it and into her face i would not take such a tone if i were you he hissed beady black eyes narrowing hermione nodded eyes moving across the wide loopy writing of the parchment beneath her hands yes professor i took you on as a favor to the headmaster yes professor but dontthink i wonthesitate to dismiss you simply because you re dumbledore pet student yes professor he scowled at her trying to determine if she was being sarcastic or not but hermione remained diligently focused on correcting the half rolled parchment and he couldnttake points from her for doing what he d asked get to work he growled and stormed back out of the potion classroom only faltering in his step as she called yes professor after him he frowned back at her but unable to find anything at fault to deem a deduction of house points he stalked out into the hallway frustration clear as the door slammed violently behind him hermione made the final scribbled note at the bottom of the essay on sleeping draughts and rolled it back up placing it beside the other second year rolls piled on snape desk quill once finally cleaned was tucked back into her satchel along with her inkwell and she was in the process of clasping the bag shut when the door opened again her inquiry of yes professor died before it was given breath when she saw who was standing in the doorway harry she exclaimed beaming brightly remembering suddenly where she was she frowned you shouldntbe here she whispered i ve come to steal you away he said gallantly but he too was talking in a whisper no point in waking the beast it dinner time hermione sighed gratefully pulling her robe off the back of the chair she then draped it over her satchel as she lifted it onto her shoulder indicating that harry should wait for her she hurried over to the door of snape office and knocked briskly what snapped an irate voice from inside i leaving for dinner now professor hermione replied as politely as she could the checked essays are on your desk and i also set out the materials for your next class then why are you still here he demanded get out hermione stuck her tongue out at the door then hoped her professor hadntset up any security wards that might have caught her rude gesture on film come on harry she whispered and the two of them quickly hurried out into the dungeon hall how was quidditch practice hermione asked conversationally tucking a lock of hair behind her ear i so sorry i couldntmake it but snape scheduled me to check papers harry shrugged dontworry about it so how the team looking this year hermione asked slowly not really wanting to get dragged into a conversation over quidditch of all things harry tended to get a bit overzealous sirius is a beater and my dad a chaser ya learn something new every day she commented wryly bumping shoulders with him good naturedly harry chuckled stuffing his hands in his pockets the rest of the team was wondering why they were sitting in the bleachers watching hermione winced in a few weeks once we ve figured out all the changes these sorts of things wonthappen she said reassuringly harry nodded what did you tell them harry waved one of his hands something about the flu or a broken wrist or whatever they ll be suiting up tomorrow how exciting she replied without enthusiasm they couldntstop talking about training he informed her really they sounded really excited his sing song tone made hermione smile just wait til i get through with them was her confidant reply harry laughter echoed loudly down the empty hall so you re not going to tell them anything no i wontgive them any more of an advantage than we had when we first started harry groaned and hermione assumed he was remembering none too fondly his first training experience you couldnteat for two days she giggled thinking of how humorous the situation seemed now harry looked sick i think that something our dear friends should experience for themselves dontyou harry added his malicious grin to hermione sweet smile it would be a shame to deprive theme of such a memorable moment he said with a falsely logical tone hermione pushed the great hall doors open for the both of them and they entered laughing quietly at the joke between them as they neared the benches where their friends were dining a sly grin found its way onto harry face wanna make a bet hermione shrugged what kind of bet he nodded his head in the direction of gryffindor table five galleons says sirius loses his dinner before training is over tonight hermione eyes traveled down the line of heads til she found lily bright burst of red hair and beside her the long hair of sirius black his plate was piled high with food and it looked as if it had already held one such pile he was gesturing wildly with his goblet most likely reenacting something that had happened at quidditch practice to james who looked equally gluttonous grabbing for the dessert plate while dodging the spray of sirius pumpkin juice she made a face at the display but knew that someone as egotistical as sirius black would never allow anything that would cause him to lose faith i ll take that bet she said confidently and they shook on it before taking the open seats left around their friends this should be fun hermione flipped her hair over her shoulder and settled in next to lily oh dontthink you and ron are getting off easy tonight just because i ve got to whip the newbies into shape james and sirius both made noises of indignation though their exact words were indecipherable through the vast amounts of food wouldntdream of it harry grinned how was potions remus asked solicitously cutting his steak into nice even pieces it was a nice contrast to the voracious eating habits of his friends awful i dontthink he has a nice bone in his body she gripped fiddling with the roll on her plate he not that bad lily tried he a serpent sirius interjected a greasy git said ron there a reason we called him snivellus that was james he favors slytherins said harry this made hermione glance quickly to the slytherin table where she caught sight of the familiar unfortunately faces of malfoy crabbe goyle and a few others remus sounded almost apologetic when he said he just not nice hermione did you ever think it because you tormented him so lily insisted throwing her napkin down onto the table hermione looked at her in surprise harry and ron turned to the marauders and they looked to one another before answering with a simultaneous nah lily spent the last of dinner stabbing despondently at her salad and though james tried several times to engage her in conversation he eventually gave up hermione however never took her eyes off the other girl brushing the crumbs of the dinner roll she d successfully gutted off on her napkin she cleared her throat slightly and scooted closer to lily on the bench so she could talk out of range of the boys do you think he worth the effort she whispered lowly lily eerily bright green eyes widened and she lowered her fork excuse me snape hermione repeated do you think he worth the effort silently almost imperceptibly lily nodded still wide eyed hermione smiled faintly okay okay lily whispered hermione grin widened and she patted lily on the shoulder okay she said again and stood leaving lily wondering what had just happened harry took his cue and stood up as well let go it time remus asked hermione nodded let go i want to get the air routines in before it gets dark air routines james pipped up he looked like a kid on christmas like with brooms no vacuum cleaners sirius joked thumping his friend on the back as he stood you re an idiot prongs well let go james exclaimed and took off down the great hall sirius chuckling and strolling after hermione and remus followed next with harry and ron bringing up the rear lily was the last her gaze caught on the gryffindor table three plates were sparklingly clean harry ron and hermione hadnteaten everybody up hermione commanded and six brooms rose into the air the training grounds had been scouted out by ron on the first day of term and the flat stretch of grass nearly the size of a quidditch pitch was ringed on three sides by the forbidden forest and the other was bordered by the lake it was completely out of sight arentyou coming up sirius called down doing a few showy flips in the air i dontfly she told him curtly impossible all pigeons can fly he laughed at his own joke and whizzed around lily who was content to sit quite peacefully on her own broom harry and ron made a few loops to get comfortable but where they stopped james and remus began chasing each other around while sirius tried to provoke lily to chase him hermione pushed back her sleeves and stepped up wand in hand harry ron show them alpha harry nodded and took off first swerving side to side then executing a simple double loop then ron joined him and they weaved in and out of one another repeating the maneuver twice more before hovering to a stop beside the others who promptly flew off to try it themselves we ll start at level five she instructed and blue light began to emit from the end of her wand tracing a square in the air her wand left a shimmering trail behind it with her other hand she pushed the blue square of magic towards them and it stretched to accommodate a wide area of the grounds blue lights sinking into the grass pentagravitus the grass bled blue and lily screamed sirius grunted and tried to move forward but it was all he could do to sit upright under the intense force pressing down on him remus was shaking struggling to pull himself up off his broom handle and lily was pressed flat against her broom crying out in pain as the wooden shaft dug painfully into her cheek she tried to pull away and ease the pain but she wasntstrong enough to fight the power pulling her down james had been unlucky enough to be mid loop when the spell had hit and his back bowed threatening to yank him off his broomstick he d gotten his ankles crossed and his hands locked around the handle but he was barely managing to keep from falling much less swing himself back up hermione stepped up to the edge of the glowing square and her face was completely blank it was terrifyingly emotionless what you are feeling she said in monotone is five times earth natural gravity to the marauder disbelief harry and ron came whizzing by serpentining in the distinct alpha pattern the spell looked as though it had no effect on them now fly james lost a hand and he hung precariously thirty feet above the ground with five times stronger gravity pulling him down lily cried out in concern but she could only blink her eyes in response harry swooped down beside her worry masking his features he looked to hermione but she only looked blankly back swallowing his indecision harry nodded shortly and flew back off again without helping her brooms are magical objects and as such they are above worldly forces they will move if you are strong enough to guide them hermione instructions were delivered in short even tones without inflection so fly remus stomach churned as the pressure wore down on him and he was only seconds away from finding out lily pain he heard sirius groan above him and rolled his eyes upwards to see his friend sagging gradually forward unlike remus the pressure on sirius stomach proved to be too much for him and with a strangled gag he vomited over the side of his broom that would teach them to eat before training she owed harry five galleons her mi ne remus couldntbreathe hermione stood stationary on the ground she watched them struggle to hold on struggle just to keep their bodies upright she watched her hope slip away this is never going to work calling her broom into her hand she swung her leg over and kicked off shooting up and into the magic grid her body slowed as it pushed into the square like something was holding it back and then she was rushing up into the clump of groaning marauders you said t fly sirius grunted hermione regarded him coldly that was your first mistake harry what were the others harry stopped his drills and promptly answered with militant efficiency you didntcheck your brooms for charms or hexes you got in the air without checking the area you never asked what training implied you ignored an armed witch with her wand drawn you allowed her spell to catch you unawares that enough hermione interrupted holding up a hand harry instantly fell silent you and ron will go through our usual order on your own level nine she instructed i ll take them through on level two not a mistake sirius panted we trusted you she turned empty eyes to him what have i ever done to make you trust me she waited for harry and ron to leave for their own new gravity grid and then pulled her wand from her sleeve duogravitas the force instantly lessened and the marauders heaved in great gasping breaths of air arms shaking as they pushed themselves back up james swung himself back into a sitting position on his broom and lily forced hers slowly up to meet him struggling against the double gravity every inch of the way look hermione pointed to ron and harry who were speeding through a blue grid at nine times the usual force of gravity they are on level nine you she paused for emphasis have trouble moving on level two i sorry we ve never been in extreme gravity before james retorted angrily lily was fussing over his arms hermione head whipped around so fast it gave him whiplash they are also silent she pocketed her wand once more and guided her broom up above time is racing towards us and soon the war will have begun listen to my every order and you might survive they all wore such similar looks of disbelief that hermione flew her broom back down among them if only so that she didnthave to see them anymore welcome to training she said flatly you will show up every day and do what is ordered of you or i send you back she finished her loop ending back in front of them alpha now for the moment the marauders seemed too shocked to argue and they moved to spread out beginning the routine from the start hermione demonstrated each of the maneuvers in turn but it wouldntbe for two more hours that she was satisfied enough to let them finish she closed their gravity grid and four bone weary marauders landed on the ground sweat soaked socks squelching in their shoes as they stepped back onto the grass it was fully dark out but the phosphorescent blue of the grass gave enough glow for them to see by harry and ron were still going decemgravitas the light flickered a moment and harry and ron froze as if stuck in flypaper before moving off albeit a bit slower than before theta the marauders watched in amaze as the complicated pattern they d hardly gotten through was performed with flawless ease by the two boys they zig zagged swooped dived looped twisted and lunged with seamless transitions and a grace that had been far absent from the marauder gravity grid undecimgravitas hermione raised the level to eleven their movements were greatly slower this time and hermione eyes could pick up the shuddering of the broom tail as ron completed a twist and the flexing of harry arm muscles as he fought to steer his broomstick out of the dive duodecimgravitas the field had been raised to twelve times earth normal gravity and the two wizards were still pushing through it trying to complete theta one last time ron managed to get his down in two tries but harry couldntseem to finish his every time he came out of the double loop half twist his broom would lurch to a stop and his face would turn red with the effort to get it moving again ron forced to wait inside the grid until they both finished hovered high in the air silently cheering his best friend on harry failed another run he was sweating profusely and his glasses were all but useless knuckles white with the effort of controlling the broomstick his fingers were near bruising under the force with which he gripped the shaft he failed again and again but hermione said nothing and the grid remained up and each time harry strength waned finally sirius spoke up he was working all practice let him rest hermione eyes were following harry no hermione sirius was near shouting he cantdo it she looked at him sharply and the sheer blankness of her expression made him take an unconscious step back i am in charge here not you and the next time you feel like challenging my orders you had better be prepared to take his place lily rushed forward and grabbed sirius arms she vainly tried to pull him back but he was rooted to the spot and gaping at hermione like she d grown a second head sirius don t that twelve times the earth gravity you ll be crushed she pleaded harry can do this hermione said resolutely turning back to the grid and he ll keep going until he does this is crazy james shouted and lily was struggling to hold them both back you re taking this too far hermione hermione lifted her wand close to her face and fingered it fondly no one had seen her draw it just say the word and you re gone james she murmured without looking at him everyone please lily was beside herself but they were all beyond listening i never asked you to come you volunteered hermione reminded him james might have said something then that he regretted if not for lily desperate hushing remus shook his head he your best friend he wasntjudging he just didntunderstand she watched harry like a hawk honey eyes following every motion when he lay panting against his broom after another disastrous attempt he caught hermione gaze and looked beyond to the angry marauders behind her determination swelled inside him and he set his jaw turning his broom back around he raced forward as fast as he was able and just before he hit the far side he swooped upwards into the theta routine riding the velocity of his dash all the way through the double loop half twist and into the final zig zag ending in a downward spiral singravitas the blue light faded and both harry and ron gratefully lowered to the ground without the light from the spell the seven students were plunged into darkness only the faintest outlines visible by the light of the moon hermione stared at harry rough shape in the shadows and let out a long soft breath we re done for tonight the gravity grid took longer than i thought and there not enough light left to scout the woods harry and ron both made noises of their understanding and agreement before hermione turned and walked back to the castle a faint torch lit glow in the distance leaving the rest in darkness the minute hermione stepped into the common room a laden tray of food appeared on the fireside coffee table and she eagerly sat down and began to eat ron and harry soon joined her and they ate ravenously exhaustion and lack of dinner feeding their hunger either the sight of food made the marauders sick or they didntwant to be with hermione because they disappeared immediately into their respective dormitories hermione shoulders sagged to watch them go you did what you needed to do hermione harry told her through a mouthful of mashed potatoes how are you feeling she asked concern leaking into her voice very slowly the mask she d built around herself was crumbling away he grinned cockily and grabbed the casserole from ron hungry hermione smiled back relieved and hugged him dontworry about what they think mione ron told her over a basket of baguettes she frowned at him pulling away from harry and going back to her late dinner i don t she insisted biting into a red delicious apple not even sirius and remus she didntanswer concentrating instead on quenching her appetite harry held off his shoveling of food and it was his turn to look at hermione with concern are you gonna be okay she nodded fork stabbing into her salad just give me a night as always and i ll be fine harry nodded and the trio finished their binge in silence before retiring to their beds with sleepy yawns and content well fed stomachs the next morning rise and shine lily you told seamus you d meet him this morning to check his charms homework lily sat bolt upright in bed and watched with open mouth as hermione bustled lively about the room pulling the front part of her hair back in a barrette and flinging open the shutters to let the sunshine in before the groggy redhead could register what was going on hermione had breezed right out the door remus opened the door and blinked his eyes against the sudden onset of light when his vision cleared he was dumbstruck to see a smiling hermione standing on the landing good morning remus she said brightly the corners of her eyes crinkling in that way she had of smiling just so i hope you slept well i i his mouth opened and shut like a fish as she stepped inside and went to wake up harry who it turns out was already awake he leapt out of bed at her earning a surprised scream as they both tumbled to the floor laughing hysterically he grabbed her around the waist as she tried to run and swung her around and back into his arms ron was up by this point and shaking his head at their childish display looking very much like his mother hermione ducked out of harry arms and clambering over james bed a loud groan signifying that she d woken him was chased by harry over to sirius bed where she hid behind one of the twisted bedposts what the hermione looked back over her shoulder brown hair tumbling down her back and smiled at the shocked sirius good morning sirius she greeted sweetly making his eyes go wider if possible playfully swatting harry away she pushed them all to get dressed time for class she cajoled and was banished by ron to his bed where she sat down indian style and waited for them to finish getting ready before remembering she d forgotten her quill in the common room and rushed off to get it now dontgo back to bed she warned with a wide smile that made a rather empty threat and hurry or you ll miss breakfast sirius james and remus all exchanged looks and stared after the brunette as she took the dorm stairs down two at a time in complete confusion and unable to speak
