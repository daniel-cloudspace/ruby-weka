 chapter 10 something missing unfortunately once retrieved the marauder map did not reveal any clues to the identity of the neville impersonator they all bent over the map but found no one that should not be at hogwarts and no one that was severely out of place alas here is where the map fails us dumbledore said with resigned air even if the perpetrator was still masquerading as neville which i think is highly unlikely the map would only show us his true identity not the person he is pretending to be after that initial disappointment he instructed harry to carry the map around with him if you keep it in its blank form then no one will be suspicious just be sure to be in a safe location when you activate it carry the map around with you and check anytime you have a suspicion harry i fear that is the only way to proceed from here yes sir harry was disappointed at the lack of immediate action but felt that the idea was a good one hadntginny said just this morning that harry was a good judge of people maybe he could tell especially with hermione help when someone wasntacting right i will speak with professor flitwick about engineering the same sort of map for use in my office dumbledore paused looking thoughtful for a moment maybe consulting one of the original engineers would help my that would be a good excuse to fetch remus here wouldntit harry nodded his outlook brightening immediately remus would understand about dobby death harry was sure he d gotten to know the marauder better during their last few weeks at the burrow before returning most of it was spent in training procclumency occlumency shields spells and the like but all through it harry had found remus to have a keen knowledge of how harry was feeling as well as an understanding of how to treat the subject of sirius he had never pressed harry to talk just shared a few reminiscences of marauder memories they were invaluable to harry even if he couldntbring himself to actually talk about sirius they were all dismissed then but not until dumbledore asked if harry and hermione would mind checking in on the house elves everyone looked at harry who was disturbed at the thought of the whole group in despair over dobby death as they surely must be and perhaps even blaming him for it as they should be but after hermione said staunchly that she d go alone charlie told harry the elves wanted to see him in the end he nodded knowing that he owed it to dobby to go as they parted from neville he turned to harry looking hopeful harry i was just thinking i d hate to have to go through all of this again you know if someone else decided to pretend to be me again d you follow harry nodded and you know it me right now right again harry nodded well what if you set a sort of password or even better a hand signal or something that i would always give you to you when we first meet to prove i am the real neville then if it not really me you ll know not to take toast from the imposter or anything else is that a good idea harry blinked very good neville yes i had been thinking of something along the same lines hermione chimed in it should be something small that would go unnoticed by anyone that wasntlooking for it she looked at harry and frowned suddenly she turned back to neville how about tracing your forehead with the shape of harry scar neville eyes lit up oh you re so clever hermione no one will wonder why i scratching at my forehead and if harry looking for it he ll know that it not a random itch i tending to is that all right harry harry smiled at his enthusiasm and gave another nod something like this then with careful concentration neville reached up and used his index finger to run a vertical lightning bolt on the center of his forehead hermione frowned no no that far too obvious harry had to agree use your middle finger so that the index finger blocks it a bit and just do it more like a scratch once up then down and then back up again yes that better neville gave them one more grin scratched at his forehead and said quickly i off to care of magical creatures then thanks again harry i ll keep my eyes out for you let go then you two charlie said easily leading the way down the stairs i reckon i should have a sign as well eh harry he gave them a lopsided grin how about this he looked around to make sure no one was looking then reached up nonchalantly with his right hand closing it he were grasping a snitch the whole motion was so quick and easily covered with a scratch at his left side that harry was impressed yeah that good do i need one harry hermione asked suddenly harry stopped on the stairs and looked at her suddenly realizing how awful it would be if he couldnttrust her she grew just as solemn as he nodded yeah i think ron too definitely and ginny um let see she led the way back down the stairs and harry contemplated the two signs he already had he hoped all of his friends wouldntneed one he could just imagine walking into a room and seeing twelve people start scratching motioning and grabbing at the air as if possessed got it hermione charlie whispered from far in front why dontyou just dig for bogeys hermione made a face oh honestly yeah i guess that no good is it because it has to be something you dont normally do harry snorted out a laugh and hermione fwapped him on the arm i didntsay it he protested automatically ah now that should be your sign hermione slapping charlie said in a low voice grinning up at them hermione huffed out a breath weasley men how does your mother put up with the seven of you at the same time ha well charlie smile disappeared she hasnthad to put up with all of us for a while not since percy went barmy on us hermione looked stricken oh i so sorry charlie all right charlie said but he shook his head grimly he ll come back either on his knees or in a coffin one way or the other hermione exchanged glances with harry who was uncomfortable with charlie words he still felt like he was at fault for at least part of percy falling out with his family either part or all he wasntsure which after a decidedly uncomfortable silence charlie lightened up a bit and suggested that hermione just tap her head twice to indicate that she was her own brilliant self hermione agreed quickly and quizzed harry to make sure he remembered them all so far he did neville was the lightning bolt scar charlie the snitch and hermione tapping her head by this time they were down near the ravenclaw dormitories looking around carefully charlie stopped in front of the portrait of fruit and reached up to tickle the pear it giggled squirmed and then transformed to a bright green door handle charlie grasped it and swung the portrait open in you go he said gesturing for them to lead the way harry did reluctantly he could already hear sniffling and sighing ahead in the kitchens all of this was his fault in his mind eye he saw dobby there with his green tennis ball eyes and pencil nose smiling wide and running to throw his arms around harry harry stopped hermione hesitated and then stepped in front of him over her shoulder she whispered we have to do this fordobby harry gave a sigh that was almost a moan and followed her listen to hermione listen to hermione once they rounded the corner the enormous kitchens at hogwarts came into view the tables replicas of the ones above were covered in half eaten food and house elves dressed in hogwarts tea towels were picking through it some eating a bit some waving it magically away but all looked tearful and weary no one noticed their entrance at first then a tremulous voice came from behind them mister harry potter is it sir harry turned around only to see dobby friend the squash nosed house elf winky oh i is sorry sir i is just being winky sir poor little winky harry felt another pang of grief as he took in the elf appearance she was swaying on her feet wearing the same blue skirt matching shirt and hat as the last time he d seen her only now they were quite a bit cleaner behind her there were two empty bottles of butterbeer on the table i is alone sir now that dobby is gone and winky is having clothes sir winky is able to go wherever winky wants but winky winky and here she burst into tears wi wi winky is only wanting to go where dobby goes sir harry just managed to swallow past the lump in his throat i know winky i sorry hermione exchanged a piteous look with him then turned back to the elf who had leaned so far as to rest on sharp little elbow on a small corner table winky is there anything we can do to help we re so sorry that dobby was k killed just just doing his job it was an atrocity that will be avenged i promise you n n no miss n no not an a a not a trocity at all no miss dobby was not just doing his job he is working for his master for mister harry potter dobby is being a good house elf and winky is wanting to be like dobby now they is all wanting to be like dobby now she gestured beyond harry harry turned to see the other elves had stopped their work and were coming over to stand behind him some wandering some more purposeful they looked up at harry with huge shining eyes curtseying and bowing a few pulling uneasily at their lumpy ears oh yes said a taller house elf near the front oh yes mister harry potter sir i is duffy sir dobby is telling us of mister harry potter goodness and kindness and generosity and how mister harry potter is giving dobby clothes we was thinking that mister harry potter sir cannot be good if he is giving dobby clothes but now now we is understanding how that harry asked puzzled another house elf stepped forward we is thinking that clothes means that we is not serving a master no more we was thinking that dobby is being dangerous but he was not though he was free to go he was serving mister harry potter good he was not letting any other house elf clean his room and he is dead now for being so good a house elf mister harry potter dobby is being a good house elf and a hero a rumpled mutter ran through the elves which harry only barely realized was meant to be a cheer of agreement it sounded more like a wail they were serious dobby death had somehow convinced them that being free was just another way to serve their masters better harry shook his head and turned to hermione who was just taking her hand away from her mouth no no she said in a horrified voice that all wrong i mean yes dobby was a good house elf but because he was a visionary an elf who saw beyond the confines of an outdated and practically masochistic system and dreamed of a better world and he was brave enough to stand up for his rights when given the chance and brave enough to try to show others the way to that world that why he was a good elf not because of of anything else her eyes at once tear filled and fierce looked over at harry for back up harry shook his head he could see where this argument was going despite hermione consternation but his insides were in a permanent twist from guilt dobby had refused to let anyone else clean his room that why he d gotten the toast house elves were wired to take leftovers and food on the floor as theirs sometimes that was all they got to eat it wasntlike that at hogwarts but obviously dobby had been hungry harry looked out at the dark walls of the kitchens gut clenched tight he tried to listen to duffy words but couldntreally concentrate the gist seemed to be that dobby was a martyr now a martyr because though he was free he had continued to serve his master even unto death hermione couldntquite understand their logic well i guess all that really matters is that you want to be free she said finally dobby started this movement with help from harry and as you discover the benefits of freedom and fair wages then you ll understand what s p e w stands for and we ll spread your message of hope throughout the world the elves exchanged nervous glances and backed away from her even duffy looked too unnerved to speak hermione wilted what the matter dontyou want all house elves to be free oh no miss and i is begging your pardon said one timid elf from the rear of the crowd the others parted so that the small elf could be seen he was a thin wrinkled elf with whiskers on each side of his face and harry found himself wondering if elves shaved i is not wanting all house elves to be free i is just wanting to be like dobby miss that not good enough she said through tight lips how can you let your brothers and sisters slave and toil away under unfair masters while you have it good at hogwarts cantyou remember what it was like before you came here winky hermione whirled around and faced the despondent elf you know what it was like with mr crouch you know what it like to serve a bad master oh no winky wailed throwing herself to her knees oh no winky is not saying anything bad about her master oh no i didntmean to how can you oh honestly hermione threw her hands up in frustration harry hesitated then stepped between the elves and hermione donttell them everything they re not ready for it and dontpush because that will only make them feel like you know like you re not on their side offer to give clothes next week to everyone who wants it and then give them time maybe by the end of the year it ll be something more like what you want hermione stared at him i cantbelieve you re telling me to keep things from them she said pensively well it not really keeping things from them it just not telling them the end from the beginning you wouldnthave said that last year she pointed out well yeah he said with a grimace i know hermione looked past him at the elves oh all right but they really seem to like you you explain it to them she said in a huff i just seem to make things worse when he hesitated she grabbed him by the arms and turned him around talk harry stared at the upturned faces for a moment and noticed a shift in their stances most turned toward him and took their hands away from their ears hopeful trust written on their faces it was a bit unnerving if you really want to honor dobby then take clothes when they re offered we ll give you a week to decide then hermione ll come back down and give them to as many as want to try it actually he glanced over at her she ll be down here once a month to offer clothes and counsel anyone who needs help deciding what to do i know she seems a bit forward at times but that only because she cares as much or more about the way you have to live your lives than you do but give her a chance she knows what she talking about thanks and i really sorry about what happened to dobby with that he stepped back and watched the elves look amongst themselves apprehensively mister harry potter sir asked duffy yes we is wanting you to come back down in a week sir if you is not too busy sir he said with a hopeful look in his round eyes harry couldntsay no and smiles were passed around the group now they left after hermione said a few soft words to winky and charlie grabbed a handful of biscuits well they were just going to waste he said as he chewed through the first nice going there harry i thought they might be about to toss hermione down in the refuse bin hermione harrumphed some people just dontknow what good for them but she patted harry on the arm thanks to harry there might be a future for s p e w as hermione beamed at him harry just hoped she wouldntwant him to start wearing the stupid button again but as they started back up the stairs he felt the burden in his heart ease a little it was a good thing that was happening maybe just maybe dobby death wasntgoing to be a total waste maybe it would be the beginning of change for house elves and surely that would please dobby even more than the fact that he had died in harry service that harry knew for sure by the time they made it back to the great hall there was only half an hour left in care of magical creatures so they headed that way in a hurry harry suddenly realized that he had left his bookbag in the great hall and hoped that ron had picked it up for him hermione scolded him for that of course and the normalness of it was comforting in a small way it was a gorgeous day the sun had burned away all the early morning mist and the green of the hills was brilliant harry was struck once again by the fact that even after death life goes on however unkindly or calloused it might seem the sun had not stopped shining even though dobby would never again see it in his lifetime it was like that and always would be like that even when harry himself died things seemed to fade out around harry as he tried for a long horrible moment to imagine what hogwarts would be like after he died if he faced tom down this year and failed or succeeded but died in the attempt what would death be like was it really just the next big adventure as dumbledore had said with a deep breath harry clenched his left fist and felt the comforting tug of the universal antidote band against his bicep no he didntwant to die it had taken him all summer to make that decision but he was sticking by it it just wasnttime he acknowledged charlie questioning look and tagged along after him and hermione reminding himself to stay alert the field around them was wide open beaut of a day charlie said looking up makes me want to take a turn up in the air on that firebolt of yours harry sure harry said having no problem sharing after all the weasley brothers had done for him this summer he still couldntbelieve they had faced down two hundred dementors like that all trying to protect him any time he added super charlie grinned though today might not be the best day for it hard to believe but i heard earlier one of the divination classes predicted a storm later on hermione sniffed i didntthink they taught weather forecasting in divination class yeah well i heard trelawney gone all practical after last year run in with umbridge charlie said with a grin old bat cantcompete with firenze i guess harry thought that sounded likely and agreed that weather forecasting was probably as much as the batty professor should be attempting if she came out with another prophecy anytime soon he sincerely hoped he was no where near her by the time they reached the class down at the entrance to hagrid hut it was easy to see that this was to be the largest of harry n e w t level classes so far sixth year students from all four houses were in attendance sprawled out on the grass listening to what apparently had been a lengthy lecture from hagrid and taking notes or as in millicent bulstrode case ignoring hagrid and ripping the heads off of dandelions charlie gestured that he would standing in the back wand at the ready harry nodded him on then turned to follow hermione over to where ron sat in the midst of the gryffindors hagrid gave harry a smile but kept lecturing trying to make himself as small a distraction as possible harry stepped where hermione had stepped as she made her way between two clumps of students the slytherins and the ravenclaws heads turned his way and harry acknowledged padma patil smile with a nod but stopped short when he felt someone hand grasp his pant leg looking behind he was shocked to see that the hand belonged to pansy parkinson and was even more shocked when her pug face twisted into a very slow sly smile harry froze but jerked away the instant her fingers slid beyond the fabric onto his skin he nearly fell over crabbe and goyle the big lifeless lumps in front of her hey one of them said and hands shoved harry on his way sorry he said breathlessly dodging the hufflepuffs and making his way to a gesturing ron neville beside ron was scratching at his forehead furiously until harry caught his eyes and gave him a pointed nod neville relaxed hermione shaking her head sat on ron other side and they whispered a few sentences back and forth before ron leaned over her to speak to harry you holding up all right then harry nodded ron looked relieved good i think hagrid knows something about that manticore mate harry frowned at him and ron gestured to hagrid just listen oh aye they be right big brutes but that doesntmean that understandin ems impossible let say you was born with a scorpion tail and all that extra gear guess people might be a bi afraid o you too harry was amazed that the students only looked half awake manticores were pretty scary stuff he been going on like that for over an hour ron whispered think he been over to the shrieking shack or what guess so hagrid had that glow on his face that he got when huge impossibly dangerous animals were available for adoption harry shook his head hoping that his big friend knew what he was doing did you find out what he wanted oh yeah ron said with a serious look and it bit of a favor all right after class hermione hissed at him all right all right ron groused back quietly dontget your knickers in a twist harry picked up his book bag from where it lay on the grass thanks he whispered to ron and gestured at his bag what ron asked puzzled oh yeah well ginny grabbed it and stuffed it in my hands or i d have forgotten sorry he shrugged harry nodded his thoughts automatically shifting to ginny and that little kiss she had given him earlier just one on the cheek yeah like that time hermione did it only well with that look in ginny eyes and what she had said it had felt completely different his whole body tingled just remembering he wished she were here right now what would she do when looked at her or what if he got close to her and smiled would she blush and stammer like she used to he remembered the crush she d had on him quite vividly at the time it hadntmade sense to him he had just felt sorry for her because it made her so uncomfortable but ever since cho well harry understood those feelings now even if he didntunderstand why ginny would ever feel that way about him and yet she had and now there were quite a few questions he d like the answers to like had she really given up on him and how interested in dean was really she and what would she say if she knew that his to do list now said kiss ginny weasley instead of kiss just any old girl what would she do if he kissed her harry ducked his head feeling his cheeks start to go hot he tried to get his mind back on the lecture hagrid was doing a surprisingly great job throwing in so much information that it sounded as if he had been studying a good bit perhaps after that run in with umbridge hagrid felt he had something to prove but still harry couldntkeep focused ginny had been in his dreams last night standing so close to him that he d felt a force like gravity kick in he d had to reach out to her and had run his hand through her hair it had felt intensely real and completely harry shifted he took a deep breath and looked around noticing an owl flying by the cluster of clouds in the east and the dirty roof of hagrid hut gentler thoughts of ginny tickled at his mind again until he had to let them in how her long hair whipped around when she played quidditch and how deep and dark her eyes were when she was looking at him and then how her freckles werentall over her face like ron or the twins but instead just sprinkled over her nose in this really cute way and the thought brought a pang to his heart an almost painful one it surprised him and yet somehow none of these were actually new thoughts just deeper thoughts like ginny was suddenly a n e w t level class a familiar subject with a whole lot more depth and complexity than before only of course she was something he wanted to study harry cheeks had heated up again and he felt like the whole class was staring at him knowing what he was thinking about instead of the lesson the paranoia had persisted through most of the time he was there glancing up in the direction of the slytherins he caught pansy watching him smiling that sly smile again holding his gaze now she licked at her lips and winked she did what hermione gasped as they headed back up toward the castle later she stopped so suddenly that ron ran into her and started grousing at her shush ron didntyou hear what harry said uh yeah pansy was coming onto him right ron said looking from harry to hermione eyebrows raised harry suppressed a shudder i just dontunderstand why on earth would she want to flirt with me well isntit obvious harry hermione said with a touch of superiority yeah ron agreed she trying to confuse you and distract you from your purpose ye what ron looked at hermione as if she d just sprouted a pair of horns that not it she just thinks he you know cute hermione scoffed a slytherin liking harry hey ron protested loudly harry got very good looking i mean well that what mum and ginny say anyway he said with a quick embarrassed smile and he not so squirty now and he dead famous why wouldntgirls want to snog him he finished with a loyal nod in harry direction harry wanted to crawl under the grass it doesntmatter we ll just keep an eye on her too right of course hermione said promptly she might be up to something yeah well she can make eyes at him as much as she wants she not getting close enough to get her hands on him ron said stubbornly not with me around harry started walking back up the castle tossing a question at ron so what did hagrid want anyway oh well it like this ron said as he fell into step beside harry you know that the death eaters saw something large and hairy that shouldntbe here when they attacked you outside hogwarts right harry nodded remembering the surprise of seeing grawp in plain sight well the only reason the ministry hasntbeen beating down the doors to find him is because the only people who saw him besides the staff were death eaters and it not like they could go to the newspaper or anything because then they d be confessing who they really were you know yeah and harry prompted him well right now there an underground cave that hagrid hiding him in just in case it like a pen where he kept fluffy back in the day you know and he enlarged it when he thought he might keep norbert but junior isnttoo happy there you know he got to have another place a bigger safer place and so hagrid went to dumbledore and he suggested the room of requirement right harry supposed ron stopped walking right how did you know that hermione smiled it the only logical place ron oh right ron looked at the two of them colored slightly and started walking again so there a bit of difficulty in getting him there a bit hermione echoed harry stopped the others pausing beside him so he wants us to come up with a way got it in one mate hermione went pale i dont think i can well of course not ron said loudly i already told hagrid that what with how he kept grabbing at you and all harry harry jerked around susan bones was standing there with padma both looking sober harry face hardened and his wand jumped into his hand before he could stop it we just wanted to say that we re sorry about dobby parvati told us that some of you gryffindors were friends with him harry felt like he d been punched in the gut dobby for just a moment he d forgotten ron pushed his way in between harry and susan yeah well harry not feeling very well you understand susan backed up a step looking confused padma frowned watching harry closely are you all right harry he fine hermione replied but susan is it all right if i talk with you a minute harry closed his eyes turned around and headed for the castle he heard susan say yes and then ron was by his side again i dontthink parvati forgiven me for that stinging hex yet you should have seen the glare padma gave me thought it d singe my eyebrows off hey i half starved want some chocolate frogs they spent a good deal of time snacking and coming up with ron covert signal for harry there were plenty they didntuse rubbing his stomach too common mimicking a save in quidditch too big mimicking kicking the prat arse too likely to make harry laugh and scratching his bum again too common they finally went for scruffing up his hair which he had stopped doing because fred and george had teased him unmercifully about it that done they grew quiet harry thoughts were on dobby and the imposter which made him very poor company ron had cottoned on and just lay on his bed reading quidditch magazines by the time dinner rolled around harry was glad to go to the great hall just to be up and doing something once there he wished he d stayed in the dorm harry could hardly eat for all the students coming up and saying hello offering condolences or in some cases reporting suspicious persons like malfoy or snape harry was beginning to wish he d never made that stupid speech he was in a foul mood from a really foul day compounded by the report hermione gave after talking to susan who not only claimed she hadnttalked to harry alone after the feast but was vexed to tears by the accusation that she d foisted herself upon him with all of that on his mind harry didnttaste one bite of his food nor did he manage to give ginny a smile with even one third of the dazzling brilliance he d planned it came out as a grimace when she asked how he was doing well at least it wasntneville she said with a relieved expression as she dug into her creamed potatoes i feel much better now neville looked over at her mild hurt showing on his face did you really think it was me his gaze shot around to harry and the others as well harry looked down at the table he hadntknown what to think i didntwant to neville ginny said softly but i know better than anybody how people can be made to do things they dontwant to do harry remembered with a little shock as always that she d been possessed by tom diary in her first year since they hadnttold many people about that there were plenty of confused looks around the table until ginny went on i knew you wouldnt want to do it if that helps neville looked down thinking it over then he nodded yeah it does i never doubted you for a second mate dean said with a sideways glance at ginny she glared back interesting harry thought with sudden uncharitable thoughts toward dean just after that tobias wafting came up to the table the only first year to brave harry mood harry knew someone had appeared at his shoulder again when ron looked up and his gaze narrowed what you want he half growled obviously picking up on harry vibes just to have a quick word with harry if that all right the high reedy voice replied it sounded so much like collin creevy voice back when he first came to hogwarts that harry had to turn around the thin boy with messy blonde had his hands shoved in his pockets and swallowed nervously as harry eyes met his tobias right the boy eyes widened and he gave a quick smile yeah yeah that me he swallowed again i wanted to ask your advice see he looked around at harry friends who were staring at him quickly he knelt and spoke up to harry there a slytherin first year who came up to me after potions class i not sure if i can trust her some of the things she said sound nutters his eyes met harry and then slid away like what well like she says there a whole lot of the older slytherins who are planning to kill you but i know that cantbe true right his voice broke on the last words and he cleared his throat ron swore vehemently into his food it might be harry finally said can you tell me who the girl is zimmy twitchtie harry saw ginny stab a meat pie fiendishly before glaring over at the slytherin table looking back at tobias harry sighed yeah it might be true what exactly did she say that blaise zabini been in contact with volde voldemort he said looking around nervously as there was the inevitable flinching and wincing around the table sorry and there some sort of bet going on that all i know a bet about me being killed you mean ginny threw down her fork how can you just sit there and talk about it she hissed across the table like it doesntmatter harry stared at her wondering how in the bloody hell she thought he actually had a choice in the matter shut it ginny ron said under his breath harry turned back to tobias thanks it all helps i dontknow how trustworthy she is so dontgive her any information but if she gives you names let me know tobias eyes were wide and his jaw dropped slightly before he snapped it shut right i ll i ll find out whatever i can you were you were completely serious then werentyou in that speech harry nodded ron leaned over this isnta game all righ if you re getting involved they ll know watch your back mate tobias eyes grew even wider he turned to look at the slytherin table where several students were watching them with a deep breath he turned back and looked up at harry again i ll do it i ll let you know he added with a nod thanks harry said with a slight smile good luck mate ron nodded at him tobias let me know if anyone bothers you hermione called in her prefect voice as he stood i can help tobias stared at her for a moment then nodded tensely bye he half waved and walked back down to his end of the table we ve got to do something ginny said eyeing everyone at the table tell dumbledore tell someone i fairly sure that professor dumbledore already knows hermione said quietly one of the headmaster portraits said something along those lines while we were in his office earlier remember harry professor dumbledore didntlook surprised at all yeah well i not just going to sit around while everyone in slytherin takes a shot at harry ginny said standing and slamming her hand down on the table i going to talk to luna as she stormed off ron called out after her yeah you do that i sure that will help a whole lot he shook his head as he turned back to the table grumbling maybe she ought to go have a chat with peeves as well harry watched ginny uncomfortably as she walked over to the ravenclaw table if she stayed in that frame of mind she was very likely to be right in the thick of things if and when things did happen not good he pushed the food on his plate around a minute swirling his potatoes and gravy until they appeared to be a tiny volcano he picked up a dollop of steak sauce and poured it in the middle until it burst out and dripped down like a lava flow coo ron said with his mouth full of food too ba yo don ave itty people to pu in it like ickle slytherins seamus said with a snort as hermione chided him for playing with his food harry gaze was drawn back over to the slytherin table where pansy was again watching him openly she took a bite of food and drank from her goblet her eyes never leaving harry s it was creepy beside her millicent bulstrode and blaise zabini were talking quietly malfoy the prat whatever still hadntshown up probably hiding under a rock at any rate the slytherins didntscare harry they couldntdo any worse than tom had done and harry had survived it all and here at hogwarts there were teachers friends and allies who would be watching out for him no surely he was better off here than he had been this summer at home and at the mercy of the dursleys but then again the dursleys hadnthad instantly fatal poison polyjuice potion and the dark lord on tap if they had well bloody hell harry might not be afraid of the slytherins but right now odds were certainly stacking up in their favor a n have you figured out what missing yet a shout out of thanks to beta musings and pre beta melindaleo maaaaaaan do i love you guys chapter 11 things that go squeak and scream in the night a n this one is for charmina thanks for the encouragement there was a short meeting before bedtime and all the gryffindors were called into their common room the mood was sober as professor mcgonagall went over the morning events with those in her house harry peered through the crowd wondering if any of them had actually tried to kill him face after face was familiar sober and glancing at him with obvious worry no one looked suspicious and there wasntany student harry could truly believe would do him harm therefore mcgonagall summed up from now on each student will come in the portrait hole one at a time but the password will be whispered not said out loud a statue of godric gryffindor will be positioned outside the portrait and those awaiting entry must stand back behind the statue any crowding will result in some severe unpleasantness i assure you that godric gryffindor was a famous swordsman as well as a wizard and will let your imaginations conjure the rest now are there any questions yes miss weasley what if more poisoned food shows up here professor flitwick and myself will be adding and strengthening the wards around the dormitory and common rooms tonight adding a poison alarm and a skulking monitor also as an added precaution no one will be allowed up in the sixth year boys dormitory except for the boys who sleep there now if you press your way in you will find yourself standing in moaning myrtle toilet she said with such a severe face that only a few students laughed now if there are no more questions i will ask you to go to your rooms early tonight so that the warding can begin damn slytherins dean muttered as they entered the dorm room minutes later i hate to think that one of them was creeping around our dorm looking like one of us and we didnteven know it neville raised his eyebrows as he walked over to his bed and dumped his bookbag do you really think the slytherins could pull that off he asked doubtfully harry winced as he set his own book bag down and traded glances with ron the other boys were staring at neville what that seamus asked if it werentthe slytherins then who done it death eater neville answered in a slightly high pitched voice as he sat cross legged on his bed gran warned me that they might try to get in to do mischief this year and it looks like she was right as usual the boys all regarded each other for a long moment cor seamus finally breathed out if i told me mam tha i d be back home in a whiff might have been a ravenclaw you know ron suggested but nobody answered it didntfeel much better to think that someone in what appeared to be a friendly house would try to kill harry either sorry harry finally said quietly there didntseem anything else to say not your fault dean said with a forced smile of course it isn t ron said loudly we ll just have to keep a better eye on things that all i know i will neville said as he started rummaging through the book bag at his feet and came up with a shiny prefect badge the boys erupted into chaotic congratulations and it was a minute before neville could speak again harry nodded good on you neville thinking not for the first time that something seemed different about neville this year he had grown taller over the summer and was no longer round faced he also had a new wand dragon heart string and holly twelve inches but obviously for neville to say something like what he had said in dumbledore office harry felt like the biggest change must have been on the inside where no one could see it whatever it was harry couldntbe gladder especially as his friend took charge of the covert signal idea i was thinking about this harry neville said seriously i think they should only be used if the person is giving you critical information handing you something or asking you to come with them the less we use them the better no point in you getting twelve signals every time you just walk in the room right that would jeopardize the whole system neville said seriously we ll have to use them sparingly out there and once the ward and charms are up we wontalways have to do them in here either ron and harry exchanged impressed glances both implying who knew neville gave seamus the sign of blinking twice and dean the hand sign for the letter d which was a forefinger raised in the air and the thumb curving around to meet the other fingers if he did it low it looked completely natural after that the boys got ready for bed wondering back and forth about the first defense against the dark arts class on the morrow and whether or not professor haverlime would be good at her job harry couldntimagine that there were many applicants for the position as cursed as it had been but hoped for the best professor haverlime looked matronly but so did molly weasley but harry knew his friend mother to be a formidable witch of considerable talent that he wouldntwant to cross in a fight especially if one of her children were in danger after the other boys grew quiet harry lay looking at his curtains suddenly remembering that haverlime was going to teach ginny occlumency instead of snape she must be some good he set his glasses beside him on the ledge he needed to ask ginny about that next time he saw her turning over under the bedclothes harry let out a sigh and pulled up the gray screen in his mind wanting no bad dreams or dark visions tonight he was sure he d only been asleep for a few seconds when a sudden chill passed through him startling him awake he rolled over and gasped in seconds he was up on his knees wand trained on the gray misty body floating over his bed heart thundering in his chest the gray thing squeaked and clapped its hands over its mouth harry gave a start and grabbed at his glasses with his free hand trying to smother the hope fluttering up in his chest dobby as soon as the glasses slid on his face he saw the elf huge tennis ball eyes gray now instead of green wide with excitement as he nodded what are you doing here harry asked in a scratchy voice he felt as if all the horror and guilt of the day were caught in his aching throat dobby let his arms fall by his sides and ducked his head dobby is not meaning to startle you harry potter but dobby dobby is back at hogwarts he said with a squeak of excitement on the last word but but you you are dead tears sprang into harry eyes as the words left his mouth oh yes harry potter dobby was killed the elf returned gravely dobby could not help being dead and for that dobby is begging your pardon sir dobby no harry said in a pinched voice he barely recognized i the one who sorry before he could stop himself out tumbled the words he d wanted to say to so many people before it my fault you re dead i so very sorry please forgive me and with that harry resolve crumbled tears hot and wet sprang from his eyes and tracked down his cheeks but he couldntstop them the pain was old and deep and carried him along helplessly he fisted his hands into his eyes a sob escaping him please forgive me oh oh harry potter is crying for dobby death the elf voice had gone so high as to be almost inaudible oh no dobby was proud to serve harry potter and to die for him in such a way harry potter risks his own life for his friends and dobby wanted to do no less that didnthelp and a few sobs made their way out before harry could quell them completely but he couldntreally cry in front of someone else and his tears dried quickly he wiped his face and looked up his eyes feeling grainy and ill used dobby i swear i will find out who did this and i will avenge you as i will sirius and cedric and my parents oh yes harry potter and dobby dobby is here to help harry potter as the house elf smiled widely showing all of his ghostly white teeth understanding flashed into harry mind you mean you came back here to help me yes harry potter dobby can no longer do elf magic sadly enough but he can watch and sneak and tell harry potter things dobby knows hogwarts he said in a knowing mischievous voice dobby can find out secrets harry almost smiled but found he was too disturbed thank you dobby but did you give up something to come here i mean oh dobby will not be here forever soon he will be free once harry potter is free free harry mind cast around for an answer you mean you stay here until i die dobby nodded with a shy grin dobby last thoughts were wishes to help harry potter so he was able to stay but not forever oh not forever like some unhappy hogwarts ghost no dobby will go with harry potter wherever harry potter goes and his eyes were shining with that familiar fanatical glow finding no words appropriate harry only swallowed nodded and moved to stow away his wand dobby is ready to go sneaking around the castle harry potter where should dobby go first the house elf clapped his hands in childish delight harry found he knew exactly where to send him check up on malfoy i mean draco the prat disappeared since lunch and i ve been hearing bad things about the slytherins i want to know if he in on it dobby shook his head darkly dobby heard about how the bad evil master treated his bad evil son no longer only bad things and evil things will come from that house dobby knows but dobby will sneak and spy oh yes he grinned again dobby will find young past master and come directly back wait harry called out louder than he d intended as the ghost disappeared through his bed hangings harry stuck his head out just as dobby flew back in forcing them into the same space for a moment and causing harry whole body to go cold and clammy wha tha harry ron asked sleepily from behind his hangings yes harry potter sir dobby said as he floated at the other end of the bed could you report back in the morning harry whispered i need to sleep yes sir dobby said with an energetic bow and then floated off through the curtains harry gave his head a shake and then peeked out to see if ron had seen dobby ron curtains were still drawn and a light snore came from behind them harry fell back into bed and was asleep before his mind had really sorted through all that dobby had said at some point a dream caught him up and he found himself floating on a white cloud of nothingness watching the land pass by beneath him hogwarts went by followed by a sweep of heather and hills just as a beautiful silvery lake came into view a rain shower fell beneath him drowning harry view in a gray storm the thunder below him grew louder and louder until harry clapped his hands to his ears but it still sounded as if it had cracked right in his eardrums a buzzing sound followed that harry couldntshake it reminded him of the sound the fluorescent lights made in his old public school back in surrey he was thudding his palm against his head struggling to hear anything but buzzing when harry potter sir harry jerked upright realizing two things instantly that the loud peal of thunder from his dream had been real had in fact just rolled by right outside the window and that dobby was back inside his bedhangings his pale ghostly body quivering with energy dobby found him the young past master out in the hallway under attack harry potter must come and help harry grabbed his glasses flicked his wand into his hand and jumped through the curtains his mind fumbling for sense in what dobby had said could it be a trap no dobby would have seen that did the prat actually deserve rescue harry entertained the notion of not going but he couldn t it just wasntright he couldntleave someone helpless where which hallway outside the gryffindor tower entrance left heading down toward the dungeons dobby squeaked what time is it said neville in a muffled voice harry zat you ron slurred out realizing in an instant how stupid he d almost been for going off alone harry threw himself at ron curtains and snatched them open wake up ron someone attacking malfoy er draco wha wha that ron sat up and blinked harry shook his head get up did you just say that that he yawned widely someone attacking the prat who cannot be named yes good about time he added as he lay back down and turned over harry huffed out an irritated breath dobby get him up and explain i have to go his heart pounding harry raced down the stairs ignoring neville call after him why would mal draco be over here near gryffindor tower unless he was trying to come for help or trying to make an attempt on my life the darker side of harry mind reasoned with equal force harry ignored both voices and vaulted through the portrait hole promising himself to take it slow and assess the situation before jumping in why did ron always take so deucedly long to wake up dearie oh my where are you running off to and where your friend the fat lady sounded very upset oh my i ll have to let the headmaster know harry ran bent over his feet padding almost silently on the cold stone his wand out his gaze never resting on one thing too long he didntknow how far down the hallway draco would be and every sense was strained to the limit as he tried to avoid any possible dangers so far all was quiet where was the prat dobby had said he was harry froze with his back to the wall from somewhere around the corner came choked desperate noises of someone in pain someone unable to breathe unable to scream harry tipped his head around the corner then pulled back no one attacked and there was no sign of any attackers but the sight of draco alone jerking on the floor was seared into harry mind harry set his mouth grimly and tapped his wand on his head silently thanking lupin for the forced practice as the familiar drippy feelings of an expert disillusionment charm worked their way over him no yellow glow this time as soon as it was done he stepped around the corner and pointed his wand at the boy finite incantatum immediately a scream ripped from draco throat making harry jump he realized with sudden horror that the boy had been silenced as well as put under the cruciatus draco was bloody from a wound to his head and trembling all over there was a flash of red light from the corner of harry eyes from empty space and he jerked around sideways only to have a soft wetness splash over him his disillusioned body now had a large splash of purple paint over one side of him stupefy harry sent a spell spinning toward the space where the paint had come from it must have missed there was no movement harry threw a body binding spell slightly to the right of the spot nothing another to the left somewhere distant thunder rumbled draco moaned harry didntknow what to do if his opponent was still there maybe disillusioned too why werentthey attacking had he scared them off if the attacker had been a student it was possible up on the roof somewhere far away rain was striking hard enough to be heard a torchlight sputtered nearby harry bounced on the balls of his feet not yet convinced this was over but as carefully as he scanned the hallway he could see nothing finally harry aimed a scourgify spell at himself and washed away the paint half expecting a curse to be thrown at him before he was through nothing came now draco teeth were chattering as he lay on the stone like a dead man an occasional tremor making its way over him hey mal draco harry whispered stepping back to speak to him who attacked you the boy surprised gaze flickered in harry general direction but then he shut his eyes shuddering harry had forgotten for a moment that he was disillusioned he turned back to the hallway half of a mind to try sensing which he had used with marginal success during those few weeks of training he d had this summer then he would be able to locate anything with potential magic but of course to really concentrate he would have to close his eyes from somewhere around the corner came the distant whisper of voices ron and neville s harry thought relieved he took a few steps back and glanced back in their direction of course they wouldntbe able to see him before they came into view a half grunt from draco pulled harry attention back he walked back over to the boy yeah potter draco said weakly as he sat up dontbe an idiot she an animagus what she could be any draco eyes went wide instantly harry knew the spell was coming he could sense it speeding toward him from a different direction this time and knew that it was too late he twisted and jerked back almost far enough but not quite and the red light caught him at his left elbow with a sickening crack lifting and spinning him round in the air with dizzying force there was a distant cry from someone an echo of his agony even before his back connected with the floor then his head hit stone and everything faded into a white cottony wilderness he was somewhere else it was a peculiar place one empty of stress or pain where peace reigned supreme wall to wall white or rather horizon to horizon white if only it had some kind of boundaries or other people in it it might not be so bad harry wandered about in it kicking up clouds of puffy white mist until something tickled at his mind a vague feeling that he needed to be somewhere else doing something else right now that didntmake sense to him but then a roaring like the ocean had started in his ears and with it came groaning and screaming it grew louder and louder until with a rush darkness overcame the light and he knew that he was the one groaning draco was the one screaming harry opened his eyes to see red light hit to the right of him knocking up a spurt of dusted rock from the stone floor he couldntmove the pain from his arm was deep and nauseating not to mention the reactivated bruising from the portkey incident but he lifted his wand in the other hand and readied himself thankful that his disillusionment charm was providing him cover for a few more seconds there was a whispered curse and another jet of red light headed his way from seemingly empty space protego he whispered his wand shaking the spell splattered purple paint over his shield the overflow landing on harry and the floor around him yesssss a voice hissed from across the hallway harry hurled a body binding curse toward it grunting at the pain it caused him another bludgeoning curse was the response and his quick shield kept only the worst of it off with a sickening thud the spell drove against his injured arm and left him reeling in a hellish white dream stupeffffffffyyyyyyyyyy harrrrrrry are you allllll rightttttt someone neville was whispering harry groaned hang on harry a sizzling spell cut the next silence and draco cried out right there see it neville slowly the white mist faded around harry and he opened his eyes just in time to see a red spell go jetting toward his friends protego they both yelled i got him wait red light went spinning in the other direction and there was a high pitched scream from the invisible assailant harry fought past the dizziness and nausea and forced himself to sit up uh oh said neville you just hit a girl ron said in amazement bloody hell hit her again you idiots draco screeched she going to kill me reducto screamed the invisible girl protego neville and ron shouted again in unison shields in front of them but the spell wasntaimed for them the red jet went upwards and collided with the ceiling above rock exploded down ron fell with a cry while neville dove backwards to get out of the way harry tried to stand but fell back on his haunches when white patches threatened his vision again he leaned forward on his good arm wand to the floor useless reducto draco returned fire desperately but his red light hit the wall without interference concidus the girl said triumphantly and draco cried out again as he was flung hard at the wall he went limp blood quickly welling up underneath the jagged cut on his shirt harry sat back forcing himself to lift his wand while his left arm stayed limp in his lap there were quiet fast footsteps and harry tried to follow their progress he wished he knew the stupid incantation for in desperation he called out paint and pointed his wand a jet of neon orange colored paint flew across the hall and caught the edge of a moving figure in a cloak swirling around as the girl stopped and crouched a curse spun from her just as harry worked out that she was wearing an invisibility cloak his movements were sluggish from pain as he started the shield spell proteg the fiendish blow to his ribs cut off his breath and colors spun before his eyes as he fell back head hitting the stone again hard he could do nothing but wait for air wait for the pain to subside and the world to stop spinning then crucio harry got in a breath only to let it out in a scream fiery consuming agony ran up and down his limbs in and out of his mind agony upon agony he felt himself fading and then it suddenly stopped tremors ruled his body and his sight was dark but he could still hear at first it was just cursing and incensed words from draco something about someone getting away then dobby appeared in harry vision as cloudy and gray as everything else in harry blurred vision he looked nervous and his words cut in and out saying something about madame pomfrey and was it hermione the last thing that penetrated the fog in harry mind was the moaning ragged voice of draco calling for his mum or actually harry realized foggily he wasntcalling for her at all oh mum mum draco groaned out in between pained breaths you ll pay for this i swear i ll see you rot in hell then darkness eclipsed the gray and harry fell deeply into it sleeping a dreamless sleep resting being completely at peace it had been far too long since harry had felt this safe there wasntmuch to do here when he felt tired he slept when he woke up he lay back in the security of the shield until he felt himself drifting again there was no need to hurry off and do something no one to talk to or protect just peace there had been moments like this when he was a child in his cupboard under the stairs late at night when everyone else was asleep he would pretend that he had locked the cupboard door himself to keep anyone out and that no one could come and bully him or punish him for something he didntdo of course that illusion of safety had lasted only as long as they were asleep there had never been true peace with the dursleys around grudgingly harry had to admit that this feeling of peace was an illusion as well small nudges from outside his little cocoon of consciousness were touching him now and then reminding him that the world was still going on out there it might even be those spells still battling it out whatever this peace was far too pleasant to give up at present not even tom could touch him here he hadnthad a vision or a twinge of pain in so long that harry frowned or at least he thought a frown how long had it been it was discomfiting to realize that he didntknow as nice as it was to rest he didntwant to make everyone worry they were hyper enough already with a reluctant sigh harry set about unfastening his shield nap time was over it was nice while it lasted he ran his consciousness all along the smooth gray surface of it trying to find the edges that he d sealed together to his amazement he couldntfind them he did one side then the other nothing a tiny niggling of fear introduced itself and harry worked more frantically feeling his way all around the circle he was the one who did this surely he could un do it an idea struck him and he cast out his sensing abilities trying to find a reading on the magic he had used perhaps to find a weakness or the last place he had used his power to seal it up it was no use he was on the inside of a magically sealed sphere that cut off all sensory input he might go mad in here but what could he do there was another nudge against his shield throwing himself against the area that had come to life harry tried to reach out to whatever was touching him he didntcare if it was pain tom connection or the touch of a friendly mind right now he just wanted out harry began to pound on the sphere with spells trying to break the fabric of his shield it wouldntbudge and eventually the sensation of someone else being there disappeared exhausted harry fell back into a trance like state it was some time before he could stir himself to think it through again and when he did despair rolled over him like a wave if no one not even tom was able to penetrate this shield then how could harry hope to do it now his body was still out there helpless unable to stop any of what was happening around him what if all those nudges were from dumbledore or snape tom knew the prophecy damn kingsley shacklebolt tom knew that harry was the one what if he had chosen to attack because he knew harry was neutralized with a silent roar harry threw spell after spell at the shield since there was nothing physical for the spells to hit they bounced around harmlessly jets of red light after harry vented some of his fury at himself he stopped to think he d used occlumency to get himself into this predicament perhaps procclumency the opposite of occlumency would help him get out maybe he could project himself beyond it yes procclumens but it was no use even when he focused on projecting a certain memory with every shred of strength he possessed he went nowhere there was no one else mind out there to project to but he did not give up instead harry tried again and again with rising frustration and latent rage how could he possibly have closed his own mind so tightly that not only could no one else get in but he couldnteven get out bottled up in his own mind harry released bludgeoning spells and cutting curses until he exhausted himself he seemed to do that relatively quickly and wondered if the shield itself pulled a lot of energy from him it did seem to be extraordinarily powerful eventually harry became quite philosophical about it a shield this strong would be useful in many situations if he could only control it is it possible to construct the shield outside of my mind if it was there was no limit to the protective uses it might have for him or others around him and here harry went very still perhaps it might be used to hold tom in to seal him in as it has me his next thought came very slowly and chilled him to the bone what if the only way to do it was to seal himself inside with tom one must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the pain would be unbearable he knew that and a shudder ran through harry at the despite his misgivings the possibilities continued to race through harry mind perversely he found that the more desperate he grew to discard the idea the surer he felt that it might be the only way harry sighed it would be pure suicide a last resort he finally decided if there absolutely no other way i ll take it with that concession his mind went blissfully blank for a while exhausted from his earlier efforts of escape and perhaps from the effort of keeping up the shield as well he rested again as long as he felt it necessary thus it was that some time later when he was startled to feel another nudge from outside harry was able to pull his mind together and cast a spell again using the nudging entity outside as a target procclumens this time he felt a slight give in the gray shield that surrounded him a loud rushing noise swept by and his vision seemed to blur at first he thought it hadntworked but then he felt the curious sensation of floating and as he looked the air seemed to fill itself around him he was floating in midair somehow borne aloft by a mild afternoon zephyr accompanied by white feathers the blowings of dandelion puffs and something mysterious that sparkled like diamonds in the air it was quite beautiful and restful and he was tempted to lie back on the breeze and let it carry him but then he remembered that he could not fly without a broom and just as quickly he saw his firebolt under him automatically his hands went to grab the broom and his body leaned forward in the sporting manner he knew so well by now but he didntfeel like zooming around on the pitch and after all he wasnton a pitch below him was a field of flowers mostly white lazy eyed susans and a few taller red flowers that pinched upwards in tribute to the sun they called to him drawing him downwards and harry gave in gladly purposefully ignoring the fact that in the real world flowers dontcall people he circled downwards lazily watching the flowers grow larger below him there was nothing to pull him on no where to go and no where to be right now well except for one thing he did need to talk to ginny that needed to be done harry reached the ground and unfolded himself from the broom collapsing onto the soft springy turf of grass and flowering weeds the blur of white and red flowers enveloped him as he lay back and watched the fluffy clouds pass across the sapphire sky somewhere nearby a bird sang sweetly harry closed his eyes feeling the warmth of the sun on his skin and the peaceful calm of the day drifting deep into his soul when something landed lightly on his chest he opened his eyes somehow not surprised a tawny cat with bright brown eyes and white boots on its paws sat serenely watching him from its perch on his chest it seemed in no hurry to leave with an imperious expression it she harry suddenly knew lifted a dainty paw and licked carefully at hair there though the gesture seemed too tentative to do much actual good in fact she looked less as if she was trying to clean herself and more as if she were trying to convince someone that she was an actual cat harry smiled instantly the cat dropped her paw and stared at him in a decidedly affronted manner he felt that she was demanding an apology but the sight made a small laugh bubble up inside his chest this set the cat to shaking making harry laugh even harder the poor cat looking none too serene now jolted onto her four paws and dug her claws into harry chest sorry he managed in between breaths i didntmean to offend you the cat gave him a pointed look nodded once and then jumped into the tall grass beside him harry turned over to see the cat looking uncomfortable on the mound of stalks she had trampled a lone island of hairy orange in the sea of green around it then the cat walked daintily around her small circle of crushed grass and paused to work it over with her claws when she was finally satisfied with the state of things she sat down and looked up at harry with a disgruntled look that was very un catlike what harry asked it feeling very silly i didntput the grass here the cat tilted its head to one side peering at harry looking for all the world as if it wanted him to cotton on to something oh are you an animagus the thought had just struck him of course i am it said plainly the words coming out a bit sticky from the rough tongue but the voice he recognized that voice ginny but in lieu of an answer the cat simply stretched itself up on its hind legs and well kept stretching it went up and up until it towered over harry and he had to scramble to his feet as his view shifted he saw that it had stopped at ginny normal height which was just under his own but she was still cat like that is until the hair at her throat began to disappear retracting back into pale skin and the hair around her ears began to redden and grow long her body was changing all over going pale and freckled her legs lengthening her toes becoming delicate and that when it hit him ginny wasntwearing any clothes harry jerked his eyes back up to her face to the brown eyes that were slowly becoming more human the pupils rounding out and the color deepening to mahogany did she know she wasntdressed he saw no surprise in her eyes only bright eyed happiness mixed with a healthy amount of pride despite himself his gaze fell one more time to see the smooth pale skin that rounded out the clean straight lines of her clavicle and shoulders his eyes traveled lower and he felt his breath hitch as her small breasts with their delicate pink tips came into view she was lovely and everything about her was so tiny as if she needed him to suddenly ginny gasped and harry jerked his head up already blushing furiously i forgot clothes she gasped to him as if he didntknow it already how could i have forgotten clothes i ve never even oh her hand flew to her mouth you must think he saw the horror in her eyes flicker and war with something else suddenly she dropped her hand from her mouth oh hell she seemed to be steeling herself for something it my dream i ll do what i want then she threw her arms around him and pressed her lips to his ginny was kissing him and every cell in his body was tingling warming to the fiery desire in her lips and god she was soft his hands crept across her back sliding over smooth skin that pebbled into goosebumps as he touched her it took another few moments for him to register that she was swept flat against him her unclothed body pressed into his in a very intimate way he couldntget over how soft her skin was and how much he really really ginny a voice from somewhere distant made ginny pull away sadness lingering in her eyes no she whispered this is the best dream i ve ever had tell me quickly do you forgive me harry what i but before he could say another word the dream dissolved around him he was again nowhere hanging in space somewhere in the depths of his own stupid apparently overly secured mind harry sighed deeply into the echoing silence feeling acutely lonely that had been the best dream he d ever had too but had it even been his ginny didntseem to think so and speaking of ginny was she really an animagus then he shook his head smiling it would be just like her to surprise them all like that suddenly harry realized there was again something nudging at his mind from the outside this had to be the way out fiercely he focused his mind procclumens the shield around him began to give again this time completely in seconds he had penetrated its hull and found himself surrounded by a cacophony of noise so intense that he succumbed almost at once to darkness pottttttterrrrrrrrrrrr as harry was pulled with increasing speed back into blinding consciousness he realized he d been out only seconds the spell was still working sending out the warm memory of ginny pledging to help him in his fight with tom harry jerked back to keep it from completion and as he did this to his consternation the spell changed mid way without a conscious thought he was now drawing into himself a thread of memory from the person trying to use legilimency on him as soon as it came to life harry knew it was snape he was seeing dumbledore office and the flustered wide eyed man entering was snape the professor offered no preamble to the surprised headmaster but simply walked over and leaned on the man desk potter has mastered occlumency he said marvelous severus albus dumbledore raised a hand to congratulate him hold your congratulations old man the potions master snapped with a show of rare insubordination harry knew as snape felt it that the rudeness would be regretted later he not only held under my attempt to penetrate his mind during class but he used that damn procclumency trick of his to project the memory of my rescue of him from the manor dumbledore winced yes exactly snape said lowering himself into the chair that had been pulled forward for him the next time i am summoned and the dark lord searches my mind for recent potions lessons as he always does ready for more laughs at potter expense what will he see he will see the memory of how i rescued potter from lucius clutches idiot boy he snapped then rested back in the chair and yet how fitting it is that he will be the end of me when it was his father then with a snarled potter and a whiplash of a spell harry was out of the memory and reeling in his own mind once again the overload to his senses was almost too much to bear images smells sounds all crammed into his head in a jumbled order drink this the familiar voice said and harry tentatively opened his mouth the potion went down like water but bubbled strangely in his stomach the cacophony of sense detail began to blur and fade harry found that he could open his eyes and see his surroundings grayed as though from the center of a fog unfortunately the first shape he worked out was snape bending over him the dark figure snorted at him finally he snarked out and turned away moving to the door to speak with someone outside he all yours i only ask that you prevent him from exiting until things have settled down we do not need another casualty potter and here snape moved back toward the bed until his black eyes bored into harry own stay put or i will cut off your ears grind them into powder and use them in the sublimination serum for my seventh years harry hearing had returned to normal by the time snape had turned away and stalked off but the boy was fumbling a bit trying to put meaning to the words the world felt unreal to him right now as though he d been taking place in a drama for the past sixteen years and the real world was the safe cocoon inside his own mind there was too much information to take in and assimilate here what was that memory of snape about and what had he meant a casualty harry tried to croak out words but just then he heard a welcome voice call harry it was lupin harry tried to speak back but couldn t oh no you don t remus lupin scolded madame pomfrey from beyond the door of the room was harry in the infirmary then but severus said you have been set to guard this ward and you will do it she said shrilly her matronly form coming in to view at the doorway yes of course but is he awake i ve had no time to examine him and you are keeping me from my patient she waved him away quietly and firmly lupin repeated is he awake she took a long look over at harry who gave her a small wave yes he is she said in exasperation now go and do your job and let me do mine remus gave an audible sigh before raising his voice i ll come back in to see you after i relieved harry glad you re doing better then the far door snapped shut and madame pomfrey turned to harry well mr potter she said crisply as she swept in past the curtain professor dumbledore said that that you might wake up today and here you are severus is a miracle worker how are you feeling she handed harry his glasses and paused to wave a wand over him taking his readings with his glasses on harry could see that he was being kept in a small room off the side of the infirmary it was bare with only the bed and a small table for potions beside him the ceiling was much lower here and harry thought it felt much cozier oh my you ve had quite the nice sleep then madame pomfrey concluded your red blood cell count has never been this high or your magical core so brimming full of course it would be though wouldntit with that constant depletion and restocking of magic that your body was doing wouldntbe a bit surprised to see a few of your spells becoming more powerful dear and wouldntthat be a welcome thing she pocketed her wand and poured harry a glass of water that sparkled like diamonds he drank three gulps and sighed there were too many questions to be answered all at once wh what harry croaked what been happening well we were quite concerned about you naturally mr potter madame pomfrey said as she went to straighten the sheets over him as it been over ten days since we saw those bright eyes of yours now that you re all right things can get back to normal i was just telling professor dumbledore yesterday that it would sorry but harry cleared his throat still sounding like a toad boy cross rather than like himself where is everyone drink some more water and then we ll talk harry obeyed but the cold water rolled down into a stomach roiling with nerves there should be more people here and something seemed off in the nurse mannerisms she was too cheery her eyes watery with emotion and since when did she order lupin around like a child she fussed over his covers again straightening some wrinkle that apparently only she could see now then dontyou worry about your friends they ve been here on and off for the entire ten days we ll get word to them now you re awake and they ll be up directly was it really ten days he repeated weakly handing the glass back to her and sitting up indeed she eyed him with a stern eye ignoring his protests and resettling the pillows behind him and from what i understand there naught to blame but yourself of course that didntstop those cretins from blaming the weasley girl she sighed as she moved back around to other side of the curtain but then she did do a risky risky thing love potions often go wrong and here you were given two and one of them right under my own nose i ll never forgive myself for that one i assure you mr potter to think i was but harry wasntlistening you mean ginny gave me a love potion in that butterbeer to make me no but wait she knew of course she did and she had to do it anyway she staunchly it is the only way to break the hold of a deliriously desirable love draught you know which is what you were given strong stuff that and from what i heard dumbledore practically ordered miss weasley to do it seems that he and mrs weasley bless her soul had been worried about someone trying this exact thing on you and oh my isntmolly weasley just the one to plan something like that why i do remember oh no harry groaned his stomach sinking at the memory of what ginny had done for him what she had done to him but no she had been trying to help him in apparently the only way that anyone could but ten days you said some people were blaming her for what for your coma dear she said in a matter of fact voice heading for the door now i must speak with professor dumbledore he ll be so pleased that you ve awoken and i doubt that severus thought to stop in this might change everything everything harry echoed with confusion that reminded him of snape words and he called after her loudly wait what did snape mean a casualty but she ignored him and continued clattering briskly across the stone floor harry huffed out a breath of frustration when were these people going to realize that he needed answers as soon as he woke up he swung his feet over the side of the bed marveling at how weak he felt the room spun around languidly before re settling itself he really needed to see ginny everyone had castigated her for trying to help him and he wasntsure but he thought he might have been a jerk to her himself did i really pull a wand on her he dropped his head into his hands his memories from that night were blurred as though it had all happened underwater but from what he remembered he d gone absolutely barking mad pansy parkinson had asked him to kiss her in front of the whole school and he had actually tried to do it worse he d wanted to after all they had already kissed once before harry felt all the blood rush out of his face pansy had come here to the hospital wing and tried to to he ignored the nausea stripped off the covers and looked around for his robes desperately all he had on was those familiar hogwarts issue pajamas but at least they fit better than dudders old ones where was his wand harry cursed and held out his hand accio wand there was a rattling from somewhere outside his room sighing harry padded through the door and over to a large section of drawers opposite the beds normally madame pomfrey wasntthis devious about hiding his things but then he had snuck off once before when left in the hospital wing he gave the drawer a hard jerk finding it locked as expected time to try wandless magic he had only been able to make this work a few times in practice lupin had shown him how to focus his mind like a funnel and imagine the magic coming out of the tip forcing his magic into a potent form so harry pulled up his shield and paused then instead of trying to imagine the cylinder as he d done before on a sudden whim he began to curve the shield itself in seconds it was joined at the ends and pulled as thin as a straw thinner even than a wand harry focused on the drawer and whispered alohomora with a resounding crack the drawer gave and flung itself open so violently that it left the track and barreled into harry stomach oof harry was bending over trying to reach the wand which had of course rolled away when the hero of the wizarding world done in by a drawer oh if only that creevey loon was here to take a picture for posterity harry bowed his head acknowledging that fate had quite the sense of humor and then swiped up his wand flushing madly he turned around malfoy what are you doing here faking a new injury please draco the boy reminded him in return harry nodded and grabbed his robes out of the drawer and no i resting up after being healed thanks for your concern are you actually trying to sneak out of here i trying to get some answers harry snapped grabbing up his wand and levitating the drawer back into place lupin should do fine or the weasel who should be here in seconds anyway rumor is that he has some sort of signal rock that is bound to you harry frowned looking around why hadntron been here already and if you re wondering why he isnthere let just say that he had a family emergency and draco eyes flashed in a horrible way harry began walking toward draco trying to ignore the cold snake of fear writhing in his stomach what are you talking about malfoy what have you done done me draco said with an incredulous smile i had absolutely nothing to do with it in fact i kept the headmaster little plan a secret even when it could have done me the most good i trying to practice loyalty you see what plan harry ground out hating to have to ask draco for information well one that didntfool me obviously the headmaster deemed it necessary to fake your return to health however i knew as soon as i saw the pseudo harry that it was weasley again easy to spot once you know what to look for and i did seeing as how i was forced into being you for a time as well charlie he was impersonating me with polyjuice again draco nodded lazily to answer harry question and something happened of course it did dontbe ridiculous this is you we re talking about as soon as pansy body was found oh that right you didntknow she was dead did you harry staggered back a step his thoughts skittering off in a thousand different directions he didntknow how to feel the impulse to mourn her was strong but just as quick to react was hatred and nausea betrayal and confusion he didntlove her without the potion in him but neither did he want her dead the knowledge made his eyes water as though they were crying without his permission draco was watching him intently well she is dead which is after all as i keep trying to explain to these idiots in charge here just a side effect of having my mother lolloping about the castle they truly need to catch her your mother killed pansy draco paused and finally dropped his gaze i positive of it she his contact here though she might have help he looked back up at harry pansy was found the next day after dumbledore brought out charlie up until that point it was thought that her attempt to do you in might have been successful why did dumbledore do it and what happened to charlie draco smirked one question at a time scarhead dumbledore did it because your impending death had the entire school in chaos everyone seemed to think that it was that weasel girl potion that did you in she was actually castigated by the ravenclaws and half of the hufflepuffs even some of the gryffindors started to blame her when you hadntwoken up by the fourth day that was when the slytherins wrote a song in her honor she did the boy who lived well in weasley is our queen draco sang softly harry eyes closed as he imagined ginny going through all of this merely because she had helped him there were several incidents and scuffles draco continued culminating in a rousing dinnertime row that was responsible for a fourth of the gryffindors put on detention and over 450 house points lost students from all the other houses were injured and punished as well it was gloriously horrific he closed his eyes as if enjoying the memory they confined everyone to their common rooms for the rest of the day i think that was when the plan was put into motion the next morning it was announced that you were awake church bells were ringing choirs of angels descended from on high and the daily prophet was so excited that it sent out a howler edition when was this five days ago and the plan was charlie polyjuiced to look like me yes well what happened to him draco straightened up obviously enjoying himself patience scarhead harry whipped out his wand and held it to draco temple draco eyes went wide and he blinked them several times fear was edging its way up into his pupils so you dontlike that nickname point taken tell me what i want to know and without any petty snarking got it yes harry pulled away his wand giving a look to madame pomfrey office he could just see the back of her head as she knelt before the fireplace quickly but leave nothing out draco took a deep breath another slytherin plot apparently there are seven of them the seven deadly slytherins this time it was goyle i caught him bragging about it that why i here i told him it wasntreally you that had come back it been almost two months since i had a beating that thorough what happened to charlie portkey made to look like a galleon they d been trying to get you for weeks but you re not greedy enough to pick them up idiots i could have told them that and told them that any weasley would when did this happen five six hours ago and you knew harry voice went up an octave on the last word his wand shaking in his hands if the git had known no no i didntknow beforehand draco held up his hands i swear i only found out in the common room because goyle cantkeep his fat mouth shut bragging about how pansy failed but he was going to win so i tried to rile him get him to tell me more by making him mad at least that part worked all i could find out was that the portkey went straight to hell manor hell manor harry forced himself to ask the dark lord lair sorry he finished shortly if weasley went there then there nothing we can do professor snape is waiting to be summoned harry drew back visibly draco knew snape was a spy the blonde smirked again i told you i had benefactors long ago why wouldntyou assume that one would be my godfather because of your father harry shot back when he finds out that snape is supporting you you think i run around telling everyone who sponsors me keep the information to yourself and there wontbe a problem with my father at least not until i want there to be draco said disdainfully harry blinked not sure at all when he made draco list of people to trust it was disconcerting as i was saying if professor snape is summoned then maybe he can help him get out that seems to be the best shot weasley has galleons galleons a memory was tickling harry mind one of the blurry ones but he could still hear ron voice quite clearly wow look a galleon just sitting here on the steps and i know just how to spend it too boyd fletcher new quidditch strategy book and ginny as well i found a galleon in the gryffindor common room yesterday harry you wouldntknow anything about that would you one moment he was remembering the next he was running harry scarhead draco yelled after him what the bloody hell harry was already out the door sprinting by lupin harry what are you the marauder seemed to feel that harry wasntacting rationally two seconds later there was a spell coming at him harry could feel it time seemed to slow as the searing red beam crept toward his left shoulder with a grunt harry slowed dropped to one knee and spun ducking under one stunner and sending off another in short order prote lupin surprised by the quick attack flew back before hitting the stone floor hard harry winced sorry lupin i know you ll try to stop me they all will harry looked up at the hallway as a clattering of footsteps and an odd thumping approached he knocked himself over the head with his wand disillusioning himself just as the first head of red hair appeared at the top of the stairs harry stood and eased over to the wall where a knight was standing guard slipping into the crook behind it he felt its shadow envelop him in darkness it wasntthat his disillusionment charm hadntworked but there was every chance that the stomping noise he heard was mad eye moody whose magic eye could see through spells of any kind harry wished there was a way to hide professor lupin prone form but then again maybe the man needed help anyway he d hit the stone floor pretty hard he fine ron said shortly as he strode forward stone says he up and hungry no pain much better than he was he probably wondering where i ve got to ginny pale behind him just nodded hermione had an arm around her and was sniffing regularly behind them came mr and mrs weasley tonks and stomping in last place mad eye moody the sight of all of them made harry knees feel weak things really must have spiraled out of control with charlie gone mrs weasley must be going spare i ll not allow it arthur she was saying in a determined but weepy voice harry doesntneed to know everything ron and hermione exchanged pained glances that just asking him to feel responsible sorry molly but dumbledore insisted tonks said awkwardly as she scratched at her slowly lengthening mustard colored hair doesntwant a repeat of last year ginny finally spoke up he ll want to go after charlie she said softly he ll try it as soon as he can ron had stopped and was watching his sister with a frown no he won t cause we wontlet him harry had to smile when ginny just shook her head of course harry was doing exactly what she predicted now i hate to keep repeating myself all of you mr weasley spoke up but dumbledore has got things under control there no need for harry to go running off because the order has a plan in place all we need is a bit more time before it put into motion that what we tell harry because that the truth they all exchanged glances and harry heart tugged at him maybe he should stop and let them he was okay especially for ginny sake she d been through so much since he d been out but something stopped him determination to act to help charlie that would help ginny more than anything else harry watched as hermione encouraged ginny to start walking again just think how relieved harry will be to see you ginny ginny barked out a laugh i tricked him into drinking love potion laced butterbeer he probably hates me ron and hermione protested but it was mrs weasley words that did the most good she stroked ginny hair with a soothing hand he ll be thinking perfectly clearly now love just be straight with him and he ll understand and make sure you tell him not to be expecting many more kisses like that anytime soon mr weasley said with a half smile tonks snorted and tripped on nothing almost taking out the suit of armor harry was hiding behind i sure the daily prophet made it sound worse than it was arthur mrs weasley turned a cold eye toward tonks dontsay the name of that rag in my presence newspaper indeed wouldntknow the truth if it came sashaying into their office playing the harmonica ginny giggled a bit hysterically i cantwait for harry to see it he not going to like it ron said as he ran his fingers through his hair especially that sleeping beauty bit hermione hugged ginny again looking at her worriedly but we re going to tell him everything because we have to hermione said in a firm voice and then we wontlet him out of our sight girl right mad eye agreed as he stomped on by boy can handle it he handled worse before harry thought the man magical eye had roved toward him as he spoke could it have been his imagination as i keep trying to remind everyone he not a seasoned auror molly suddenly snapped out he a sixteen year old boy and that portkey was meant for him there was a strained silence as they walked on past harry no one seemed to know what to say anymore arthur had pulled his wife in closer and she let him wiping away what must have been more tears harry was relieved they hadntdetected his presence and slowly slipped out from his hiding place determined more than ever to help charlie just then ron let out a startled yell hey what s oh blimey ron said as he rushed forward to where lupin had landed he out cold as everyone went forward harry ran along the wall back the way they had come making for the stairs behind him he heard a cacophony of voices is he breathing what happened mad eye is harry nope sorry he gone no oh harry mum molly are you all right harry couldntlisten to anymore wand drawn he whispered accio firebolt turning to take a last look he froze instantly mad eye was staring directly at him the auror was still a moment then nodded his head at him jerkily harry gave a quick wave relief flooding him that he wasntabout to be turned in as he turned to go down the stairs the old auror yelled constant vigilance so loudly that its echoes drowned out everything else harry took the stairs down as quickly as he dared wand out his firebolt almost knocked him off his feet as soon as he reached the landing above him he heard voices shouting his name he disillusioned his broom mounted it and then he was off bound for gryffindor tower harry sailed over the next three flights of stairs suppressing a whoop of joy that somehow bubbled up from under his anxiety this was probably something that filch would want to hang him by his toes for but that just made it more fun hogwarts castle was a fantastic place to ride the ceilings were tall and the hallways narrow making for lots of hairpin turns harry zoomed by statues past oblivious portraits and over the heads of a few students that turned to follow his invisible progress with gaping mouths what that noise i felt a draft was that peeves then harry heard one third year ask an older student once down in the main hallway harry could see that most students were still finishing their dinner in the great hall though some had spilled out into the hallway he stalled a bit there noting the way that the small groups congregating there had a strange sort of energy and furtiveness he supposed it just made sense surely everyone knew by now that harry or the person everyone thought was harry had been taken by portkey he shook his head and flew on trying to keep his thoughts straight if everything went as planned then everyone would be celebrating shortly and then for the first time harry remembered the name draco had given to those in his house who were trying to kill harry the seven deadly slytherins the name left him cold pansy love potion had been just the first attempt then and charlie abduction was the fall out from the second attempt goyle s and five more to come harry stomach did a small flop which grew into an ache of dread when he remembered asking tobias wafting to get information about the slytherin plans from that twitchtie girl if he could that had not been a good idea harry made a mental note to talk to tobias again as soon as things settled down ten days harry gave himself a mental kick for staying down so long he just hoped nothing had already happened to the boy while he was out just then harry reached the fat lady portrait and wrestled with himself over the quickest way in finally dismounting he hurried over to the portrait and froze as he realized that the password would have changed harry swore under his breath oh my who there the fat lady paused before opening but when harry didntanswer she just sighed peevishly another student up to no good i ll wager what is this house coming to harry looked around with fevered intent hoping to see a student coming up but there was no one he would have to wait harry did not do waiting well he gritted his teeth and sent mental messages in the direction of the portrait hole come out and go to dinner you need to take a walk you need to talk to a professor come on somebody open up no one came and harry redoubled his efforts to his surprise the door popped open with a crack and lavender brown came out into the hallway looking confused harry mounted his broom and kicked off hovering above head level and ducking down to slip inside the hole as he breezed by lavender she shivered lavender what are you doing called parvati from the couch i dontknow lavender said breathlessly pulling the door shut and looking around with another shiver i just felt like the door needed to be opened so i did it and then i felt this presence come over me really squeaked a second year whose name harry could never remember suddenly most of the common room was paying attention to them oh yes lavender said in a deeper tone i really think that i think that it was a visit from beyond the grave to harry disgust a respectful gasping went around the room lavender sat right on the floor there beckoned to some of the other girls getting out tarot cards like trelawney s though some of the boys threw pillows in her direction and griped at her to shut it lavender had a fair audience of girls for her impromptu s ance harry took off up the stairs as soon as he could do so without giving lavender more mysterious wind to work with his mind was racing as he landed in front of the sixth boys dormitory still disillusioned he hoped that there wouldntbe anyone inside to hide from as he d be ransacking ron things in short order opening the door and swiftly moving inside harry was relieved to see the room empty then there was a hiccoughing sigh from behind neville bed hangings and harry froze small sobbing noises escaped despite what sounded like desperate attempts to stifle them wincing harry continued on over to ron bed treading lightly he had no time for neville right now sorry harry neville choked out in a muffled voice harry whirled around but the bed was still shut up tight so sorry confused harry stood stock still for a moment then felt understanding dawn had no one told neville that the real harry hadntbeen taken obviously not from the way his friend was sobbing bloody hell harry whispered in a tense voice then turned back to continue on he didnthave time to mess about when charlie life was on the line he d show himself to neville when he got back as he reached ron bed he was shocked to see galleons strewn across it at random as though someone had already been searching for them ron money bag lay open on the bed harry grabbed it fumbled with it and then threw it back down it was empty someone had already thought of this his hopes fell faster than a bludger had the other portkey been found when he d overheard the others in the hallway it had sounded like there was a plan in motion and harry easily believed that ginny would have remembered the galleon she had found but ron obviously no one would be able to make the portkey work except harry or someone polyjuiced to look like him and harry fervently hoped no one had tried that surely dumbledore wouldntrisk that from what draco had said the plan hinged on death eater snape and no one else harry closed his eyes and tried sensing over the coins looking for a magical aura over any of them in the darkness behind his lids harry saw the faint glow of his broom from where it was propped against the bed there was also a faint overall glow on ron bed as if it had collected the magical essence of the person who had slept there every night for years but the coins themselves were like small round voids on the bed no magical energy at all harry cursed loudly a sudden silence fell over the room harry froze all noise from neville bed had ceased he had to do this quickly there was only one hope left and that was that ron rather impressive gift for disorganization had triumphed in this case h h hello neville voice came from behind him along with the familiar stirrings of someone rising out of bed accio galleon harry whispered aiming the desperate spell at ron trunk maybe ron had put it some place else on a whim but after a moment he knew it was a lost cause no coins came forward at all is somebody there neville voice was firmer now and harry turned to see his friend standing beside his bed uneasily the boy eyes were red and watery but there was a determined look on his face when no one answered him neville drew his wand and his face darkened i know someone there tell me who it is or i ll hex you where you stand his gaze was off by about five feet but harry knew he couldntcontinue to fool his friend with a sigh he tapped his head with his wand and disillusioned himself neville went white as a sheet h h harry is it really you are you are you okay he jerked several steps forward and then stopped did they let you go he asked looking confused at his own question no neville harry said quickly that wasntme they took that was charlie polyjuiced to look like me i just woke up in the hospital wing and dashed here do you know who took one of ron galleons wow neville breathed so they didntget you but they got they got charlie instead he frowned suddenly by now the polyjuice will have worn off yes it will and i ve got to go get him back here that what i was going to do i mean back when i thought it was you neville said looking suddenly energized but the bloody thing wouldnttake me harry started walking toward neville his mind reeling you mean you tried to use the portkey to come find me all alone yeah harry wanted to follow this up further but his mind was putting two and two together the galleons spread out on ron bed neville crying on his bed alone so you ve got the galleon portkey then what oh yeah it right here i think neville said drawing it out of his pocket and offering it to harry but it doesntwork harry almost took it but stopped himself just in time wait he barked out taking a moment to disillusion himself wow neville said suddenly staring at nothing harry how d you do that is that like the way the aurors do it harry harry only response was to steel himself and force his hand forward until it grasped the portkey the world blurred around him in a familiar wash of reality and darkness that took his breath then harry felt his feet hit the floor and he worked hard to stay upright he saw at once that he was in a cage in the center of a shadowy room with stone walls the wall directly in front of him had manacles hanging from it at random heights then a klaxxon split the air and harry clapped his hands to his ears it was an alarm it had to be around him he caught glimpses of a fire place and a long table with restraints embedded in its metal sides by now the siren noise had crept inside harry skull and he could feel it vibrating with each screaming pulse if someone didntturn it off he might go mad but just then a death eater appeared at an opening that must have lead to the door he lurched forward with an uneven gait clutching convulsively at one knee and at one ear while several feet away from the wall he aimed his wand at a section devoid of manacles and shot off a red jet of light the wall imploded leaving a jagged hole rocks flew outward for a distance of five feet hitting the shield the man had quickly pulled up in front of himself the man if it was a man turned away with disgusted jerky movements and bent over he looked like he was in pain had tom punished his followers for not capturing the real harry potter good it was making them sloppy now the death eater gave the cage a cursory glance before continuing his pained walk back to the entrance he had come harry took his hands down from his ears horrified to hear nothing but a dull roar and the thudding of his own heart it was as if someone had stuffed cotton in his ears he shook his head and considered his situation more carefully the first thing he had to do was find charlie carefully trying to make no noise at all though he truly could not hear harry turned to look at the rest of the room feeling suddenly sluggish he stumbled forward and rested a hand on the bars determinedly continuing to peer into the shifting shadows of the torchlight two walls were bare of anything but manacles turning slowly to the final one harry let out a silent gasp limp in metal wrist cuffs feet dragging the ground helplessly was charlie his head hung down obscuring his face from view he was shirtless with various welts and burns and cuts all over his torso and graying skin where it could be seen the pants he wore harry s had been ripped open in several places and blood lay darkly crusted at a gash on his right thigh just above the knee it was almost impossible to believe this was charlie weasley and harry had a moment of total unreality he seemed to float off from his body his mind clouding over as it tried to reconcile that cast off abused body with the laughing canny second born weasley he knew so well but it was impossible it was absolutely impossible that someone could treat charlie so horribly that someone could pretend to be that unaware of how much his family loved him how much they would die to be here in his place and how anguished they were all feeling now not knowing then he remembered the laughter as tom had tortured harry at the graveyard how the death eaters had loved to see the boy who lived brought low hurt and humiliated and how lucius had continued that goal on his own with a jolt harry was back feeling fury like hot lava bubbling up inside him fueling his hatred and giving his mind a sudden focus tom was responsible for this tom had made charlie suffer just because he wasntharry a primal scream was pressing to spring from harry lips but he bit down on his tongue until it bled and waited trembling with with exhaustion harry knees buckled and hit the bottom of the cage what was this his fury abated drained just as quickly as his energy had been he could barely keep his head up the cage was cursed he knew suddenly without a doubt he raised his wand with sheer force of will grunting with effort he started to speak but before the spell made it out harry eyes rolled back in his head and he fell to the floor sprawled out with fierce concentration he kept his wand in his hand from somewhere distant came the sound of iron scraping iron muffled in a strange way the first thing harry saw when he opened his eyes was the death eater looking into the cage eyes narrowed behind the white mask then his eyes fell closed again and he slept chapter 15 harry in the sky maybe he shouldnthave woken up from the way the entire left side of his body had gone into paroxysms of pain harry thought that might be the case the pain radiated from his hand but for some reason it had spread and now he was forced to groan through every breath long and slow it helped almost as if he were letting out some of the pain with each release of breath but there was a down side and that was that everyone knew that he was in pain harry never liked letting that sort of thing get out merlin i thought he was still unconscious ginny voice said from somewhere nearby from her footsteps harry could tell she was coming back to check on him draco how long has he been awake the answer was so quiet that harry couldnthear it why didntyou call me ginny snapped out then bent over harry he could feel the whisper of air as she leaned over him and wished he could stop moaning harry she said in a soft mellow voice madame pomfrey gave me this potion for pain since she busy with charlie but you have to sit up to drink it i sorry harry easier said than done harry watched from behind his lids as the world went psychedelic with every shift of his body somehow he got up then found himself leaning heavily against ginny when had she gotten so good at doing madame pomfrey job it was hard to breathe but at least that meant harry couldntgroan he drank the potion with a grimace then opened his eyes as it slid down ginny face was close and blurry he didnthave on his glasses thanks he whispered in what he hoped was at least a semi grateful way before giving in and lying back on the bed again she pulled her arm from behind his shoulders and settled him back comfortably he watched her blurrily so you re giving potions now yeah i was here so much the last time you were recovering that madame pomfrey started training me a bit i like healing i sorry you were in such pain if the ferret had just done his job she bit off her words with a huff of disgust he deserves to be in pain snapped from somewhere nearby there was a rustle of robes and harry knew ginny wand was out her voice was ice cold my brother is lying at the other end of the hospital wing and harry harry is lying here both are in pain and both almost died tonight i dontthink you want to be dicking around with me right now need any help with that bitsy came a cheerful familiar voice harry looked up to see fred and george coming from across the ward mum sent us over to see what up with harry george trailed off ginny had swung around and her wand was now trained on them what did you call me possibly not a good time to joke my esteemed brother fred said as he froze in place hands up sorry gin just slipped out managed george shrugging though he kept still harry knew the twins had said they respected ginny power but this was still surprising the pause went a little too long and harry shot a glance at ginny then peered harder to see if her face really had crumpled as he thought it might have he grabbed over at the table beside him finding his glasses and jamming them on yes she was going to cry fred and george were exchanging wide eyed looks deciding something in a split second between them george frowned and then fred nodded they turned back to ginny adopting similarly sweet expressions and walking around to each side of ginny who had now lowered her wand and was covering her face with one hand it been too much for our little gin gin fred cooed taking ginny arms and leading her toward the chair beside harry bed she all done in poor little tyke oh stop it you sot ginny said in watery voice pushing fred hands away george who was holding the chair ready for her merely added tut tut dearie little poppets need to have sweet manners ginny managed a half hearted glare come a bit closer and i ll hex your little poppet george smiled at harry ruefully she a delicate one is our little lamb harry blinked still a bit stunned at her very private threat but then she did have six older brothers to deal with she had probably learned very quickly the best way to incapacitate them ginny groaned and gave in as fred bustled her over to the chair with so many fawning patting movements that harry had to smile just have a little rest now here you go bitsy ginny froze again at the nickname then glared at her brothers and for just a moment it looked as if she was going to lash out at them then slowly a weak smile crept over her face and the twins broke out into brighter grins like the sun breaking out from behind a cloud said fred with a sigh one hand to his chest makes you want to break out into song dontit said george giving harry a look harry was feeling very sunny now and yet somehow distant from himself it took some effort to consider the question carefully dunno he finally said bemused doesntmake me want to sing not much does but well it sort of makes me yes it does make me want to snog her silly all three weasleys stared at him as if he d said something strange harry shrugged and seeing their faces giggled then clapped a hand over his mouth had he really just giggled ah ginny said in a suddenly amused voice wiping away her drying tears that ll be the potion talking feeling better then the twins burst out laughing he high as a kite harry pulled the hand from his face considered and nodded at least it been a long time since i ve felt this good he frowned have i ever felt this good he sniffed and smiled no dontthink so i ve never felt this good he laughed and looked at ginny oh except that one time we kissed that felt this good too over the twins indignant expressions of oy came a derisive voice must we trip down this particularly boggy memory lane surely there must be something better to speak of potter draco fred said politely would you like a ton tongue toffee shoved down your throat no then shut it before i hex start hexing your various orifices shut now harry when in the bloody hell did you snog our sister like that he didn t ginny protested do you people not read the daily prophet or is just a congenital deficiency that makes you forget everything you ve read draco said scornfully fred looked at george would you like to pull his pants down or should i george looked thoughtful dunno maybe i will it been a while since i ve tried an arse clamping curse there was a strangled sound from across the room that right harry said the daily prophet did a whole article on that love potion thingee didntthey and the kiss i overheard your parents talking about it fred and george exchanged glances when they asked as one before i went to rescue charlie when everyone was standing outside the infirmary half a mo ron said that article was a load of dung george said he said it wasntlike a kiss like that at all just a peck and he was there come off it harry said scornfully d you really think i d get the opportunity to kiss ginny and waste it on a peck like that fred thunderstruck expression melted and he stepped forward a sly grin on his face said just like a true weasley mate i think i need to shake your hand he took harry good hand with gusto george daubed at imaginary tears seems like just yesterday he was a wee first year and now here he is scamming on our little sister not that we intend to let you harry fred went on dropping harry hand she is the only one we ve got now tell us more about this kiss so that we may take appropriate disciplinary measures how harry feeling then mrs weasley voice calling from across the room made ginny spring into action a bit better ginny said as she sat by harry and shushed him not for long fred said in a low voice his eyes narrowed as always with the twins it was difficult to tell whether fred was serious or not fortunately harry couldntbe bothered he smiled at mrs weasley concern i feel wonderful harry said i was just telling them that i dontthink i ve felt this good in a very long time in fact the last time i felt this way was oh donttell that story again harry it positively boring ginny said quickly as her mother stood beside her i didntthink so george said ominously ditto fred agreed harry tilted his head to look at ginny triumphantly see not boring my you are feeling better arentyou mrs weasley smiled but suspicion was dawning in her eyes she turned to narrow her gaze at ginny how much of that potion did you give him enough to make the pain go away ginny said firmly a little flush on her cheeks i understand dear but really that probably a bit too much mrs weasley said with a soft glare at her daughter though i do feel terrible he has to wait for madame pomfrey just keep a closer eye on him since he feeling a bit footloose and fancy free now i have to go back to charlie just wanted you to know that he coming along nicely should be fine in a matter of hours thanks to you dear and madame pomfrey will be over here as soon as she can call if you need anything at all she patted harry shoulder in a way that made him feel quite warm inside and then turned to pat the twins absently before walking back over to the other side of the room bye mrs weasley harry called to her drop in any time he turned back to the twins she such a great mum right so let get back to this kiss fred said in a blithe tone shut it you gits ginny growled harry was under a love potion well actually two of them at the time and it not like he was exactly oh no no harry protested it wasntjust the love potion ginny clapped a hand over his mouth dont say another word harry you re completely doped there was derisive laughter from across the room how much of that potion did you give him weasley draco asked shut it draco ginny fred and george barked out stop covering up harry mouth ginny george said gamely as he turned back around i wanna know what he was going to say something even more incriminating i d wager i like high harry he loads of fun maybe we should ask him about the dursleys now get some straight answers out of him for once george ginny said immediately sounding a lot like her mum harry feeling a dip in his mood said somberly i dontwant to talk about the dursleys why not fred asked getting settled into the chair nearby as long as you re feeling chatty oh come on you two ginny said shortly leave him alone but she wasntas adamant this time harry got the idea that she rather wanted to hear what he had to say why dontyou want to talk about them harry george prodded because it hurts harry said in a low voice thinking belatedly that he probably shouldnthave answered that question and that painkiller potions seemed to make him a bit stupid but then it hit him that thinking of the dursleys didnthurt as much as usual he shrugged and went on i know you dontunderstand george because it not like your family you hurt each other on accident some times and it all right even with percy i dontthink he means to hurt you it just that he sees things differently the dursleys arentlike that they go out of their way to hurt me whenever they can and it always been that way they could never stand to see me being happy or doing well in school harry voice grew quieter as the memory of those days ghosted over him like a fog driving away the thought of his listeners completely putting it into words was like scratching an itch one he d never realized was there they always had to ruin it somehow whatever minor happiness i managed to scrape out so that dudley would be happy or look better in comparison or something stupid like that i remember one time when i was little a man came up to us in at a restaurant and want to give me candy for being so good dudley didntget anything because he d been wailing like a banshee aunt petunia couldntstand it as soon as the man left she took the chocolate bar and gave it to dudley that was the last time i remember us eating out together after that they d just leave me at home he paused took a deep breath and let it out slowly i dunno they could have been much worse but i dontthink mum and dad would have wanted me to grow up there i wish i hadnthad to the room was quiet and slowly harry realized he was in the hospital wing saying things out loud he d hardly ever dared think fred was looking at the floor ginny had sidled up to george and was leaning against him his arm around her shoulders they were all so quiet how did they treat you physically fred asked slowly physically harry asked with a blank face er like well okay i guess they didntever spank me they prided themselves on being above that but if i got out of line caused a row because i d got no christmas presents when dudley had got fifteen say well then uncle vernon would take a swing at me sometimes sometimes it would connect but i was too fast for him most of the time harry grinned visualizing his many escapes so easily you should have seen him all red in the face thundering after me yelling about what he d do to me if he could catch me but all the time i running dodging sliding if he kept at it i d hide under my bed and duck into the corner where he couldntreach me more often than that he d just give up and let dudders take it out on me later dudley could beat me up whenever he wanted you know and i think they allowed it just because they hated me so much and they kept you in a cupboard right ginny asked in a soft voice yeah that was my bedroom they d lock it if i got in trouble no one asked anything and harry was free to cast his mind back to it it wasntso bad it was dark under there and it always smelled a bit musty but i like it you know i felt safe there like a rabbit burrowing into the ground dudley wouldntcome in and uncle vernon couldntfit they always thought they were punishing me by locking me in but it wasntreally so i had a few books uncle vernon had thrown at me in a rage and all these chess men from one of dudley old sets he hates chess and i would play soldiers for hours and there was that box of crayons i got hold of once and i colored the boxes at the other end of the cupboard didntget any meals for two days over that they did that a lot didntthey wankers george said in a tense voice oh yeah harry nodded that was pretty much constant if i did magic on accident then they d lock me in with no food once it lasted three days because i did it at school in front of other kids just apparated myself onto the roof when they were coming to get me once that was the worst that and after my first year at hogwarts when they locked me in my room and only fed me a bowl of soup now and then i ll never forget how glad i was to see that old ford anglia outside my bedroom window weasleys aboard harry said wonderingly it was the most amazing thing i d ever seen god you re pathetic potter what are you practicing for the next edition of the quibbler harry watched ambivalently as three wands went for draco who sat sneering across the room poor little orphan boy spills heart out to adoring fans what rot it not rot it the truth harry said evenly feeling good that draco just wasntgetting to him today perhaps mr silver spoon needs to be gagged with it fred retorted his wand aimed directly at draco face keep it up ferret and we ll let ginny have free reign ginny lowered her wand and walked closer to draco bed where the pale boy crossed his arms and shifted uncomfortably harry was wondering why on earth they were so concerned with the ferret he wasn t ginny looked tense but her voice was smooth as silk harry found himself thinking that probably that wasnta good sign what makes you think harry not telling the truth draco sat up straighter venom twisting his face into a potent sneer because because he the effing boy who lived and i refuse to to draco never did get out the remainder of his refusal but continued on anyway my parents were death eaters and they treated me better than that the only person i ve known with an upbringing that bad was professor snape ginny glanced back at harry who was nodding solemnly snape was as rotten as mine was or worse and that the truth the weasleys were all exchanging glances george shrugged obviously thinking snape deserved it ginny shook her head and looked back at draco are you actually that stupid or are you pretending or maybe great bleeding coward that you are you were so scared that night you donteven remember what happened when the death eaters apparated outside harry house with you in tow did you think harry threw himself out draco started to retort but she interrupted with a shout and a wave of her wand silencio the twins both started moving as if to stop her but she shouted at them dontyou dare dammit for once he going to shut up and listen fred gestured graciously for her to continue ginny turned to draco who had frozen against his headboard you and your pathetic inferiority complex you have to take every opportunity to knock harry down dontyou and why that do you even know it because he so much better than you ll ever be stronger faster smarter kinder more loyal better at everything that matters even quidditch and no matter how hard you try no matter how much money you throw around and pay to the right people it wontmatter you ll never be anything but a vicious power hungry selfish unkind weak minded jackass every time you lash out at harry another crack appears in that thin veneer of sneering superiority another crack that reveals what inside bitterness and the truth that you see it just as easily as everyone else does ginny face had flushed pink and she leaned in to draco bed you hate harry because you see yourself in him or rather what you could have been and aren t you hate him because there a reason people care about harry and it not because of his family or his blood or because he the boy who lived you hate him because he everything you wish you were and instead of asking yourself why you lie to yourself to make it seem like he doesntdeserve it when just the opposite is true you re the one who has had everything handed to him you re the one who always received special treatment and you deserve it far far less now that you have no name to back you up maybe you re beginning to see it maybe that why you re laying in here day after day or then again maybe it just because you re a coward there was complete silence ginny face had gone pale again and she held her chin up proudly as she waved her wand finite incantatem draco stared at her white as a sheet with cheeks stained so red it looked as if someone had slapped him everyone waited a moment but apparently he was speechless well you know what they say fred said with a wise air as he turned back toward harry bed tis better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and prove it sage advice brother mine george added ginny harry said in awe that was amazing could you say all of that that again i cantremember half of it but it really made me want to snog you ginny groaned and covered her pink face with both hands as a kite george summed up so one more question what happened to your hand fred asked casually as he walked back over to harry bed everyone been going on and on about it harry frowned my hand he picked it up and looked at it blankly there was a red mark there the size of a galleon hm doesnthurt dontremember not that hand you idiot fred corrected the other one harry froze then moved his left hand from its perch on his stomach he knew even before he brought it up to eye level that he should have left it where it was a shudder ran through him at the sight and suddenly the ghost of pain reappeared ouch he said the burn was bad his hand had been turned to the side when he ran into the flames and accordingly the charred skin was on the left side of his fingers and palm and was in some places burned to the bone the flat of his hand was missing layers of skin burned away to reveal the red glistening of raw muscles and harry put his hand back down and swallowed remembering wall of flame didntput my shield up quick enough who did it george asked eagerly lestrange harry stared at him yeah rodolphus how d you know we picked up bits and pieces from the other gryffindors before coming up here they re in a right state you know fred and george exchanged glances what were you doing in the dorm ginny asked well we re re matriculating you might say fred offered with a grin checked back into the dorm today what harry and ginny said together then ginny launched herself at fred who scooped her up in a big hug yeah george said eagerly stowing his wand and coming to sit by harry we ve decided things are getting too hot around hogwarts to not be here anymore now that they ve taken charlie out well it a matter of family pride harry couldntkeep from grinning so that where you ve been getting ready to come back got it in one george said over ginny head fred took over we had to make arrangements with the store sell out some shares and get a caretaker you know the drill now we re financially independent disentangled for the time being and paying our own way to this illustrious institution has nothing to do with the fact that dumbledore asked us to come keep an eye on things george countered nor with the fact that his request comes with pay fred added and scholarships nope we re here strictly on principle to keep an eye on skids like draco i dontthink you have to worry about draco harry said slowly just now it goyle who bears watching i still cantbelieve that he tried to kill me and pansy all the slytherins hate me what did i ever do to them ginny slid away from george and came over to sit on harry bed now you re whinging harry shut it she looked over at her brothers and dontworry with all these weasleys around you re safe here just concentrate on getting well right right fred and george said in unison the only thing you need to worry about is if we catch you snogging our sister in the future then there ll be hell to pay fred said matter of factly george nodded harry looked over at ginny worried but i like ginny gave a squealing grunt and put a hand over his mouth mmph harry said indignantly why do you keep cutting him off like that i like him this way fred insisted why do you keep lying to him draco spoke up suddenly his expression dark and ugly dontworry about the students trying to kill you harry since you re such a special kind and caring bloke just stay the same reckless idiot as you are now and everything will be fine fred and george exchanged dark glances and strode over to draco bed so what are you doing in here anyway you son of a death eater george said in a low voice recovering draco said shortly harry turned his attention back onto ginny as she sighed and took her hand away from his mouth he didntlisten to a word i said did he harry stared up at her he didntcare about draco and there were still things he wanted to tell ginny and with the buoyancy in his heart and the numbness everywhere else he still felt like talking it was a good kiss harry remarked taking her hand with his good one and tugging at it before she could move away do you remember she looked away and her half smile slowly faded harry sensed that he d made her sad and tugged at her hand when she didntlook down he whispered up at her but there was an even better one wasntthere ginny jerked her head to him and he smiled slowly just you listen to me fred said in a louder voice calling ginny attention away he in that bed because he risked his very valuable life harry made a face and tugged on ginny hand again until she faced him dontyou remember she looked down at him again slightly curious but a bit blank finally feeling mischievous harry raised his eyebrows and whispered meow ginny eyes flew open wide and she jerked back her gaze skittered around the room then came back to harry no she said in a breathless voice you weren t you couldntbe that not possible what part of he a hero dontyou understand george said loudly and harry pulled ginny closer so she looked at him again and ignored the very loud conversation going on over by the other wall but i did and i was he watched the emotions on her face battle a moment before settling on what looked like an interesting mix of horror and pleasure it wasntjust a dream harry watched fascinated as the surprise in her eyes gave way to a wave of what looked like chocolate brown desire her mouth fell open slightly and she sighed harry really wanted to kiss her brothers or no he felt he was flying exhilarated and all i wanna know is do you really feel that soft harry asked quietly sliding gentle fingers up her arm to the crook of her elbow she didntmove a mite her arm was pale and beautiful warm and lightly freckled smooth as cream and soft as silk harry felt his body start to heat up deliciously ginny took in a deep shaky breath and harry looked up the moment their eyes met again an electric shock went through harry body her eyes were melting with emotion and she clutched at the hand on her arm he was taken aback until she said oh harry in a trembling voice harry and with a sudden shock he knew what that emotion in her eyes was love the world seemed to fade around them harry blood boiled and his heart thumped and he knew that ginny was the only thing he d ever really wanted this badly an ache filled his chest and he wondered if his eyes looked as soft and vulnerable as hers oy ginny bill barked out from somewhere fred george yeah said two voices at once ginny broke away from harry yes i here charlie awake poppy a miracle worker come and see ginny clapped her hands together thank merlin be nice ferret barked out fred then let out a whoop as he charged across the room we ll be ten steps away in case you need another reminder coming billy boy george followed his twin with a grin i ll be right there ginny flung herself back at harry careful of his arm and pecked him on the lips pausing only to look him in the eyes and say brothers across the room and all before dashing away harry put his good hand to his lips and smiled feeling so full to the brim of good things that he was dizzy he half expected one of those deranged cupids from madame puddifoot to be flitting around over his head tossing confetti and flinging silver arrows lying back on his pillows he sighed and listened to the tearful but happy sounds coming from across the room a gray fuzzy sort of feeling came over him and he fell into a doze a n thanks so much to everyone for your reviews you know now that i listen to you right see it is actually an h g story after all i just wanted to note for future readers really that this is the last chapter we will post before the publication of harry potter and the half blood prince then we will officially be going au we are halfway through and i do have the outline and the story already set up so if there are any similarities between hbp and my story they will be unintentional and wow pure dumb luck i promise not to plagiarize thanks for your support prologue to chapter sixteen the tea was hot and bitter and it really wasntdoing its job remus lupin grimaced as a yawn split his face despite his attempts to keep it at bay he d been at this for far too long though his replacement wasntdue for another hour only four order members to cover this operation that was so fundamental to the future of the wizarding world remus put the cup back in its saucer watching the slight tremor in his hand that made the china clink faintly it couldntbe helped remus was tired dog tired a thin smile creased his mouth straining to accommodate the sudden memory of sirius i and my kind take great offense to the use of such an inspired term for such a mongrel half breed like you the marauder had said with his nose in the air tossing that famous black hair off his shoulders aristocratically remus let the image fade slowly in no hurry to return to the real world one where padfoot could talk and move no more harry was hunted constantly by a megalomaniac and hogwarts was being slowly ripped apart at the seams remus rubbed at his eyes wearily he had to do what he could to help a lot of wizards were counting on him before being called to the school by dumbledore remus desire to help and a sudden windfall of money had led him to begin a commune for werewolves one of the few organizations to reach out to werewolf brethren sirius had left him money not that he would have gotten it under normal circumstances as it was several hundred thousand pounds wizarding law had stepped in to complicate things but dumbledore had quietly gone to the minister of finance and somehow managed to work things in remus favor then asked that he mention it to no one grateful remus complied he bought a small farm and went on a quest to find werewolves in need of help preferably young ones that would also be impressionable it was easier to find them than he had expected pitifully easy young wizards and witches homeless penniless and starving because of their infirmity he convinced five of them to come with him live at his farm and work using the tightly locked down shed for transformation time with an endless supply of wolfsbane potion five young werewolves learning to work a farm enjoying life for the first time in years only one of them with family that would still claim him the companionship they had developed eventually felt to remus more like home than anything he d felt since the marauder days being at hogwarts now meant that those five young people were back at the farm on their own remus hoped they were carrying on as he had taught them working hard to have food to eat pooling their limited finances and discussing their options intelligently until remus had found them each had been leaning toward joining voldemort ranks at one time or another the drive of the werewolf to kill and destroy was strong and the message of voldemort to these downtrodden and persecuted beings was no more complicated than take your revenge on the world that turned its back on you remus worried about them a great deal almost as much as he worried about harry harry remus sighed and the usual frown line creased itself between his graying blonde eyebrows it seemed as if through a slow ponderous shifting of the universe over the last five years one boy one very lonely and tormented boy had become the focus of all things good or bad every plot led to harry downfall and every defense was raised in his honor how could one person handle this much importance might not the simple pressure of such an existence drive anyone to extremes and yet harry survived continued to survive and do ever more increasingly amazing things of course he was back in the infirmary again this term harry had yet to go to a single class because of all the attempts on his life remus closed his eyes and sighed if severus information was correct there might be several more at first remus hadntwanted to take the threat seriously even dumbledore had been reckoning against the slytherins actually following through on their plots but so far two had nearly succeeded pansy had given harry a love potion and nearly dragged him quite willingly off to voldemort goyle had managed to get charlie kidnapped which led to harry following in a suicidal rescue mission if sirius were alive remus thought with sudden vehemence he would have flayed harry within an inch of his life for that little stunt and so would james but then again remus thought with that same wan smile had they been here one of them would most likely have gone with him had it been padfoot guarding the infirmary that day he would never have let himself get knocked out by a hex from harry invisible or no and so harry would have pled his case sirius would have listened grinned and said what are we waiting for shaking his head slightly remus picked up the tea cup and took a last bitter swallow of the liquid disdaining to study the dregs in the bottom of his tea cup on principle with care he set the cup back in its saucer the clinking of hogwarts fine china like music to his unaccustomed ears he picked up the marauders map for the tenth time this hour and searched through the school keeping his eyes open for any name in an unusual spot he was also keeping an eye open for narcissa malfoy who surely hadntgiven up on her plans yet somewhere beneath them she was biding her time ready to come back when harry was most vulnerable or maybe draco she seemed equally likely damage to one as the other strange turn of events they had finally come up with a good strategy to make the marauder map more helpful with bill help remus had discovered a charm for the map that would render invisible any student enrolled at hogwarts the only problem was it had to be done for each individual student and required a complex spell so far they had managed to get an eighth of the student body entered taking care not to apply it to slytherins or any student reported to be acting mysteriously as many students had been remus smiled harry speech at the beginning of term had really galvanized the younger students into almost constant tattle telling and it took someone with the wisdom of solomon to figure out which tips were real and which were only the vibrant spinnings of an overexcited impressionable mind the dots on the map had blurred before his eyes and remus sharpened his gaze preadly gartopholus and barton belinda were strolling together outside on the grounds hopefully heading for some innocuous place and not for a secret annhiliate potter meeting not that any of those had been successfully reported it was just bits and pieces that kept coming in millicent bulstrode harassing ginny blaise zabini threatening that first year gryffindor that harry had befriended what was his name timothy or then remus jerked and leaned farther over the map his breathing arrested malfoy narcissa there she was in the hallway heading for the great hall or past it to the infirmary bloody remus jumped to his feet grabbed his wand from the table and knocked it into the small innocuous looking lump of white wax on the desk tonks remus voice strained to be quiet at yet commanding what shrieked tonks and a muffled thumping and various crashes could be heard over her voice it remus tonks narcissa malfoy is remus is that you yes narcissa damn suit of armor i swear those things move tonks quiet what is it she suddenly sounded business like narcissa malfoy is on her way you should be able to see her soon unless she got that wait where did you say i dontsee anything just a bunch of claws heading out the great hall remus watched with horror as malfoy narcissa turned the corner and headed into the foyer where tonks nymphdora was stationed she right there tonks she ll be in snake form or under an invisibility cloak five steps behind patil padma okay i ll get her i dodging padma sorry luv i ahh screams came over after tonks voice faded dammit bloody remus tapped the blue patch of wax on the desk mad eye lupin the man barked back immediately remus jerked up the map tonks is down narcissa malfoy is on her way up the southern stairwell watch out she ll be under her invisibility cloak if she managed to take out tonks right remus agreed sweat starting to bead on his upper lip as he scanned the map feverishly if she got past mad eye there was no one to head her off until she reached the infirmary where weasley fred was standing guard she was moving incredibly fast remus stabbed the orange patch of wax and barked out fred get ready narcissa is on her way what now she down on the southern stairwell facing off with mad eye right now oh well good so mad eye will take care of her he can see through invisibility cloaks you know yes i know that but you must be on your guard lupin she got one o the kids round the neck i cantget an angle on her smug little protego ugh crashing noises and thuds were all remus could hear mad eye what happened after a moment the man voice came back on much more quietly this time she cast a bludgeoning curse hit my shield and knocked me down two flights of steps warn weasley and potter two minutes later after frantic communications with fred and the headmaster remus sprang for the door moving so fast that the marauder map slipped off the desk and to the floor with a gentle scrape as if the heat of remus horrified gaze had made the lone dots in the infirmary stand out even more against the faded parchment the words potter harry and malfoy narcissa radiated side by side with all the intensity of a solar flare a n thanks to you guys for being so patient while i got this chapter written and betaed while hbp was being published and read by millions i decided to take a hiatus this wasa short prologue to set up the very very long chapter that follows hang with me that chapter should be up tomorrow my lovely beta musings is putting the final touches on it for me today chapter 16 fall out is the longest i ve written yet lots of catching up to do hopefully soon we ll actually see harry in a gasp class wontthat be a change of pace he he he chapter seventeen something found harry could see the hatred pooling in narcissa eyes as he pressed his wand harder into her neck they stood rigid locked together potential energy incarnate at any second one of them would break the pose and deadly spells would start flying narcissa twisted ginny face into a sneer that infuriated him enjoy your kiss he asked snarling her face was strained and pale his wand was digging in tight no but then i knew what i was getting into when i started it i have done it before you know she smiled wickedly harry couldntthink what she meant but the idea sent nausea rolling through him like a high tide then her face transformed so quickly into a sweet sorrowful look that he was taken aback her voice slid into a higher sweeter tone i wanted to apologize again for not remembering what a rough summer you had at first he could only grasp at the words meaning rough summer the memories assaulted him poisoned cake handkerchief portkey torture lucius she knew she knew what he had done wait he shook his head to clear it the words she had just said and the tone of voice he recognized it who had said that to him someone unusual just before kissing him susan susan bones harry stared at narcissa that was you she began to back away and harry only then realized he had let her go he raised his wand dont move she cackled her face once again transformed into evil ginny i ve been playing with you ever since you arrived foolish boy i ve been people you dont even know about harry froze like who he barely got the words out as his mind brought up friend after friend who she could have impersonated trying to kill him trying to kill draco or oh the boy who lived needs a little hint lucius always said you were too smart for your own diffindo protego she blocked his spell easily and the jet of light whipped back past his shoulder harmlessly harry was shaking he d cast that spell at her without thinking nausea was eating him alive she d kissed him twice she d been playing with him all term and that bastard husband of hers she stepped closer wand still raised remember the toast i meant it for you of course but killing that insipid house elf that was so fond of you was certainly no disappointment would have been better if it could have been a weasley but we must be grateful for what we re given harry nausea hardened into a cold numbing hatred his fist clenched his wand tight and his nostrils flared with each breath she d polyjuiced herself as neville she d brought him poisoned toast she killed dobby harry dug down deep and forced a smile you just cantseem to keep your hands off me narcissa you re stalking me in my room digging through my things he gestured to the invisibility cloak on the floor how long has that been missing first morning of term ring a bell i sorry were you sleeping too hard to see me as neville of course searching your trunk harry nodded like i said stalking me digging through my things kissing me makes me wonder the side of his mouth quirked is lucius not man enough for you her eyes shot wide open and he could see the intent in them even before the jet of purple light left her wand time seemed to slow he had time to curse himself to assess how far away his wand was from being ready and to see how desperate the situation was then his magic kicked in and with a whorl of power he was in motion harry twisted and flung himself back the purple flame grew brighter as it neared the heat of it began to scorch his face and then he was looking the other way feeling the sting of fire on the outer layer of his skin and watching the flame continue past behind him narcissa let out a guttural howl the jet of light hit something loud and breakable and harry was still falling falling backwards in a slow arc that he knew was trouble what was behind him infirmary bed got to move crash harry was on all fours beside the end of the bed shaking his head to clear the last second he had managed to bring one arm around and under him so that his hand caught the floor first and vaulted the rest of his body over and into the bed frame at least he landed on his feet narcissa was looking away what is going on in here harry whipped his head over just in time to see a flash of red catch madame pomfrey in the chest and fling her back so hard that she disappeared back into her office then he was up on his feet wand aimed at narcissa curse on his lips narcissa you have greatly disappointed me harry froze his eyes flickering over narcissa shoulder to where professor dumbledore had just appeared she whipped around wand aimed harry took aim as well reducto she screamed and flung a hex at dumbedore who merely waved a hand to block the spell in mid flight the spell struck a leaded glass bookcase with a crash reducto harry snarled and was stunned to see dumbledore again raise his hand and block the spell into a shelf of vials crash what are you doing harry yelled harry professor dumbledore cautioned with a word then turned to narcissa why are you so bent on destruction narcissa i would have thought this far more likely from your sister than you concidus she shrieked in return only to have that curse knocked aside easily into a wall she screamed and jerked around to take aim at harry once again concidus before he realized it harry was on the ground the spell going over his head and connecting with something breakable in madame pomfrey office crash enough of this accio wand dumbledore said tiredly despite narcissa attempt at blocking the spell her wand flew up and into the headmaster hand she hissed at him through clenched teeth like a cornered cat the headmaster only raised his eyebrows take care dear girl i am no longer your amiable teacher narcissa staccato laugh cut through his words like a blade through flesh she began to back away toward the wall looking back and forth between harry and dumbledore a dangerous smile was playing on her face you dont know what i know she said in a singsong voice and i not going to tell you she smiled sweetly a genuine ginny smile that unnerved harry what what do you know the headmaster gave harry a cautioning glance aurors will be here shortly and it might be in your best interest to cooperate aurors aurors she laughed wildly they re pathetic i just beat some of their best with an invisibility cloak and a hostage you think azkaban will hold a malfoy you have been proved wrong on that count before dumbledore sighed they will find a way narcissa then i ll never tell what i know she hissed which is what harry said through clenched teeth wishing dumbledore would just go away and let him have it out with her his stomach was in knots narcissa looked at him that you will die soon boy a victim at that word something like an electric shock went through harry and he jumped forward wand raised no i not going to die i not going to be a victim not of anything breathing hard he pressed forward and pointed his wand at her i going to find out who trying to kill me and i going to get them first got it and that includes you for a moment there was only the sound of harry harsh breathing in the room narcissa looked at him through hooded eyes are you threatening me boy hell yes harry gripped his wand so tightly that it shook so very tough narcissa whispered low enough that it barely carried to harry ears but not after lucius was through with you oh no not then you would do well to remember the room seemed to grow dim around harry eyes his heart thudded and sweat beaded on his upper lip he blinked several times he swallowed and said something into the vacuum around him something about lucius getting what was coming to him but far from feeling capable of revenge at the moment he had all he could handle just to stand up straight dumbledore was talking slowly harry lowered his wand and he found himself staring at the floor narcissa was laughing he knew he should stop her but he could her lucius voice like he d never left the manor and that horrid mirrored room do you know what revenge feels like harry harry an uncertain voice was calling him he looked up to see ginny staring in the doorway blood running down her cheek she looked mussed and tense with pain as remus lupin stood beside her breathlessly holding her up where madame pomfrey remus said fred needs to be helped and i think miss weasley may have a concussion just as remus stopped short ginny eyes widened and her jaw dropped harry looked where she was staring and saw narcissa looking every inch her twin lounging against the wall smirking ginny walked forward as if possessed but harry focused on the blood running down her cheek she d gotten hurt narcissa had hurt ginny harry blood ran hot and he started forward harry dumbledore said warningly revenge is not sufficient excuse for violence you must stop before someone else gets hurt harry looked around at the old wizard feeling as if someone had ripped his head off and attached it wrong maybe i want someone else to get hurt maybe i want her to get hurt you know what she did to me to dobby to ginny and god only knows who else this has to stop it has to end i sick of this sick of it taking out your anger on narcissa will not help dumbledore said to him in gentle words under girded with steel then what will ignoring what she done pretending that it all going to go away harry had begun and now he couldntstop i havent been to a single bloody class all term and i couldntcare less none of that matters how can i pretend that school is important and that the bloody house cup matters when at any moment i could be facing him again he scrubbed a hand across his face and dropped it again by his side suddenly his throat was clogged and it was difficult to speak dontyou see this is it he shrugged his shoulders once this time one man left standing or one thing and the entire wizarding world at stake not just the wizarding world harry dumbledore added soberly the muggle world as well the weight of his destiny rested back on harry shoulders with the familiarity of a old coat it calmed his anger depressed his need for revenge narcissa wasntthe real opponent she was just a crazed mental lackey harry turned his back on narcissa and walked away he ended up at his bed and sat his left hand was throbbing again great what was madame pomfrey going to oh harry turned around and interrupted remus report telling them that madame pomfrey might be seriously injured professor dumbledore was on the move before harry had finished speaking narcissa sat against the wall the conjured ropes holding her tightly she narrowed her eyes at harry lucius is coming for you boy and silencio ginny snapped stepping closer to the helpless witch on the floor and kneeling in front of her how dare you speak to him that way and how dare you use that that and my face too words seemed to fail ginny and she reared back and punched narcissa right in the nose harry jaw dropped narcissa head thunked back against the wall and she stared at ginny in stunned pained amazement harry felt a smile slide over his face as blood began to drip from narcissa nose ginny smiled thinly that looks better sounds better too if i were you i d stay away from me narcissa just stared at her ginny seemed satisfied with that and turned a smug look on harry who was watching her with undisguised admiration but as ginny walked over to him the smile slid off his face she sat down beside him bouncing the mattress she didnt look at him for almost a solid minute they just both watched the dust mites fly through the stream of sunset colored light from the window harry didntknow what she was thinking as for himself there didntseem to be anything that would catch in his mind everything was just still and quiet ginny slid her hand over his pulling away his wand and setting it aside then she took his hand in both of hers and held it gently after a few moments harry eyes filled but ginny didntask any questions didnt ask why he was so overwrought or why the threat of lucius seemed to work so well on him no she just sat there leaning her head on his arm holding his good hand and breathing deeply they sat that way until ron arrived at the door breathless with mad eye moody hung over his shoulder you all right harry yeah fine i d have come sooner but the rock said you were okay besides the pain in your hand and moody was in pretty rough shape he wouldntlet me levitate him not a sack of potatoes boy mad eye grunted put me on that bed there ron grunted and strained to carry mad eye finally leaning him toward the mattress until the auror fell on the bed i said i not a sack of potatoes where that damn pamfrey woman harry pointed to the bed across the way pomfrey she right there mad eye just grunted damn malfoy woman she get everybody not me harry said quietly good the auror barked then lay back on the bed and settled his hands on his chest whoever in charge i last i fine just a broke rib or two no problem ron came over and stared at ginny bloody hell what happened to you harry looked over at her too she did look pale but not weak at all in fact her eyes flashed at her brother and she growled her answer that damn malfoy woman ron catch up i went out there to check on fred and he was already under fire she had harry invisibility cloak on you know or i would have got her ron backed off well yeah of course you would ve me too i mean if i d been here and not eating i sorry harry i should ve been here some bodyguard harry held up a hand ron he made his friend meet his gaze with a long pause it okay i fine well no offense but you dontlook fine i fine i bloody well fine ron pulled out the rock well except for your hand harry grabbed the rock and chucked it down the infirmary hey someone yelled harry looked up to see a team of aurors entering the room one had his wand out and harry rock was frozen in midair he was a tall dark skinned man clean cut and attractive his voice had an accent but harry wasntsure what it was yet sorry harry mumbled the auror let the rock fall to the floor no problem harry felt ginny and ron staring at him but he didntfeel much like talking in fact while the aurors questioned narcissa harry deflected attempts from both dumbledore and lupin to talk about why he d reacted so strongly to narcissa words lupin finally took ron aside something that irritated harry to no end ginny was the only one who seemed to understand that harry needed to be left alone he glanced over at her she was seated on the bed across the room from him as a mediwitch from st mungo fussed over the cut on her face her brown eyes were pained but she smiled as soon as she saw him looking at her harry smiled back just barely another mediwitch was looking over madame pomfrey who was quiet and still on the bed beside them harry frowned narcissa spell should have just knocked her out and he was surprised madame pomfrey wasntup and about yet dumbledore was walking over to her now having questioned mad eye thoroughly the headmaster face was stern and as tense as harry had ever seen it if he was that angry why had he been so benevolent to narcissa dumbledore noticed harry watching him with a careful look he started over harry turned back to narcissa who had yet to say a word to the aurors narcissa if you dontstart cooperating we ll have to use veritaserum said the tall auror in charge the dark skinned man with what had to be a mediterranean accent he d given his name as fornier or maybe forney something like that and seemed to know narcissa somehow now he smiled at her i know you dontwant us to do that narcissa there no telling what might come out i ll bet you know all kinds of little secrets narcissa gave a funny little jerk but said nothing harry dumbledore said and harry realized the headmaster was beside him now how is your hand feeling fine harry answered automatically though his hand was aching to the bone that back handspring he d done to get away from narcissa spell had put all of his weight on the still healing hand she not going to tell them anything is she i afraid you might be correct we will have to hope that whatever secrets she has hidden will be easily discerned once we journey down into the chamber of secrets once everything has been dealt with here we may need for you to accompany us harry i know harry promised dumbledore waved his hand and a pink flowered armchair appeared the headmaster took a seat then waved his arm and put up a silencing charm harry looked over at him in surprise dumbledore was studying him so intently that harry looked away you seem to have some issues left over from this summer harry perhaps in our haste to get you back in tip top health we neglected to make sure that you were healthy in other ways harry gaze skittered over to the headmaster then away again i fine maybe my hand hurts a little harry the headmaster voice was full of compassion i have told you before that what you feel makes you the kind of person you are what i not upset about what she said if anything i upset because you wouldntlet me deal with her the way i grab her shouts from the aurors broke in their conversation somebody get the mediwitch we need a mediwitch she convulsing harry couldntsee narcissa for all the bodies in the way but it didntsound good a mediwitch was pushing the aurors away i think it was poisoning she poisoned herself how we were sitting right here oh god look at her mouth harry finally got a view around fornier and stared now he knew how mrs weasley felt when she faced that boggart he knew it wasntginny there limp bound with pale gray skin those werenther front teeth elongated and protruding from her mouth in the shape of two inch bloody fangs but still the sight was electrifying he couldnt quite catch his breath that not ginny not ginny bloody ron over on the other side of the aurors was gaping he exchanged a slightly panicked stunned look with harry when the bloody hell did she grow those fornier turned to his aurors with an amazed look a short ruddy man answered i i dontknow sir i was watching her the whole time and i didntsee anything unusual like two bloody pokers sticking out of her mouth the man shook his head i guess it was too fast i dontknow did anybody else see anything when no one else answered he went on i didnt even know it was possible to partially transform like that anyone else the headmaster waved and vanished his chair away it is a rare gift but i have seen it before it a shame we could not learn more from her fornier finally said to his team but a fitting end nonetheless professor dumbledore gave harry a long sad look before striding forward to check the body of narcissa himself harry wasntsad at least she wasnt sneaking around the castle trying to kill him anymore or kiss him he shuddered just then he realized ginny was beside him again arentyou glad a snake not my animagus shape she asked quietly her hand on his arm ugh the mediwitch is ready to treat your hand when he didntmove or even look away from the body she tugged at his hand come on harry harry went willingly but the need to get alone and think things through was getting overwhelming he saw ron sitting on another bed looking as shell shocked as he felt over by the door a quiet conversation was taking place between the headmaster and lupin professor dumbledore looked pleased then the mediwitch came over and blocked his view fussing over harry hand unwrapping it and declaring it a horrendous mess giving him two potions and nearly ordering him back into bed thank goodness the headmaster had come over by that time and he leaned on her to let harry go he spent far too much time in here already this term this is a small injury that he can deal with on his own as long as miss weasley performs the cleaning spell every day as she was instructed i will ginny said firmly i ll make sure he takes care of it and ron will make sure he takes his pain potions ron jumped up and walked over i will i got my kidneystone back he held it up i mean not my kidneystone harry s i mean well not his kidneystone but a dragon kidneystone that oh forgetaboutit as he trailed off harry tried hard not to glare at him yes i understand mr weasley use it well harry lupin has informed me that in her haste to leave the chamber narcissa left the hidden door wide open there will be no need for you to accompany us on our search harry was mostly relieved to be let off but he pursed his lips something was niggling at his mind is there a problem harry no sir but you d you d better look for rats dumbledore eyes twinkled indeed that is my first priority harry nodded they were obviously thinking the same thing the tunnel to the chamber had collapsed at the end of harry second year only a very small person or a small animagus could likely get through there if a snake animagus could get the chamber open then who better than a rat animagus to accompany her harry awoke with the gradual awareness that he was back in his own dorm listening to the very familiar sound of ron griping what was it ron was saying harry frowned and grabbed for his glasses ouch he tried again with his good hand wake up ron said in between yawns you gotta take this the curtains of harry bed were opened and bland morning light spilled in around his red headed friend it was still early harry blinked and made out the vial of something purple in his friend hand that for pain of course but i not i mean i dont ron disappeared in a flurry of curtains and swear words muttering all the way to his bed and back harry was just wondering what in the world he d done to hack his friend off so much when a small stone thunked onto his chest it was a most interesting mottle color cream glaring red and faded yellow and it was very very hot ron pointed to it scowling you wanna explain that you re fine to that thing then it driving me starkers harry picked it up suddenly registering that this was the stone spelled to his physical condition it hot of course it is that why i up at this indecent hour would you just take the bloody pain potion please ron thrust the vial at him again harry drank his potion the throbbing of his hand suddenly to the forefront of his mind his little duel with narcissa had aggravated his injury quite a bit but he still hated the thought of going to classes with the sling on all those slytherins would think he was off his game and be more likely to attack wouldntthey the rock in his good hand immediately started to cool and the color of oatmeal slowly vanquished the others about time ron groused bloody stone now i just have to get you to breakfast and maybe the bloody thing will leave me alone sorry harry shrugged as he handed it back no no ron backtracked you keep it for a while i going to catch five more minutes ron disappeared from behind the curtains it going to be a bad day i can feel it harry put the rock under his pillow wouldntdo for that thing to get into the wrong hands or well it wouldnthurt either apparently all it would do is nag someone until they tried to help him harry got up and started his daily routine glad to be up and about doing it even if the sling made things awkward it did help him remember not to use his hand which was the whole point anyway by the time he was ready to go downstairs the other boys were stirring ron was the last of course and harry had to ruthlessly yank open his curtains and pull off his bedclothes to get him up then he waited while ron stumbled around the room getting his clothes on once losing his balance and taking neville down in a tumble of pajama clad legs and arms when they finally exited the room and took the stairs they got their first taste of the hysteria that was to characterize the day it harry he back nearly a dozen gryffindors were waiting down below cheering and calling up to him other voices started calling from behind and by the time harry reached the portrait hole the room was nearly full of gryffindors still tucking in shirts combing their hair or pulling on their jackets all clamouring to see him it was very flattering but a bit overwhelming by the hermione had made it to his side and a fourth well wisher had jostled his bad hand ron was enjoying it much more than harry i afraid it may be like this all day hermione said with a glint in her eyes that said she was enjoying this as well harry sighed what did i do to deserve this well for one thing you ran off on a rescue mission without telling anyone she said smugly but i had to charlie life was at stake yeah hermione stop being so down on him he a hero ron defended him roundly yeah came the echoes of several others of course he is she sniffed i just meant that he should have told someone he was going and and maybe waited to see what the plan was i not saying he shouldnthave gone at all oh forget it she concluded when seeing the glares around her she gave harry a careful hug i just glad you re back and i wontsay anything else about it at least not until the next time you do something dangerous thanks i think harry hugged her back when she pulled away she was serious again her brown eyes searching his but really try to understand why everyone is so excited you have no idea what most of them went through to defend you against the slytherins and to defend ginny when everyone said your coma was her fault maybe you should say something yeah ron echoed harry nervously resettled his sling looking for a way out but not finding it finally he turned around to face the common room crowd almost immediately everyone quieted harry shook his head and smiled a little smiles broke out around him and several gryffindors called out we told them you d be back harry i knew they didnt have you all along down with the death eaters down with the slyterins three cheers for harry and as they hurrahed harry rubbed at his neck and straightened his tie and gestured for them to quiet thanks guys it means a lot to me that you er for you to what i mean to say is that this is great but it is just me i mean i don t how your hand harry that was collin creevy harry smiled at him fine the mediwitch was just being careful really now what i trying to say is could we maybe just not do all this faces around him faltered and harry tried again it great really and i know how hard it all been but not i mean i know exactly what you mean faces turned toward the top of the stairs harry smiled there with vibrant red hair falling around her shoulders in soft curls and a dimpled smile playing at her mouth was ginny she descended the stairs in an expectant silence all eyes on her harry was just enjoying the view but he was aware of the whispers at the same time ginny walked right over to him the gryffindors parting easily for her when she reached him both arms went around his neck and just as harry was starting to protest her lips met his stunned he could do little but put his arms around her waist hold her tight and give in it was a soft sweet kiss that went on a bit too long or so harry thought with the pressure of all those eyes around them ginny pulled back and smiled at him then she turned to face her audience what he means to say is that he now taken their housemates erupted in applause and whoops of delight harry flushing furiously pulled away from ginny but she grabbed his hand and gave him a possessive smile that made his heart feel like it had just performed a blindingly brilliant wronksi feint then harry caught sight of the twins making their way over and his smile faltered he still hadntdecided whether they liked him with ginny or not now dontlook so nervous old boy fred said with a glint in his eyes buck up george added it not as if we didntknow what was going on before no of course not fred continued in fact you might say that we even planned for this eventuality the twins looked at each other musingly george added hoped for it they turned to harry after all we do have a whole line of products developed just for situations like this ginny held up her hand donteven start with me gin gin bitsy she glared at them we re not starting anything with you of course not we just have to make sure that if anyone is going to be brought into the family they can stand a few pranks pranks harry finally spoke up oh nothing too bad fred said reassuringly just the occasional product placement when necessary necessary harry voice cracked which he hated himself for he could face down tom and a dozen death eaters but not ginny twin brothers well yeah george said putting his arm around harry neck like for example now when some bloke has just snogged our sister in full view of the common room bad form that fred said shaking his head must be consequences but but she kissed me harry protested he turned to ginny but she was smiling smiling sorry mate but it must be done george tugged harry back with the arm around his throat and whispered two words down toward his injured arm freckle juice harry sling erupted into a psychedelic cascade of color swirls of purple red and blue chased each other down the fabric highlighting the black letters harry arm do not remove ginny pealed with laughter and ron snorted loudly harry groaned he d been hoping against hope that no one would notice the damn sling after a while and now this oh honestly hermione said half exasperated half impressed fred shook his head in mock regret i sorry we had to do this to you harry i just hope you learned your lesson harry glared at him i dontthink he has brother george said seriously oh how terrible let try this one then sling o rama oy harry was yelling jerking his sling away from the twins hoping it wouldnt work but then the sling froze and its colors melted into one sickly brown color that faded until it was a light tan color then two spots appeared and one long line from upside down it was hard to tell but it looked kind of like a face uh oh the eyes blinked the mouth opened and it spoke loudly make way for the boy who lived harry buried his face in one hand v i d w k coming through v i d w k ron repeated very important dark wizard killer of course fred supplied here comes the pride of gryffindor the dreamboat of amateur quidditch and the triwizard champion of turn it off harry bellowed i cantwalk around like this fred raised his eyebrows and tilted his head to one side eyeing george not good ron said unnecessarily george nodded at fred fred nodded back sorry harry but you didntsay the magic word version 6 0 the face on the sling shuddered and blurred a moustache grew over the mouth and heavy eyebrows fred and george looked absolutely gleeful hello it said in heavy spanish accent i am de sling of de great harry potter did choo know dat he is not wearing any underwear to mmph harry who had slapped his hand over the sling mouth appealed to ginny either they make it stop or i dontwear it her eyes lit up immediately and she leveled a look at her brothers they caved oh all right bitsy george whined no need to get all huffy apple cart turnover the sling lost its face and obliged by immediately breaking out in a rash of undulating green apples harry sighed i suppose that as good as its going to get you need to lighten up harry fred said ruffing up harry hair before heading for the portrait hole besides everyone ll be so busy talking about your sling they wontbother about how heroic you are see you at breakfast george said with a wave harry had to admit that maybe that was true the gryffindors had broken up laughing and showed no signs of forthcoming hero worship maybe the twins were on to something come on i starved ron led the way out of the portrait hole grabbing harry book bag as well as his own harry was about to protest when ginny hand stole into his free one after that such a feeling of well being came over him that he couldnteven join in the worrying over what narcissa had hinted at hermione was obsessive about it trying to figure out what secret the evil witch had been hiding but harry agreed with ginny assumption at the moment that the witch had only been taunting them and really had no secret at all well maybe it something like how she going to kill the ferret in the end ron said in an upbeat tone that wouldntbe so bad just then they reached the wall where the house points were on display harry was dismayed to see that the gryffindor hourglass not only had no rubies in it but there were a few of the dark green slytherin emeralds in it as well as a few black diamonds of the hufflepuff house what going on harry asked hermione oh all four of the houses lost so many points that there werentany more to take away so dumbledore developed this new system of keeping score if a gryffindor lost points by hexing a slytherin then our house took on emerald points yeah ron said mournfully it wontgo back to being rubies until we dig ourselves out of this hole we re in seems like your rescue of charlie would have counted for something it did hermione said that took us from negative 250 points to negative 20 we re much better off now than we were before no thanks to you ron what d i do he demanded you fought every slytherin that came into your path only because every slytherin said that harry was a goner harry shook his head and sighed still horrified at how badly things had gone while he was unconscious he was going to have to show the houses how to get along again tell them that he was okay and there was no reason to take out their aggression on each other ginny let go of his hand i think i ll walk in first you know give everyone a few days to get used to the way things are now harry looked at her discomfited you dontneed the extra attention you know he stared at her fully aware that he was probably giving her a lost puppy dog look but he couldnthelp it he felt so much better with her holding his hand she looked at him warningly dontgive me that look raised her eyebrows please she sighed loudly oh all right she took his hand and groused all the way into the great hall that look is going to be trouble harry felt mildly pleased with himself but then again troubled by the fact that he wanted to hold a girl hand that badly was he that messed up of course once he actually walked into the great hall he forgot about that worry entirely five steps in and everyone was turning pointing and calling out to him the sling went psychedelic apparently responding to all the noise just what harry wanted eight steps in and his eyes were drawn to the ravenclaw table where cho chang was standing up looking in his direction damn he was mentally kicking himself for promising to speak this morning when a strained cry caught his attention harry neville voice immediately the hair on the back of harry neck stood up and he dropped ginny hand knocked hermione into ron ejected his wand and whipped it around protego the shield was fully formed and the bludgeoning curse merely knocked him back a few feet there was an explosion of voices and a scream as harry leveled his wand at draco ron wand was aimed a second later the screams died down to a gasp welcome back potter the blond sneered thanks harry spat out just before letting loose two almost simultaneous spells while draco blocked the disarming spell the bludgeoning curse hit him on one shoulder spinning him around and lifting him off his feet harry noted with satisfaction that not one of his cronies cast a cushioning charm for him chapter 2 welcome to my world the shriek came from a lipless mouth underneath a nose that was sodden but recognizable its eyes burned brilliant yellow from behind shuttered narrow lids more like a man than a cat s but the thing was not a man as it stepped forward on its lion like paws and crouched a scorpion tail swiped testily through the brush behind it it was something they had studied harry mind frantically searched for its name man head lion body scorpion tail his mind threw out the relevant facts hermione had drilled into him tail full of deadly poison hide impervious to hexes and mouth perhaps capable of pot ter it croaked in hacking syllables speech you pot ter harry wand was instantly back in his hand but he hesitated the creature seemed bloodthirsty but what if he was another pet of hagrid s what if you die pot ter it said with the air of someone correcting himself then it smiled an evil smile harry braced himself then flung a strong impedimenta curse in its direction watching numbly as it bounced off without effect the thing shrieked again its face contorted into a mask of hatred you will die it leapt forward in a ripple of sinuous muscle harry fell back slinging a strong reducto curse as he went that promptly bounced off its chest nearly taking harry left arm then the thing was before him rearing shrieking sharp teeth bared claws out harry raised his wand and wham he was instantly ten feet to the side feeling the impact all over then tumbling over and over with something he couldnteven see he landed on his back breathless again staring up at the cloudless sky listening to the thing shriek and malfoy curse flamboyantly his broom harry broom had carried the disillusioned malfoy with it and they had knocked him off his feet potter you idiot i supposed to be at hogwarts right now why didntyou just get off the bloody broom harry turned to his side clutching at the newly sharpened pain in his ribs and i supposed to be at hogwarts too one more move made him gasp in pain malfoy just had to hit him in the ribs didnthe i didntget off the bloody broom because it was traveling too fast you pitiful excuse for a oh my that a manticore where the hell did that thing come from malfoy voice rose steadily in pitch harry looked over his shoulder to see the thing settling back into a crouch great no idea dontsuppose you know a curse that penetrates manticore hide do you it going to kill me malfoy shrieked look at it it getting ready to attack if you want to keep on screaming like a girl harry muttered but he didntsay it too loud the manticore seemed disturbed by malfoy voice it was shaking its head back and forth and even more importantly it wasntpouncing yet harry glanced over to where malfoy was and saw that though dirt and dust clung to malfoy form he was still largely invisible harry climbed to his feet carefully he cantsee you at any rate he took a deeper breath grimacing his ribs were on fire but he didntthink they were broken maybe we can use that to our advantage what malfoy was near hysterical you dontunderstand i ve i ve had nightmares about manticores since i was i boy harry was beyond disgusted i thought you said you werentscared that there was nothing more they could do to you he glanced around again but the invisible broom was just that invisible i wasnttalking about wild animals potter the voice was aimed right at harry now that thing can do a lot to me not wild animal the manticore growled taking a step forward and peering in malfoy direction he he it it talks just find the broom malfoy harry said under his breath and keep talking he didntdare move the manticore tail was twitching find the find the what i not your valet you insufferable and here his language grew even more colorful the manticore shifted and sniffed the air he took another step forward his gaze set unfalteringly where malfoy stood time to go accio broom harry hissed and held out his hand a thunk and a loud cry interrupted malfoy tirade quite satisfactorily then the firebolt settled itself into harry grip and he mounted it oh you ll regret that potter malfoy said in a voice tinged with malice the shifting in his voice making it clear that he was getting to his feet mark my word so marked harry said watching the manticore keenly now get on no malfoy said peevishly i dont want to ride with you then use your portkey you prat at that the manticore crouched and pounced in a blur of golden movement malfoy screamed he hadnthad time to get to his portkey and harry was already off the ground with sudden inspiration harry aimed his wand down and yelled serpensortia sextus the manticore was now below him searching the ground where malfoy stood his tail reaching back to strike with a long hisssssss six snakes rained down over the manticore and it howled in dismay the tail was immediately busied striking at the slithering bodies nearby malfoy was hysterically babbling and harry waited until his mouth sounded full then his voice cut off as though a door had been shut harry pulled up and away from the furious beast just as the five snakes hissed in unison die manticore die the manticore howled in pain two snakes lay immobile but the tail was not fast enough to strike all remaining four three had imbedded themselves in its haunches the other was hissing around its paws with another shriek the manticore fled in a ripple of fury passing back into the dense brush beside the shack brushing off two of the snakes on the way harry turned his broom in the direction of hogwarts and flew as fast as he dared that manticore had been waiting for him who knew what other surprises tom had out here despite himself and the pain he was fighting harry enjoyed the flight his firebolt cut through the air just as cleanly as he remembered it wasntuntil he got near to his destination that he remembered who was after him and that tom wouldnthave given up so easily he slowed as the mighty gates of hogwarts came into view then started violently as dumbledore voice came out of thin air ah mr potter you have made it safely might i persuade you to fly over the lake as the gate is under attack at present bon voyage harry had found the small lump of wax fastened onto his broom almost as soon as dumbledore voice had erupted from it now he fought the urge to peel it off and instead did as the voice asked he could just hear hermione voice in his head saying harry stop fiddling with that you re in danger as he flew closer he could see that there were several figures engaged in battle at the gates his mouth settled into a grim line as the long line of black robes and white death masks turned his way shouts rang out harry clung tighter to his broom and veered west two red beams of light shot in his direction but he swerved around them easily and then the line of death eaters was scattered by a bellow of rage harry head jerked to look over at grawp who was lumbering up to the gate beside hagrid oh no harry groaned now everyone would know there was a giant at hogwarts but the appearance of the giant had changed things considerably death eaters were disapparating so often that it sounded like microwave popcorn soon it was only dumbledore snape hagrid and grawp standing by the gates hagrid waved until grawp flung a thick hand back to wave as well sending hagrid flying keep going harry dumbledore encouraged through the wax blob the lake is still much safer once you are safe inside please check in with madame pomfrey harry nodded and resumed full speed heading for the body of water on the rear of the school grounds once there he could see why the headmaster had directed him that way a full contingent of mermen and mermaids were swimming near the surface and the giant squid had seven of his tentacles waving languidly in the air they gave harry just a moment of hesitation then he flew in between the bulbous slimy appendages that smelled vaguely of algae and moth balls one of them waved as he went by harry shook his head to clear it then he was over the water and on school grounds in spite of himself he let out a deep sigh he d made it mr potter we are making our way back into the school now and all are accounted for the hogwarts express is doing just fine charlie has reported in safe and sound and you ll be pleased to know i sure that mr malfoy made it safely in as well oh very pleased i sure harry muttered good i should let you know that it was mr malfoy timely warning that led the faculty into the stand at the gates had we not been there your approach would have been much more difficult harry frowned i ll be sure to thank him oh good good he was convinced that you would be less than grateful but i was determined to let you know nonetheless thanks harry said shortly not wanting his thoughts stuck on that git is everyone all right then yes the express is merrily on its way by now harry was at the back steps lowering himself down to the ground regretfully there was just something about flying his firebolt the light touchdown jarred his ribs so that they burned as he dismounted he took in several painful breaths before straightening maybe he had broken something his firebolt harry rubbed a hand across the wooden handle lovingly as his eyes prickled and his throat began to ache harry tried to shove away the thought of sirius but he wasntsuccessful and found himself suppressing a painful chuckle at the memory of how proud sirius had been of harry flying if only things could have been normal and sirius could have come to see more quidditch matches if only he would be around this year harry forced himself to stop his gaze traveled the familiar dips and arches of the enormous building in front of him so familiar and yet somehow the building had lost a glow without sirius some of the magic had gone or maybe some of the hope harry had been burying underneath his day to day actions some of the possibilities it was all gone sirius had been what had he been harry sighed unable to find the words he no longer felt borderline suicidal as he had during the summer but his future was more bleak than it had been in years harry started up the stairs with a wince what was it that ginny had written him this summer it had helped every time he looked at it she said that she had missed sirius too not like you do of course but in a breathless pained sort of way that surprises me sometimes he was sort of an ideal to me and in some ways he reminded me of you a smile ghosted across harry lips and the ache in his throat eased a bit he hadntthought of himself as being like sirius in any way at all but it was a comfort to think that maybe something of his godfather survived in him as harry slowly made his way up the stairs and into the school his mind turned to his own condition it couldntbe a good sign that he was going to see madame pomfrey before he even made it up to gryffindor tower with a magical heave the doors to hogwarts opened and harry potter moved over the threshold the shadow of his broom brushing the top of the ceiling like the blessed crosspole of the bishop a n thanks to all who reviewed it so motivating to have other people excited about a story sorry about the mundungus issue i had honestly caught that mistake and edited it out in one draft but didntcatch it before i sent it to my beta and she missed it and that was the copy that i posted stupid me i ve fixed it but thanks for the heads up it isnteasy keeping track of the details sigh dianne i did do a fair amount of re writing on the beginning of this story before posting it honestly started out stodgy and boring but i refused to post it and one day i realized why sequels as a genre are just boring no one wants to know simply what comes next so i started trying to envision this as a new story one that had to start with a bang instead of stupid long winded explanations as soon as i did that i was ready to start writing hopefully i ll still be able to get all the boring information in that you guys need without it calling attention to itself as boring up next interim chapter nineteen dealing with the devil the warm feeling from his defense against the dark arts class stayed with harry the rest of the day in fact he was so cheery at lunch without being able to explain why that ginny was suspicious she looked away from harry and sipped her pumpkin juice maybe you fancy professor haverlime she said airily ron choked on his pumpkin juice did you have to make me imagine that stranger things have been known to happen she continued sliding her gaze over to harry of course i dont fancy her harry protested lightly still smiling she just might fancy him though parvati giggled from down the table as she smeared marmalade on a roll you should have seen her face when he dodged that curse she threw at him ron was horrified but she s she old some old ladies like em young seamus spoke up my aunt bonnie living in with a lad whose only eighteen and she near forty ron made an awful face that disgusting ginny looked appraisingly at harry so haverlime in love with the boy who lived it not like that harry muttered beginning to feel pink in the cheeks she was just very worshipful hermione supplied then frowned when half the table laughed and i not sure it so very funny she turned to harry how is she going to teach you what you need to know if she too busy melting into a puddle of goo every time you deflect a curse teach him ron protested what she supposed to teach him about fighting the dark arts that he doesntalready know harry shook his head i dontknow everything ron of course you don t hermione snapped ron that just the sort of attitude he doesntneed to have if there anything that might put him in danger it thinking that he already ready i not ready i know that harry insisted hmmph ron grumbled i d like to see old haverlime infiltrate one of volde volde vol de mort hideouts and rescue a captured order member hermione stared at ron entranced you said it you said his name harry and ginny exchanged smiles yeah i did didnt i ron grinned hermione patted him on the arm and leaned in to whisper in his ear so what exactly did happen in defense against the dark arts class ginny prodded harry tried to mumble something general and get out of it but she pressed him when he finally did start explaining hermione jumped in because he wasnttelling it right to harry complete embarrassment she gave a full recitation of the events even though almost everyone at their table had been there that it i setting hannah up with george ginny said wiping her eyes after hermione finished harry exchanged a questioning look with ron and why would you do that he asked tentatively fully expecting the loud sigh and glare he got from hermione ginny however just gave him a quick grin oh never you mind harry potter she said with a glint in her eyes that girl business harry raised his hands and shrugged to show that he wasntgoing to touch that topic with a five foot wand he loaded his plate up with his favorites and in between bites asked for a rundown of the quidditch situation the answers were discouraging with three new players and one player moved to a new position the team was far from ready for the season part of the problem was that they had yet to practice with their seeker though they d been meeting on and off for two weeks ron said katie was satisfied with the progress of the chasers thus far but the beaters needed a lot of work the hardest part to hear was the figures and facts ron had amassed about the other house quidditch teams between slytherin unbeatable beaters reynold bartolemew and hector gravesly and hufflepuff terrific triad of chasers from the previous year their season looked tougher than it had in many years they only had just over a month to get the entire team into shape the first match of the season was ravenclaw vs gryffindor and katie as well as ron wanted them to be ready harry was surprised to realize that katie hadntbeen on his back about practice when he mentioned it ron snorted that because she afraid to mention it to you he said exasperated says it not as important as the other stuff you re dealing with well of course it isn t ron hermione said firmly who was no longer nuzzling his side now that he was talking sports quidditch isnteverything there a whole world of wizards out there that dontknow or care anything about quidditch and they lead successful normal happy lives ron stared at her not by my book they don t he shook his head and picked up his goblet of pumpkin juice it comments like that that make me wonder about your sanity he took a swig while ginny giggled hermione you ve really got to pick your battles better harry afternoon class was care of magical creatures which included a stirring and quite frightening lecture on quintapeds given the note of affection and admiration in hagrid voice harry was unsurprised to hear from hermione that quintapeds were classified with four xes by the ministry of magic according to hagrid quintapeds were dangerous carnivores with five clubfooted legs and low slung bodies that particularly enjoyed the taste of humans not that he blamed them poor dumb beasts they had been that way since they had been transfigured into that form by a rival family on their scottish isle hagrid actually wiped a tear away as he opined that having once been human they surely must be the most misunderstood of beasts well he can talk all he wants to ron muttered as long as he doesntstart bringing quintapeds in for us to feed they d likely be very unhappy and go for the hand holding the food instead he wouldntdo that hermione said firmly looking pale you never know with hagrid ron said seriously i think i heard something rustling back behind the shack hermione edged closer to him and ron gave harry a covert grin ron was right the rustling turned out to be a giant golden ox that hagrid led out with a proud look while the students retreated to a safer distance away he very loudly called it a re em and said it was the only one of its kind in the british isles a re em can give grea strength to hoever drinks its blood which o course makes em a very desirable animal fer a dark wizard ter have round hagrid said to the students in a conspiratorial voice as he reached up to pat its golden fur lightly from the slight gasp hermione gave harry knew she was as concerned as he was the slytherins were sitting in a pack as usual and harry could see blaise and theodore nott exchanging pointed glances great just what they needed harry muttered under his breath hermione agreed the re em seemed placid enough eating grass in extremely large mouthfuls as hagrid talked it was hard to believe that anyone would want to drink its blood but then harry had caught someone doing that before many years ago dark wizards wouldntshrink from causing an animal pain they might even like doing it each of the students had to give the re em a handful of oats before heading back to the castle so hermione and ron made sure they were near the end not because i scared harry but so we can talk to hagrid hermione insisted right me too ron agreed harry smiled the re em was scarily large and more than one student had to be coerced near to it harry liked the touch of the soft horse like muzzle against his hand and found himself glancing up into soft brown eyes i hope you stay safe he whispered to it ron looked frozen until his turn feeding it was over hermione hung back nervously but she managed to get near enough for the re em to reach her hand with its tongue after the last students were done hermione led harry and ron over to the hut hagrid was there scooping large steaming piles of dung into a large sack as the re em stood tethered close by munching contentedly on more grain didn she do grea hagrid grinned at them apparently not noticing that they were standing as far back from the dung as possible never woulda imagined it a re em here on school grounds er hagrid does anyone else know that you have that re em i mean anyone not at hogwarts hermione asked in a timid voice oh no hagrid said as he straightened up and pushed at his lower back with one hand found out she d been captured and used fer blood harvestin the poor thing and i ad ter get er some place safe the trio exchanged looks but said nothing more about the animal good lesson hagrid harry said as they shoved off hagrid gave them a cheery wave and he went back to shoveling dung you know i think i actually liked that one ron admitted on their way back to the castle hagrid needs to be more careful hermione put in obstinately there a reason re ems have a four x danger classification the only real danger is that they might step on you ron said simply pretty easy to avoid really yes but having an animal here that attracts dark wizards he just lucky the aurors didntcatch him with it she said in a worried voice they were just here yesterday you know harry frowned it not an illegal animal is it no but i pretty sure that he did something illegal to get it and you know the aurors would ask all sorts of questions if they saw it harry knew she was right but didntthink hagrid was in any real danger the re em maybe there were a lot of slytherins who would like to get their hands on that blood from that his mind skittered quickly to the meeting with draco who had been glaringly absent from care of magical creatures and the professors at six harry had a lot of homework to do and on a sunny day like today seeing the quidditch pitch in the distance was pure agony his missed two weeks of classes was going to be painful to catch up on harry forced himself to sit at the common room study table and focus on one subject after the other until it was time to stop for an early dinner then with a groan harry laid his head on the table as unhappy with hermione vocal approval of his diligent studies as he was with ron diatribe for studying too much harry ate dinner quietly his mind straying to the meeting he had no idea what they expected him to do at the hearing but just show up to be evidence that malfoy draco had indeed hexed him in the great hall he d get a slap on the wrist for retaliating but the main attention was to be on draco punishment harry smiled just to think of draco without his wand all day long that must have been why he missed class whenever harry had seen him the prat had been slinking around his eyes downcast crabbe loyally by his side without even the basic defense of his wand draco had probably been afraid to anger another student the thought of that made harry smile even bigger and then he saw cho headed his way harry muttered a curse and ducked his head ginny looked over and cursed as well harry stared at her there got to be a way out of this she said as if reading his mind but i already promised harry muttered out of what hermione asked as she and ron quit their quiet conversation to listen ginny filled them in making harry sound like a child waylaid on his way home from his grandmother s she knew he was injured and on painkillers and she asked him anyway that is rather shady of her hermione agreed so you dontwant to make the speech harry dean asked casually sounding somehow surprised they all turned to stare at him you great git ginny said in a stunned voice you know harry hates speaking in public well yeah course i do dean expression darkened it basic potter knowledge but i thought that i mean there was that speech he did at the beginning of the year forced into it harry summed up grimly oh right dean blinked but then all the all the girls remember the girls afterwards hated it harry ground out between clenched teeth really dean sounded skeptical yes harry practically shouted seamus punched dean in the arm hard will you just shut it mate you sound like an utter windae licker sorry to interrupt harry harry turned around to see cho looking uncomfortable i sorry i wouldnthave asked if i didntthink it absolutely necessary you saw the reaction this morning to draco attack the students are so nervous and they need to know that they can stand down that you re okay and that ginny wasntto blame for the love potion fiasco harry buried his head in his hands he d forgotten that people had blamed ginny for that ginny put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed rather hard standing as she did so he doesnthave to make a speech just to get people off my back she said with venom and thanks so much for making him feel that way i didntmake i can take care of myself ginny went on i dontneed him or anyone else fighting my battles for me dont guilt him into this harry popped up out of his chair placing himself in the frigid air between cho and ginny he raised one hand to speak but hermione beat him to it i ve got it i know what you can do everyone froze and turned to her hermione smiled what if we have you do another interview interview cho harry and ginny asked at the same time yes hermione continued like we did for the quibbler we can print the whole story of what happened with pansy or well at least as much as you need to tell for people to understand she inserted that as harry face turned pale it doesnthave to be everything of course we can even have a q and a session at the bottom to make sure that everything gets covered what do you think harry paused it a good idea harry cho said not just to make it easier on you but to give something to the kids that they can hold and read at again and again the houses need to be united and understanding what you re up against really may help them get on your side that as close to united as we re going to get i afraid ginny took his hand her face hard you still donthave to do this not for me do it if you want to help everyone else understand that all harry scanned the room his gaze resting on each of the other three houses for a time the students were eating dinner but a fair number of them were looking back at him wanting as always to know what he was doing and who he was talking to he would never understand that there was no doubt that hearing exactly what had happened with pansy would exonerate ginny in their eyes but he also had a faint hope one that he felt growing as he looked over the slytherin table full of familiar faces that maybe hearing the whole story would discourage the them from carrying out their plans for whatever reason of course it might be too late zimmy twitchties message about goyle probable death made it seem like the seven deadly slytherins were stuck in a kill or be killed pact maybe there was no way out for them but he had to at least try yeah yeah i ll do it harry agreed cho shook his hand and thanked hermione they made quick plans for a meeting tomorrow night to get the interview seeming sure that luna would be able to work out an in school edition of the quibbler if she had help from the weasleys and hermione harry smiled at cho before she walked away it did seem like she was concerned for the school instead of trying to make his life more difficult but that melancholy tone she d adopted since last year was still there under the surface maybe she still thought about cedric maybe she thought that harry didn t he did he remembered everyone who had died as voldemort gained power those memories were air and bread and water to him still and when he needed it they were fuel and fire harry and ron had left themselves just enough time to make it to the meeting they talked quidditch all the way there the conversation serving to make harry so anxious to get out to the pitch that he could hardly stand to go to dumbledore office instead of heading outside but he forced the feeling aside and stood before the gargoyle prepared to give the appropriate password the gargoyle stepped smartly aside leaving harry with his mouth hanging open now that what i call service ron said standing straight from where he had been leaning against the wall they got that programmed to your magical signature or something an oily laugh from inside answered them of course weasley severus snape sneering faced appeared from within after all the boy who lived must have twenty four hour access to the headmaster now mustnt he snape stopped to peer down at harry with his black beady eyes sallow skin paler than normal harry ground his teeth before answering we were asked to come here oh i beg to differ snape interrupted you were asked to come and an extraneous weasley barged in with some romantic idea of protecting you from all the dark wizards in your path not all of them harry said quietly snape raised one eyebrow before stepping aside making way for another pale figure draco the tall boy looked somewhat discomfited his gaze flitting around the hallway nervously before settling on harry i need to talk to you potter his eyes were unusually direct and emotionless got your wand back draco ron grinned at him fingering his own wand in front of him it wasntpointed at the slytherin yet yes draco snapped pulling his long wand out as proof but keeping it in a neutral position did we miss the hearing harry asked confusedly looking from one to the other and arching his right wrist in case snape made a move for his wand his left arm was still in the damn sling but that would make them think he was easy prey professor dumbledore was called away snape sniped out by the wizengamot it appears there is some question of how to handle gregory goyle actions i ll bet ron muttered watching draco suspiciously snape scowled at him that mr weasley is none of you affair professor dumbledore handed down a quick decision in draco behalf setting him a month of detention with minerva and myself the schedule of which we will work out you and here he smiled malevolently at harry are to serve the first week with draco in my classroom if you would care to walk this way harry stood his ground i think i ll wait until professor mcgonagall gives me that information as you wish snape retorted draco come draco turned his head to look at snape and something passed between them though harry couldntsee any sign of it on draco face very well perhaps we ll begin the detention tomorrow evening snape said in a silky voice his gaze lingering on harry after you ve spoken with minerva then he whipped about and stalked away into the shadows lining the hallway ron was standing with his mouth wide open did he just did he just change his detention schedule for you harry draco huffed out a loud breath no you fool of course not professor snape changed it so that i could talk with potter tonight ron blinked then stared at harry that doesntmake any sense either does it harry harry agreed turning back to draco what going on between the two of you why was he willing to cover you arse this morning when you attacked me have you got something over him blackmail is that it draco stood there a moment smirking then the smirk disappeared behind a smile and he laughed ron fell back a step mouth agape he jerked his wand up in front of him who are you come on come on we know you re not draco harry move out of the way there no need harry shot back draco may have lost his mind but it really him yeah well forgive me if i donttrust your instincts on this one ron groused edging up beside harry you haventgot the best track record for knowing a polyjuiced person when you see one it him ron and you re only amusing him indeed draco smile had grown bigger but it faded as harry spoke to him you wanted to talk dontflatter yourself potter it more of a need than a want fine room of requirement i believe you know where that is harry led the way and draco and ron fell in beside him ron wand trained on draco every second draco ignored him you re not still holding a grudge about that potter about umbridge you know i had to report you he said calmly couldntlet you get away with everything oh stop trying to justify yourself ferret ron snapped i was not talking to you weasel why dontyou go back and get one of your surely more competent brothers to babysit the boy who lived you wouldntwant it to get back to them that you let potter have a secret meeting with me would you ron turned white beneath his freckles and harry jumped to hold him back brilliant draco if you want to talk to me stop antagonizing my friends he huffed while straining against ron otherwise i going back to the common room fine draco spat out i ll leave you to control your pet ron roared something intelligible and harry had all he could to stop him from going after draco and pounding him into the stone floor draco however had wandered off down the hallway unconcerned you know where i ll be ron get hold of yourself harry grunted as ron shoved him back several steps his body as rigid and tough as seasoned steel this isnthelping just as harry was about to give up ron suddenly wilted looking confused wait where did he go room of requirement harry panted glad to catch his breath he cantgo there ron stared down at harry that where grawp is grawp harry said bewilderedly he vaguely remembered something about hagrid wanting them to help hide grawp but he d forgotten about it entirely a slow grin spread over ron face yeah hermione transfigured him into a teapot and we moved it in there before transfiguring him back a teapot well it was a big teapot took me and bill ages to get it up there hiding whenever someone came near the marauder map is dead useful some times you know yeah so then draco wontbe able to get in right we locked it up tight no problem ahhhhhhhhhhh a shrill scream from up ahead shattered the calm harry and ron exchanged a quick look and then they were off ron grinning the whole way this is the stupidest idea you ve ever had potter draco said as he closed the prefects bathroom door behind him ten minutes later and that really saying something his hair was still slightly mussed from his narrow escape from grawp but at least no one saw us who knows what they would have thought ron barked out a laugh that your look out ferret boy ron said with a wicked grin i a weasley and he the boy who lived we re not the ones they ll wonder about draco glared then let do this quickly weasley go away ron began to protest hotly but harry stopped him just go over there by the bath you can watch us but you donthave to listen what if i need to listen you don t ron looked back and forth between harry and draco shaking his head then he focused one last dead earnest glare at draco i ll have my wand on you the whole time fabulous now leave draco said without expression ron gave harry a last questioning look when he nodded ron backed away keeping draco in his sights he settled over at the far end of the pool sized bath turn them on draco ordered him ron hesitated turn them on draco shouted face flushed in anger ron grimly reached down to turn on a few faucets as the different colored foams poured into the bath harry turned back to draco wand out draco froze why do you have your wand trained on me harry leveled his gaze at him i donttrust you either toss your wand over there by the towels where we can all see it harry indicated where with a point of his wand draco huffed out a breath stalked over to the towels and threw his wand down with a clatter there satisfied harry smiled completely comfortable with a temper tantrum throwing draco of course now you draco indicated harry wand with a look harry slipped his wand back into the holster and his right arm out of the sling he needed to be ready no matter what there was a short silence while harry used his sensing skills to reach out around him probing the air for any magical signatures as far as he could tell there were no magical objects around except draco wand and the mermaid portrait on the wall it seemed safe enough to talk when harry tuned back in draco was looking away his countenance dark his face was tense as if his thoughts were sharp and painful eventually he spoke things are not going well harry raised his eyebrows you mean you ve noticed that too draco simply nodded ignoring harry sarcasm harry decided to try again things looked like they were going pretty well for you at least until you decided to hex me in front of the entire school necessary i assure you and yes things are better with the slytherins but it took me far longer than i expected thanks to daddy dearest draco said with a bitter smile the stakes have been raised substantially i only hope it not too late for you harry shook his head would you stop being so melodramatic and explain what in the bloody hell you re talking about draco paused tilting his head to the side you think i melodramatic yes excessively draco nostrils flared i assure you my life is cause enough for pain and bitterness you have seen only a fraction of the whole story oh yes harry said in a stilted voice i can see now that you are not melodramatic draco thank you for pointing that out to and then there was a split second when harry knew draco fist was coming towards his face he paused decided not to draw his wand and jerked to the side draco swing missed and he ended up on the floor in a tangle of knees and elbows hissing in pain as he impacted on the marble floor harry looked over to see ron standing with his wand raised i fine he waved ron away ron scowled draco cursed then looked up in surprise when harry offered his hand he didnttake it you know what my father capable of you ve been there harry stopped breathing his chest suddenly too tight to get air in you think life with him was all fun and games you think that cane of his is just decorative harry turned away forcing air in his lungs he shouldntlet draco get to him he had to be stronger than this so you want me to feel sorry for you is that was this little meeting is all about harry turned back watching draco stand painfully to his feet well good news i ve always felt sorry for you draco stood straight his face as pale as harry had ever seen it a sneer slowly transformed his features when he spoke it was in a strangled voice let start at the beginning shall we and then maybe if i speak slowly and in small words you ll understand why you need my help help harry shook his head disgusted i dontneed your draco broke in ignoring him well this summer was an eventful one in hell manor while my father was out proving himself to be the greatest wanker of all time cutting me off without a trace poisoning my contacts turning mum against me the other death eater mums and dads were coordinating a plan a big plan seven attempts to kill the boy who lived during the school year using their own flesh and blood as the assassins draco was pacing now gesturing elegantly his voice a bitter mix of sarcasm and venom although this wasnt completely new information to harry still his blood was chilled they were dedicated in a barbaric ceremony of which i will spare you the details and returned to hogwarts with the sheen of evil glittering on them and of course daddy warnings echoing in their ears not to trust me they believed him harry took a deep breath trying to loosen his constricted chest so you re saying you hexed me today in order to persuade them that i no fanboy of yours yes and it appears to be working i was convinced draco smirked of course i still convinced well perhaps i didnthave to pretend so very much draco admitted harry nodded his mind ticking through the information at high speed but this plan tom cantseriously have thought sixth years would succeed not here at hogwarts draco crossed his arms why is it you bristle so much when severus calls you arrogant the most powerful evil warlock in hundreds of years wants you dead and you re talking about his schemes as if they were a fantasy i assure you nothing carries more weight in slytherin than currying the dark lord favor he said with bright eyes and nothing guarantees that favor more quickly that contributing to your pain distress or death you must take this more seriously harry clenched his hands and felt the tight band of his universal antidote against his left bicep well forgive me if i dontquiver with fear every time tom name is mentioned harry spat in case you hadnt noticed i trying to live my life in between death attempts it not easy but it better than curling up in a corner somewhere harry had had enough is this all you have to say i ve got it rough feel sorry for me watch your own arse i have better things to do you know harry was already moving toward the door when draco next words arrested him goyle is dead you know draco said conversationally his parents are trying to cover it up someone will probably polyjuice him at the wizengamot trial whatever it takes to keep the school from finding out but the rest of the seven deadly slytherins know already they wanted you dead before now they need you dead or they will die harry face screwed up in something like pain he hated the position those kids were in but he hated them too for dealing with tom and for so casually committing to kill him draco paused a moment as if he was waiting for harry to speak then went on i dontknow that the dark lord really intend them to succeed he might only have wished to make your year here as difficult as possible and to make an example out of those students who failed or maybe to punish their parents for some wrong they ve committed against him draco said all of this casually walking over to the stone wall and running a finger over the carved scrollwork i not certain which it is but now that two of them have been punished for their failure the rest are far more motivated to succeed draco turned back around locking eyes with harry they will be coming at you with everything they have now for survival if nothing else harry swallowed five more then yes crabbe yes zabini yes and bulstrode nott and hughes draco reeled them off like a quidditch team line up crabbe was not a surprise to harry at all nor nott really but milicent and that fifth year rawley hughes he barely even knew the boy that why i here draco said softly staring out at the pool now you ll never make it without my help harry took a deep breath i ve made it this far yes and if the prophecy is right harry jerked his head over to stare at draco then they wontsucceed however you dontreally want to find out how much pain you can endure without dying do you and the prophecy says nothing about someone else dying in your place a bodyguard or a friend who jumps in the way at the wrong time a chill ran down harry spine you need to know as much as you can about what they re planning and i the only one close enough on the inside to get the information to you harry frowned tossing out the idea of zimmy twitchtie offer to spy as soon as it came to mind there werentany other options left and no matter what harry pretended the episodes with pansy and goyle had been horrifying enough in and of themselves he had no desire to repeat them or any part of them especially since he might be risking his friends as well as himself but could he trust draco not to be setting him up he couldn t there was too much on the line harry jerked his wrist wand in hand as he raised it draco eyes widened what are you legilimens sobbing girls were running to draco as he walked in the slytherin common room he dead draco dead crabbe was in a heap in front of the fireplace motionless tears rolling down his face they killed gregory what are we going to do draco stood frozen a girl pressed against his chest on either side stunned crucio the memory of lucius wand out pain spiraling through draco senses made harry nauseous no son of mine is a traitor dark shapes crowded closer hands reached out and grabbed him punching kicking all around this scene was so familiar that it could have been harry own memory the pain the torture mum now harry was seeing the opulent interior of malfoy manor the dark oak lined dining room narcissa was sitting at the table pale as a ghost a broken teacup on the table in front of her what is it draco looked young and scared where is father narcissa answered faintly he been summoned again draco was trying valiantly not to cry a desperate smile sprang up on his face that good right of course draco his mother said tonelessly run along and play now draco turned away misery and fear etched on his face then harry was seeing a younger draco skinny and awkward sobbing falling on his knees in front of his father his bare back was bloodied with sharp thin cuts i sorry i sorry i so sorry muggles are horrible daddy his voice went high and thin with hysteria i know they are i wontspeak to them again daddy i swear it lucius face was impassive and calm a bloodied riding crop was in his hand harry jerked his wand down ending the spell before he could see anything else the white marble of the prefects bathroom came into focus around him slowly he sought out draco and found him looking as shaken and horrified as harry felt but there was also a grim resolve about it as if it was exactly what he d expected harry to do harry wanted to apologize to explain that he had wanted to see proof that draco was trustworthy not invade his most humiliating memories but his mouth was dry as dust no words would come out draco took a few deep breaths and walked shakily over to his wand tucking it away in his robes then he turned to harry if i wanted you dead you d be dead by now prophecy or no but i on your side and i am putting my life at risk to help you i have no life left if the dark lord wins he took a deep breath i believe crabbe will be next i ll let you know as much as i can as soon as he confides in me what do i do til then harry said quietly as draco headed toward the door be a saint he called back over his shoulder they ve each chosen to align themselves with a deadly sin lust anger greed envy pride etc he turned back to harry shouldntbe too hard for you to avoid saint potter he smirked then walked out slamming the door behind him bloody hell what did you see harry ron asked walking over slowly i guess you heard the whole thing yeah ron said sheepishly i had the extendable ears cause i thought they d come in handy during that meeting with you inside and me jonesing out in the corridor you dont you donttrust him do you harry sighed the problem is i do and i dontthink i have a choice anyway author note merry christmas and happy holidays to all thanks so much for sticking with this story and for giving me time you are who i writing for and so much thanks to melindaleo and musings for all their help you guys always give me time love love hugs hugs chapter twenty a triad of trouble professor mcgonagall was not able to get harry out of the four days of detention with draco that were set by snape which made harry first full week back in school less than ideal however it wasntnearly as bad as it could have been professor snape of course was not the reason that detention was more palatable than expected he was his usual caustic self and set harry the grossest and most time consuming tasks possible but harry had developed a rather thick skin when it came to disgusting potion ingredient preparation and not even the rotting fish eyes could give snape the pleasure of seeing him gag what actually made the detentions more pleasant was draco behavior it wasntthat the slytherin went out of his way to be kind or to help with those horrible chores that would have been more disconcerting than pleasant anyway but draco didntneedle harry or rub it in when snape gave the slytherin some posh job like polishing cauldrons instead of separating usable dragon dung from dragon dung compromised by other animal dung in fact draco said nothing to harry which was confusing if draco trusted snape then he should be giving harry information about the seven deadly slytherins now right if draco didnttrust snape which would be the shock of the century then why wasnthe bothering to rib harry relentlessly that had always gone over well with snape in the past that enough potter clean up and go back to your dormitory professor snape snapped from the doorway some of us have better things to do with our time than fawning over you harry didntbother to comment his mood was black tonight because he d missed another quidditch practice bringing the total to two for this week he didntexpect katie to have much more patience with him she d been an absolute angel compared to angelina which was why harry wasntrisking another word to snape he was not going to miss saturday practice no matter what he cleaned himself up passed by draco without comment and headed out the door this was the final detention and he was thankful to be getting out at ten o clock oi mate ron said as he clambered to his feet his face bright with hope are you done already yeah harry nodded a sudden yawn breaking out git couldntfind any more rancid frog spawn for me to strain how was practice better than most i actually had a difficult time keeping the quaffle out of the goal today i mean sure it could have been because i stink but i think it was mostly because the chasers are finally coming together ron said hopefully as they started up the stairs so who was here while you were at practice fred george came out and gave the beaters some tips i dontthink they liked that much harry was about to ask about ginny performance when light footsteps came from the ascending stairs in front of them ron jerked out his wand harry tensed his right hand then petite feet appeared and ginny came down into view breaking into a smile as soon as she saw harry you re out early she said brightly i was just coming to relieve ron relieve me what in the bloody hell are you up to ron said incredulously looking her up and down well i certainly dontmean taking a piss for you ginny snapped i taking your place now go take a shower you reek no i dontwant to leave you alone with harry ron protested with wide eyes what if something happened do you have any idea what mum would do to me that your look out fred already said i could now shut it and hold out your wrist she commanded no ron shook his head vigorously i not doin it ginny drew her wand and pointed it at him do you think i cantwork this properly she bit out the words at him did i miss the duel where you proved that you re faster more powerful and better suited to guarding harry than i am because last time i checked look ron harry jumped in quickly before things got nasty you re assuming that i ll need protection when i really don t i mean it nice that you and your shut it harry ginny and ron chorused in similarly aggravated tones glaring at him and yes okay gin ron jumped in you might be able to take care of yourself in most circumstances but this is different no it not ginny yelled putting both hands on her hips anger flaming her cheeks i care just as much because you wont be paying attention ron finished stubbornly you ll be hiding out somewhere snogging or oh god dontmake me go there you know what you ll be doing harry tried not to look at ginny as a rush of heat to his face confessed the very thing he hoped for but would protest with every fiber of his being to ron face should it be needed ginny was fresh from the shower her hair still damp and the smell the soap wafting invitingly toward harry she was too busy to notice harry silence yes and i also know what you and hermione will be doing whenever you two get alone which might be very difficult to do if your sister is as pissed off as she is right now ginny said quite convincingly you need to go shower up ron harry and i need some time alone why dontwe kill two birds with one stone i ll walk harry back he ll be safe i promise ron looked back and forth between them harry did his utmost to look angelic and completely disconnected from the heightening senses in his body ginny wanted to snog him she was planning on it harry swallowed his mouth suddenly parched so fred sent you he thought this was a good idea yes ginny said calmly he seemed to think it would be good for harry oh yeah harry agreed silently very very good ron huffed out a long breath and turned to harry and you re okay with this i mean with me leaving i could just stay around the corner or something so you could shout no she right ginny can handle whatever anyone throws at her harry eyes met hers and felt an electric thrill pulse through his blood if ron wouldntleave harry might have to do something desperate fine but i dont like it and if bill or god help me mum lays into me for this i sending em your way not that it will help ron threatened pointing at ginny i going to go get that stone of harry and keep an eye on it bloody hell he sighed i ve probably just bartered my life away it will be worth it when you get to spend time with hermione now go shower and find her you re foul ginny waved ron away imperiously yes sir see you in the dorm later harry not too late okay yeah sure harry said lightly his eyes still on ginny ron scowled and held up a fist harry blinked in surprise ginny stepped forward and wrapped her small fingers around ron wrist fraterdum singletus she whispered there was a slight silvery glow down ron arm and onto ginny hand ron and ginny locked eyes a long moment which reminded harry how much this mysterious spell bothered him finally ron nodded and ginny released his wrist ron flicked his eyes to harry and then turned to go see you back in the dorm ron we ll be fine harry called after him ron waved without looking back harry held out a hand and ginny laid her hand in it smiling up at him harry pulled her closer so what does that mean anyway that spell ginny smiled up at him family secret harry it just means that you re safe with us harry wanted to contemplate the meaning of what she said but the heat of her body was clouding his mind they werentsafe here he knew that this was no place to let down his guard so harry grabbed her hand again and led the way up the stairs up on the third floor having dodged peeves successfully and rather breathlessly harry and ginny spilled into a classroom snickers and giggles coming fast peeves had been imitating the gray lady floating in an hourglass shape and with an imperious but nobly sad look on his face harry turned to watch ginny giggle holding one hand over her mouth to stifle the noise he loved how easily he laughed with her and how she made him feel like life was full and god was she beautiful the moonlight was bathing her face in a soft blue glow the shadows making her eyes dark and mysterious and her hair almost black he looked down trying to calm the beating of his heart which for some reason was pounding like he had run into that manticore again then ginny slid closer to his side leaning back against the wall as he was the stone was cool through his robes and shirt and where she nestled against him felt warm harry hesitated before putting his arm around her hadnt she told ron that she wanted to snog him or at least not denied it it wasnttheir first kiss it wasntlike she turned and moved in suddenly her face just below his her body pressed against his harry could barely breathe he closed his eyes bent his head and eased his lips slowly softly into hers she gave a sweet sigh the moment before oblivion took harry mind away then the rhythm of their movements and the heat generated by their bodies took him to another place somewhere there was no prophecy no voldemort no need to do anything but feel the need for more finally drove into him like a spear in his side and he gasped pulling away from her it was that nausea again that awful feeling harry ginny was still touching him but it felt like she was far away the rapture had melted like a daydream he turned and stepped away from ginny his gut clenching in frustration with a guttural cry he drove his fist into the stone wall feeling the pain bitterly harry then ginny had grabbed him thrown her arms around him and pressed herself back into his chest it all right it just me whatever it is just breathe deep until you re past it damn your secrets he tried to breathe deep but his chest caught on every inhalation his body was fighting him it had something to do with him with lucius the name hit him like a blow and he bent forward his face buried in ginny hair now the fragrance of it trapped sunshine and strawberries filled him as he pulled in a deeper breath this was now she was now whatever had happened then was past it wouldnthappen again and he wouldntlet it rule his life dammit he clutched at her and with a desperate look and a murmur of her name warned her just before he slanted his mouth over hers he could taste rapture could feel it and it pushed out all memory then she slipped her tongue into his mouth and harry jumped his body didntknow what to do hot flashes radiated through him a shiver followed from head to toe urgent need suddenly colored their kisses and harry began to feel out of control riding a hot new flood of desire just as he started to realize that as much as he needed to stop he didnt think he could ginny pulled away harry took a desperately needed breath and shook his head to clear it he wasnt even sure what day it was or how long they d been here glancing up at ginny he was alarmed to see her trembling he reached out for her arm just as her knees gave way he held her arm then both her arms finally sitting down with her awkwardly as she kept going down she was in his lap trembling her shoulders hunched her gaze fixed on the floor ginny she looked up and harry was shocked to see enormous tears in her eyes ginny what is it did i what did i i sorry did i it okay she whispered it okay i ve just never been kissed like that before there was a tremulous smile on her face even as the tears grew larger she swiped at her eyes laughing shakily harry wanted to ask her what she meant but words refused to come she looked back over at him and reached out to grab his hand it not a bad thing harry for a bloke to kiss a girl so well she nearly faints he blinked it not no not at all it just it made my knees feel that weak but she looked so shaken and so un ginnylike that harry was still concerned are you sure that all it was i didnt are you sure very sure this time she leaned forward and looked harry directly in the eyes assurance emanating from her gaze it was the best kiss i ve ever had i think that was the problem harry smiled feeling heat prickle up the sides of his face then his hand began nagging at him ouch he murmured looking down at it in surprise ginny giggled now you ve done it harry looked up ruefully what will madame pomfrey say when she finds out you ve been punching walls i just hope she hasntgotten rid of that sling yet harry groaned when harry returned back to the dorm ron wasntthere neville and seamus were giving him such knowing glances that harry knew they d badgered ron into telling who had been guarding him at least dean wasntthere harry pulled off his robes and threw open his trunk dean had taken to giving him dark looks lately whenever girls were mentioned but especially when ginny name came up harry shook his head and pulled his pajama top on as if his life wasntcomplicated enough he wished dean would just take a swing at him and get it over with it wasntuntil he was in bed that he remembered dobby where had that house elf ghost got to he hadntreported in the last three nights not that his reports were all that helpful draco had finally gotten the other slytherins to open up apparently and was according to the elf constantly plotting harry death but since harry knew that draco was claiming to spy on the slytherins rather than joining in he didnttake these reports in at face value it was disturbing to hear nonetheless and harry was always a little glad if dobby didnt turn up every night but three nights harry waited until after ron and dean showed up for bed the former smiling rather absent mindedly the latter ignoring harry once his dormmates were all in bed and their rhythmic breathing and or snoring began harry whispered dobby it took two full minutes for the house elf to show up something that was also a bit unusual yes harry potter sir squeaked dobby as soon as he showed up as gray and insubstantial as always do you have any more news on draco doings oh no harry potter sir he shook his head unhappily dobby is a bad house elf sir if dobby could crack his head on the mantle dobby would sir yes i convinced you would but not sorry at all that you can t harry said with a slight smile where have you been dobby is keeping winky company and guarding her from the bad house elves harry was taken aback and felt a momentary pang of guilt he had meant to visit the elves in the kitchen but had only managed it once what bad house elves they is not happy that winky is pushing for freedom from the hogwarts master they is wanting her to be a good house elf and work for free and stop being so loyal to dobby but they were all for it last time i was down there said harry consternated i dontremember anyone being against winky oh yes sir harry potter sir they all says they is for winky but then bad things happen when poor winky is alone at first winky is thinking it was accidents but now she is thinking they is not what sort of bad things dobby tugged at his ears oh dobby is keeping her company and warning her of all the things falling cauldrons hot irons steak knives but there is so many and dobby cannot watch all the time you cantsee who doing it but you re a ghost dobby cantsee dobby wailed from behind his transparently gray knobbly hands dobby doesntknow does dumbledore know about this winky is not wanting dobby to bother the headmaster dobby said looking up with a sniff but dobby is warning the headmaster anyway good and i sure winky will be fine she can do pretty powerful house elf magic cant she dobby seemed convinced that the headmaster would take care of it and left after promising to check in on draco at odd times especially whenever the boy schedule was free harry was dying to know what he and snape said to each other whenever they were alone once the house elf was gone harry settled back in bed his mind once again turned to the puzzle of draco and shifted the ill fitting pieces around until he gave up and fell into a quiet rest the next morning at breakfast three unusual things happened first hermione appeared at the table with a secret alight in her shining eyes fairly bursting to talk what is it harry asked right away i just got a note from professor dumbledore and he wants me to meet him in his office tonight she turned to ron and you know what that means dont you uh ron said gaze darting about the room as if searching desperately for a clue in their surroundings you re going to be head girl next year nice try hermione smirked and then turned to harry it means he ready to look at my research research hermione leaned in closer remember i the official researcher for the order of the phoenix oh harry said blankly wondering how he could have forgotten that detail i reckoned that was hermione speared him with a look an empty title shows how much you know i ve been doing research every chance i could which admittedly hasntbeen much lately but while you were in the infirmary in that coma i got a fair amount done oh yeah she did a lot of work then ron nodded anxious to get himself in the clear outdid herself well no one knew when you were going to wake up harry or if you were going to i had to have something to focus on or i d have ended up barking mad almost did ron supplied over helpfully ginny giggled hermione paused to look at their tablemates all of whom seemed busily talking about other things she lowered her voice anyway i was looking up that priori incantatem spell that you mentioned this summer there wasntmuch in the library even in the restricted section here hermione interrupted herself to answer harry shocked look which we are able to access now that we re sixth years but what i did find looks promising i gave dumbledore a report a few weeks back and i didntknow if he had looked at them or not but she added with a hopeful smile i think he had a chance now and we ll find out if that how you can kill voldemort harry harry nodded immediately sobered as he was anytime the inevitable was mentioned hermione and ron exchanged a glance and fell silent as well being prophesied to end the reign of a dark and terrible wizard was a definite conversation killer you know i think you and i need to have a talk ginny said shrewdly from beside him harry couldntlook away from those piercing eyes soon enough he hadnttold her about the prophecy yet he didntwant to he was putting it off as long as possible for many different reasons as harry avoided ginny eyes he noticed katie bell and cho chang talking to professor mcgonagall who was nodding resignedly then his gaze was drawn over to the slytherin table two seventh years were sitting in draco usual spot looking intent upon their conversation glancing over the hufflepuff and ravenclaw tables he saw several more students clumping up to talk all seventh years what going on with the seventh years harry asked nodding toward the gryffindors oh the n e w t s transfiguration practicum is next week hermione said with dismissal you d think it was the end of the world the way they re acting ron rolled his eyes tell harry why you re being so pissy about it ron i not pissy about it hermione thwacked him in the arm ouch it just that they wonttell me anything like it some great secret or something well maybe it is ginny spoke up reasonably hermione huffed out an exasperated breath here comes katie now why dontyou ask her hermione shot ginny a curious look but ginny just smiled angelically harry wanted to investigate that smile but katie had just stepped up to their table looking a bit harried harry ron she began before anyone could speak i have to cancel all quidditch practices next week except for saturday s terribly sorry and all that cantbe helped but we ve just gotten harry back ron began loudly we ll be fine ron ginny cut in fine ron yelped our chasers are weeks behind in their speed drills the beaters are dropping quaffles all over the place harry stared at ron i thought you said they had good practices this week well yeah ron said quickly but that doesntmean we can just slough off a week and expect to win any matches at all i know that but as it cantbe helped katie began again yes it can ron stood up creating a flurry of movement as ginny hermione and harry all reached to pull him back down dontcall off the practices simple as that i have to katie raised her voice to the level of ron s surprising everyone and calling attention from every table this is my n e w t year and what i do for the rest of my life depends on the outcome i have to do this no what you have to do is sacrifice for the team ron pounded his hand on the table drawing even more stares what kind of captain are you you let everyone goof off you let harry miss practices all the time hey ron shut it you re too nice you dont yell at anyone fine now i yelling katie roared and pushed harry out of the way so she could stand on the bench can everybody hear me there were stunned nods from around the table good because i quit fuming through her tears katie stepped down and stomped away ignoring as best she could the applause and cheers of the slytherins several of her friends hurried after her katie what the bloody hell was that ron stared after her horrified ron half the table chorused at once what he looked around wide eyed harry pulled him back into his seat you have some major apologizing to do mate not just apologizin seamus added severely some very thorough butt kissing is required i reckon that was not very nice ron neville said firmly ron slumped in his seat i didntmean to make her quit i just thought i mean has she gone mad or has mcgonagall letting her call em off like that a few debates broke out on the subject around the table but ginny broke in over all the noise katie been ready to blow for weeks and mcgonagall was probably trying to help her keep her mind on her studies i imagine she was expecting us to practice just the same without katie but now that we ve lost our captain ginny said with a scathing look at ron it looks as if we ll be doing that the rest of the year i ll apologize ron said morosely she ll come back right if you grovel enough ginny admitted but not until after she finishes her transfiguration project ron and harry exchanged a glance what transfiguration project they asked together hermione loudly joining in oh no look at the time ginny said i d better get to class and with a smug smile she gathered her things as she bent over to kiss harry cheek she whispered in his ear since we cantgo to hogsmeade they re bringing hogsmeade to us at his puzzled look she just smiled how does she know about this and i don t hermione demanded from ron who told her they stared at each other for a moment then both broke out fred and george harry just shrugged keeping ginny secret for her but what could she have meant about bringing hogsmeade to hogwarts it did make sense that dumbledore might have decided not to allow the students to travel to hogsmeade this year with all the trouble they d had so far with dobby death pansy attempt on harry life and her death then goyle attempt and charlie abduction not to mention narcissa running about the castle trying to kill her son and harry and with five more slytherins plotting away harry looked back over at the slytherin table noting again that draco wasntthere blaise was missing as well and millicent that was when the third unusual thing happened a young witch came running up to the gryffindor table gasping for breath when harry got a full look at her face and short spiky hair he recognized her as violet hooch there was only a brief moment for him to recall her hanging about the quidditch pitch during practices and to wonder why he d never seen her in the dorm before she was clutching the shoulder of his robes and spitting out garbled words harry was frozen in stunned amazement until violet finally managed to get two names out blaise and tobias what where harry jumped to his feet barely remembering in time not to whip his wand out in the grand hall when violet shook her head eyes squeezed shut harry grasped her by the shoulders tell me he demanded voices all around were chiming in ron and neville had risen have to tell you blaise has tobias violet said slowly her eyes now open and bright with unshed tears where she took another deep breath three levels down she gasped just outside the slytherin dorm harry never heard the last three words as he was already racing for the door ron keeping pace beside him they dodged students and ignored mcgonagall loud call the furor dying as they reached the hallway and the grand hall doors slammed shut behind them to their surprise neville was only one step behind go back harry ordered no neville yelled back looking from one to the other i want to help fine if you can keep up harry said in between breaths as they raced on as they reached the stairwell leading to the dungeon neville was slowly being outdistanced by the other two go on ahead i ll catch up he called after them ron and harry yelled assent just as a clump of students exited the stairs the sudden appearance of the one breathless wand out face fixed in a rage caused instant panic there was a mad scramble to get out of his way and all the lurching dodging and jumping away from harry meant that several of the slowest ended up directly into ron path before he could stop he took out two students at full speed they hit the ground in a tangle of arms and legs and foul language what the matter with you you ve nearly killed padma where he harry bloody hell harry wait but harry shook his head and went on taking the stairs three at a time he couldnt stop imagining tobias in blaise clutches again he d meant to do something to keep the slytherin off tobias back but he d waited too long hey remember sirius ron called out over the clamor of voices his voice echoing to harry eerily in the stairwell the words cut harry like a knife but the warning was a good one nevertheless this could very easily be a trap harry didntslow down but quickly he went over his defensive strategies he d only been down here once before back in his second year but he knew from that what to expect running full tilt he managed to make it down to what surely must be the furthest dungeon level level in only five minutes then he slowed trying to quiet his breathing and listening hard there were muffled voices ahead but he couldntmake out the words harry crept silently behind a stone pillar and tapped his wand on the top of his head he took a few deep calming breaths then disillusioned he moved down the final staircase freezing at the bottom ahead past the blank stone wall that hid the slytherin common room stood zimmy twitchtie wide eyed and with wand drawn she was watching the staircase and whispering something harry couldnthear what should he do tobias trusted her but then why was she being look out for blaise with regret harry stepped closer and sent a silent petrificus totalus at her just as it hit he finally understood what she was saying please please oh please she fell over and harry managed to reach her before she thudded to the floor with a whispered apology he laid her over to one side she must have been the one who sent violet harry felt a twinge of guilt but then again she was probably safer out here anyway a cry of pain reached his ears and harry bolted up like a shot tobias he raced silently down the corridor to the right through the chill damp air with a shiver harry gripped his wand tightly and stepped up to the closed door the voices were coming from inside say it blaise was sneering or i ll curse you so badly there will be no future generations of the great family wafting no tobias screamed his voice stretched taut with pain and anger outside the door harry jerked in a visceral reaction torture instantly cold hard steel replaced the ache in his stomach and fire ran in his veins he gritted his teeth stepped back and aimed his wand reducto he projected against the gray screen that came up instantly in his mind the door imploded and chaos reigned shouts and screams came from within harry stepped through the hazy air his gaze zeroing in on blaise across the room whose face had a decidedly greenish tinge guard the door blaise barked out wand already trained on the empty air in front of him there were two other slytherins in harry periphery one on each side of the room the nearest was draco what where is he millicent screeched from somewhere behind harry whipped around and aimed at crabbe who was eyeing the door nervously uh there was naked fear on the larger boy face no you clod he already inside the room go stand right there blaise used his wand to point crabbe in the right direction i want you two to make sure he doesntleave until i want him to any day of the week millicent boasted i beg to differ said a lazy familiar drawl harry jerked back around toward draco who was leaning up against a wall arms crossed wand pointing down he leaves when he wants to didntyou learn anything from his little foray into hell manor i d start talking quickly if i were you whose side are you on draco bellowed eustrich bletchley from the far wall harry whipped his head around to look the sallow skinned hairy ape of a slytherin over he was too cowardly to shoot the first curse harry kept his wand midway between blaise and draco why yours dear of course draco smirked in response why else would i be here harry tobias whispered it a trap harry couldntkeep from glancing at him and then couldntlook away the poor boy was shirtless spread eagled to the wall so many red welts crisscrossing his chest that all the skin was swollen and parts of it bloodied tears made paths from his despondent vacant eyes harry found himself trembling with rage and started counting to five forcing his anger under control oh i think he knows it a trap by now blaise said stepping forward cautiously what he doesntknow is why five harry twisted knelt and screamed a curse at crabbe that laid him flat on his back he there aim low blaise screamed and four wands fired from all corners of the room quartering the room with brilliant red jets of light they all missed harry had felt them as soon as they left their wands blaise cruciatus eustrich confundus charm millicent petrificus totalus and draco cheering charm and in the seconds that followed harry had leapt up clearing two curses arched back to go over a third and flipped over putting one hand down to miss the fourth the result was that the slytherins had to scatter to avoid the curses as well in the end draco was actually closer to hitting blaise than harry sorry draco called out gaily thought i saw him over there blaise climbed to his feet murder in his eyes use the color charm and find him instantly harry knew it must be the charm narcissa had used to spray paint at him to foil his disillusionment charm he crouched and cast stupefy against the screen in his mind millicent flew back against the wall with a satisfying thud from the vacant look on her face just before the jet took her she obviously didntknow the color charm which was coming at him right now harry dove for the floor feeling rather than seeing the jet of red light miss him by inches paint splattered with a sploosh against the wall harry rolled to avoid a second volley from eustrich and stopped quick enough to lash back with another silent stupefy that hit home he silently scourgify ed his robes then cancelled the spell that held tobias up to the wall as the boy fell forward harry jumped to catch him there you are you encumbered by tobias limp form harry couldntmove fast enough to dodge but he raised a shield in time the curse flew back and blaise had to dodge again i think the word you re looking for is bastard draco supplied helpfully will you just curse him you blaise cut himself off again then tapped his wand to his head and disappeared harry cursed under his breath sorry but he ll nail me he whispered letting tobias slip gently to the floor the boy mumbled something and harry paused to listen a red hiss erupted in his mind a sensed cruciatus coming his way nearly on him and he threw himself sideways wham white light flooded his mind and harry reeled crumpling backwards onto the floor he d smashed into the wall the side of his face was numb his shoulder was on fire and blaise where was blaise bright lights were popping in front of harry eyes he was completely dazed he raised his wand anyway desperately trying to sense blaise signature there harry fired off a silent bludgeoning curse saw it hit a shield and knew he couldntmove fast enough to avoid the next curse he flattened himself sucked in his breath and waited wand ready he saw the flash of red in his mind and threw up a shield the curse still smacked his back against the wall it was that strong there you are you it was blaise but something had cut him off a curse from behind harry sensed and then he was thudding into the wall on harry right he hit the floor and lay still at least from the sound of it harry looked up to see ron standing in the doorway wand aimed at something off to the far right harry tipped his head to see draco wand aimed back at ron he never can seem to finish his sentences the blonde said with a smirk who ron ground out why zabini of course i was aiming at him you know not potter well how would i know since i cantsee either one of them ron still trained on draco leaned in the doorway and peered around harry you all right mate fine draco took out zabini i was going to do that you know ron groused as he stepped over crabbe bulk couldntsee a bloody thing o course wearily harry tapped his wand over his own head and became visible again he started to sit up and then decided against it the world tilting that far made his stomach heave yes of course draco acknowledged pushing himself off the wall there always some excuse for mediocrity isntthere we ll just have to convince blaise that somehow a weasley managed to get the drop on him he paused then again there are some things that strain the imagination too far ron who was ignoring draco now walked over to harry you dontlook fine why in the bloody hell didntyou wait for me they were torturing him harry said reaching out a hand to ron help me up ron shook his head but grasped harry hand and slowly pulled him up harry wavered a bit putting a hand out on the wall look at him i couldntwait ron looked over at tobias still form then walked over to the invisible blaise nudged him with a foot and then kicked him hard then he pointed his wand down at him give me one good reason why i shouldnt repay the favor pass draco said indifferently you re next ron snarled wand now aiming at draco torturing first years is the sickest oh please draco scoffed you call that torture you should have seen what they wanted to do to him i held them back ron harrumphed oh right you didntreally want to torture him in fact you wanted to give him a teddy bear and tuck him in bed but they wouldnt let you believe it or not i dontcare draco snapped back but you d better get him out of here before they wake up ron gave blaise one more kick for good measure harry smiled at him grimly you d better carry tobias one more thing draco drawled as he stepped up to them if you dontmind knock me out ron and harry exchanged a look draco ron said with a grin you just made my day a n to all my patient patient readers you see i actually haventgiven up on this fic i not quite sure why you ve stuck with me on this long long journey but this story will be finished eventually and the next chapter will be out in a much more timely fashion i promise we ve had illnesses and house problems keeping me away from the keyboard lately but that should be finished now having that said i am estimating ten more chapters in this fic and they should all be barn burners hold on to your hats thanks again for your patience chapter 21 unsettling outcomes hermione waited for almost an hour before a grim harry and a rather subdued ron made it back out of the dungeon things hadntgone to plan after they rescued tobias mostly because snape was the first teacher to find them instantly irate when he saw the state of his slytherins six out cold including zimmy only an exhausted and puffing mcgonagall had kept snape from tearing into ron and harry but intervention hadntlessened the burning of his dark eyes as he d glared at harry with something four years past hate which harry had viciously returned he didntexpect snape to act fair where the slytherins were concerned but supporting them when they had done something so heinous was going too far if dumbledore could only see snape at moments like this then lupin had arrived startling harry and ron he had been in the castle on duty for the order and adding the last remaining students to the marauder map security charm unfortunately he had been working on the seventh years names and hadntnoticed tobias name down in the dungeon with the slytherin sixth years it wasntuntil harry name suddenly showed up in the room with zabini draco and crabbe that lupin had grown alarmed he had first notified snape who had been in his office at the time before running on to intercede himself he was rather surprised that snape hadntgotten here sooner harry wasn t he was probably hoping they might succeed he said darkly as they mounted the stairs to leave the dungeons and they nearly did harry you ve got to be more careful lupin lectured stopping to fix fierce eyes on him do not simply run into a room full of your enemies with no back up oh what am i saying dontrun into the room even with back up he corrected himself angrily wait for help aurors are here now on duty every day we re here to help protect you harry glared down at the floor feeling rather abused had he or had he not just done the right thing they could sit around and dissect his methods all day long but when it came down to it i sorry harry lupin began again i shouldntbe angry with you for trying to help but i do what i have to do harry interrupted i always have and i always will you get onto me for it now but soon it all going to come down to that and then i guess you ll be glad i so reckless lupin stared at him harry turned away and started back up the stairs halting only when remus put a hand on his arm not reckless harry he whispered brave forgive me harry looked back down at him and nodded of course with a nod he led ron back up the stairs in a bit of shock over lupin turnaround at the top they found dumbledore waiting for them as hermione and neville stood trying to keep a crowd of students out of the stairwell the gryffindors gave a cheer and hermione looked relieved to see them ron headed straight over to her while harry stood to the side and gave dumbledore a full report the headmaster was grave as he patted harry on the shoulder before heading down to make certain the slytherins were sent to his office for questioning and that tobias made it to the infirmary thank you harry for being so willing to help a fellow student he said with a smile that quickly faded but perhaps next time you might first appraise the teachers of the situation before you charge off harry stared at him until the headmaster smile returned i say that only of course if you are given time to do so we wish to help you in any way we can and protect you my boy you do understand that yes sir harry admitted dumbledore briefly ordered the students back into the great hall or back to their common rooms if they were done with eating harry and ron returned to the great hall after grabbing a bite to eat which harry barely managed while answering all the questions put to him about the slytherins actions he headed upstairs with the understandably angry and raucous gryffindors they wanted revenge and as angry as harry was he couldnttalk them out of it hermione talked herself almost hoarse trying to keep the third year boys from pelting the slytherin quidditch players with dungbombs during their practice the next morning ron just laughed at her efforts dinner was cancelled much to everyone surprise and sandwiches were set out on the tables in the common rooms hermione and neville the sixth year prefects informed everyone that this was a preventative measure the students were to stay in the common rooms or in the dorm room for the duration of the evening to keep tempers from flaring and unintentional harm being done unintentional my arse ron grumbled next time i see zabini there going to be some intentional harm done harry couldnt help but agree he tried to stay put but kept pacing in front of the fire unable to focus on the games going on around him finally he asked permission to go see tobias after a long delay word came back from professor mcgonagall who was in a meeting at the moment that he had better stay put or else tobias was fine but was not to be disturbed tonight nor were any gryffindors to be out wandering the halls especially harry he threw himself down in a chair grumpily near where fred and george were playing a game of exploding snap with ginny disgusting isntit harry fred said airily humiliating george agreed next thing you know they ll be putting a bib on you at meal time dontwant to get messy din din on your nice clean uniform do we he cooed in an irritating falsetto then it just a short jump to diapers and breastfeeding oof fred was interrupted by a pillow stuffed into his mouth i knew you d work the conversation around to breasts somehow ginny said coolly she stepped around george who was looking affronted on his brother behalf and dumped herself in harry lap one sweet smile later harry thoughts were successfully railroaded in another direction completely ginny often had that effect on him hermione often had the opposite effect she showed up in the common room after being taken off prefect duty mcgonagall wasntactually in a meeting she was waiting outside the headmaster office where professor dumbledore was meeting with snape they d been in there an hour already that means there ll be no time for me to meet with him about the research i ve done well he d ve probably been too busy anyway ron reasoned before stuffing another half of a ham sandwich in his mouth and catching the full brunt of hermione glare we e woul after several stinging remarks were traded ron caught her bad mood harry managed to worry a bit though ginny full attention was on him now that things might not be going according to plan if snape had the headmaster ear but as it was a friday night they all eventually put aside their worries and the twins brought out a new product line for them to test something for their transfiguration project dontask us for details hermione fred warded her off with a raised hand we canttell you a thing except that you might want to have some galleons handy next friday especially you harry if katie project goes as well as expected and also ron you might want to make good on that apology to our esteemed quidditch captain before then i knew i would fred exchanged a secretive grin with george the new product line was experimental jellies which featured along with frigid marmalade which made neville cold to the touch when he ate too much jolly jam with a light cheering charm embedded in its ingredients and pleasant preserves with a stronger cheering effect jittery jelly which had much the same effect as a jellylegs jinx fred stood like a statesman addressing the gryffindors as they eagerly passed around the samples imagine you re sitting around at breakfast and you re manky stepmum makes you take out the garbage again so you return with appropriately manky hands and very sweetly fix her some of this say you want a good day fix her some jolly jam or if it revenge you re after take the jittery jelly to her instead she ll be in bed in a twink seamus dared colin to try it hell yeah i ll try it said the smaller boy his cursing still causing amused looks from all the older students i ll try anything just ask dennis oh he will the pint sized fourth year offered he really up for anything colin took a big scoop and everyone watched him eat it with bated breath tastes nice he offered thickly smacking his lips a bit like strawberries oh wait there a jiggle and off he went legs jittering so much that when he talked it sounded as though he were operating a jackhammer of course harry had to explain what he meant by that when he said it but then everyone agreed and that was how colin finally got one of the things he most fervently wished for a nickname from his fellow gryffindors from then on he was colinjack unless it was the twins speaking who of course called him colinjill saturday dawned as bright and clear as if someone had ordered the perfect quidditch day the team was captainless as ron hadntbeen able to get up his nerve to apologize to katie yet for which of course the team soundly ridiculed him as soon as they reached the pitch is poor ickle puss scared of the big bad captain ginny called out the last words of which were screamed over her shoulder as ron gave chase the whole team got involved in trying to keep ron from throttling ginny harry ended up holding him back half laughing half angry all right all right no one dies during practice save that for the game everyone laughed and eventually ron relented gripping his broom tightly now that everyone is warmed up let start with the three man passing drill line up harry hadntmeant to take over for katie in fact he d been expecting ron to do it but it seemed to come natural to him and to his surprise everyone did as he asked after an hour he was happily ordering them around yelling if needed thrilled by giving voice to the various weaknesses he saw in the team it wasnteasy for the chasers to function well without katie but with any luck she d be back before the first game after another hour harry was sweaty and exhausted and hadnt practiced seeking at all but felt pleased with himself and the team ginny walked beside him as they left the field arentyou the little dictator she said playfully bumping against him well if katie wontdo it he reasoned why not me i can think of no one better her smile lit up harry insides after showers they caught up with hermione at dinnertime she had been fruitlessly trying to gain entrance to the headmaster office and had been sent another note from dumbledore apologizing for the inconvenience of having to wait he would send for her when his time was once again free the great hall seemed sparse no seventh years attended dinner except cho chang who hardly seemed aware of where she was so intent was she on her transfiguration text the slytherin table was noticeably thinned out those who had participated in tobias abduction had not been seen all day neither had tobias who was supposed to have been let out of the infirmary at some point the trio plus ginny spent a few minutes looking for him back at the dorm but didntfind him the day ended in an orgy of studying harry trying to get caught up on his transfiguration homework ginny readying for her o w l s hermione calculating arithmancy suppositions and ron falling asleep over his history book it impossible he groused i ve been conditioned to get sleepy every time i see the thing i mean binns couldntbe exciting if he doused himself with gasoline and lit a bloody match ron all right all right ron exploded turning around to glare at her a stinking match binns couldntbe exciting if he doused himself with gasoline and lit a stinking match is that better yes she said calmly turning a page she looked up and gave him a smile that ron returned lopsidedly he looked a bit dazzled the night came and went leaving harry with the blissful feeling of having caught up on sleep and not being needed anywhere at once he woke up sunday feeling thirsty but hopeful in fact better than he had in weeks he gazed up at his crimson curtains with a vague smile that slowly grew into a grin three of the five remaining seven deadly slytherins were out of commission and surely on their way out of hogwarts by now even snape couldnttalk them out of that so that meant there would only be two more attempts on his life which was undoubtedly better than having four to look forward to harry grabbed his glasses stretched and popped out of bed get up mate he said as he parted ron curtains and thumped him in the head unnn unnngh ron replied did not hurt harry said over his shoulder as he jerked off his pajama top and reached for a t shirt get up we have a lot of work to do on the team today and remember i captaining again since katie still wontbe there thanks to you harry thumped him on the head again ow geroff and a disheveled shirtless bed headed ron was on his feet groggily rubbing sleep out of his eyes quidditch right he mumbled as he headed for the bathroom the great hall was nearly deserted as ron and harry met ginny and a few other team members for breakfast ginny was pale and had dark circles under her eyes didntyou get any sleep last night harry asked taking her hand in his own under the table sort of i was reviewing potions trying to stay on the o w l schedule hermione planned out for me and i fell asleep on my books then i had a nightmare that snape was chasing me through the castle demanding the ingredients for frigid marmalade she said with a shiver stupid dream but it creeped me out a bit and i couldntgo back to sleep once i got in my room shouldnthave drunk that coffee i suppose suppose not harry agreed you can nap after practice yeah ron nodded we re all going to need naps after today practice i say we do double drills and a one handed scrimmage a few groans were heard from down the table do you want to beat slytherin or not ron asked them loudly we only have two weeks you know practice flew by as harry tried to get serious about the team deficiencies by the end the beaters were definitely improved and he thought the chasers even without katie actually had a chance against slytherin now harry had even managed to practice seeking during the second half of their scrimmage he d caught the snitch in less than eight minutes the glow of a good practice and a good workout stayed with harry after his shower and about ten minutes into his lunch then like a dark fog shrouding a sunny day the slytherins entered the room first came some third years all looking at harry strangely a few laughing next came a few fifth years then a clump of girls and following them draco a limping pale draco who was using what looked like a black cane to support him as he crossed the room his gaze was fixed on the slytherin table harry was watching him with a slightly gaping mouth and only heard the reaction around him as the next slytherins entered what the bloody hell that impossible harry how did but harry couldntanswer in stunned amazement that quickly turned to fury he watched bulstrode nott crabbe and zabini stride across the floor what are they doing here ginny grabbed at harry sleeve but he was already on his way to the teacher table dumbledore wasntthere but a tight lipped minerva mcgonagall was in her usual spot severus snape was staring at them with a small smile from his seat not a word potter she waved at him but the headmaster has dealt with all my objections in the same way he will deal with yours by reassuring that this is the only fair and reasonable thing to do how how can this potter not another word she paused and took in a deep breath through her flared nostrils those students you see maintain that they were put under the imperius curse what imperius curse my arse ron bellowed beside harry mr weasley ten points from gryffindor for that disrespectful language though i must say the sentiment is not unshared she gave him a stern look there was evidence using a priori incantatem that mr bletchley had indeed performed the imperius curse many many times over the past weeks under the circumstances the headmaster was obliged to give the students the benefit of the doubt since professor snape vowed to serve as the responsible party for any more incidents indeed i have mr potter snape said in his most oily voice i hope you have no problems with the outcome harry glanced at the potions professor and then turned on his heel fury fueled by desperation heated his every moment so that he fairly whipped the air as he moved to confront the slytherins hot blood pumped in his veins draco saw him coming raised a single eyebrow and crossed his arms he murmured something to blaise who immediately jerked around and zeroed in on harry who was already glaring down at him blaise gave a very fake smile potter i am so very sorry about that misunderstanding the other night oh yes the one where you went to kill me and missed harry hissed through his teeth blaise eyes narrowed i never meant to kill you surely even you cant be that dense harry leaned over closer do you know why you had to trap me in a room and surround me by four other slytherins before you d throw a curse my way because you re a coward blaise jumped to his feet and his eyes glittered if i d meant to kill you potter you d be dead think what one of the seven deadly sins anger are you angry now did my little trick make you angry enough i think you so so do i millicent said loudly a smug smile on her repugnant face he angry and when you re angry blaise pointed out you make mistakes harry was going to have to try harder his upper lip curled you re the one who made a mistake you re too much of a coward to take me on alone how dare you what dont you know that common knowledge everyone knows draco is a ponce crabbe is an idiot and zabini is a coward even baby gryffindors know that zabini was shaking with rage but he hadntreached for his wand yet everyone watching you and everyone knows you would never pull your wand on me i will my turn is still to come blaise breathed oh brilliant and do you know what happens to deadly slytherins who try to kill me and dontget the job done right a flicker of fear rose in blaise eyes yes i can see you do pansy and goyle do i mean did you re a coward blaise salazar slytherin himself would be ashamed of you very aware of the line he was crossing harry spat on blaise face then there were arms grabbing harry pulling back and slytherins reaching for blaise as he vaulted the table wand waving screams sounded and teachers were yelling but harry had blaise right where he wanted him harry shook off his friends and punched his wand into his hand dropped to one knee opened his mouth and did not fire a curse blaise was howling something inarticulately his frenzy ending in a bludgeoning curse he jerked to the side and let it pass then stood up nice shot zabini blaise jaw dropped but he moved to fire another curse draco knocked his wand hand down with his cane so hard that the crack echoed around the room harry stowed his wand a grin on his face and have a nice trip home blaise was stuttering madly with a grin harry walked back to the gryffindor table great job harry ron pounded harry on the back i thought you d lost your marbles for a minute there but that was brilliant ginny kissed harry on the cheek soundly very brilliant zabini was the worst of that lot and now he gone hermione wasnt nearly as nice harry james potter you spit on zabini he wasnt reaching for his wand and i didntknow what else to do he wait harry stopped and turned back around professor snape was snarling at zabini how dare you pull a stunt like that in the great hall you were made aware by the headmaster that this sort of misbehavior would result in immediate dismissal from the school grounds and yet you flagrantly disobeyed the rule what do you have to say for yourself harry slid a glance over to ron and saw him staring as well pale and gaping like a fish i i i dontknow what to say sir blaise stammered out he was baiting me i just wasnt thinking obviously apologize to mr potter and then go and pack your things but sir potter he was crabbe began from beside them harry saw draco make a gesture to quiet him there are no exceptions to the rule apologize to mr potter the hall was deathly quiet blaise walked stiffly over to harry who felt that he d been plunged into a surreal dream i apologize for my behavior yeah er sure blaise face settled into a sneering grimace what he might have meant as a smile and turned away snape who had been watching blaise with a stern eye moved his gaze to harry where it softened i am certain mr potter will forgive you for your outrageous behavior he is the forgiving sort correct mr potter harry blinked of course he is though i hardly think he is blameless in this episode mr potter there will be no verbal attacks on students allowed in the great hall either if you have a problem with a fellow student come to a faculty member first is that clear professor mcgonagall asked in ringing tones yes ma am harry said in a voice that didntcarry half as far mcgonagall then turned to the gaping student body now do we need any further underscoring of the rule that there will be no spells in the great hall ever no there was a general shaking of heads then get back to eating as snape escorted blaise out harry looked blankly round at ron and hermione ron face was a mask of horror hermione was blinking over and over again as if her thoughts were spinning too fast to register ginny tugged at harry hand and he let her lead him toward the table they all sat under a heavy cloud of silence after a moment ron roused himself did snape just say something well i mean could it be called sort of maybe well nice what he said yeah harry murmured ron nodded i think i going to be sick it just so wrong neville added with a shudder blaise was gone now having left the hall without a backward glance snape right on his heels harry would give anything to hear that conversation his gaze traveled back over to where draco sat watching him his face impassive harry had a thousand questions going through his mind as the new week dawned the mystery of snape behavior deepened potions was a waking nightmare now marked not with sarcastic remarks and bitter hate directed at harry but with sugary words and niceness from the professor that went far beyond the bounds of creepiness by wednesday harry wanted so desperately to go back to the way things had been before that he spilled his delirium draught on purpose right on snape shoes as he walked by here harry thought here where the yelling begins and we get back to some normal detention giving rancor but instead snape face turned a mottled purple color reminding harry vividly of uncle vernon and then he smiled harry flinched did i brush your vial as i went by dear boy snape voice oozed with charm how clumsy of me scourgify you ll still get full marks of course then he walked directly to his office and closed the door hermione stared at harry trembling why did you do that harry shook his head his eyes never leaving snape office i ll bet he put a silencing charm in there and is breaking things right and left why he pretending to like me no one believes it no one likes it the slytherins were regarding harry with the utmost contempt murder in their eyes draco however was sitting with a vacant expression one hand propping up his head he looked abjectly miserable i dont know harry hermione said putting a hand on his arm to get his attention but i dontthink it will help anything if you make snape lose his temper just play along play along harry asked the germ of an idea was beginning to form i can do that i can definitely do that from that day on he was as pleasant to snape as snape was to him he did it because he knew it bothered snape more than anything else he could have done in return and the look on his face was quiet comical the first time harry told him he looked extremely well dressed that day the headmaster agreed to meet with harry for a few minutes on wednesday night after meetings with concerned parents and professors wishing to heighten security and before his almost nightly conversations with minister of magic cornelius fudge bletchley had been handed over to aurors over the weekend when dumbledore reluctantly contacted the ministry the consequences though not unforeseen were grim several members of the wizengamot were calling for an investigation into dumbledore control over hogwarts questioning his ability to keep the students safe an editorial had made it into the paper causing a flurry of speculation and concern about bletchley safety the boy would probably go to azkaban to await trial which was not good dumbledore was doing his best to waylay the head auror costa fornier from pursuing this course of action but the man was stubborn having lost narcissa malfoy to suicide he was taking no chances professor dumbledore recounted all of this information in that way he had of making it all seem to be a bother instead of the grave complications that they were even when harry brought up the seven deadly slytherins dumbledore seemed unfazed he had known about them from the start of the year from snape and had the professor working on the problem from the inside he hasnt done exactly a bang up job sir do you think professor dumbledore leaned back i would be careful of dealing out judgment so quickly harry the situation is much more complicated than you know severus must be careful not to show his hand so to speak and that hampers him from dealing directly with situations and that kept him from warning me about the love potion or about the portkey or maybe it was spite really sir i i have my own reasons for trusting severus harry harry opened his mouth to argue and shut it again there was really nothing else to say after that there are things in professor snape life that you do not understand and probably never will understand there is little love lost between the two of you but you are no longer on opposite sides surely you ve noticed the change in how he treats you in class i ve heard that your reciprocation has been a little less than what i had hoped for well i sorry sir but it just creepy harry barely restrained a shudder and i dontunderstand what you mean that we re no longer on opposite sides you ve always said he was on our side yes but he had to appear to be on the other side as he was reporting to tom as a double agent of sorts that is no longer the case what since when the headmaster smiled do not feel badly my boy but it all goes back to your rescue of charlie weasley severus had already told tom at that point that you were still in a coma your rescue showed that snape was either a liar or completely undependable he had a desperate choice to make return beg forgiveness and take the consequences or never return at all harry let that all sink in a moment so he chosen to never go back precisely therefore he no longer has to force himself to menace you in front of the death eater children or future recruits he is free to act as a normal professor will that is the change you have seen in him harry wasnt really satisfied with this but he let the subject drop he thanked the professor for his time then stopped himself at the door have you seen draco sir i have he seems to be caught in a difficult spot but i am afraid that is where he has placed himself and we are of little help but he being bullied sir that limp of his had to have he insists that it was a clumsy accident and no more professor snape said that draco tried to heal the broken leg himself and did so badly draco refuses to go to the infirmary to have it fixed as it does not pose a danger to him we are letting things take their natural course harry gritted his teeth and sir hermione asked me to let you know she ready to meet whenever you have a spare moment the headmaster chuckled remind her that i will send for her as soon as that spare moment appears will that help no not really i ve been telling her that all along but you know hermione thank you sir but as he walked down the stairs to collect ron he wondered how much of the truth dumbledore was missing because of his blind faith in snape faith that seemed more blind all the time toward the end of the school week the seventh years were by turns exhausted giddy and mysterious which drove hermione mad finally on thursday evening mcgonagall announced to the school that the great hall would be closed on the following day for the seventh years to prepare their transfiguration projects breakfast and lunch would be served in the common rooms this sparked a flurry of wild speculation none of which was commented on by the reclusive seventh years the gryffindors were all complaining about the change in eating venues until the breakfast buffet appeared in the common room the next morning instead of the simple fare they had expected it was like christmas come early the spread of hot dishes and sauces and baked items were accented by a gold leafed tablecloth and shining crystalware edged in cold the milk was cold and frothy the coffee hot and strong the juices were icy cold everyone served themselves and then lounged all over the room chattering in between bites even tobias made an appearance settling himself in a corner with violet hooch taking care to be as far away from harry as possible harry watched him determined to at least exchange a smile with the boy he hadnt seen him since the incident tobias had made every attempt to avoid him it was obvious he felt uncomfortable in his presence even now he had to be aware harry was trying to get his attention but he kept his eyes down on his own plate give him some time harry ginny said as she settled down beside him on the couch balancing a muffin and another cup of coffee on her plate he was really scared have you tried the casserole i hate it when mum makes it but this is grand ron happily stuffed his face making harry smile this was like a giant indoor picnic with the promise of another one for lunch so harry mood was high as he kissed ginny goodbye at the portrait and walked to class with ron and hermione they were sinking into a deep quidditch discussion when they rounded the corner on the third floor so the attack by the slytherins took them completely off guard all harry knew was that suddenly ron was gone hermione was screaming and draco had hit him so hard that he was slammed against the wall blood pouring from his nose now truth be told harry could have prevented that punch his sensing told him where that fist was and when to dodge but he was so surprised by the force of his concern for draco and distracted in trying to figure out why the boy was doing this that he did nothing at first once he did manage to get a hold of draco and get in a good punch to his gut the slytherin seized the chance to lean in close to his ear whispering frantically harry listened his gaze flickering from the intensity in the boy eyes to the other slytherins who were screaming encouragement or harassing the gryffindors abruptly draco was finished shoving harry away and pulling crabbe from ron any real damage could be done the slytherin crowd followed draco reluctantly giving harry filthy looks as long as they could harry watched wiping blood from his mouth and spitting more on the floor are you all right hermione asked tremulously harry nodded professor flitwick showed up but harry assured him it was a simple misunderstanding that draco had gotten in his way and tripped him so that harry had hit the wall with his face ron blustered until hermione shushed him the crowd of sympathetic students that had gathered around them stared at harry shocked by his lie harry stared back once flitwick had gone harry muttered i dontwant a professor fighting my battles for me i ll take care of draco my own way dontworry the students nodded and looked generally approving again be careful harry give em hell harry one first year walked over and reached up on tiptoe to kiss his cheek laughter spread around the hallway as harry blushed and bent down awkwardly for the life of him he couldntremember her name but she was a tiny blond fairy of a girl you have to stay safe harry dont worry about that nasty boy what goes around comes around that what my mum always says thanks harry said faintly wishing everyone would stop staring the little girl turned to hermione and gave her a smile then returned to the group of giggling girls she belonged to once the crowd had dispersed hermione turned again to harry what did he say to you what who ron asked looking from one to the other harry felt his nose gingerly it didntfeel broken but draco sure hadnt pulled the punch he said i d better not eat any pudding tonight why not ron asked louder shush hermione hissed apparently it crabbe turn harry admitted picking up the books he d dropped and sighing before he looked at his friends he knows about the drug laced cupcakes we gave him in second year and he knows that goyle is dead ron and hermione exchanged grim looks well still not eating any pudding at all ron shook his head how long do they expect you to keep that up ron stuck to that line of reasoning no matter how many times harry explained that pudding wasntworth dying over as they sat in their chairs ready for transfiguration ron leaned over to have another go at harry listen to me you prat i can be your taster show me what you want to eat and i ll try a bit if i keel over and die then you ll know not to eat it i dont need a taster harry growled i not some poncy prince he shouldnt eat anything at all hermione said firmly from the other side that a bit much dontyou think they had a whispered argument over harry like he wasnteven there he thought he agreed with hermione until she said that he should go to his dorm room and stay there all night fasting that was going a bit too far nevertheless he agreed that he was going to have to be careful once transfiguration class began he found out how difficult of a job it was going to be this year it was deemed unsafe to let the student body travel to hogsmeade mcgonagall said in a clipped voice that preempted complaints thus professor dumbledore has asked that the seventh years be allowed to try to bring hogsmeade to us they have each chosen a type of shop to run and have transfigured bought or borrowed what they need to make their shop and stock it accordingly you will want to have your galleons handy the bazaar will open at three o clock sharp with food and sweets of every kind no dinner will be served so eat up by your purchases you will be ensuring a better grade for your fellow students ron was shaking his head fred and george get all the breaks how in the world did they happen to get back into school the one year that seventh years have to run a shop to get a good grade when are we ever going to have an assignment on something i good at seamus leaned back from the table in front of them you mean like clearing out the bathroom with that stink of yours ron just grinned and nodded you are exceptionally talented in that area mate hermione ignored them with a muttered boys are mad harry smiled but sweets and enticing pastries were spinning in his mind he flexed his left bicep and felt the familiar tug of his universal poison antidote the one made by snape did he dare trust in it he could take one before eating anything he suspected poisoned and it would neutralize it at least according to snape but trusting snape at this point seemed utter folly harry went over his options all morning with ron and hermione interjecting their polarized opinions intermittently by the time for the bazaar harry still hadntcome to a conclusion he joined the throng of students waiting in the great hall and took ginny hand she turned and gave his hand a squeeze you ll be fine we ll test everything before you eat it simple no worries harry nodded but what if draco was wrong what if the slytherins fed him misinformation to lead harry off the track harry shook his head he had to trust draco he had to he just wished it didntsound like such a completely idiotic thing to do the student body waiting in the foyer of the great hall grew louder and louder as the clock approached three everywhere there were faces lit up with excitement obsessing over what they would find inside the huge doors speculating from owl post deliveries theorizing and recounting every hint and tidbit anyone was lucky enough to gather from a willing seventh years you know fred and george said something about katie shop being right up my alley oh sorry mate ron said as he was stepped on the back of harry shoe getting shoved here so d you think it could be a quality quidditch supplies kind of a shop d you think she d give me a discount or something not enough of one ginny said tartly the whole point is to see who can make the most money today that counts for a large part of the grade that hardly seems fair hermione sniffed obviously some things will sell for more money than others yes but the students were supposed to take that into account and think up ways to bring in more money to compensate i think it going to be interesting to see who does the best ron poked her where your loyalty of course fred and george will sell the most they ve got real world experience and candy just then the doors to the great hall opened and out stepped professor mcgonagall quiet down quiet down everyone now the students have worked very hard to make this a wonderful experience for all of you and to get the best marks they can dontruin by behaving badly respect all of their hard work regardless of which house they are in and remember that buying their products will help ensure a high marks for them are we ready good then proceed in an orderly fashion i said orderly but with a delighted cry the students surged faster than professor mcgonagall had anticipated she quickly put up a shield that made a twanging sound every time someone bumped into it and berated every student that came near eventually resorting to taking house points in that one crush over two hundred and ninety house points were lost most of them slytherin in surging crush forward the trio and ginny nearly got separated but they managed to stay in a pack by fierce dogmatic stubbornness aided by ron long reach and harry temper and entered into a world completely unlike the one they traversed every day the first thing they noticed was the sky magicked in the ceiling above them which was radiating the thrilling mix of oranges reds and yellows that appears just before sunset only this sunset was controlled lasting the whole three hours that the bazaar was open and setting into a clear starry night once it had closed as fred and george told them later beneath the brilliant sky was a winding maze of brightly colored stalls and tents selling all kind of wares colors assaulted the students from every side in the awnings and flags that waved advertising the goods inside as well as the house of the owner looking more closely harry could easily pick out the shop boasting of weasleys wizarding wheezes about halfway down the winding path using bright neon orange as its base color up higher on some sort of magical hill that supported a large clump of shops was katie kwidditch keeper both of those harry would definitely visit later first were a clothing shop run by a hufflepuff girl who had always been nice to harry ginny picked out a scarf there as harry and ron stood in the open air eyeing cho chang food stall down the lane the smells of the rich and spicy foods that wafted forth were tantalizing harry was hungry in fact that was all he could think about as they walked forward peering into the next shop that they could actually fit into students were packing in all of them especially cho s harry noticed it didntsurprise him at all when ron bought a meat pasty at the first kiosk they came to the hufflepuff pasty shop hermione gave him a look but his mouth was too full to defend himself after ron had eaten over half of it he took pity on harry and handed him the rest oughtta be safe tastes great he summed up licking his fingers harry didnt care how much was already eaten it was fabulous that was the pattern they followed for the next hour as the girls shopped ron buying food some paid for by harry eating a bit and then handing it off neither of them was really satisfied in the end but it was better than watching harry starve all afternoon they had to wait in line to get into the weasleys eyesore of a tent even though the twins didntresort to tricks or bribes to get anyone inside the crazily striped orange lime green and nautical blue tent was filled with gadgets and candies from the other store at even lower prices since there was less overhead the twins were in their element making deals padding sales with miscellaneous items cutting the prices for the prettiest girls hannah abbot harry was surprised to see had actually donned a talking apron designed much like harry bothersome sling and was helping tally up sales buy more and spend less the talking apron boomed everything on sale everything must go moving sale going out of business sale inventory reduction sale inventory predilection sale inventory selection predisposition and trepidation sale hannah who blushed pink when george winked at her continued to blush as harry bought a galleon worth of tricks and candies arentthey doing great she said enthusiastically i think they re going to win yeah harry murmured he was still debating eating a nougat when ginny stepped over to him i bored here let move on katie kwiddich keeper was a beautiful shop all done in varnished wood with properly working doors and an open ceiling with magically hung ceiling fans to let in the sunset she met them at the door and walked around with them proudly the brooms i inventoried just to give it atmosphere though it would be nice to sell one or two they give the most profit of anything i sell but i also have a great line of supplies to clean brooms and anything you need to make watching the games more comfortable omnioculars bum bastic seat cushions huge house supporter banners and clackers imagine when we re playing slytherin and our whole houses clacks those during a penalty shot ginny was in awe katie how on earth did you get enough to stock the new firebolt actually it a loan if it doesntsell i return it to quality quidditch supplies if it does sell i get half for commission harry had noticed ginny eyes come alive as she d studied the new firebolt beam it was smaller and lighter than his own with a deluxe seating charm and heater the twigs were straight as an arrow and the handle glowed softly in the fading light it was beautiful and fiery just like ginny he had to buy it for her they enjoyed looking at the other things and each bought a gryffindor banner to hang in their dorm rooms the clackers they couldntuse because they would be in the air during the games of course when harry mentioned they missed her at practices katie stiffened saying that she couldntthink about that until after the transfiguration project was done i hope she sells a lot ginny whispered as they left the shop so she ll be in a good mood and come back to play just then they passed neville who was happily stuffing his face with chinese food as luna steered him to a nearby table hello harry luna called smiling keep an eye on the crows harry didnt appreciate the reminder of that dire dream she d had about him but it did remind him to keep an eye for crabbe so far he hadntrun into any of the deadly slytherins but was almost sure he d seen lupin duck out of sight up ahead good aurors on duty harry looked around for ron and saw him exiting his brothers tent eating some sort of licorice let go and get ron he said taking ginny hand ginny sighed i was hoping to spend some time alone with you harry squeezed her hand we will later all right all right then she said with a sigh just then george stuck his head out of the tent bitsy you re wanted he called gaily excuse me while i go hex a brother out of existence doesntmatter which one ginny growled as she grasped ron arm he whispered the bodyguard spell and ginny was on her way again so quickly that harry almost missed the whole thing harry haventbeen eating anything without me have you ron asked as he sucked on his licorice wanna bite no thank you i prefer my licorice dry been to katie s actually yes want to go with i have something to buy ron was alight with jealousy when he saw the broom harry was going to buy i dontthink she ll accept that harry i mean it a bit much maybe but it perfect and i would buy it for her if it only cost a shilling it not the amount of money that matters you dontthink she d understand that ron nodded his head comprehension slowly dawning so is that how i should be too like if i wanted to buy something for hermione just find something perfect for her and dontworry about money er yeah i guess so works for me i mean i think it does it not like i ve done this before or anything after working out the payment with katie who was thrilled beyond belief to be selling her second broom of the day harry headed back out satisfied and ready to eat half a cow if it was presented to him in a bowl i have to eat something let head over to cho s cho intercontinental cuisine didntjust serve chinese food but hot indian food thai food as well as mexican and italian dishes the smells coming from the kitchen were heavenly even as mixed as they were ron tossed the last bit of his much abused licorice in a trash bin nearby and led the way it was set up cafeteria style with all the dishes laid out on trays according to type harry picked an italian feast of spaghetti lasagna and stuffed shells in alfredo sauce he was barely patient enough for ron to taste it for him before digging in ron had gone with chinese food mostly because harry had the italian covered and he knew he was going to get to eat his as well the food was excellent behind the counter cho looked satisfied if frazzled she had a staff of four underclassmen working to get the trays ready and another seventh year running the register they were doing very very good business just as harry had taken the last bite ginny showed back up i bought you something she said pulling harry away from the table where ron was still finishing up ey wai ron called through his food we wontgo far harry assured him as ginny pulled him on to the alley between cho and a half filled book stall run by a disappointed looking ravenclaw harry pulled his hand out of ginny s wondering at the tightness of her grip you can let go i not going to run away oh she blinked then smiled sorry i just wanted you to have this before you got too full she handed him a small package what is it harry asked as he opened it a mini gateaux it really rich chocolate cake only it small enough to not make you sick you know since you have that thing about chocolate cake harry looked up at her and nodded he did have a slight aversion to it because of his aunt chocolate cake that had been poisoned which reminded him he hated to ask but did you taste it already she stared at him no why does it have a bite missing or something he looked back at the cake no bite missing but ginny knew he couldnteat anything sweet tonight harry jerked his head up wand already in hand couldntcome up with anything more original cra ginny face twisted and she flung a container of liquid at harry face he jerked aside but some splashed on his cheek his skin seared with pain and both of his eyes were forced close as the fumes rose he was now fighting blind automatically he turned to sensing a curse was coming harry felt it the killing curse but there were students behind him he couldntduck he had to shield was that even possible with only a half second to spare harry desperately conjured the gray shield of occlumency focusing it outside of himself there was a terrible pressure a pain that came from beyond the shield it threatened to splinter his mind to rip his soul from his body and harry fought it with every ounce of power he had but it wasntenough it was breaking him he could feel it a scream began to build inside filling up his mind with darkness and pain and then suddenly there was light harry mind glowed with an infusion of silvery essence feeding him power out of nowhere no not nowhere it was familiar ephemeral magic and it acted like adrenaline in harry body he used it to fight harder focusing on his shield strengthening it until it was impenetrable the killing curse could go no further and it snapped back returning to where it came from harry was thrown in the opposite direction body limp he hit the ground with a bone jarring thud that took his breath gasping weak he looked up into the white shocked face of fred who was trying to say something something important then the world slowly faded to white chapter twenty two which sounds more dangerous to you harry felt like his entire body was being pricked by needles that horrible feeling when blood is returning to a body part that had been asleep but all over he moved restlessly where was he his eyes felt too heavy to open and those prickles damn his whole body must have been asleep what had happened he remembered ginny vaguely and pain moving a hand to his face he felt smooth skin where he was sure there shouldntbe slowly harry opened his eyes through the haze of blurry light around him figures were drawing near harry professor dumbledore voice greeted him lightly how are you feeling all right he rasped i think here you go ginny whispered from beside him she placed his glasses on for him somehow knowing what he was looking for he settled his glasses more securely taking in at a glance hermione grim look fred pale steadiness beside her lupin obvious tiredness and tonks looking rather defeated in a hufflepuff uniform the headmaster looked as he often did around harry twinkly eyed but defeated around the edges harry i sorry harry looked back at ginny surprised to hear the unfamiliar note of helplessness in her voice are you all right yes mad as hell but fine she retorted as several shades of red crossed her face a sudden burst of memory assaulted him half assembled the girl who had pulled him out of the tent that hadntbeen the real ginny where were you ginny threw her hands in the air angrily violet hooch asked me to go with her and talk to tobias because he was so depressed but we never made it some one got the drop on us from behind and if i ever find out who did it she ll be a good girl and come tell me so i can have first dibs on killing them fred put in not likely ginny tossed back in clipped tones harry mind was racing to fill in the blanks he remembered now the false ginny throwing something at his face something that burned violet and ginny were both found unconscious behind the hufflepuff pasty shop lupin went on to explain neither was seriously injured they only wanted me out of the way ginny seethed before focusing back on harry so they could use my face again i sorry harry i so bloody sick of this harry clutched clumsily at her hand it not your fault i fine but i dontunderstand how exactly professor dumbledore crabbe threw the killing curse at me i tried to put up a shield but i didnt think it would work indeed it should have been impossible my dear boy but your shield deflected the avada kedavra deflected it then crabbe dumbledore nodded vincent crabbe was killed by his own curse harry felt the blood drain out of his face i couldntdodge it i was afraid it would hit someone behind me like neville in defense against the dark arts class so i tried to block it i knew it wouldntbe strong enough and i remember very distinctly that the shield was failing and then harry shut his eyes briefly trying to remember a silver light came from somewhere and strengthened it does that make any sense at all the glance passing between dumbledore and lupin made harry pause hermione was holding her hands to her mouth crying she d been silent this whole time why was she harry felt the world suddenly tilt beneath him where ron as everyone gaze slid to harry left he turned to look there too and stopped breathing ron pale and terribly still was lying in the bed across the aisle and the missing pieces slid into place with an almost audible click that spell harry breathed turning back to ginny who stared back at him with a closed look is that was the spell is about the bloody bodyguard spell harry you must stay calm professor dumbledore warned in a low voice harry turned to him why someone tell me what does the spell do what did it do to him he looked wildly from one face to the next oh harry tonks murmured and walked away from the bed the headmaster stepped up to the bed all your questions will be answered the fraterdum singletus is a spell of fidelity and brotherhood one that has been used to magically bind the weasleys to you it was adapted and administered quite without my knowledge to allow the many to support the one what dumbledore raised a calming hand it is an archaic bodyguard spell used in times of great necessity it allows the guard to give magical energy or anything else needed to the one they choose to support anything else harry repeated suddenly feeling the bed falling away behind him you mean i took from ron to make that shield because he was my bodyguard harry voice cracked yes that would seem to be the case making you incidentally the only person to have ever survived the killing curse once or twice but harry wasnt smiling and the weasleys knew this would happen he turned burning eyes on ginny you helped do this yes harry sat up jerkily clutching at the bedclothes for balance then take it off i can t ginny said edgily harry ignored the buzzing in his ears that sounded like hermione pleading and lupin giving rational advice he only had eyes for the beautiful traitor in front of him whose face was turning bright red except for the white ring around her set mouth a danger sign he had no intention of heeding take it off take it off no you pig headed clot will you just for once let someone help you ginny began take it off right now or i ll jabbing pain stole harry breath cutting him off abruptly he fell back as though his strings had been cut dontyou dare fly at my parents like that for doing this or i will bloody well kick your arse whether you re the one or not ginny sucked in a deep breath and went on longer far too long considering harry was just trying to breathe from the next bed ron groaned oh ginny stop it you re only making it worse hermione flung in their general direction and fled to ron side ginny finally stopped or just ran out of words she was standing there fairly vibrating as fred ventured close enough to pull her away let him rest he murmured he just got off dying you idiot harry was focusing on not passing out over the quiet sound of ginny sobbing he heard the headmaster approaching and from the other side of the bed the brisk footfalls of madame pomfrey professor dumbledore laid a cool dry hand on harry brow and the pain in his abdomen loosened its deathgrip harry pulled in a deeper breath despite the guilt sitting heavily on his chest or maybe that was leftover pain from the curse binding his ribcage in fire he couldnttell which as if he needed anything more to yell about madame pomfrey chided as she bent over him worst case of magical depletion i ve ever seen and here you stand baiting him out as his friends called whispered goodbyes harry took the offered pain potion gratefully waves of exhaustion anger guilt and pain were taking it in turns to make him miserable how could the weasleys do this to him madame pomfrey straightened his covers patted his hand and gave the headmaster a stern look one minute and no more theatrics yes poppy the headmaster said obediently madame pomfrey nodded satisfied and then walked briskly away harry listened to her footfalls the seething mass of pain in his gut now down to a dull ache he waited for the headmaster words hoping they would give him some dim understanding of how to deal with this new wrinkle in the tattered fabric of his life oxygen alone wasntdoing the trick the headmaster spoke in his most gentle voice i sorry but miss weasley was telling you the truth there is no way to reverse the spell harry stared at him in slowly mounting horror why why would they do this what if i lose courage harry this spell was not meant to burden you professor dumbledore said with a smile the weasleys are trying to show their faith in you in your ultimate triumph and they mean only to give you an added incentive ultimate triumph the words echoed in harry mind he covered his face in his hands what incentive that of giving you something to live for they fear as i do that you will whole heartedly throw yourself into the battle and care not what happens to yourself afterward harry dropped his hands staring at the familiar ceiling he had to admit that he had gone far beyond caring in many ways what happened to himself in the end except when he thought of ginny there he was hopelessly entangled in the future he desired with her but now with this spell active you must take care of yourself if you would have your friends survive tears threatened and harry blinked several times he already had the fate of the whole world on his hands did it have to get more personal his biggest fear was voldemort getting his claws into one of his friends and using them against him now that didnteven have to happen for harry to be responsible for their deaths he simply had to need their magical energy their adrenaline their blood oh god there has to be a safeguard harry said forcefully there must be yes that was the adaptation they made harry the need will travel from one weasley to the next until the need is met the headmaster nodded answering harry unspoken question ginny also contributed some of her own energy to help shield you tonight it was apparently your own quite substantial magical force as well as nearly all of ron added to a small part of ginevra that led to your second escape from the killing curse quite remarkable and perhaps something to be grateful for dontyou think guilt hit him again this time with the prick of a four inch needle directly to his heart he covered his face with his hands again he couldntprocess it his mind just could not wrap itself around such a wave of exhaustion hit him pulling him down into a drugged stupor he wanted to think more about the consequences of their actions but his eyelids were so heavy even heavier than his heart sleep my boy you will feel better when you wake and then we will deal with these slytherins harry heard the words as if from a far distance and they stayed with him as he slept he dreamed of endless ways of dealing with slytherins none of them involving endangering weasleys that night harry woke suddenly shaking his head to clear it he felt so much better that he was certain his sleep had just sucked more magic or something else from his friends when would that stop how had he never noticed it before he d been injured plenty of times but then again maybe not this bad since the weasleys had become his bodyguards maybe it only came into play because it had been an avada kedavra cast his way he still didntknow what to think about what they had done it made him feel different he was always trying to protect those around him and suddenly the best way to protect them was to protect himself harry potter sir harry jerked violently dobby was floating there pale and translucent dobby where have you been harry whispered sternly i thought you were supposed to be watching out for me dobby is sorry mr harry potter sir for failing you so miserably dobby wailed but quietly so that harry for once didnthave to shush him dobby is a bad bad house elf ghost but dobby is still having to guard poor winky sir it is needing to be done winky it took a moment for harry to remember that someone had been threatening the poor elf oh have you found out who was behind all the problems yes sir but it is not making very much sense to poor dobby it is duffy who is doing it wait i remember him he was all for getting freed when i was down there last what made him turn against winky dobby is not knowing winky is not knowing either duffy has said he is never doing anything to winky but dobby knows he is lying has he taken clothes yet no sir harry potter sir then perhaps professor dumbledore should ask him he wouldntbe able to lie to his master would he dobby grew more agitated wringing his ghostly hands but duffy has already talked with the headmaster and it is not doing any good duffy is still lying is there any way i can help harry asked hopelessly dobby hesitated dumbledore is saying that house elves need to take care of house elf problems or they will never truly be free do you think this er i think that the way it usually works but i can still come down there if you need me dobby straightened up at once his tennis ball eyes shining brightly oh thank you harry potter sir but dobby dobby is handling it good so er have you followed draco at all then oh yes sir and i is having something to report finally harry muttered he is going to see the head auror claude fornier at the ministry why no harry potter here at hogwarts the aurors are here because harry potter almost died and the headmaster is beside himself the house elf said in a whisper he is letting the head auror meet with students bad past master was in his office because he is being a slytherin and he is fighting with his wand when everyone fought because because of harry potter almost dying he said in a hushed whisper his eyes suddenly swimming in tears again oh dobby is so glad you are better good mister harry potter yes but what this about draco when bad little past master came out of the auror office he was not well not at all he had been cursed are you certain did you hear anything silencio is what dobby heard the elf said soberly drifting toward the floor and when the past master came out he was white and shaking and there was blood on his lips harry lay back on the pillow sudden nausea making him ill his skin prickled and a shudder went through his body how many aurors were in there just the head auror harry potter harry took a deep breath still he could have done anything to him why harry was sickened why would fornier do that why would snape let him did you watch to see if draco went to visit snape after that no he did not bad past master cleaned himself up and went back to his room slowly is harry potter sad dobby was not sad dobby is bad house elf ghost he said with conviction no that all right dontpunish yourself dobby hesitated hand on nose it does not really work as well now that dobby is a house elf ghost that is bad i dontthink so dobby grinned just a little bit and then went off with promises to report about draco to dumbledore harry laid there for a while trying to adjust his picture of what was happening in the school apparently there d been another catastrophic incident between the houses after harry had gone unconscious and fornier was ensconced in the school as part of heightened security measures draco was in a worse spot than ever he d finally gotten the slytherins to trust him and now the head auror was making his life a living hell again it sounded as if fornier had been vicious and out of line but then anyone would generally assume draco was the head of the sdses instead of an outsider trying to help harry and betray them and maybe fornier actions would make the slytherins think again before trying again not that anything else had seemed to work long before harry had decided whether or not the head auror presence would ultimately be a good or bad thing he found himself drifting back to sleep his dreams were haunted by a half transformed snake like narcissa and claude fornier doing a waltz while draco stood chained to the wall watching it was such a disconcerting dream that harry was grateful to wake to the quiet darkness of the infirmary later sucking in a deep breath of relief before he realized something blurry was sitting lightly on his chest stifling a cry he tried to grab at his glasses without moving the thing unnecessarily it seemed harmless and sort of soft but meoowwww confused but hopeful harry managed to get at his glasses and keep a hand on the cat at the same time once his vision was restored a smile crept up his cheeks a tawny cat with bright brown eyes and white boots on its paws sat serenely watching him from its perch on his chest with an imperious expression it she lifted a dainty paw and licked carefully at the fur there though the gesture seemed too tentative to do much actual good in fact she looked less as if she was trying to clean herself and more as if she were trying to convince someone that she was an actual cat it was so much like the dream harry had seen once before in what seemed like ages ago that he had to laugh ginny what are you doing here and like that instantly the cat dropped her paw and stared at him in a decidedly affronted manner again just like the dream she dug her claws into his chest the pain chasing away his smile ouch what was that for she hissed at him so angrily that harry jumped then he remembered oh because i yelled at you she retracted her claws harry sighed i sorry i just hated that i hurt you and ron without even knowing it and that it likely it will happen again i dontwant that the cat stared at him with wide open brown eyes not blinking for so long that harry felt self conscious what but he had just spilled his guts to a cat hadnthe and said something easily that ginny might never have gotten out of him otherwise just as he was about to start babbling an excuse the cat stepped closer and licked his nose her breath wasntvery cat like not fishy or bad like crookshanks had usually been just warm and sweet and her nose was a bit cold where she rubbed it against his cheek that tickles he murmured but was more comforted than bothered by her closeness as she began to settle down by his shoulder he lied back on the bed and let her circle and paw at the mattress to her heart content why do cats do that anyhow she didntanswer but flopped down inelegantly right on his nose hey budge over he protested scooting her off his face your aim is a bit off she sniffed at him flopped down again and set at once to licking at her back one white booted paw in the air harry watched her with interest you know you donthave to do that to convince me she didnt stop and he watched her until his eyes started to cross he yawned and slid his glasses back on the table beside his bed you ought to have a cat name you know so that i dontgive away who you are boots maybe she started to purr against him boots it is then staying here all night he stretched and felt her slide into place beside him not wanting her to have to resettle he turned on his side and cupped her body between his chest and knees it was nice if a bit strange to know that his girlfriend was here even if she was furry and had a tail g night boots he whispered mind drifting to years past when as a boy in the closet under the stairs he had wished for a pet harry fell asleep to the sound of purring and the feel of soft paws flexing and pushing gently against his chest he slept better than he had in weeks when he woke boots was gone and madame pomfrey was standing by his bedside with a draught of medicine to start the day far from well harry spent most of that day recuperating welcoming ron back to the land of the living and apologizing many times for sucking half the life out of his best friend not your fault mate ron said cheerfully though his freckled face was still far too wan for a real smile bill was the one who started the whole thing this summer remember that drop of blood you gave to him so he could do that test to see how far you d recovered yeah well he took two drops one for the test and one to set up the bodyguard spell or no wait i think it was three actually one for the test one for the bodyguard spell and one so charlie could charm that kidney stone so we d know how you are all the time without me even noticing obviously you dont you know bill very well george put in from grinning the twins ginny and hermione had come in to see harry and ron leftovers from breakfast in hand if he doesntwant you to notice something you don t how else do you think he got to be head boy harry shook his head and his gaze naturally moved over to ginny who was pale but gave him a brief secretive smile so how many slytherins did you say got expelled harry looked over at hermione she was feeding ron a pudding twelve but dont get too excited none of them were the ones who should have been expelled and there were ten gryffindors six ravenclaws and three hufflepuffs as well they expelled anyone who d thrown dangerous curses during the fighting the ones who threw defensive shields or basic defensive hexes didntget expelled or yours truly would have been gone fred spoke up and most of the other weasleys as well at least the ones that were conscious ginny growled then turned to glare at harry and by the way why is it that when you were passing out those spiffy little hand gestures to everyone before i was the only one who didntget one if i d had one then you would ve know it was me from the get go instead of following crabbe as me into a dark and steamy alley harry stared at her mouth slightly open she was right he d never given her a sign to give him whenever they met so he would know it was her and all the others had been forgetting to do theirs you re right i should have i sorry of course you are harry took a deep breath and i sorry for not being grateful for the bodyguard spell there was a marked silence in the room and harry couldntmeet anyone eyes he d already said it to ginny but he knew the rest of them deserved to hear some of it too it in the uncomfortable silence that followed harry blinked his eyes several times hoping they would dry out and then he found his lap full of ginny she threw her arms around him and pressed her face into his neck we know she whispered you donthave to say it harry hugged her back tucking her head under his chin and reveling in the feeling of peace she brought just by her nearness she felt so small and he once again vowed to keep her safe which meant confusingly enough partly keeping himself safe odd i know what my sign should be she said nuzzling against his neck i ll just say this meow harry felt a zinging heat go through him at the sudden reminder of the dream remembering rather uncomfortably now since her brothers were in the room that the dream had ended with her undressed and if i cantsay it out loud i ll just mouth it perfect harry whispered back in a husky voice breathing in the fresh scent of her faintly damp just shampooed hair there was more nuzzling but as a mass exodus took place and ron discreetly took a slow turn around the room limiting himself to one disgusted noise on the way no one was witness to the sweet slow kisses that marked harry true return to the land of the living and reminded him of exactly why it was so so very good to be alive he fairly floated through the afternoon as ginny kept him company helping with water or whatever he needed giving him a lingering kiss whenever he looked too pale or seemed to need it he might have pretended one or two of those times but who could blame him life was good that is until that night just after supper when hermione arrived at the infirmary breathless and waving a daily prophet you re not going to believe this i dontlike the sound of that ginny said sitting up in the chair beside harry bed and putting away her transfiguration text harry was perfectly happy to halt his wizarding chess game where he d been getting spanked by ron what is it cantit wait ron groused in response hermione tossed down the paper and waited hands on hips harry read with mounting disbelief poppycock and you can quote me on that this quote comes directly from the wizarding prime minister cornelius fudge who was incensed at the rumors that harry potter the wizarding world youngest and most beloved hero has again survived the killing curse impossible shouted the minister as he was followed by this reporter following a speaking engagement at the royal bramblebury peppermint league annual bazaar absolute balderdash what sort of nincompoop would believe an idiotic story like that the boy gone mad trying to put that over on us mad the report came from head auror claude fornier who watched the minister slight tantrum with a sardonic smile and said only i believe it to be the truth minister you might want to revise your statement the minister turned to this reporter and said poppycock and you can quote me on that after the minister had been bustled away by a contingent of aurors mr fornier stayed behind to explain the facts behind the rumors first hand he saw the disastrous results of a duel between harry potter and classmate vincent crabbe crabbe son of brody crabbe of hanglington heights was dead on the scene the victim of not a spell of potter s but of his own deflected killing curse potter did not send the killing curse fornier a tall dark and handsome wizard said decisively we investigated that possibility right away of course who would want their hero running around killing students that a recipe for disaster as it is parents who send their children to hogwarts are in arms over the previous deaths of two slytherin students this term all in some connection with potter some connection with potter ginny interrupted what the bloody hell is he up to he knows narcissa killed pansy he was here when she was caught ginny eyes blazed at harry yeah ron echoed loudly what he doin harry folded up the paper and banged it down on the table pulled across his bed causing one of his pieces to topple the small black knight straightened himself huffing loudly and rather melodramatically i have no idea what fornier game is but he got his own agenda that for sure harry then confided in his friends about draco debilitating visit to the auror office hermione made a hmmming sound that makes no sense fornier is questioning your innocence in the paper but then while he at hogwarts he ignores you and spends his time working draco over yeah doesntmake much sense but finally an auror with his priorities straight ron barked out a laugh maybe he only waiting until i out of the infirmary to work me over just let him try ginny snapped and harry smiled at her briefly before moving on has fornier called other students in yes all those who were expelled all the slytherins and a few others mostly prefects hermione added neville and i were called in right away mostly to answer questions about your behavior toward the slytherins before and after the deaths occurred all the slytherins yeah i think he doing a brilliant job shaking up all those nasty slytherins maybe he ll force the seven death eaters in training to give up ron said eyebrows raised i still say it not a bad thing to go after draco like that ron draco completely helpless right now hermione chided him someone should tell the headmaster about this dobby already has harry assured her i sure professor dumbledore will put a stop to it i wish he d put a stop to the bloody sdses ron groused how many more of them are there three no there are four hermione corrected ginny how do you figure that well let start at the beginning we know that the sdses are going down the list of the seven deadly sins hermione began pansy was lust goyle was greed crabbe was gluttony oh i get it ron nodded thoughtfully cause it was with a cupcake and blaise attempt with anger ginny said pointedly that makes four yeah ron chimed in er no harry hesitantly broke in i dontthink blaise has had his attempt yet what ron exploded then what the bloody hell was all that with tobias they had you surrounded but nobody threw the killing curse did they and besides that blaise said himself it was just to get me off balance make me angry worked ron observed are you sure he didntjust muff his attempt and say all that to play it off ginny said despairingly pretty sure very sure hermione added let not forget if he d tried and failed already he would be dead ginny sighed and slid her hand inside harry s you re right of course but blaise has been expelled for all we know he is dead after all it took us a while to find out about goyle everyone exchanged startled looks at least for now blaise isnthere and his plans must have been at the very least derailed so perhaps there will only be three after all possibly hermione agreed then went on the four remaining deadly sins are anger sloth pride and envy sloth isntthat one of them things that hangs on by its claws to the trees and moves slower than mad eye moody on the toilet one of them is going to try to kill harry now ron looked from one face to the next what that a sloth i know it is sloth dear brother means laziness ginny leaned across harry to say ron stared at her so someone going to try to kill harry by being lazy how does that work harry was grinning you know i think i might be able to handle that attempt the point ron is that laziness or sloth hermione said pointedly is a sin according to the church and the penalty for it as well as all sin is death i not sure what the slytherins will make of that in their plans but then i dontsee how envy could be deadly either yeah but look at pansy she managed to make lust deadly didntshe and completely miserable for harry as well ron added i would ve thought that at least that one would have been fun damn slytherins the day that harry and ron were to be allowed back to their dormitory dawned bright and cold foreshadowing the gentlest beginnings of winter classes had again been interrupted but were to resume the next day harry spent the day in restless rest gladly gathering his things together when madame pomfrey finally declared both ron and him fit a few minutes later harry was surprised to see professor dumbledore arrive at his bedside is something wrong headmaster oh no harry everything is as well as can be expected i am merely here to see you safely to your room harry eyes grew wide and he looked over at ron to see if his mate had any idea of what was happening ron shrugged we re here called hermione voice from over by the door and suddenly the infirmary boasted a dozen more students with bright smiles all gryffindors hermione ginny fred and george dean neville katie and the rest of the quidditch team were standing there wands at the ready ginny came over to the beds nonchalantly so ron harry feel up to a walk what going on nothing she lied and picked up his schoolbooks i can carry those on my own he objected reaching for them but she stepped smartly away dontworry i not carrying them wouldntwant to hurt your precious ego she said quietly so only he could hear the boys wanted to help she moved back to the door and passed out his books to the gryffindor boys come on harry we haventgot all night katie said loudly but with a smile professor dumbledore smiled at harry both of you follow me and we will give those slytherins something to think about again harry and ron exchanged a quick questioning look ron gestured for harry to lead and he did taking a deep breath and picking up his bag of toiletries and such the other gryffindors greeted him and let him pass through only to re form in an arrowhead once they were all through the doors the two unfamiliar wizards who had apparently been standing at the door followed immediately behind professor dumbledore and harry walked behind them flanked by fred and george behind him was ron flanked by hermione and ginny past them came the rest of their friends the entire group had their wands out and at the ready harry flexed his wrist and his wand popped out the poison antidote still rested reassuringly tight around his left bicep he felt ready but was soon overwhelmed at the first stairwell the d a stood lined up against the wall each of them nodded at harry and joined the group at the rear as they passed harry looked back to see the large group stretching back like a parade all they needed was muggle commentators and a purple dinosaur float it seemed funny and a bit unnecessary to harry until they hit the ground floor and headed toward the great hall students who had been walking purposefully in one direction or another suddenly stopped and stared open mouthed at the sight of professor dumbledore leading a procession wand out and forward it harry he began to hear repeated over and over in whispers and shouts look a disturbance up by the great hall turned out to be a groundswell of students rushing out to see them he all right harry harry the shouts grew to a roar the atrium began to fill and just as harry was beginning to panic a bright sizzling beacon of light burst forth from the tip of headmaster wand painting the walls and all those beneath them a brilliant blinding white students froze and cries died in their throats as the light slowly faded to a glow an unnatural silence fell spreading backwards into the great hall itself not a sound was made everyone blinked trying to see again and harry felt the twins reach for him making sure of his presence i fine he breathed though it was several moments before he could see normally again around the procession the students looked stunned but still intensely interested in harry presence slowly professor dumbledore began to move forward again and the tide of faces fell away as silently as the wind bows a field of wheat harry half wanted to apologize but didntdare break the silence a group of slytherins stood frozen by the doors to the great hall watching with emotionless faces as harry walked by draco alone among them kept his eyes down the long hallway seemed even longer than normal and harry was relieved to finally reach the stairs the headmaster continued the way up his light steady his figure strong and the parade of followers followed as they reached the third flight harry suddenly realized why he hadntseen any other gryffindors along the way up ahead stretching from the fourth floor stairs and up as far as he could see his housemates lined the path for the first time a smile lit his face and a lump large as a bezoar stuck in his throat as soon as the headmaster reached the first gryffindor they all started cheering harry found himself shaking hands that reached around fred and george and calling out thanks again and again the gryffindors all piled around the parade until it began to get dangerously crowded all along the stairs harry had to be pushed up ahead by fred and george just to squeeze through at the top the clamouring and cheering only grew louder as they approached the common room door as the hallway was lined by harry house mates as well at the door dumbledore stepped back and gave harry a smile he looked winded but there was the light of pride in his eyes welcome home harry you ll be very safe here now you have my word on it harry who was feeling a very disturbing mix of elation exuberance pride and teary eyed gladness at being welcomed so heartily simply nodded as words were so far beyond him he did that most of the rest of the night at the welcoming party and afterwards in the dorm room it was a great party full of too much food and no talk of anything serious but there were two very surprising moments first when tobias stepped up to harry manfully and shook his hand all the while choking out thanks and sorrys and glad you re okays so rapidly that harry nearly laughed once he understood him but tousled his hair fondly instead and second katie announcement tobias stepped away to tame his hair just as katie called for attention from up on the first landing of the stairs once everyone head was turned her way she yelled that she was back to captain the quidditch team deafening cheers resounded across the common room she then welcomed harry and ron back and confessed it was their near death experience that had prompted her to forgive ron completely ron thanked her and said he was ready to follow orders yelled or not the whoops and hollers following soon lead to excited speculation about the season and how the team would fare in their first match of the season against ravenclaw as the conversation ran down harry found himself once again accosted by tobias this time with a steadier more determined look in his brown eyes what i meant to say before was that i glad you re okay harry and i sorry for not thanking you for helping me before i was just a bit messed up you know of course harry hastened to say i do understand really it fine and i promise to watch your back like you asked at the beginning of the year in that speech i determined to help you like you helped me i promise it that important to me harry wanted to sigh at another promise to protect him it was really beginning to be quite a burden to be so well looked after but he managed to smile and say thanks tobias grinned said thanks in return again and went off out of sight harry was glad the first year was finding his feet again he really was but he truly truly hoped the boy would be nowhere near him if when the sdses struck again exhaustion suddenly came calling and harry could stave off the inevitable no longer he tried to conjure a moment alone with ginny but that all it was the barest of moments with a good night kiss at the end any lingering elation immediately deflated when he came in and saw seamus empty bed he threw a pretty vicious bludgeoning curse at bulstrode after she bragged that you were dead dean explained soberly wish i d been mad enough to do it too glad you re both back yeah it been awful with all three of you gone neville put in ron and harry put their things away surprised to hear from their dorm mates that besides those gryffindors missing because of suspension more students had been pulled out of school by nervous parents over the past few days including the patil twins and violet hooch harry hadnt even noticed their absence in the all the clamour but he felt the worst about seamus despite that it was a relief for the boys to be back in their familiar beds and it was easy to fall asleep dobby again woke harry to report but had nothing new on draco condition the boy had remained in his room for most of the day until dinner when harry had seen him the only person who had gone in his room was millicent bulstrode not a good sign harry was going to have to find a way to communicate with draco but finding a way to do that unobserved was a puzzle especially since there were now aurors roaming the halls harry wasntsure whether to feel oppressed or heartened by the presence of the men and women in charcoal gray robes wands at the ready several of them nodded at him on his way to breakfast as if they d been watching particularly for him dumbledore seemed very serious about harry safety now but to that end what neither harry nor any of his friends could figure out was how none of the remaining seven deadly slytherins had gotten kicked out i dead sure seamus only threw that bludgeoning curse because millicent nearly hit him with one herself dean spoke up at breakfast yeah and if fornier not here to get rid of the slytherins then what the bloody hell is the point ron said pausing to yawn widely ginny grinned well maybe he likes tap dancing around the great hall laughter spread down the table it was true that claude fornier walk was just odd enough to make his footfalls in the great hall sound like irish dancing each time going toe heel toe heel toe heel as he went draco looks terrible this morning hermione observed no dontlook at him all at once but do take a look when you can harry waited a moment and then glanced at the slytherins table oddly enough one of the twitchtie girls was sitting on the end closest to draco in direct opposition to the usual hierarchy of slytherin eating habits a first year eating with a sixth year draco himself looked ill and jittery and was staring down at the table as if he expected to be devoured by it at any second whatever fornier was doing to him it was working the twitchtie girl was chewing her food thoughtfully and surreptitiously watching draco why on the other side of draco milicent nott and hughes harry clued back into the conversation just as ginny was getting on ron has it ever occurred to you that he has just as much information about harry and how he avoided the past attempts as he does about the sdses if draco tells fornier everything it could be really bad bad for who ron insisted harry draco or the sdses harry but he isnt going after harry not yet hermione mused why would he harry hasntdone anything wrong fornier an auror neville continued hesitatingly isnthe one of the good wizards silence reigned at the table for a long moment and several of them turned to look up at the head table where fornier was engrossed in an apparently amusing discussion with trelawney the dark man smoothed his beard and then reached for his glass of wine we hope so harry finally summed up but we know they can be compromised hermione reminded them after all it was kingsley shackelbolt who helped the death eaters tear down the protection at privet drive this summer remember bloo dy hell i knew it wasnta good sign when the defense teacher ended up being a sweet old lady who worships the ground harry walks on ron said morosely i knew it meant someone else was going to show up later on and do bad bad things but at least he started with draco that something ron really this is hermione began when she was interrupted by ginny wait what he up to ginny pointed back at the teachers table claude fornier had just rounded the teachers table and was tapping his strange toe heel toe heel way to the front of the room a few giggles spread around the room bringing a frown to fornier face he raised his hands for silence and got it as i have stated to you in my previous talks some additional safety measures need to be taken in order for this school to operate safely professor dumbledore has graciously allowed me to rule on a very important decision just this morning this year he lingered over the words quidditch has been cancelled harry had been contemplating the fact that he had apparently missed some previous fornier safety chats when the man last words finally sank in the announcement met with a stunned silence followed by a loud widespread outcry what for the gryffindors who had just secured katie return to captaining this was especially horrific and as harry listened to fornier lilting accent explain the needed security crackdown something just snapped harry stood up no with that one word he secured the attention of the entire student body they swiveled as one to stare at him pardon me harry potter is there something you would like to say yes dontcancel quidditch the man shook his head as though he had misunderstood him then turned to the headmaster i assure you professor dumbledore that this is a necessary step in protecting me harry interrupted then let me assure you it not necessary alas the entire world does not revolve around you and your ego the dark man returned with a snide smile and a ripple of gasps went around the room nor does it revolve around yours mr fornier professor dumbledore stood to his feet at the head table and turned to harry enough of this what is it you would like to say harry you certainly deserve our attention harry took a deep breath and exhaled trying to think of the right words but they wouldntcome i tired of being the reason everything is turned upside down we ve worked hard these few months all of the teams have despite all of the turmoil we deserve the chance to play and yet as the ministry appointed head of security here at hogwarts i have the authority to make rules as i see fit fornier growled no quidditch potter no matter how much you whinge there were more gasps around but harry only felt his gaze upon fornier sharper intensely at the dig this was all so familiar hadntthe ministry learned anything by now mr fornier you are testing my patience professor dumbledore said softly but now harry knew exactly what to say to the head auror go ahead cancel the quidditch season but i warn you we ll play anyway the same games the same teams without official school sanction maybe without a few of the less popular rules some students around him cheered but harry only saw the narrowing of fornier eyes i dontknow which sounds more dangerous to you fornier said nothing just took a look at the students and then back over to dumbledore who was smiling nicely put mr potter now mr fornier we will allow you to make as many security requirements on the field and the players as you deem necessary within reason of course but i think we will nay we must allow the quidditch season to go on as planned a cheer went up in the great hall and fornier tap danced his way out author note thanks for your patience one and all there are only six chapters left and they should come at more regular intervals now with plenty of action to take us through to the end you are all fantastic thanks for the support ash chapter twenty three pride goeth before a fall during the next two weeks the gryffindors rode the wave of delirious all consuming insurrection with amazing single mindedness katie was back at captain harry and ron were back at practice completely healthy and there was additional joy of knowing that every time they practiced they were figuratively thumbing their nose at head auror fornier the man was a dark fountain of menace everywhere he went snapping orders at the aurors questioning students ad nauseum and performing random searches of students property no matter which house they were in if one house received more scrutiny than any other it was the slytherins fornier much to ron increasing sense of joy pounced on draco as mercilessly as a hunting owl with an empty stomach draco for his part did a fairly good imitation of a small rodent frozen in fear he took whatever the head auror dished out as silently as possible never even looking the man in the eye i telling you something not right hermione hissed as they passed draco suffering yet again through a bag search with fornier in his face harry gave up trying to catch draco eye and as they rounded the corner pulled ginny hand up to his face to rub it against his cheek he d found that it helped unwind the tight knot in his stomach what had he done before ginny she squeezed his hand before turning to hermione so you want the slytherins to go parading around with god knows what in their bags knowing that they re planning at least three more attempts on harry life hermione gave ginny a scowl of course not i glad they re being searched but it just doesntadd up why is he harassing harry too if he here to protect him this was something harry had been kicking around and growing angrier over himself his bag had been searched every day this week even if not as often as draco s at first i thought it was only to make it look as if fornier wasntplaying favorites but now he gone beyond that he made harry late for potions twice this week yeah it lucky snape is still being so so ron trailed off with a grimace rather than giving harry detention for being late as he would have any other year snape had merely forced a ghastly smile and continued on with his lesson even hermione had missed taking notes for the next few minutes as she along with the entire class sought to find familiar ground to stand on harry had noticed ron hadntclosed his mouth afterward for a full five minutes he d tried to but it just sort of fell back open again ron shuddered then went on i dunno about fornier seems to me he may be searching your bag to see if you ve been pulling some of the pranks due to several sets of unfortunate circumstances fornier was now finding himself in a stew of rather well seasoned mutiny first off he had impeccably bad timing coming to hogwarts the year after dolores umbridge thus the students were already disposed to begrudge fornier any power given him by the ministry also harry had begun this year slightly more inclined to revolt than usual given the summer he d had which in addition to having fought off many death attempts while back at school had only made the drive stronger then it is necessary to factor in that the attacks by the slytherins had only made the students in majority more sympathetic to harry they hated to see him further harassed and responded accordingly now to cap it all off fred and george were back at hogwarts now put all these circumstances in a blender with steamed milk and out comes an amazing frothy fornier is going down frappe enjoy the day after harry quidditch revolt the great hall had somehow become inundated with small toy snitches that amused the students by whizzing about and chirping the hogwarts school song as brilliant as the trick was and as wonderful as it was to see fornier trying his hardest to ignore the bright balls darting about professor dumbledore ended the mischief with a wave of his hand as the snitches fell students scrambled to catch them excited to see that they each contained a small prize inside crunchy chocolate snowmen that showed an unusual resemblance to auror fornier and made the sound of tap dancing when eaten by that evening a nice basket of the chocolates ended up on fornier desk sent with love from a secret admirer often credited to one or more of the weasleys though they never confessed once the ball got rolling fornier owl was loaded down every morning with pictures cards and small chocolates from many secret admirers at first the auror had the nerve to be flattered and walked around with a smug but slightly alarmed look on his face then after a few more letters he grew disturbed ultimately he became paranoid though the headmaster convinced him nothing could be done to discourage students from expressing their thanks and devotion to a public figure such as himself by the beginning of the second week fornier became more aggressive with his searches and more distracted scanning the students with a new nervous tic in his left eye which made him look like he was winking ginny was naturally the first to take advantage of this new weakness after lunch one day she sought fornier out as harry and the others watched from around the corner did you want to see me sir she asked brightly he eyed her up and down as though she was a particularly venomous specimen of a doxy no no not at all go on to class miss weasley are you sure you dontwant to see me now quite sure now move on she smiled coyly did you maybe want to see me in private later merlin child no of course not ginny looked so innocent and heartbroken as fornier shooed her away that harry had to physically hold ron up he was laughing that hard and that was the beginning of the winkers the name for various and sundry students who plagued fornier claiming that he must have winked at them for some reason hermione was finally able to schedule a meeting with the headmaster and reported back to harry and ron that the d a galleons were now fully operative portkeys with the destination of dumbledore office it about bloody well time ron groused but how d he do it for all of them when they re still in our pockets the protean charm i put on them was strong enough to carry it hermione replied demurely well done hermione harry said in such obvious relief that the others both looked at him you ve no idea what a load off my mind that is knowing that if something happens to that if you need to all of you can get to safety brilliant work really harry thought he saw a flicker of worry in the looks they exchanged so he quickly moved on to quidditch talk gryffindor after all was getting ready for the first quidditch match of the year the season that harry saved from being wiped out by fornier they had practice each night hours on end to try all the new plays katie had researched during her time off for the team i had to do something with all that spare time she d laughed when ron stared at her plans with his eyes bulging by thursday night of that second week they had added all the new plays to their repertoire and even ron was satisfied with the variety if i d only known ron faded off his eyes dreamy as he stared into the fire sprawled out on the couch clean and rumpled after his shower harry who was likewise clean and leaning back against ginny on the couch as she fluffed his slightly damp hair looked at ron curiously but was too comfortable to speak hermione reading in the wing chair opposite had no such problem yes see there was no need for you to be so rude to katie you should learn to control your temper ron wha no he sat up and turned to stare at her i meant that if i d only known she d do all this if i got her mad enough i d have pissed her off sooner harry whose mind had been preoccupied with a long brown paper wrapped package that hadnt arrived yet fell back to musing it had taken some doing which included but was not limited to bribing filch with information partially true about how the slytherins had been behind some of the pranks against fornier ensuring that ginny was not his bodyguard tomorrow afternoon and figuring out a way to keep from being searched by fornier in the hallway while he was in route at last he thought he had it all worked out after classes on friday harry obeyed the expected summons to filch office using luna and neville as look outs and decoys so that he and ron could get bypass fornier and his gang of aurors neville actually had to submit to being searched himself and harry promised himself that he would pay his friend back somehow and as he stood back outside filch office long brown paper wrapped package in hand he didntbegrudge filch the extra five galleons he d had to pay nor the trouble getting it here it would have been easier if he could have just bought it from katie kwidditch keeper but with all the trouble crabbe had brought with his killing curse and all the pandemonium afterwards the brooms had been sent back to get checked for damage or curses but now it was here and ginny was going to love it heading back to the common room harry draped his invisibility cloak over the package and floated it behind him once more luna and neville went in front of them with no trouble this time getting the gift past ginny was going to be a problem though one at a time he and ron went though the additional security at the common room door hardly noticed it now and were surprised to see violet hooch standing in a circle of gryffindors ron and harry exchanged looks violet was giving ginny a hug apparently having just returned hermione as prefect was standing with violet papers in hand glad you re back tobias said as ginny stepped back i thought your mum wasnt keen on you staying violet shrugged it was my aunt that got me back here madame hooch rocks someone yelled she rocks hard violet agreed spiking hair shaking vibrantly mum was being so boring about the whole thing you ll be killed it too dangerous i kept telling her that it only slytherins that are dying and that only because they keep messing with harry damn straight fred agreed loudly to the cheers of the other gryffindors no one messes with harry and gets away with it more cheers harry who was nearly hiding now back behind ron thumped his friend hard when he began cheering too oy but ron caught the hint and turned and headed up the stairs letting harry step in front of him to hide the view from behind and below dean who was coming down the stairs looked disgruntled and only waved as harry greeted him unfortunately harry wasntwatching where his invisible package was pointing as it was very long and very invisible and dean hunched over with a sudden pain filled grunt harry was shoved back into ron who got poked with the other end of the package and nearly went off the stairs what the bloody hell was that dean ground out sitting painfully on the stair sorry mate harry whipped the package up vertically and hastened to dean side present for ginny sorry course dean spat out course the present you buy for ginny just has to rack me in the balls why settle for just figurative harry froze what what d you mean ron who had been busy grousing as well stood below them peering up at dean yeah what that supposed to mean dean looked down and struggled to his feet nothing he finally got out breathing heavily he gripped the railing all the way down moving slowly amid the laughter and chattering of the group down below ron and harry exchanged uneasy looks and watched him go hey harry tobias called up to him the whole group turned and harry saw by ginny mocking glance that she had known he was trying to sneak by her harry greeted the group and welcomed violet back when he looked back at ginny she raised her eyebrows and nodded toward dean as if to say what the hell was that harry shrugged and moved the invisibility cloak ed package behind him ron grabbed him and called down below harry split his pants gotta change harry froze and stifled his protest then let himself be hustled upstairs turning slightly pink as laughter followed them all the way up getting too big for your britches potter fred called up the laughter was broken by a single clear voice in some places fred dear ginny said suggestively but then you wouldntknow about that would you the stunned silence broke out into raucous hilarity and harry went all the way to bright burning red unfortunately by staying upstairs and hoping the furor would die down he gave the twins ample time to come up with more material and found when he finally emerged from the dorm room that he now had a new title the one with the big one and ginny instead of joining harry in his perpetually embarrassed state had the nerve to look smug the day of the quidditch match dawned cheerless and cold a stiff breeze whistled through the halls of hogwarts and everyone thoughts lingered on winter before jumping full tilt toward the ravenclaw versus gryffindor match in late morning it was easy to tell because charmed everlasting snowflakes had been set to follow fornier around changing into roaring lions if hexed his retreat from breakfast that morning was not nearly as dignified as usual between his tap dancing dodging snowflakes yelling at the other aurors to hex them and lions roaring every time they tried professor mcgonagall seemed to like them as she merrily joined in reassuring that she could get rid of the things and then causing more roars than any of the aurors as her hexes never seemed to actually get rid of them all in all it was with a light heart that everyone turned out to the quidditch pitch set against a blue sky the palest shade of perwinkle the stadium was awash with colorful banners and flags waving in the playful breeze the line of students filing out to the pitch was marked by aurors at every thirty meters or so and joined by many additional witches and wizards all family members seeking to support their players or seeking reassurance that hogwarts was safe dumbledore had welcomed them all indeed a large smoke written message gathered above the pitch harry leading the team to the locker room was surprised to see it forming above welcome parents students and distinguished guests to the first quidditch match of the season distinguished guests my arse ron muttered i hope he not putting fornier in that group should have read welcome parents students distinguished guests and extreme mental cases ginny said the atmosphere was noticeably less buoyant in the locker room after everyone was dressed katie rattled off the list of plays in the playbook reminding the key players of their moves and the mental counts that went with them timing was everything in quidditch which was why harry had chosen this moment as soon as katie was through and everyone was well into their last five minutes before a game routine harry pulled ginny aside they stepped over behind a row of lockers and ginny smiled up at him her eyes narrowed the dimple on her left cheek making an appearance you ve been acting funny all morning for the last few days actually what going on harry looked down at his shoes and swallowed all the words he had planned suddenly spinning away like a snitches in mid flight ginny nudged him now dontdo that it just me you prat i know it just he took a deep breath i dontknow if you ll get mad at me or not if you donttell me then i really will get mad here harry reached behind him into an unoccupied locker and pulled out the brown paper wrapped parcel it was long and decidedly broom like in shape and ginny mouth formed a small o she dropped to the bench and started ripping off the paper oh if you you canthave oh you did she cried out and then gasped in a huge breath again a firebolt beam the awe in her voice and the look of rapture on her face gave harry a warm squishy feeling he d not often had she liked it harry katie commanding voice barked from across the room she cantfly on that today it a new broom it may throw her entire game off harry blinked but that simply had not occurred to him ginny stood slowly and stiffly in front of harry i can fly on any broom thank you katie thank you harry i love it then with a hug she dropped her formal tone and whispered in his hear and i love you i ll give you a better thank you later harry went hot all over sweat prickling in interesting places and then managed to choke out i glad you like it she pecked him on the cheek and then faced the team brightly everyone ready to go harry walked to the center of the room and stretched his hand out go he said forcefully the beginning of the ritual he had begun during his brief time of captaining in katie absence the others moved in to form a circle broom in one hand the other placed on top of harry s each saying go when all had joined in they pumped their hands in time with the words go go gryffindor go the students roared as the gryffindors took the pitch and here is the gryffindor quidditch team potter weasley weasley bell new chaser hoffman new beater grady and other new beater headly katie who had turned to face the gryffindor crowd paused and grabbed at ginny isnt that your mum where there beside that man oh that your father isntit nice red hair should have known oh yeah that dad dad mum she waved like mad look ron harry it mum and dad bugger it is ron went a bit pale and i didnteven know but it a good thing they re here ron right ginny prodded him well yeah but i didnteven have time to get ready you know which is probably why they didnttell us they d be here they knew you d have more time to get nervous just wave you clot harry waved as well and smiled to see them finally wave back ginny turned and gave harry a peck on the cheek break a broomstick love the gryffindors all went oooooooooo and harry turned bright red you as well he squeezed her hand and then watched her mount her broom and rise with the other gryffindors ron gave him a shaky wave and took off the big mystery today is whether or not this team which has been patched together so many times as potter has grown from first year seeker to sixth year can pull together to offset the sleek stylings of the ravenclaw team which returns this year in its entirety the ravenclaw team was already up and flying except for their captain and seeker cho chang madame hooch and cho waited for him as katie had left his name as co captain on the roster at mid field harry jogged over noticing how cho eyes were drilling into his own it will be an interesting match ravenclaw had a mediocre season last year but having all of the same players should have given them time to improve and word in the hallway is that improve is a weak word to describe what they ve been doing hello mr potter madame hooch said are you feeling well yes ma am and my team is ready catch that fantastic move by fourth year neal mcdonald what a woollongong shimmy look out gryffindor chasers this boy has been doing his homework very well and miss chang are you feeling well today yes ma am and your team the professor went on are they feeling well and ready to fly they are feeling ready to win cho gave harry a sideways look with a small smile harry grinned see you in the air on the gryffindor side of the field let me direct your attention to the always breath taking ginny weasley beautiful on the field and in the air harry stood there one arm on his broom the other hand clenched in a fist by his side and frowned up at the table where the new commentator was seated a fourth year hufflepuff named brian moss i must say that i glad to see her spread her wings as chaser this year i always felt that the seeker position was best held by potter and i glad that he back out there standing on the field staring at me for some reason what he called down to harry did i say something wrong there was muttered whispering from a smaller figure beside brian and then his very sheepish voice came back on let me amend my earlier statement to say the always breath taking and of course already taken ginny weasley who seems to be spinning around the pitch on the newest broom from the firebolt line the beam rumor has it that the broom was a gift from her very possessive and er very powerful boyfriend harry potter himself i sure all of gryffindor will be glad of that gift by the end of the game today there was the noise of a throat being cleared how was that harry harry gave the box one more glare and then lifted off madame hooch whistle blew just as he got into place below him the players zipped into action and the roar of the crowd picked up harry automatically began scanning the pitch his eyes working in the natural rhythm he had developed over the years for a moment he tuned into the running commentary ravenclaw is on the offensive at the start of the game today which is only appropriate seeing as they ll need every scoring opportunity available to try and best potter and his sturdy team of gryffindors more whispering from the commentary box then another voice came on i think it time that a girl gave some commentary a cheer went up from the stands mostly from the girls i cantbelieve you called the gryffindors sturdy you make them all sound plump or something harry couldnthelp smiling as brian came back on er this is my girlfriend brian the word is girlfriend right er this is my girlfriend winnie condalary and she thinks it would be good to get a girl perspective on the game and so do some of the faculty so yes i do for one thing the gryffindors are not sturdy at all all of them are whip thin except for that huge bear of a keeper they have ron weasley and then the colors of the uniform all that leather trimmed in gold well let me just say right now that no girl out here is thinking sturdy when she looks at all those gryffindor wizards win nie oh you can talk about ginny but if i so much as mention the boys you what that professor flitwick oh right sorry anyway the ravenclaw team looks to be surprisingly good this year i suppose you d say something boring like they re dependable well i might yes but which they aren t they only won two games last year they tend to be a bit uneven with some brilliant moves by cho the darling captain of the team and a trio of very strong chasers which you can see in action at this very moment yes they are moving toward scoring position keeping weasley on his toes and what that trevor marsh swoops in and pins weasley against the hoop harry did a quick one eighty and watched in disbelief as ron shoved hard back against the ravenclaw player and pulled away from the goal hoop the quaffle tossed by hughes went in but that got to be the worst bit of stooging i ve ever seen a whistle from madame hooch confirms the foul is weasley all right yes he all right but he looks pissed and ginny weasley pulls back to comfort him no wait she going after trevor marsh another whistle but she hasntfouled him yet a preemptive whistle harry watched with a mixture of alarm and pride as ginny hunted trevor down and pinned him against the lower wall of the stands hard the gryffindors went wild and madame hooch is giving a foul to each team what was weasley thinking winnie snorted she was thinking that marsh shouldntget away with it of course the two bickered back and forth until the action got going again harry who had been shaking his head over the commentary suddenly saw a flash of gold near the stands he was off like a shot the wind whistling in his ears the commentary and calls of his teammates coagulating into a dull roar the snitch shot off diagonally and harry stretched for it but it spun by out of reach behind him he heard cho go whistling by in full pursuit damn he jerked a turn and sped after her it a race to the snitch harry heard before the commentary became a blur again cho was just ahead of him the eddies from the tail of her broom creating turbulence in harry path he moved up slowly trying to get a better angle and more speed cho was almost there the snitch was a golden smear ahead harry put an extra burst of speed on and now he was with cho neck and neck he kept his eye on the snitch but saw her head turn his way for just a second the snitch dove and both of them careened downward breathlessly then without warning it flipped under and sped away below them harry vaulted his broom into a forward roll and slid to a stop facing the way the snitch had just sped away what a move by potter brian enthused has anyone ever seen that before i mean successfully done harry shook his head he d seen lots of players lose control of their broom that way harry dont do it who was that someone was screaming out of the crowd at him he looked over and saw hermione straining to get her voice to him she was holding her wand to her throat harry dont get the nice move harry cho called down to him speeding away after the snitch i think we ve just seen a new quidditch move perhaps one that will be named hereafter as the potter roll harry leaned down over his broom and flew like an arrow in the shallow trajectory the snitch had taken cantyou come up with a better name than that harry ignored the roar around him cho was ahead of him again she d nearly beaten him to the snitch once before and the memory of that near loss propelled him forward the snitch angled up straight through the middle of the pitch and harry found himself dodging ravenclaw chasers as they closed in on ron and the goal again using a hawkshead attacking formation this time well that new harry muttered the wind snatching away his words the chasers were reaching the goal area and two peeled away leaving trevor marsh alone with quaffle poised to toss it into a goal harry couldnt watch as the snitch took him back due east again toward the ravenclaw goals it moved back through the center goal and as harry and cho dodged the keeper they slowed down harry looked up down right and left but the golden glint was gone cho looking desperately angry gave harry a look and peeled away to the right harry stayed where he was hovering above the ravenclaw goals searching the sky he took a quick look at the score board no ravenclaw had not scored harry grinned ron was doing a great job the gryffindor section was going crazy his parents must be so proud har ry catch the snitch har ry catch the snitch they hadntdone that one in a while but it sounded a little strange like there was an extra syllable in it more like har ry dont catch the snitch what he looked over at the gryffindor section and saw them all waving frantically several voices went loud using a loudspeaker spell but they all competed for his attention and nothing sounded clear enough to understand especially with the commentary ongoing weasley just managed to dodge that bludger and now she moving back into position to no now where she going over to potter there she was flying frantically at him red hair flapping in the wind her face tense enough to make him instantly on edge something was wrong harry pulled up on level with her first she takes a go at cho cantchase her down so she turns on potter does anyone else understand this har ry hermione was trying again dont catch the snitch he looked over at her in disbelief what ginny slammed to a halt beside him her hand grabbing his broom and making them both rock pride she yelled then sucked in a breath dontget the snitch it a portkey we have to stop cho harry breathed out then looked up to see her single mindedly pursuing the speeding ball he touched ginny on the hand thanks and then took off his breath heaving his heart pounding he had to stop her otherwise not another charlie no ginny was beside him screaming at cho they flew all out players scattering around them the game ground to a halt but cho was up so high that she hadnt noticed her eyes were fixed on the snitch closer and closer harry drew he could almost reach her broom cho reached out her hand stretching toward the snitch no harry yelled donttouch it cho ginny screamed and the roar of other voices was at once deafening but cho had found what she wanted with a smile that harry could barely see she plucked the snitch from the air no harry yelled again cho gave a low barely heard gasp and then disappeared ginny and harry pulled up their brooms sharply staring at the empty air harry was frozen inside they ve got her he mumbled the death eaters then ginny was in front of him her broom nestled next to his legs touching her eyes boring into his i sure she carrying her d a galleon harry what but does she know about it of course harry we made sure all of the d a knew about it but kept it a secret she ll be okay she ll get away harry nodded still struggling to take in a decent breath all she has to do is say dumbledore office she ll remember and harry could see that ginny really thought it was true she wasntjust saying that i could use mine to go check she offered but i dontwant to leave you honestly who knows what going to and suddenly harry mind registered three things at once one people were shouting his name again two something dark and round was coming directly at him from the right side and three if he ducked that something was going to hit ginny harry she gasped harry dove and rolled sideways pushing ginny broom down and around a fraction of a second before she dove the fraction that meant the difference between safety and broken bones a bludger whistled by harry ginny yelled and he twisted to see the other bludger coming from behind another dive another roll this time with ginny splitting apart from harry and the other bludger had missed as well harry so many people were screaming his name that without looking he knew it was time to move again he shot ahead then rolled up and back in as narrow of an arc as he could make it coming up behind the bludger damn not again they d tampered with the bludgers how had they managed it last time it had broken his arm before it had been stopped but with two louder screams again harry senses spun outward and up one bludger coming down on him with a gut wrenching twist he avoided the hurtling ball only to find that the other had corrected its trajectory and was heading straight for his face diving would take him too far forward so harry rolled to the right and headed for the goal posts on the ravenclaw side from within the chaos of sounds yelling screams furious winds going by came the shrill sound of madame hooch whistle she was clearing the pitch good a few spells shot from fellow players at least one that looked as if had been from ron but the bludger was going so fast that it was nearly impossible to hit and an impedimenta that was spun from his right nearly connected with harry he swerved to avoid it then ducked to miss the goal post and sloth rolled right to avoid the next bludger attempt at least the stupid things werentgoing after anyone else not like the portkey not like cho this had to be another attempt from the slytherins they were piggy backing them now hoping if one didntwork he d be too distracted to cope with the next one coming so quickly fat chance he muttered as she swung wide to avoid trevor marsh who for some reason hadntmade it all the way down to the ground yet the bludger passed right by marsh and he spit out an impedimenta curse that actually connected actually connected and made the bludger go faster harry close to panic now flew even faster sensing the bludgers one coming from ahead and the other about to overtake him from behind he managed to get around the slower bludger and then both were after him the world went by in a blur a steady roar was in his ears tears leaked out of his eyes from the wind and he knew he was running out of pitch from behind him came a shout harry turned about in surprise charlie weasley was on a broom coming after him he hadnteven realized charlie had been there and going that fast charlie was shouting something harry looking past the bludgers and at charlie tried to hear past the wind what was he saying at this speed there probably wasntanyone else who could keep up harry jerked his broom down into a spectacular dive heading straight for the ground behind him he saw the bludger edging nearer nearer harry was slowing down bit by bit closing the space between them the stadium was steadily moving from a small indistinct blur to a large pool of noise and color now the ground was coming up fast and the fast bludger was right on his tail charlie had pulled off to the side still shouting the ground was rushing up at harry he was in the stadium down past the stands and staring at green grass before he began the wronkski feint almost too late he pulled up as hard as he could feeling the strain against his arms the pull of gravity on his broom with a loud concussion the fast bludger hit the earth behind him harry pulled up and away and the slower bludger swerved to follow good move harry charlie was suddenly keeping pace leaning hard over ginny new broom yelling into the wind harry just nodded breathing too hard to speak his arms were trembling listen there are five d a members up on brooms all of them with portkeys just ditch the bludger spin around and try to slow down before you make contact it will take both of you to dumbledore office harry gave him a thumbs up sign evacuate the crowd i may not be able to keep it out of the stands i on it you re doing great harry dontworry about us charlie slowed and was behind him in an instant the only way to get rid of the bludger was to run it into something but it was too agile to hit goal posts and he couldntdraw it into the stands until the crowd was clear that would take another minute or two and harry was tiring fast it took enormous concentration and energy to keep going at such high speeds he looped around the gryffindor goal posts and headed back the other way seeing for the first time the d a members on brooms he knew who he would aim for ron was the only one he trusted to handle the impact of having harry hurtle himself at him he would try and slow down before making contact but it might not be possible damn he sped past the first student who was too small to be ron and the second who had dark hair dean behind him the bludger was closing in harry sped up saw that ron was ahead on the left and swerved right the bludger followed him and curved around as harry followed the wall of the stadium the stadium was emptying of students good suddenly harry was back up beside ron he shot straight up and the bludger slowed momentarily to change trajectories harry took advantage and swung around before diving straight down the bludger slowed again to follow harry did a corkscrew and swung out of it below ron shooting straight up one more time he pulled back on his broom to slow it feeling the vibrations as the magical energy fought with his momentum below him the bludger slowed and followed harry was just above ron when he let go of his broom he was already falling when ron jumped up to catch him and there was a tremendous collision somehow ron managed to get hold of harry yelling dumbledore office they were falling but then came a sharp tug from behind harry navel and the usual disorienting roll of darkness and light spun over them the pitch was gone the bludger left behind harry slumped with relief though he hated portkeys hated the places they took him and the way tom always seemed to be in control but almost anything was preferable to being beaten to death by crazed bludgers unless no harry whispered as the light touch of something dark whispered by his mind wha ron never got to finish his question with a hard jerk that snapped harry neck the forward propulsion stopped just as if he d been grasped from behind just like last time ron bellowed in pain the magic of the portkey pressed them forward while tom magic held them back a familiar spearhead of agony bloomed in his skull harry curled in clutching his head but he was already erecting the gray screen of occlumency in his mind procclumens harry mouthed carefully using the knowledge of what he d learned over the summer as long as his focus and will were strong he didnt have to actually say the words aloud on the screen came vibrant recent memories of ginny kisses of ron muttered fraterdum singletus and its meaning of brothers to the final breath of the support from the whole school as harry had been walked from the infirmary to his dorm dumbledore leading him with a smile from somewhere nearby and yet far away tom shrieked in pain and harry bit through his bottom lip to keep from doing the same as the pain in his head doubled and the crushing force grew stronger it squeezed the air out of his lungs and he felt ron convulse behind him but with one final spastic tug tom magic released them and harry found himself tumbling on the hard wooden floor of dumbledore office ron groaned behind him harry lay still breathing deeply winded from the flying and the portkey he tasted blood on his bottom lip the office was quiet with only the soft familiar whirring of dumbledore strange magical objects on his desk as background ron sat up and leaned over harry all right mate his face was pale and there was an ugly bruise on his cheek harry nodded and closed his eyes damn ron muttered tensely climbing to his feet she not here he said thickly harry eyes flew open and he sat up suddenly remembering cho she has to be here cho harry was on his feet now wiping the blood from his mouth maybe she already on her way downstairs maybe but before either of them could move for the door a sudden thump from behind startled them harry didnttake the time to turn around he sensed the spell coming his way and dove left ron whipped around wand out but was caught directly in the chest by a cruciatus curse and dropped to the floor writhing in agony no harry yelled but had no time to get to his feet instead he dove left to avoid the curse slung at him then aimed and fired a bludgeoning curse in return at dean the taller boy easily blocked the spell and smirked at him who did you expect a slytherin harry barely got up a shield in time to deflect the next volley of curses then flung an impediment jinx at his friend and dove behind dumbledore desk dean blocked the jinx took ron wand easily and stepped toward the desk harry it just you and me now best man wins i dontwant to hurt you dean he called out something someone is controlling you it has to be the imperius try to throw it off maybe i dontwant to while harry watched in horror dean reached down and grabbed the desk with both hands lifting it as easily as if it were made of styrofoam with a roar the dark skinned boy threw it behind him where it slammed into the wall with a solid thud and rolled over harry wand was trained on dean but his mind was whirling now he noticed the dried specks of blood around dean horribly lopsided grin the long streams of bloodstains down his shirt and the shaking of his wand hand rage and something else made harry own hand quake as he knelt at a serious disadvantage only one meter away from dean wand you re under the imperius dean you dontwant to do this oh donti and harry was suddenly unsure it was always you harry winning everything taking all the glory for yourself leaving nothing for the rest of us i cantfly as well as you i cantfight as well as you and i couldnteven keep ginny away from you you ve taken everything i ever wanted you ve even taken my best friend away from me i didntmake seamus leave and i didnttake ginny from you she shut it shut it you you he shook his head and harry saw tears come into his eyes his frantic wild eyes the one they call you what will they call me then the one who killed the one he laughed a short barking laugh think i ll get a title too whose blood did you drink wouldntyou like to know but i dontthink i ll tell you it could be cho s it could be hermione s it could even be ginny s harry felt hot fury rise but he suddenly knew the true answer to the question dean had hurled that desk so easily envy he said suddenly understanding very impressive potter the name sounded strange coming so spitefully from dean mouth got it in one care to guess who but he never got the rest of the words out there was another smaller thud and a harry it was ginny dean spun with his wand raised catching her off guard she aimed hesitated looked at harry and then back at dean harry harry shook his head dean hadntfired a spell just stood there shaking from head to toe eyes widening with horror i almost he whispered ginny i i petrificus totalus harry curse snapped dean legs together and he tipped over backwards stiff as a board ginny ran over to harry and threw her arms around him shivering what happened to dean imperius curse must have been they made him drink re em blood and come after me it was the only explanation for dean sudden strength re em blood i dontthink he would have said those things otherwise ron he called over to his friend who was just now sitting up fine y okay yeah dean a bit stiff at the moment good cho harry with ginny looking up at him hated to answer she not here yet ginny held him tighter so this was envy yeah the portkey was pride ron cursed the slytherins roundly and rather creatively leading up to a very important question yeah harry agreed what about the bludgers what sin could possibly have anything to do with killer bludgers you got me mate ron said as he pushed himself to his feet ginny shook her head then jerked back to stare in harry eyes a giggle starting before she could completely squelch it what she peeled her hand away from her mouth and said almost apologetically sloth harry groaned ron strode over to dean and pushed him over with one foot so who got hold of him kind of hard to imagine bulstrode pulling off something like this just then hermione popped into the room wand outstretched harry ron she relaxed her pose you re all right oh good what happened to dean exactly what should have happened to the back stabbing prat ron muttered as he headed over to hermione arms open for a hug but hermione stopped him with one hand on his chest i cantbelieve you said that what happened ron opened his mouth but no words came out because just then cho appeared in the center of the room lying on the floor arms bound to her sides blood on her face clothes torn screaming with a raw scratched voice dumbledore office dumbledore office after a second of shocked stillness harry ran to her and knelt she didntsee him just screamed on and on he put a hand on each side of her face to still her and called her name over and over until she finally saw him at once her eyes glazed over and she went limp in a long slow faint a galleon fell out of her hand and hit the floor with a soft plink a n

charlie said tightly his voice barely registering with remus as he studied the marauder map with growing concern i dontsee him anywhere charlie swore colorfully then tried to take a few calming breaths what about fred and george nooo i dontsee them either i ll check with minerva keeping his eyes on the map remus tapped his wand on the colorful splash on the corner which looked like nothing so much as a haphazard drip from an obnoxiously colored candle in a few seconds professor mcgonagall wilted voice could be heard terrible news remus the aurors must have let lucius through theodore nott and rawley hughes were found dead in the slytherin common room none of the students will say what happened horror froze remus for a long moment where is severus shouldnthe have been with the slytherins yes of course he should have but no one seems to know where he gone could the marauders map possibly come in handy in that respect sharp sarcasm bit into the words but remus knew worry when he heard it i see him but remus registered the name snape severus just as he saw the name beside it malfoy lucius bugger said charlie looking over remus shoulder he with lucius mcgonagall inhaled sharply for a long moment no one said anything remus and charlie exchanged a glance it could mean anything severus could be intercepting the dangerous party in order to put him off or the unthinkable he could be helping him surely he trying to contain the wizard mcgonagall said in a once again firm voice dumbledore is on his way to the infirmary perhaps it would be a good idea to accompany him as she trailed off remus agreed with her then asked the status of the students in gryffindor mcgonagall said that half of them had been put through the emergency floo in the common room fireplace all hogwarts students were being evacuated after the attack on harry and the arrival of lucius charlie looked disturbed when mcgonagall replied to his question about the twins by saying they had not checked back in mcgonagall expressed concern over harry safety which remus was able to assuage with his news that harry draco and ron were locked in the room of requirement good news indeed she said with a satisfied air however you should keep a guard posted outside as no wizard since houdini has ever been able to find a way into and out of scrapes as well as our mr potter duly noted remus agreed and signed off wondering where he d find someone to spare in all the chaos charlie moved ahead to the corner and looked both ways how difficult is it to stick your head back through the floo and let people know that you re okay he groused as remus caught him up you d think since there two of them to make decisions they d occasionally remember to be thoughtful how long have they been gone nearly an hour molly wasted no time in getting news to us that arthur wasnt himself she a brave witch to be so bold after spending hours with lucius charlie clenched his fists so hard that several of his knuckles popped he d better not have laid a finger on her remus was silent so long trying to contain the sudden pain he felt that charlie looked back at him what is it remus did he do something to mum charlie voice rose precariously on the last word but remus was already shaking his head then what remus took a deep breath and leaned against the wall rubbing a hand over his face if i ever doubted that lucius had abused harry in a way other than what we expressly knew of well i have no doubts now but snape said i have no doubts charlie studied his face before turning to swearing violent curses under his breath then do we have any doubts that severus is helping lucius right now hardly remus said stone faced did harry tell you never mind stupid question dontneed to know anyway need to focus right need to get to lucius and if wormtail hurts my father they ll be burying him in a matchbox him and lucius wait remus raised a hand aurors mitchington helbrams coming up the stairs on the right charlie paused mitchington and helbrams hired by fornier unknown allegiance do we have time to take them down not if we want to catch dumbledore he on the move again heading downstairs from the gryffindor common room severus and lucius are still on the second floor not moving remus paused clicking through possible scenarios let go down on the left agreed moving quickly and quietly the pair covered the distance to the stairs and started down remus checked the map to make sure the aurors werent following instead they were moving toward the gryffindor common room where just outside the names wafting tobias and twitchtie uzima had appeared remus froze what do they think they re doing charlie turned who the twins harry and ron no remus shook his head first years in the direct paths of the aurors they ve then he paused no they just ducked into the corridor leading to the headmaster office curious though they may have simply heard the aurors footsteps as he watched the two students headed far down the corridor until they should have been behind the guarding gargoyle to his further surprise they entered the headmaster office but the headmaster isnteven there remus said softly how back down the corridor the two aurors hesitated at the corner and then continued on to the base of the gryffindor tower where remus knew the fat lady and the recently installed gargoyle would do their jobs and repel the aurors neatly he took a deep breath the students are safe and the aurors are now knocking around outside gryffindor tower good luck to them charlie grinned with wicked eyes let go catch professor dumbledore tobias did not let go of zimmy hand even after they had gained entrance into the headmaster office hullo he called out into the quiet still air dust motes drifted lazily through the sunbeams that lit the room far through the windows tobias caught a glimpse of the milling crowd still outside and frowned are you sure we should be in here zimmy asked quietly it doesntseem quite right tobias turned back to look at zimmy he wasntsurprised to see tears still standing in her eyes the headmaster told us to come here remember her gaze met his miserably but still it doesntseem right she pulled her hand away to wipe at tears as they began to fall again tobias took a deep breath and stepped toward her awkwardly he put one arm around her shoulders and bent his head trying to see into her eyes he wanted to reassure her to his surprise she turned and buried her face in his chest sobs making her whole frame shake tobias froze then started gently patting her on the back trying to remember what harry did when ginny was upset not that she was often but hadnt there been once or twice when she was worried and he d held her like this he d more often seen ron and hermione interact but since she usually ended up mad at ron tobias had decided not to copy ron moves listen he croaked then cleared his throat you re safe now i wontlet them get to you but everyone going home and i cantgo she sobbed even nelda and primmy get to go home but not me tobias sighed she was right and it was all his fault she d come to him today desperate warning him that harry was in danger thoughtlessly he d left zimmy where she stood and run to hermione yelling everything at her from two rows away all the gryffindors had heard zimmy warning which did help speed up things a bit but now he knew better he should have known the slytherins had spies among them even if there was no way he could have foreseen that lucius malfoy himself had been there in disguise now lucius was after draco for again being a traitor as well as zimmy and tobias for foiling the plan the worst part was that it wasntjust lucius but all the slytherins who had sworn to kill harry too the castle was not safe for any of them now even worse zimmy family were dark wizards through and through and leaving the castle might put zimmy in even worse jeopardy she d said goodbye to her sisters after they d sworn to let her know if and when it was safe to go home all three of them had been spying for the light side while at school though their parents thought differently only two of them could keep up the charade now after leaving the sisters zimmy and tobias had run to the gryffindor common room where professor dumbledore listened gravely to their story and warned them of dangers they d had no idea about tobias shuddered as images of his previous capture and brief torture went through his mind harry and ron had rescued him that time this time they wouldntbe able to help tobias swallowed he couldntlet that happen to zimmy nor did he have any desire to repeat the experience for now they would stay here and wait safely before he had left for the hospital wing dumbledore had assured them that this was just what harry was doing at the moment harry hiding safely somehow tobias didntthink that would last long stay down you two tonks shouted her voice muffled by the tapestry petrificus totalus we are ginny hissed back as she crouched beside hermione anger broiled in her veins maybe we should just take the shortcut down to the second floor hermione suggested then we can come up the we dont want to go to the second floor ginny hissed we want to get to the hospital wing for cho and dean it makes no sense to carry them down and then back up again it does if this way is blocked by aurors with evil intent aurors with evil intent dontmake fun ginny this is not the time for it ginny ground her teeth everyone treated her like she was incapable of doing anything when she could do anything the order members could sometimes better suddenly she knew why she was so angry and her way seemed brilliantly clear i going back up no ginny we have to take cho you have to take cho ginny retorted already pushing her way out of the tapestry but ginny ginny gave one look back i have to go help harry hermione froze her mouth open to speak ginny was changing sprouting tawny fur on her face white fur on her hands and feet her clothes disappeared next showing pleasing glossy fur all over then she shrank a tail appeared and with a small shuuuuup ginny was a cat it had all happened in a matter of seconds oh that really fair hermione huffed ginny knew it still aggravated her that she hadntbeen able to study her way into being an animagus though as ginny had pointed out several times harry and ron hadnteither ginny meowed a small chuckle nosed the tapestry aside and sinuously ducked under it tonks high above was using a shield to repel several curses when they went flying down the hallway back toward the aurors the two men leapt aside perfect timing ginny sprang for the corridor several yards to the left and zipped inside before any more curses could be thrown she knew exactly where she was headed with her noiseless tread she zipped down the corridor using every sense to feel for danger nothing but then well maybe she didntknow exactly where she was headed she sighed a cat sigh when in hogwarts one always had to be flexible when dealing with stairways there wasnta stairwell there now instead there was a wall farther up ahead there was a single doorway one that she didntthink she d noticed before it smelt interesting to her cat senses of tears and anguish desire and despair and magic very strong magic there were no sounds of pursuit behind her ginny moved forward and sniffed the air of the room tentatively the air was stale and the emotional fragrances that stained it were not nearly as new as she d first thought in fact they might be years old and they centered on the object standing tall and imposingly on the other side of the room it was an enormous mirror one so high that its top would be out of reach even for hagrid surrounding the mirror were ornate carvings in gold that ended down at its clawed feet an inscription carved around the top read something that ginny so low to the ground could not make out she walked closer glad for the silent pads of her cat feet noise would have felt out of place here but even when she was closer the writing at the top remained a mystery to her she growled in frustration and raised up to rest her paws on the cool smooth surface with a start she saw that the mirror did not reflect her strange but familiar cat animagus form instead she saw herself as she was in human form but a little older and here her face was transformed not only by age but by a look that seemed almost alien to her contentment her smile was gentle her eyes without hardness or mocking without horror or fear curls hung down her back and she suddenly saw a familiar hand comb through the ends the hand that she knew so well long and lightly calloused from hours of quidditch moved forward to rest on her stomach ginny pulled away from the mirror balancing on her haunches for a long moment then fell down on all fours to lope back farther away for a better view from this vantage point she saw the face she loved most in the world and the expression on his face nearly broke her heart it was harry yes but a harry as she d rarely seen him no dark circles under his piercing emerald eyes no hunted haunted look that spoke volumes about what he would not mention no weight of impending prophesies to bow down his strong shoulders harry as she desperately wanted him to be one day older carefree and loving her in the mirror the two embraced and kissed and harry didntpull away it was some time before ginny could leave hermione stewed for only a minute before concluding that ginny had been right she left cho lying as comfortably as possible on the stairs made sure dean was secure and pushed the tapestry out an inch or two from her vantage point she could see that tonks had one auror down and had pressed the other back farther down the hallway ginny was nowhere to be seen clever girl hermione pointed her wand out to the side of the tapestry and aimed at the auror knees petrificus totalus she whispered focusing hard and waving her wand just right the auror heels snapped together and he went backwards with a loud thump tonks let her shield down and wheeled about in surprise hermione nice wand work she shook her head as she went to collect the aurors wands now would someone explain to me how it is that i guarding you you did very well yourself hermione said as she renewed her mobilicorpus spell on cho and lifted her through the tapestry but dont try telling the boys we did just fine on our own idiocy apparently comes with the male hormones part and parcel tonks stopped and sighed right you are mate right as rain now on to the infirmary yes and will we be seeing ginny again cat form or no hmmm i think not she gone to help harry tonks went pale and clapped a hand to her face charlie is going to kill me oh if only i d gotten a look where she d gone but i was too busy she ll be fine tonks i sure of it and if you need to stay and take care of the aurors feel free i dontneed an escor hermione lucius malfoy is running amuck in the castle hermione went pale and he would dearly love to get his hands on anyone harry loves anyone tonks hermione came remus voice from ahead we saw you might be in a spot of trouble but looks as if you ve done just fine on your own professor lupin looked tired but cheered to see them safe he spun a quick incarcerous about each of the aurors let go girls charlie appeared at the corner we re headed for the infirmary as well only stay back he paused looking over the girls before speaking again professor snape and lucius malfoy are two floors down there a chance we may intercept them let us deal with them but we ve got to hurry if we re going to help dumbledore right you are except for the part about me hanging back tonks popped off to get cho and dean hermione raised her wand and performed a mobilicorpus on dean when tonks nodded at her they fell into a line remus charlie tonks and hermione each with a suspended auror or student tonks just fine just keep hermione to the rear all right charlie slammed to a halt wait where ginny harry listened to the uncomfortable silence grow he had no idea what to say mostly he felt empty as though some private dam filled to brim with stinking stagnant water had been broken by a spear thrust a very pointed and very painful spear now that the stream had died down to a trickle he had no idea what to say master harry potter sir harry jerked up there was dobby floating pale and miserable two meters off the ground how did you get in oh never mind harry cut himself off remembering that ghosts went through walls all the time it just hadntoccurred to him that it would work here as well how is dumbledore dobby hesitated he is being very good mister harry potter sir but but what dobby somehow managed to fidget in mid air he is going to the infirmary is he hurt no sir but it is dangerous harry listened in growing horror as dobby explained what the headmaster was walking into and for what purpose you have to find a way to get us out of here he finally managed ron was already blasting spells at the door dobby is not knowing a way to get harry potter out the elf ghost wailed well then find someone who does harry bellowed find remus get him up here and get me out but the bodies sir dobby squeaked dobby has to warn you what bodies the two slytherins nott and hughes dead sir harry jerked a glance over at draco who had gone very pale and very still ron exchanged horrified glances with harry and then turned back to hurl spells at the door again harry turned back to the house elf ghost find remus and get me out of here he snarled and tell the other house elves to go to dumbledore and help him if he dies then they re free and we know most of them dontwant that do you hear me dobby blinked his huge eyes nodded once and disappeared with a whispered yes sir to dumbledore sir harry started pacing as soon as the house elf disappeared fingering his wand compulsively hermione and ginny had been on their way to the infirmary too he should have never agreed to hide like this he should have fought remus and started a row rather than be tossed in a locked room like a naughty tomcat neutralized while lucius ran around the castle with his wand harry heart beat loud in his ears as his blood sang for revenge professor dumbledore strode down the long hallway despite his intent there was no telltale desperation in his movements only a heady cocktail of adrenaline purpose and the culmination of years of preparation singing in his veins he felt almost fifty again and a jaunty tune was bubbling to the surface just as he began to whistle the distant infirmary doors whispered open and severus snape stepped out severus and the warm words of greeting died on the headmaster lips he faltered to a stop why are you not supervising the exodus of the slytherins his voice echoed down the hallway a familiar sneer settled on the dark man face but did it have a new flavor was that always so concerned for the students how touching i not sure the history books will quite do you justice here you are moments away from annihilation and yet you are completely unconcerned it must be that pesky optimism you exhibit so often no despair crushed albus light heart like a tower of stone his whole world shifted turned and flattened out all the while a smile played on his lips forgive me old friend someone must counter the damaging effect of your unique blend of cynicism narcissism and pessimism severus further words died on his tongue at the appearance of another wizard and immediately the pieces began to fall into place ah yes lucius we meet again albus smile widened which drew a startled look from lucius that quickly eased into a smile albus lucius inclined his head which was still ridding itself of arthur russet colored tones i afraid your plans may have to be altered that is if you were planning to gain entrance to the infirmary lord voldemort has ordered otherwise indeed the professor said slowly taking a quick glance at severus whose face showed only what it wanted to show then he sighed flexibility is the key to a long life however i believe that it lies at your feet today to make the necessary adjustments i must insist that you move aside severus and lucius stepped in closer together and raised their wands disdaining further talk seeming to enjoy the headmaster surprise albus felt a deep pang of darkest grief at the doubts that once again assailed him before beginning the summoning of his magic how to clear the way without injuring one for whom he had spent so much of his own lifeblood even now his heart fluttered like a canary in a cage crying out that severus must be acting under the influence of dark magic must be planning to switch sides at the last possible moment but no matter the result was the same and it had to be dealt with now closing his eyes simultaneously blocking the powerful spells spun his way he opened his hands and readied a curse pfftt pffttt dumbledore held his magic in check watching in delighted amazement as house elves careened into the hallway thirty of them at least scattering in all directions and facing the three wizards two of whom seemed pleased to see them albus only had time to wonder at this before the first house elf curses were shot in his direction for the last time everyone stand back mcgonagall voice cracked on the last word showing the strain of the past hour stand back she said neville echoed putting down the bucket of floo powder to help to sort the students back into a line back you beasts he said with a stilted grin barely managing to get a smile out of the frightened second year at the front of the line let do a count off see how many are left mcgonagall nodded tersely as ginger buttons began the count the line snaked back behind the girl on for far too long where mcgonagall was concerned eighty four called the last gryffindor far too many thank goodness for neville though the boy face had paled when neither harry ron nor dean had showed up back at the common room he had been eager to help and volunteered to be the last student to evacuate get a move on called someone in the back where most of the older students were waiting as many voices chimed in ginger stepped forward waving as though she werenttwo meters from her teacher i next professor mcgonagall she said yes ginger that is rather apparent the professor said tersely now remember to see madame hooch once you are there and she will set up your trip home the girl nodded trembling and took a pinch of powder from the bucket in neville hands goodbye ginger and dontworry neville said smiling as she looked at him with anxious wet eyes she nodded again then turned to wave at the others before stepping forward and pitching the powder into the fireplace ministry of magic she cried into the floo then with a swirl of her skirt she was gone the next second year was getting a pinch of floo powder when the fireplace let out a belch of magical fire neville jumped back pulling the younger student behind him but i next she wailed neville shushed her looking over at mcgonagall his wand was already out take cover she said crisply striding toward the students d a students wands out protect the younger ones there was a reassuring surge of motion from the back of the line and the front students began to scramble then the fire started sparking and something came through neville gasped a single scream rent the air professor mcgonagall turned wand at the ready ginger buttons lay on the floor eyes open wide body lifeless she d been thrust back through the floo but that meant take cover mcgonagall shouted the room exploded into motion all except for neville he was staring down at ginger dark familiar emotions keeping him there he d just told her not to worry he d smiled at her and sent her through the floo to her death there was no time to do more than blink back tears before the wizard stepped through the flames neville looked up and found himself face to face with head auror claude fornier ginny slipped noiselessly up the stairs her tail twitching ahead were some interesting smells smells that said caution she was glad to comply they seemed to be coming from the direction of gryffindor tower using her elevated senses she spied two groaning lumps not far from the gargoyle guarding the tower a catty smile curved her lips she could smell fear and pain from two men that also smelled of dark magic no need to worry about them she delicately retraced her steps and bounded up the staircase ready to find harry suddenly a presence startled her she froze and fluffed up to twice her usual size an angry yowl rumbling in her throat but the ghost that floated overhead was no reason to panic unfortunately that was one cat instinct she had yet to conquer disgusted with herself she forced herself onward trying to ignore the puffy fur screaming stop and groom me with every step being a cat could be extremely annoying sometimes but then she was up the stairs smelling dusty worn stone and faded tapestry heading for barnabas the barmy wall hanging now how to get inside ginny paced back and forth three times thinking only of harry could the room feel her desperation could it judge need ginny stopped and sat expectantly but the answer was no she settled a furious gaze on the wall and waited only the twitching tip of her tail giving evidence that she was not a statue inside she was running through the full list of spells curses and magical devices she knew of legal and illegal but nothing seemed promising ginny ears perked up her tail went still what was that sound a hissing she whipped around eyes searching the stillness quivering muscles ready for action it was coming from the stairs ginny trained her eyes on the shadowy entrance to the hallway who was coming again her ears perked forward heavy steps harsh breathing someone big and closer much closer something was coming fast too fast ginny turned to streak down the hall a panicked orange brown blur strong magic was chasing her something she couldntfight coming right up on her snapping at her heels with a sizzling pop ginny shot into the air and came down in a fluffy yowl of terror she landed on her feet but was terribly horribly frozen she couldntmove a muscle all she could do was watch as two sickly green house elves sidled up laughing garly is sorry the kitty is having such a bad night said the first coming down to squat and peer into ginny face a growl rumbled low in ginny chest dont worry said the second house elf a squattier and squash nosed version of the first one everyone will be having a bad night tonight a nasty giggle shook his pinched shoulders bad night for good wizards good night for bad wizards garly the first elf laughed his green eyes glittering good night for house elves house elves who follow him ginny growl froze in her throat house elves who followed voldemort was that even possible panic clawed at her chest even as the heavy footsteps she d heard earlier suddenly reappeared you did it you found her millicent bulstrode ginny couldntlook up into the girl face but there were thick tears clogging her voice yes now i can give potter what he got coming to him and it ll all finally be over finally a n house points to millicent she right we are ending this story with the next two chapters so get ready chapter 27 the one part i harry hadntrealized it before that it was possible to be completely enraged and yet completely focused at the same time hot flares of fury were searing him inside but he listened almost passively to lucius malfoy voice as it taunted from outside the room it not his time yet a voice inside him said but it will be soon right now there was nothing for him to do but wait draco was even replying for him father i impressed by your use of house elves magic you ve come so far the boy voice dripped disdain at one time i believe you would have cut off both testicles rather than resort to stooping so low but then you are a malfoy a cold laugh was his response and you are not you pusillanimous pitiable traitor i shall enjoy exacting my revenge upon your pain wracked slowly dying flesh at length likewise returned draco with chilling malice you sadistic power hungry miscreant it is notable that you chose to stay on the outside of the room safely tucked away from any fair dueling it is you who are safely tucked away and you who are to be plucked from this room one by one like so many overripe melons and your innards stretched across these stones unless potter gives himself up harry eyes shot open and his insides chilled instantly he reached down and pulled ginny into his arms hugging her tightly and rocking with her over my dead body ron yelled back yes and on top of it too lucius returned potter you have three minutes before we commence the killing ron turned away from the door all right here what we do harry pulled away from ginny slightly and was heartened to see her eyes open though she still trembled against him harry she began and he immediately tuned ron out shhhh it all right i here violet what ginny eyes bled tears violet hooch she was under the imperius bulstrode said zabini put her under it hermione was beside them now her hand gently on ginny arm but zabini was kicked out ginny nodded she was already under it they used her to get me aside during the bazaar then again when she was sent home he got to her again she came back under his spell and tampered with the bludgers poor violet harry shook his head it doesntmatter now are you all right yes she said closing her eyes and shivering into him but i dontthink i can handle lucius anymore dontworry he said through a clenched jaw pulling her tighter i can handle him no one heard a word i said ron groused loudly this is not the time for it harry as if i ll get another chance harry glared at him as if he ll get another chance draco hissed at him ron looked at draco shocked then back at harry who was still glaring at him ron face slowly cleared and he stepped back oh right harry looked over at hermione who nodded gave ginny a quick kiss on the cheek and then headed over to ron let give them a minute she whispered draco gave harry a long suffering look before turning his back morose at the onset of more gryffindor intimacy harry hesitated then met ginny eyes i wasntsure i d get a chance to see you again he whispered there something i have to say ginny stirred in his arms her brown eyes suddenly alive and full of tears she sat up still leaning against his chest me too you go first harry nodded then had to look away the words were fleeing from him at an alarming rate no he closed his eyes dug in and opened his mouth when we first got together it was like magic he stopped opened his eyes and smiled flushing i mean magic the way it seemed to me when i first saw it coming from the muggle world er like it was everything i ever wanted but didntknow that i did does that make sense he looked up to see her face transformed happy despite her gray pallor and the blood on her bottom lip he reached up and gently wiped at the red smear with his thumb it wouldntcome off and she winced so he smoothed that rough touch with a gentle lingering kiss ginny sobbed a bit as he pulled away then caught hold of herself of course it makes sense harry continued to caress her cheek losing himself in it knowing it had to be the last time he would ever feel it you made me feel normal and wanted and loved like i never had before ginny turned her head to kiss his hand draco groaned softly over to the side and harry made a herculean effort to ignore him ron however thumped him on the head prat harry let his hand fall to her long braid falling down over her shoulder catching it gently in his hand ginny no longer content to let him have his way reached up to touch his face to run her fingers intimately over his features as he had never done before almost as if she were memorizing him harry caught her hands in his and pulled them off his face closing his eyes to focus but i had a problem deep breath when lucius had me in a few quiet halting sentences harry confessed to her the painful truth of his captivity and how it had confused his physical feelings for her how any intimate touch had reminded him and haunted him and nauseated him i knew it confused you and i didn t he finally looked up at her and spoke plainly i didntwant you to ever ever think it was you truth is i couldnthave gotten past that if it werentfor you he smiled at her it gives me courage knowing that you love me i do harry nodded i dontknow what going to happen after this but no matter what hold on to this to what we have it will make you strong ginny weeping reached up to pull him into an embrace it always has loving you has always made me stronger shaken by her words by the memory that she had loved him long before he had ever understood his love for her harry closed his eyes and remembered he remembered the small red headed girl running alongside the train waving to her brothers crying because she was too small and was going to be left alone he remembered her bright brown eyes and the silence that had plagued her for years whenever she saw him he could hear the steel in her voice in later years as she steered him straight time after time not commanding like hermione or cajoling like ron but with a firmness that always surprised him she was strong there she said pulling away from him and wiping at her eyes i going to make you three promises one i not going to leave your side again two i not going to get caught again so stop worrying about it if we get separated dontworry the next time you see me i ll be coming to rescue you and three no more singing valentines good harry said as he gently took her hands in his i dontreally like singing valentines ginny gave him a watery smile harry squeezed her hands and smiled back the moment wasntgoing to hold and harry knew it but he was drawing strength from her and saw the same change in her face as she took in a deep settling breath okay she whispered now i ready time up mes enfants lucius called moments later call upon your gods and weep no wait harry called disentangling himself from ginny i coming out what came several voices from around him harry no ginny said trying to push herself to her feet i need to do this harry strode forward until draco stood in his way he not alone draco waved the marauder map at him snape is there as well and god knows how many house elves torn harry shifted from foot to foot if you try to walk out that door i will petrify you ginny called out from behind him brilliant idea draco spat at her over harry shoulder then the savior of the wizarding world will be an unmoving target harry drilled him with his eyes donttalk to her like that draco nodded yes fine but there will be no hex harry shoved him out of the way and faced the door then we re going to blow through it all at once he said in a low voice take out some of them and widen the fighting area otherwise they d pick us off one by one as we came out the door yeah ron said that what i just said draco made a rude noise well cept the part about blowing open the wall i didn think we could do tha we can harry stated then looked around at everyone ginny stay back she started getting up immediately and hermione bent to help like hell i will you should know me better than that she gave him a wan smile dontweaken yourself further he begged i know how strong you are just let us do the spell okay fine she assented but with her trademark disgruntled look just then a house elf appeared in the corner cowering as harry spun to shoot a curse at her no mister harry potter sir she whispered it is winky sir are you remembering me harry stopped his curse just in time winky what are you doing here winky is outside with the bad house elves but i is not going to help them all house elves is not bad i know winky what can you do is harry potter going to blow down the wall everyone exchanged glances did you overhear that she nodded and sniffed all the house elves did house elves is having good hearing harry sighed so much for the element of surprise winky blinked her big watery eyes when mister harry potter gives the count the good elves will attack the bad maybe that is being a help harry smiled slowly that is being a big help winky smiled in return and popped out everyone ready he looked around at the others and then froze gaze jetting to the walls what am i i such an idiot of course draco said instantly staring at harry but why hasnthe done it yet done wha ron asked looking from one to the other his face growing darker by the second oh hermione said loudly i see but i dontknow why either why what ginny said sharply harry walked over to ginny stowed his wand and scooped her up in his arms dontworry he said as she buried her face in his neck the headmaster will get us out of this he strode over to the back wall and faced the blank stone expectantly but snape said the headmaster was dead ginny said in a small voice ohhhhhhh ron said finally now i get it yeah why hasnthe open sesame d yet he no longer alive in himself harry murmured to ginny he given his magic over to the castle and it been helping us just watch one by one everyone got behind harry who was waiting by the back wall of the room three seconds went by then four and then the wall split open before them ginny gasped and grasped harry tighter it all right he told her we ve been doing this all afternoon harry took a deep breath and started inside ginny was almost a dead weight in his arms but it felt good to carry her he knew she had to be hurting and lucius harry swallowed and shook his head there was nothing he could do now he had to get everyone to safety it helps to have friends in high places eh potter draco called back ron and hermione were walking ahead debating whether it was time for her to drink her potion from madame pomfrey she said every three hours ron hermione chided it canthave been that long think of all we ve done since then it has to be at least two what have you been doing ginny asked harry harry hesitated to tell her about neville and mcgonagall but in the end he felt he must as they walked up the long staircase hearing the echoes of the others around them he skimmed over the events he made sure to tell her that fred and george had rescued her father and that charlie had been up and fighting the last time he saw him ginny took in the overwhelming information as stoically as she could hate to be a bother potter draco said as they neared him on the stairs but has the wall down there closed off yet harry leaned slightly against the wall to anchor himself and looked below it had been a straight climb up so it was easy to tell the wall was open no draco met his gaze lazily dontyou think that odd shouldnthe want to keep my father and snape blocked from following let me down ginny insisted i can walk still puzzling over the open wall below harry let her slide to the step above him careful now he told her keeping a hand around her waist oh hermione voice came down and light flowed down the steps it opened up here careful harry called up ron check it out be righ back ron dark form appeared outlined by the light pouring in the doorway and then vanished beside him harry could sense draco staring down at the open wall beneath them no one had yet appeared there were the house elves still waiting for harry count or had they already attacked without him all right harry ron appeared through the lit wall one more time it brought us back to the third floor everything quiet everyone up quickly harry instructed and there was an instant flurry of motion ron hermione and ginny were swallowed by the light before being followed by a reluctant draco harry paused to look back down the wall below was still open but no one was in sight harry harry jerked his head up to see the wall slide shut with a snick his friends were on the other side no he slammed his hand against the stone on the other side he heard faint voices yelling his name ginny and then the stairs gave a jerk harry turned to look at the long stairs beneath him stretching three floors down do you want me back down there are you insane he yelled his voice echoing around in the tunnel the stairs gave another jerk and then disappeared harry windmilled wildly as his feet slid out from under him and his back hit the stone hard stunned momentarily he felt his body gain momentum and begin to slide faster why was this happening with only seconds to go until he was deposited back into the room below harry pulled himself together and readied his wand focus he told himself trying to quell the rising panic dumbledore wants you there be there it almost worked then the light broke over his face and he was dumped into the room nearly at the feet of lucius malfoy well happy christmas to me he said smugly crucio but harry was already in motion rolling fast enough to stay ahead of lucius curse stay still damn you lucius said tension beginning to work its way into his calm icy voice it was a small room and harry was already at the end of it so he turned and used the momentum he d gained to run three steps up the wall his senses engaged it was easy to spin out an impedimenta mid flip one that took lucius by surprise the older wizard still managed to get up a shield but it was so weak that the impact knocked him back into the wall harry spun around and hit himself with a disillusionment charm as lucius clambered painfully to his feet one leg did seem to be injured from earlier harry used the time to quietly move aside his wand trained on lucius lucius gaze darted around the room his eyes going wild harry breathed soundlessly and watched draco father slowly fall apart are you afraid boy who has no one left to love him lucius screamed his wand aim skipping around the room with no rhyme or reason you canteven face me can you is the memory of what i did you the last time i met simply too shameful he flung a reductor curse to the wall blowing a small hole in it harry now on the other side of the room smirked lucius words had no hold over him now and there was the little matter of revenge to think of right after he ducked this bludgeoning curse harry threw himself to the left wand out erecting the gray screen in his mind contra producto produxi productum harry cast with focused thought a favoritespell of fred and george from the old days used especially for when percy was sitting on the toilet and before harry had even landed the room was beginning to darken lucius turned toward the noise as harry collided with the floor all his weight on his left hip left elbow and left foot he slid a few feet and lucius lit up the space behind him but the room was nearly dark now and all harry had to do to disappear was to be silent which was more difficult than it should be now that his elbow and hip were on fire from contact with the stone floor harry breathed through clenched teeth as quietly as possible while moving to his feet lucius had also gone quiet he wasntgoing to risk lighting his wand and announcing to harry where he was so now lucius would be fighting an invisible opponent in a dark room again harry smirked sonorus he cast against the shield again lucius his voice was shockingly loud in the room and echoing until it was impossible to tell where he wasthen he whispered do you know what revenge feels like harry heard the slight intake of breath and moved closer on silent feet eyes closed he sensed lucius form and his magical energy he would know before any spell left his wand i see you learned your lesson well lucius said coldly i learned nothing from you harry yelled and sensed lucius reeling back from the sound but the wizard was laughing now you learned hate from me boy and shame and when you face the dark lord you will be all the weaker for it i asked you if you knew what revenge feels like harry hissed oh yes lucius spat back i remember then you will know how good this feels and harry lifted his wand lucius was running to the left but harry merely followed him with the tip of his wand and shot the tar all over him as he ran it was a new spell one that acted exactly as the paint they had used in defense against the dark arts but heavier and flammable this one he had learned from rodolphus lestrange back in hell manor lucius stumbled gasped for breath no potter tar covered him all over accio wand incarcerous harry reached out to catch lucius wand listening with pleasure to the wizard mad cry severus harry whipped around but he knew there was no one else in the room no one no wait there was a figure moving down the hallway harry sensed a wizard with a strong magical core coming near harry turned once again to lucius do it boy or are you a coward harry hesitated then cancelled the darkening charm the room came into view again and with it a broken tarred tied up and frothing lucius coward the dark lord will silencio lucius stopped abruptly harry considered him considered burning him as he d intended he d hurt so many people he d hurt ginny but to kill someone this way was so the door flew open and severus snape strode in his black cape billowing harry trained his wand on the wizard watching him carefully lucius screamed to snape silently snape considered lucius then turned back to harry what are you waiting for with a casual wave of his wand he sent a jet of flame at lucius and cancelled the silencing charm at the same time there the wizard turned giving harry a profile of his hawk like nose i ve been waiting to do that for years harry was so shocked that he almost dropped his wand entirely lucius was writhing rolling wrapped in flames screeching until his voice grew dry and raspy then snape waved again and the flames grew whiter and hotter lucius was reduced to ash in seconds harry was still staring in abject horror when something hit him hard on the back of his head his knees buckled and the light around started evaporating he was falling forward and down so far down but snape words followed him into the dark it time to go harry the dark lord awaits when harry woke up he was lying on a cold smooth floor staring up at floating candles lit with blue flames feeling the throb of his heartbeat in his skull the black walls of the room loomed over his head completely out of proportion for the space around him and there were so many doors everywhere he looked there were plain black doors without handles it seemed familiar if only harry could think around the pounding in his head maybe he could remember i see your head is not as hard as i gave you credit for came a grating voice from behind him harry looked over to see severus snape seated wand out watching him if you would do me the pleasure of delivering myself up to you tied tarred and silenced no i dontthink i will thanks harry interrupted as he struggled to his feet the dark room spun around him and the high polish on the black floor made him feel as though a tumble might send him drowning in deep waters balancing on his own two feet had never seemed so difficult is the dark lord ready for me indubitably it is whether you are ready for him that is the eternal question and one that i have fallen most ill while pondering shall we get on with it harry bit back an angry retort he couldntafford to get baited into anything right now especially since his wand was not in his wrist holster he had to calm himself get as much information on where he was and you re at the ministry of magic snape supplied easily blue light from the candles flickering on his face i ve brought you here to show you something that few witches or wizards have ever seen he was walking toward a door one of the twelve harry suddenly remembered that opened into different sections of the department of mysteries right harry shook his head and tried to orient himself he d battled lucius and his death eaters here and lost sirius to the veil as well in the death room which was beside the time room but he had other concerns right now wait what happened to my friends the last i saw of them they were fighting off house elves on their way to reunite with the order there they will be dealing with aurors dementors and a nasty manticore before leaving hogwarts if the dark lord doesntdecide to scoop them up and use them as bait for you harry clenched his jaw then what in the bloody hell are we doing here snape watched harry amused this will not be our last stop we will go on to hell manor potter where all the students who were supposedly sent home were flooed directly one of fornier sneaky little plans here they were collected by death eaters over the bodies of several ministry workers naturally and sent on to hell manor and what are we waiting for harry tried to force the squeakiness out of his voice but the new information had shaken him to the core students at hell manor harry tried to focus on snape answer we are here because albus wished it to be so i am fulfilling my last duty to a friend friend drop the act snape you were never yes exactly severus took several abrupt steps in his direction startling harry i am dropping the act harry and tentatively snape smiled harry mind ground to a halt the death eater before him the professor who had saved his life numerous times only to betray him in the end hadnthe betrayed him in the end was actually smiling and not the ghastly false smile that had so nauseated the gryffindors during potions class but a small light smirk that actually reached the man normally unfathomable eyes but this is the expected outcome of my years of verbal abuse and unrighteous wielding of class power the wizard smile grew albus predicted you would not believe me at first which is why i took the precaution of securing your wand i know you would derive great joy from taking out your anger and frustration on me the wizard who assiduously cultivated your hate for the past six years but this is not the time your future lies in that room snape gestured to the door he d approached as does your past you seek what is there you have sought it your whole life though you do not know it there will be no fulfilling of the prophecy without it harry stood silent staring at the door he could hear a replay of the words dumbledore had said to him in his office at the end of his fifth year words burned in his mind by desperation pain and latent horror there is a room in the department of mysteries that is kept locked at all times it contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than forces of nature perhaps the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there harry could remember the way the wizard old blue eyes had burned into his with intensity sorrow and a fierce puzzling belief in harry abilities it is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which voldemort has not at all not at all harry snape said firmly the time for secrets is past enter compelled by something he could not even name harry walked forward slowly aware every second that he could be making the biggest mistake in a lifetime of big mistakes his steps echoed in the dark room and he continuously tried to blink the brightness of the blue light out of his eyes walking into an unknown room dazzled wandless in front of severus snape ron would kill him for this but if this was the room and truly it could be another easily if snape wished to deceive him then harry had to enter as harry passed snape he turned on his senses nothing came from beyond the door at all meaning that either its magic was hidden or that it was empty of magic entirely harry stopped in front of the door and drew in a deep breath behind him nothing stirred snape was still watching him the candles threw strange bluish shadows over him and once again harry doubted the wizard intentions then he turned reached out his hand and cracked the black door open easily harry senses went wild inside this room was one of the purest sources of magic he d ever encountered it was extremely powerful and wildly intoxicating perhaps there was some secret weapon after all as harry opened the door snape made a move to follow him and harry meant to whip around ready for any sort of betrayal but once he saw what was in the room he froze his knees buckled his eyes swam with tears he only made it five steps before he fell to his knees it was a small room with elegant carved wooden walls depicting witches and wizards in various forms of dress in the few seconds that harry forced himself to glance around the room checking for hidden danger he recognized a few personas he had studied by the glow cast from the center of the room seemingly all of wizarding history was represented in this room and all of it attended to the figure the one real figure in the center of the room harry moved closer a young woman was lying on a narrow pillowed pedestal her long crimson hair flowing over the side the soft glow of magic light infusing the air above her with radiant sparkling mist as harry moved ever nearer hardly aware he was doing so the features of her face so familiar already became more beautifully clear her narrow pale forehead the dainty slightly pointed nose and the full pale pink lips were all features he knew by heart had memorized from her photo and even though her eyes were closed he knew that if they opened oh if they but opened he would be gazing into emerald depths that were the mirror of his own lily potter his mother he stared without moving without conscious breath studying every detail of her face and clothing for so long that when snape appeared on the other side of the pedestal harry could not bring himself to even look up lily potter dead at twenty two years of age harry finally jerked his eyes away and stared at his professor startled to see a soft look around his eyes dead because she chose to save her son you a bitter tone had crept into his soft words and his eyes cut to harry before returning back to lily i dontthink i ve ever forgiven you for that i ve become convinced that she was correct in doing what she did but still the world is not a better place for losing her harry looked back at his mother and blinked back another rush of tears why is she why does she still look so her act synonymous with love and self sacrifice and responsible for the downfall of the dark lord was seen as the usher in of a new time of peace and prosperity for the wizarding world lily potter could have easily been named the savior of the wizarding world instead of you but because of the prophecy albus chose to emphasize your future role rather than lily past one but to let such a one as this simply die after all she had done was an anathema snape looked away and paced idly toward the far wall studying the walls a way was found to preserve her and the ministry agreed the room was built and here we are what way snape gestured behind harry the draught of the living death of course harry turned and saw tucked away in the corner a plain wooden table only large enough for a single item a silver chalice that hovered an inch over the table and rotated slowly his eyes widened as they took in the dull satin finish and the design played on by an infusive glow flowing scrollwork that hid running wolves and their mates howling at the moon the stem was incredibly delicate balanced by a pearl studded base harry had seen this goblet before he had been given highest marks in transfiguration at the beginning of term for it transfiguring a turtle into this goblet likeness he turned back to snape i ve been here before when you were a baby they brought you here to see your mother one last time i remembered that goblet i transfigured yes yes of course you nearly gave minerva a snape gave an uncomfortable pause before continuing on showing that he too had heard of her demise you startled her by transfiguring the likeness of this chalice albus was pleased to hear that you remembered the visit to your mother albeit in some sequestered normally unused section of your brain somehow snape still managed to make it sound like an insult that the headmaster was pleased but wait you have to be alive in order to take the draught of the living death and my mother was already wasntshe his chest constricting with sudden emotion harry stepped closer still to snape wasntshe dead for a long moment harry thought snape wouldntanswer him the glow from the room cast warmth on one cheek but the other side of his face lay in shadow she wasntcompletely dead harry stopped breathing the dark lord had cast a spell that night before entering your home snape gave harry a cursory glance he was determined to live forever and had found a way to preserve his soul the animus abeo all he needed to do to complete the spell was cast the killing curse and then his soul would be bound in a chosen object the object was to be a small solid gold ring that he wore that night on his person he was to cast the killing curse on you it was supposed to be the culmination of his attempt to take over the wizarding world the death of the one prophesied to be his undoing but after killing both james and lily and readying the object for the transfer of his soul the dark lord made a mistake snape turned toward harry his dark eyes glittering he tried to kill you while your mother protection was guarding you it proved to be his undoing how harry prompted after snape paused your soul was not ripped from your body as he d intended because your mother soul was covering it instead his own soul was torn from his body when the curse rebounded it was in limbo kept in place by the spell that had prepared it to inhabit the ring but unable to go there because he was not there to direct it instead it was pulled and directed by the strongest magical force present you harry was breathing again but barely he swallowed his throat parched with every sentence snape uttered he felt himself grow closer to doom to understanding the force of the dark lord own killing curse had forged a connection between you a connection that now channeled his dark soul into your body but there being so much light so much love in your body because of your mother presence the dark lord soul could not withstand it part of him the part that was once good the part that might have been redeemable at one time and still quietly yearned for good things joined with yours instantly becoming a part of you centered around the scar that was the point of the transference of souls but the part of the dark lord that could not abide love that shrank from everything good that part ripped itself away and sought out shelter in some other more inhabitable creature for him unconsciously harry had reached up to touch the scar that even now marked him the connection he felt with tom that was because part of his soul was entwined with harry own but you said she wasntcompletely dead harry prompted snape crossed closer to harry lily knew they would come she knew the dark lord will try to kill you and she was determined to protect you at all costs she came to me insisting that i help her that i use my knowledge of the dark arts to help her forge protection for you the earnestness in snape face made harry pull back though his desire to understand made him nearly vibrate with tension why you snape spoke quicker now more easily because she was the only gryffindor that ever befriended me the only person who ever saw behind the mask i had carefully cultivated in order to spy on the dark lord recruits you must understand that even then even then albus was my mentor and already i was being turned into a spy already i was alienating anyone who had ties to the good and was courting those who were slowly being gathered by the dark lord lily always saw through my pretended anger my vague attempts at alienating her she knew to come to me when she needed help and i helped her i knew which spell the dark lord would cast to preserve his own soul he did not confide in me but i was able to glean it from his thoughts during one short unguarded moment snape smiled briefly his ego did not permit him to suspect me then when lily asked me to meet her one night far from hogwarts safety even unknown to james i could not help but respond she begged me for protection and not for herself no she never would have lowered herself to do that but she begged protection for you i told her that the only way to ensure your safety would be for her to cast the same spell harry stared at the wizard his mind too sluggish to grasp the full meaning the same spell the animus abeo she cast the spell the same spell as the dark lord to preserve her soul or at least part of it in you harry took a step back his eyes had gone watery again and he seemed to have trouble breathing my mother to save your life snape reminded him to save my life cast a spell to preserve her soul in me yes and the spell worked even with our modification you see lily would not use the killing curse as the spell required but she fully expected to die by one she used the force from the dark lord spell against her to forge her own animus abeo when part of the dark lord soul followed hers into your body it was joined up in the magical binding your mother soul had already made as your own magic began to seek to heal the damage both were sealed up magically bound to the wound created by the curse what is now a scar on your forehead harry rocked back on his feet before catching his balance again so the dementors were always drawn to you because you hold not only one whole soul but also the parts of two others that is the source of your strong magical power professor snape looked almost smug at the revelation harry knees gave out and again he knelt in the room he was a a he didnteven know what to call himself a frankensteinian monster an imposter a pretender he wasntin the least bit strong his only magical strength lay in the power given him by his mother and by voldemort himself potter snape paused harry this room was kept so that you would not just hear the information of the origin of your rebirth but understand it and see how costly it was you are what you are who you are for a purpose i have spent the better part of my life preparing for your coming preparing others to accept you then protecting your life and preparing you for the hard road and darkness ahead the weight of the truth cannot end it does not end the necessity the rightness and the meaning of your existence harry heard it all but his heart felt frozen look at her snape prodded him look at her harry climbed heavily to his feet and moved himself to stand by his mother snape joined him looking down on her lovely face tears slowly leaked down harry face the best witch i ever knew died for you she passed on to you the best parts of herself and gave you strength and power the best wizard i ever knew has just laid down his life to protect you inside hogwarts you may not claim to be the one everyone thinks you are but you are the product of so many wizards and witches giving to you and making sure that you are ready harry harry wiped his eyes and looked up at snape who had fixed him with a deadly earnest black eyed gaze for six years i ve bullied you and taunted you knowing that my seeming hatred would pale in comparison with the venom of the dark lord you must eventually come to face that was why harry seemed incapable of finishing a sentence it was my job albus trusted me to do the one thing that he could not ensure that you were not petted and feted into a self satisfied stupor the dark lord reinforced that by binding me to an unbreakable vow that i was to undermine your training as much as possible it served both sides that demanded my allegiance harry nodded too wearied to ask more questions now the answers were all so strange so much to think through and there was no time now harry harry looked up for six years i ve told you and anyone who would listen repeatedly of your ineptness your weakness and your fallibility are you ready to prove me wrong the intensity of snape gaze and his words had their desired effect yes sir harry stared long into his eyes and then finally glanced away i assume you have a plan of course listen carefully the first thing we must do is revisit the veil harry stared at the crumbling stone archway before him watching the mysterious tattered veil moving slowly in a wind he couldntfeel whispering voices caressed his ears the pull of the unknown beckoned he was still trembling from his talk with snape thoughts were broiling in him constantly bringing strong feelings to the surface again and again i have a piece of the dark lord in me harry said thinking aloud and my blood was used to bring him back to human form correct and if i threw myself into the veil right now what would happen you would die unquestionably and he would be left vulnerable to attack but we are unsure that anyone else may be victorious against him harry and there would still be dementors and a manticore ravaging your friends at hogwarts and the dark lord followers to deal with after that it would be more ideal for you to survive the encounter with the dark lord of course harry gave him a look there is a time and a purpose for everything harry you are needed beyond this room at this time the veil is a temptation for you but do not think you are alone in that my purpose and my road have been infinitely longer and harder than yours harry looked at snape in surprise but instinctively felt that what he said was true if he really had deceived the dark lord all along had been a death eater only on dumbledore instruction had watched the deaths of so many and been the recipient of so much pain from denying himself the things he most wanted in life simply because he had a purpose to protect harry and stop the dark lord ultimate victory it was almost unthinkable grudgingly harry realized that he would not have been able to do it that his heart and his soul were not cut out for such duplicity purposeful or not with a small smile harry nodded you re probably right that was remarkably easy severus snape said with another of his unexpected smiles i dontthink those words ever passed from your father lips and there they stood for a long moment simply smiling at each other then feeling completely absurd harry looked back at the veil so then we destroy it and the dementors will dissipate immediately the wizard lost his smile and resumed his business like demeanor it was nowhere near his usual cold inhospitable sneer but it was close enough to make harry more comfortable precisely dementors are wizards and witches who in their lifetime were users of the unforgiveable curses their punishment was to be sent through the veil where their souls were ripped from their bodies but by use of a spell a horrible spell finally outlawed by the wizengamot a century ago their bodies were recalled back through the veil because they are in effect deceased they do not retain physical bodies no more than a ragged ravaged skeletal appearance having nothing of their former lives no memories no souls of their own they house a vacuum inside one that desires nothing so much as to experience joy again and to ultimately regain their own soul back destroy the veil which imprisons their souls and they will be free harry swallowed and looked at the veil with newfound horror someone could have done that to sirius but i thought dementors just appeared bred out of evil and dark magic ah yes they do breed a perfect example of how dark magic can take on a life of its own and grow beyond our control but still all of them are all tied to the veil by the magic that begat the original dementors without that spell without the veil that is the basis of that spell the dementors would cease to exist then why hasntsomeone done this before snape scowled use your head potter they were advantageous to the ministry until recently when the dark lord began using them against us and by that point fornier was positioned as head auror no order to destroy the veil would get by him okay fine how do we destroy it we must dissolve the magical link between the veil and the land of souls then destroy the structure itself land of souls yes snape replied acidly the afterlife limbo the spirit world whichever you prefer right er how about if you handle the link and i ll destroy the arch nicely decided snape turned to the arch and lifted his wand this link was forged in the dark ages when wizards were necromancers and raising people from the dead was a regular practice it was problematic though to have people thought to be dead constantly popping up again so an archway was built and a permanent link forged in order that it could be controlled by those in power eventually this room was built to house the archway and to keep it out of the clutches of the populace it was relegated to ministry use only he paused the wizard who first used it to create a dementor was later turned into one i dontthink he will mind us destroying it i would think not harry said shuddering how do you destroy the link simple we remove the key from the body buried under the archway snape aimed his wand at the floor careful of the stones before harry could ask whose body and what stones there was an immense upheaval in the floor surrounding the archway as if the stones were boiling and coming to the surface of a great cauldron with a swirl snape directed the stones to ripple away from the arch moving in concentric circles toward the walls they piled up on top of each other filling in the first few rows in the stadium seating harry rode the waves of tremors in the floor and tried not to think about the fact that they were nine floors down in the ministry if anything were to start falling apart snape looked pleased the archway now stood alone its supporting platform dug away inside the area where the platform had been was a narrow crypt with a single coffin cobwebs draped from the walls of the crypt to the wooden box that was discolored and stained by time who in there harry pointed with a jerk of his head the architect mother snape replied as he pocketed his wand and began to climb down into the crypt we can only assume she wasnta very good one you think harry looked around nervously are you sure there arentany traps or security systems protecting that thing albus assured me they would be turned off that even fudge himself saw the necessity of it the dementors have to be destroyed if we want to defeat fornier aurors or make it safely to hell manor fornier dead harry said automatically neville killed him longbottom snape looked surprised at first then looked more closely at harry how fornier made the mistake of not killing neville first just injured him neville dead now snape inclined his head a short show of respect for harry grief and an unexpected one then he directed a stern look at harry ready with your wand focusing his attention back on the coffin snape waved his wand and lifted the top of the coffin off with a curiously wet thwacking sound harry shuddered he d heard of inferi before and had no desire to meet one of the undead but he peeked over the edge of the stone circle to see the innards of the coffin anyway it was completely full of slimy green water and the smell that came wafting off of it was heinous harry almost gagged professor snape made no movement but turned his head slightly it appears that his mother was at least part veela they like to be buried in water no they loathe any moisture in their casket because it quickly deprives them of their beauty most are embalmed this would be an insult of enormous proportions he swished his wand and emptied the casket of water inside a skeleton was lying with a curious locket of shining gold around its neck that would be the key harry walked around the low circular wall which remained from the pedestal and leaned back over to get a better look it looked like a normal locket in every way but when snape raised his wand and muttered a soft word the locket chimed a clear bright note as if a bell had been struck by a hammer as the note faded harry noticed that snape seemed to be waiting for a response harry waited with him the air seemed expectant almost vibrating with tension or wait it was vibrating there was a sound growing louder every second a vibrating humming buzz that was coming from the archway itself sending the black tattered curtain into a frenzy of spasms harry stood and raised his wand to destroy the archway not yet the link is still viable snape shouted holding an arm outstretched to harry harry eyed the skeleton in the coffin nervously snape waved his wand and muttered something indistinct something that seemed to concentrate the magic in the air harry closed his eyes and sensed the power surrounding the locket and how it stretched to protect the opening of the archway yes if the locket were destroyed then the gateway would be damaged and vulnerable to magical attack the vibrating grew higher pitched and much louder harry opened his eyes pressing one hand against the ache in his ears while holding his wand hand aloft snape had already sliced through the gold chain and was attempting to destroy the locket and then the sound grew even higher like the scream of a teapot on full boil the shriek of a fwooper and the scrape of a saw on wood all concentrated into one intensely painful blast harry tried to cover his ears more fully then desperately slung as powerful a silencing charm as he could at the locket in snape hands it worked but on snape the professor turned an outraged look on harry who hastily undid his spell before succumbing to the sound both hands pressed to his ears he fell to his knees it was up to snape if he couldn t but then it stopped harry looked up and peered over the edge of the low wall snape was pressing one hand to his ear a look of pain on his face on the floor lay small bits of gold nothing more do it snape said through clenched teeth harry shook his head and stood raising his wand the archway before him hadntchanged but the magic had altered it greatly harry sensed that it was fluctuating seeking an anchor to hold it in place it wasntgoing to find one do it now harry erected the shield in his mind and threw his strongest possible reductor curse but the jet of light hit the stone and spread across its surface like an emerald wash then disappeared harry looked down at snape who was giving him a disgusted sneer i guess if i want something done i d better do it myself but harry felt something stirring in the air you might want to put a shield snape lifted an eyebrow or what i might get injured by a and the archway blew up spitting pulverized rock rubble and dust into the air harry was on the ground instantly shield up trying to get the taste of boulder out of his mouth professor snape the concussion had hit harry rather hard and it was an effort to crawl to the low wall looking down on the crypt professor snape you thought perhaps that i could no longer apparate harry whirled around to see professor snape at the top of the steps leading to the dias smirking at him by the way nice spellwork harry stared for just a moment at the compliment before giving him a wan smile are we really done with the dementors now yes you might want to move snape said conversationally why harry looked around behind him but saw nothing stirring the stone of the archway was gone but the shape remained behind a gaping black wound in the air finally uncovered by its veil the lost souls will be exiting soon to join their demented bodies harry gave the wizard a look before scrambling to the farther reaches of the room then the trembling began again and a sad keening sound filled the room again the atmosphere in the room darkened energy crackled in the air as if a violent thunderstorm approached harry lowered himself to the ground wand up snape joined harry on the floor and both fixed their eyes on the veil to see something that few wizards would ever see in the beginning all was dark within the hole an inky blackness as solid as the stone arch had been then a light began to twinkle distantly so far that harry thought it might be his imagination playing tricks on him but then another light joined it and another and the pinpricks became streaks of light with a beginning in the far distance they were coming this way and fast the voices began again the whispering that harry had always heard behind the veil growing louder and louder as the streaks of light became brighter and then suddenly they were upon them two figures of glowing white exited the darkness first a short thin man with a droopy face wearing wispy old fashioned robes and a large woman with angry dark features they circled once and their expressions changed there was freedom in their movements and newfound peace on their faces as they flew out of the walls and then there were more tens more hundreds more coming so fast that harry could only get an impression of the many different kinds of wizards and witches that came through all of them had been turned into dementors harry shook his head then froze his gaze had caught on a tall thin man who was continuing to glide around the room when most had moved on the ghost was looking intently around the room as if he d lost something it was hard to get a look at his face but harry was already standing harry snape said beside him careful as harry stumbled down the stairs gaze fixed on the ghost above him tears jumped into his eyes brushing them away impatiently he tried to confirm what he already felt yes yes it was him sirius harry screamed through a suddenly raw throat i here turning the figure slowed and moved toward harry harry starving eyes watched every expression that flitted across the ghost face relief joy sadness love sirius held out his hands to harry and a smile grew on his face harry eyes filled and he couldnthelp but hold his hands up toward him just a little i ll be there soon sirius tell mum and dad sirius was shaking his head with an expression of grief he flew closer to harry bringing an intense flow of colder air with him it been a very long year sirius i didntthink i d make it now i have just a few more battles to fight and then i can be with you again sirius looked grieved he put out his hand and touched harry lightly on the head or at least tried to his mouth worked to form words h harry you can fight harder than that he smiled if you are t truly your mother son you will fight harder than that harry bowed his head and nodded i miss you he whispered and i you sirius whispered back so quietly that harry almost didnthear it when he looked up again sirius ghost was gone the room was quiet save the whispering of the last two ghosts enjoying their newfound freedom the veil was destroyed the dementors unable to harm anyone ever again and sirius was gone again harry feeling the familiar painful squeeze begin in his heart shut his eyes and tried to breathe sirius was right he had to fight harder his mother would want him to just as harry was opening his eyes his senses flared an incarcerous spell coming from what the split second hesitation made his desperate dodge too late ropes snaked themselves around him from shoulders to ankles making him teeter precariously silencio snape hissed and once again harry was so dumbfounded that the curse hit him easily snape had deceived him all of this was a lie why to get his help destroying the veil accio wand harry wand went winging to him furious harry jerked at the ropes and snarled at snape noiselessly almost dumping himself on the ground he never should have trusted him he never should have i tellin you that was him sirius bloody black ghost then how come i didnteven get so much as a glance tell me that voices coming from outside the room quiet but growing louder wait was that well you do have a tendency to go off scratching your arse at important moments good luck i was paying attention and saw that this is the room they all came from the twins oh really and why in the bloody hell would ghosts be fleeing from the department of mysteries tell me that probably smelt that ghastly aftershave you ve been wearing ever since paula pricklesleeve started coming round their footsteps stopped outside the door perish the thought probably smelt wormtail b o probably been at least four or five weeks since he bathed eh come on then one of the twins harry immediately saw that it was fred appeared inside the doorway eyes wide and jumping about the room taking in the destruction and finally coming to rest on harry who by this time was madly trying to gesture with his head for them to turn around harry bloody george had ducked his head in and as soon as he saw fred heading for harry whipped his head around to the left and caught sight of snape his shield went up just in time to save fred from being hit by a reductor curse fred turned and whipped out his own wand shouting several colorful names for the professor harry in an agony of helplessness watched with sinking heart as snape just sneered at the twins and easily blocked the first two curses they spun at him come to join the party then he flicked his wand and a jet of purple light just missed george winners take all harry are you all right harry nodded at george and jerked his head to snape as if to say forget me watch out for him i haventhurt the poor boy if that what you re worried about i admit i would like to but that wasntpart of my orders from the dark lord snape curled his lip as he spoke orders from the dark lord you bastard fred shouted and i always said you were too pathetic for voldemort to really use too broken and bitter he hurled a powerful incarcerous but snape blocked it less easily this time does that make you angry perhaps you should hang around and see what happens when i turn precious potter over to the death eaters they ve been waiting years for this he smiled and harry saw the merciless cold devil he d always hated in snape and yet something didntseem quite right in what he was saying you ll have to go through us george said moving slowly to join his brother why dontyou just stay right there snape swiped his wand and nothing happened then suddenly the stone in front of george grew tall and split in two the giant arms for that is what they looked like now reached around george and clamped around him tightly fred gave a cry of alarm and hit the stone with several spells but nothing worked harry fought to made a noise any noise to remind fred of the danger to himself but was of no use and just as he d foreseen snape simply repeated his spell and enclosed fred in a like stone embrace harry tried to move couldn t tried to focus to bring up the screen in his mind just as he got it up snape began speaking try it potter and i ll kill them harry met the black eyes with hatred but gave in thank you accio wands there i have no need to hurt you spawn of weasley and will be more than happy to leave you for the returning aurors to find if there are any once i have a simple piece of information his voice was silk wrapped menace and harry thought he could happily kill the evil wizard right now if he were free from the curses spewing out of both of the twins mouths it appeared they agreed with harry then snape waved his wand and fred screamed i said i have no need to hurt you but i will unless you tell me where you put wormtail i am responsible for him you see fred was manfully battling the tremors that racked his body while snape stepped closer to him leave him alone george bellowed kicking uselessly against his stone captor his arms pinned tightly against his sides would you like your brother to feel the same pain snape gestured loosely to george i dontcare george returned let him do it fred or perhaps you might not care to see our gryffindor savior battling the same agony snape wand strayed to harry as fred hesitated white hot pain sliced through harry midsection and he couldnthelp but fold in his bonds his face contorted the pain was brief in fact by the time he was on his knees the pain was already gone harry looked up in surprise bastard george shouted wormtail is in the atrium fred ground out with fury in his eyes there was no one in the auror office to process him so we made a cage for him a proper cage for a rat he smiled grimly not sure what good that information will do you anyway harry will still get away and then you ll know what pain feels like snape gave him an oily smile your faith is touching hold on to that the worst is yet to come lazily he began to swish his wand back and forth back and forth muttering words that harry couldnthear he looked at fred and george with alarm horrified to see that their eyes were closing no he cried out silently snape was capable of anything anything once the twins had fallen over slumped in a bewitched sleep and harry had rediscovered how impossible it was to free himself snape turned to harry continuing the same motion harry shook his head yes snape whispered you do need to sleep you have a very long night ahead of you harry and you need to rest sleep his voice fell to a whisper harry felt his eyelids closing but could do nothing to prevent it his body was shutting down of its own accord and he was lying on the floor staring up at snape when everything went blurry his eyes began to close ginny he whispered soundlessly ginny chapter 3 interim bored harry lay in the third bed to the left in hogwarts hospital wing languid after his brush with death watching the dust motes dance in the shaft of sunset washed light he d been here far too long already the other students would be arriving any minute and yet madame pomfrey insisted on having him rest longer i taking no chances with you mr potter she had said as she pressed him back into bed with a practiced hand not after the summer you ve had no you at least need to start off the year well enough no matter that i cantever seem to keep you that way she d muttered that last part while waving her wand to check the healing of his ribs then he d been forced to take another draught of that horrible bone healing potion and stay in bed another hour the potion had been nasty but nowhere near the agonizing ordeal of his last experience here after the poisoning just the memory of that made him nauseous so harry shied away from thinking about it once again letting his gaze drift about the deserted room to the carved stone of the high ceiling and finally to the closed white doors at the end of the infirmary in his mind he could see a big black dog suddenly bursting through them he would give anything to make it a reality and to see the dog become a man and to hear sirius go off onto one of his completely unreasonable lectures on risk taking oh even that harry would suffer gladly a deep sigh racked his still sore ribs they were waiting for the breaks to heal before taking care of the bruising with mounting frustration harry mind reached for better thoughts as had been his pattern of late his mind caught on ginny she should be here soon on the hogwarts express with the others which he reminded himself dumbledore insisted was perfectly safe there were disguised aurors and the entire d a on board as well as the added protection of charlie guarding his friends in the guise of harry potter taking polyjuice potion every hour to keep the illusion for the duration it was difficult to believe that it was already time for term to begin the summer had been a blur of pain and anger blood and fear culminating in his ejection from the dursleys home the place he had officially called home for sixteen years the dursleys had bargained to be rid of him for good accepting another house on the other side of town in exchange for one more week of the safety of blood magic that would be enough to keep harry safe for the coming year of course in spite of that arrangement they d tossed harry out the front door at the first sign of death eaters on the front lawn harry gritted his teeth dumbledore had gone into more talks with the dursleys but so far had not pursued charges against them harry almost understood why though all the weasleys especially ginny and mrs weasley were vocal in their anger about it if this were to go to trial there was the very real danger of lucius or some other powerful death eater forcing the wizengamot to swing penalties against harry or some other such nonsense the near miss during the trial last summer after harry use of magic against the dementors had been proof enough and of course there was the fact that the dursleys needed to be protected from tom in spite of the fact that they hated all wizardry and wanted no help at all taking this to trial would bring the dursleys attention that could be very very dangerous most wizards would assume that harry loved his family and there were wizards who would hurt them for no larger reason than that the idea of the dursleys being attacked again because of him made harry mouth go dry he could not love them as he should but he still cared it was just another reason to settle this quickly tom needed to be dealt with and harry well he couldnttake another summer like this past one his real vacation hadnteven begun until after malfoy had left the burrow the prat acid tongue and bitterness about his father had made him extremely hard to endure though to be honest he had gone quiet just before he left to go to snape unplottable mountain chateau which apparently was a family holiday spot that snape rarely visited instead of the punchline to some outrageously silly joke malfoy had remained there during the last week and a half of summer hols and things around the burrow had gotten much easier harry had been able to recuperate more fully once he felt he could relax or at least mostly relax but the git repeated assertion in private that ginny was harry greatest weakness had continued to play in harry head while malfoy was there harry d spoke to ginny only when necessary but once the git was gone harry found himself naturally watching her and trying to not watch her which only resulted in him being aware of himself not watching her which wasntany better in the end he came to the conclusion that he d always sort of watched ginny always noticed her without really noticing and now trying not to be aware of her in a room just made him that much more aware of her he thought however that he d at least kept his difficulties to himself and no one else had noticed but he was wrong harry flushed under the white sheets remembering three nights ago he had been playing chess with ron and trying to not watch ginny it had made his hands sweat to see how little control he had over something that in the past had seemed so easy x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x harry leaned forward and nudged his pawn not seeing any imminent danger from ron players at the moment the pawn looked up at him sighed and then trudged forward with the air of a condemned man going to the gallows as soon as the play was done ron leaned forward eagerly in his chair always a bad sign then came the lopsided grin as he reached for the board which could only mean disaster harry sighed and flicked his eyes over at ginny again without meaning to of course she was still reading her crimson hair piled in a flaming waterfall over one shoulder as she rested on the window seat of the living room harry could tell she was distracted by something she was turning the pages slowly much more slowly than usual in front of her on the couch hermione sat flipping through her new arithmancy book and mumbling to herself already hard at work though it was still almost two weeks before term began it was a normal night here at the burrow post dementor attack harry was still surprised that it had been deemed safe enough for everyone to let him stay here but then grimmauld place had been compromised so there really wasntany other option harry shook his head the fidelius charm had failed again just like it had for his parents there always seemed to be someone ready to betray them at least this time no one had died this time though mrs weasley had been injured that memory always brought tightness into harry chest the burrow had been attacked just to get to him and he hated the thought that he was bringing them all more danger just by accepting their invitation of hospitality suddenly ginny slammed down the book she had been reading harry jerked his gaze away from where it had been stuck on her and down at the chess board cursing himself inwardly his face was flaming what is it ron asked him curiously then looked up at ginny who had just stopped beside them harry glanced up caught in an instant by the way her hair swirled around her shoulders and her brown eyes narrowed in challenge well what is it she snapped at harry hands settling onto her hips er nothing stammered harry he swallowed hard as he looked back at the board jerking his knight over to block ron rook geroff it my turn protested ron along with the tiny irate knight setting the piece back much to its satisfaction where your brain at mate his brain must be stuck somewhere over my head because that where he been staring at for the past hour and a half ginny said heatedly no er i mean i was just thinking in your general direction that all harry averted his eyes from ginny back to the chess board as his cheeks went crimson again he thought he had caught a faint smile on her face liar she said without venom i just didntwant you to think i hadntnoticed that all and with that she walked back over to the chair and scooped up her book harry breathed a sigh of relief as she continued on up the stairs your move ron said cheerfully his grin self satisfied harry studied the board disheartened to see that his much beleaguered knight had joined the other black pieces that had been smashed and dragged off the board he hadnteven noticed so began ron in an odd voice i probably shouldnteven ask this so don t said hermione in a loud voice from over on the couch harry turned to look at her and saw one of her warning looks being passed to ron ask what harry piped up his curiosity piqued ask if you ve been staring at my little sister for a reason ron replied with a twinkle in his eyes ron hermione warned of course not harry said loudly and he hoped convincingly he was going to have to get better at this by the time they headed to school but then again there would be a lot more to occupy his mind there the d a quidditch if they let him play and snape snape and that newt level potions class probably the awkwardness or whatever it was would go away by then by the time harry faded back into the conversation hermione was telling ron off i think i ll turn in he interrupted quickly sure mate go on up this game ll keep i ll be up in a bit ron stammered a bit and his ears turned pink a sure sign of subterfuge harry just nodded and smiled over at hermione night hermione good night harry sleep well she smiled sweetly at him and he felt a bit better but as he walked up the stairs the lone one of the trio a feeling swept over him that he didntlike but remembered very well from fourth year loneliness it stayed with him tainting his thoughts as he lay in bed for nearly an hour after getting ready for bed shuffling his way through dim possible futures horrors unknown and triumphs unseen for neither can live while the other survives that night harry dreamed horribly but woke no one with his cries even ron slept through all of it like most of his bad dreams lately it had centered on his time in malfoy manor and the abuse he had suffered at lucius malfoy hands when he awoke in a cold sweat with the bloody hall of mirrors vaporizing into the darkness of ron room it was hard to tell which he was more grateful for the wand gripped in his hand or the bedclothes completely covering him lucius had crossed a line that night making humiliation a part of the night torture it made it impossible for harry to feel normal impossible to leave it behind and the veiled threat that draco had made about future abuse being worse harry pulled up the gray screen in his mind and forced his breathing to slow to normal if he allowed it to dominate his thoughts this way then lucius had won harry decided to make another list one a bit different from his ways to keep my friends from gettting killed list it took only a few minutes to write down everything on his mind to do list 1 kill lucius 2 kill tom 3 master procclumency occlumency 4 kiss a girl on purpose 5 survive in the end the list was a bit surprising wanting to kiss a girl was new and seemed completely out of place on the list but the thought was as a siren call to him something that glowed with normalcy and felt wholesome less desperate he had to keep it on there so far he d only had that one kiss with cho which hadnteven been a particularly good one he wasntsure but he thought that probably maybe it would have been nicer if it had been someone not crying and someone he was moved to kiss on his own cho was completely out of the picture now so he would have to stay on the look out for someone someone special someone amazing and fabulous and brave they d have to be brave to want to be around harry potter he smiled bitterly at that and since he wasntsure he would survive killing tom in fact he had an inkling that tom would only go if he could take harry with him kissing a girl simply had to go higher up on the list so he revised it to do list 1 master procclumency occlumency 2 kiss a girl on purpose a good kiss too 3 kill tom 4 kill well put lucius out of commission 5 survive that was better after organizing his thoughts harry felt better and was able to go back to sleep quickly this time to a dreamless rest x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x harry extra hour of rest was finally up but madame pomfrey was nowhere to be seen he eased himself out of bed and slipped on his shoes again it was curious to him that dumbledore hadnteven shown up here to talk things over with him but then again malfoy had been here all afternoon probably whinging for attention plus there had been all the stunned death eaters to deal with as well as grawp dumbledore probably had quite enough on his hands harry knew what to do now anyway it was all prearranged quietly he grabbed his broom and eased out of the infirmary moving cautiously toward the astronomy tower it was fine if a teacher saw him or even a student just as long as two of him werentspotted and right now with charlie heading his way in an invisibility cloak the chances were small but not nonexistent that it could happen epilogue remus lupin was slouched back in his chair one arm slung over his face hovering between slumber and waking as usual his nightmares began before he slept the image of harry bloodied battered and fighting to survive voldemort attack on his mind and soul was burned into remus psyche a mirthless smile crossed his face when he was old and drooling he d be able to sketch that picture out in full detail that picture as well as the picture of harry in st mungo s silent still and in a coma remus had lost count of how many hours he d sat representing harry parents and godfather waiting for the least sign of improvement a futile mission something even the most optimistic healers had agreed upon there had never been this type of injury before so there could be no agreed upon treatment as always damn him harry defied the rules remus felt the familiar weight pressing on his chest the sign that it wouldntbe long before either rage or tears would claim him harry didntdeserve this once again he d sacrificed so much to benefit so many and thus far he was the only one alive unable to enjoy the fruits of his labor the fact was the entire wizarding world had changed in the three weeks since voldemort death almost the entire ministry had been put to death including nearly all the loyal aurors leaving an enormous hole in the fabric of the political realm of course there was no shortage of witches and wizards to fill the positions but the public was nervous after that horrible night when the ministry of magic and hogwarts had been breached and all the captives taken to hell manor the public had been difficult to reassure in a way it had been surprising to see bill weasley take the reins his name was known to people as his father son and as a friend of harry s as were all the weasleys perhaps things might have been different if percy and fred hadntbeen lost and if molly wasntprostrate with grief but as it was arthur as the sole surviving member of the ministry was in no shape to capitalize on the need for public figures when asked by his father bill stepped up his charm and ease in front of people great or small his great love for harry the enormity of his family losses and his involvement in the rescue at hell manor all put him forward and he was asked more and more often to speak to the public on the ministry behalf as heartbroken as he was bill was one of those people who could put personal pain aside and do what must be done now there were rumors he would be asked to run as the next minister of magic strange days bill weasley minister of magic strange days indeed strange just to be sitting here post voldemort knowing the bastard would never be able to come back knowing that bellatrix lestrange lucius malfoy and most of the death eaters were dead as well it was a new dawn for the wizarding world and its hero couldnteven blink his eyes clenching a fist remus sat up and looked down the hall to where ginny weasley and her mum were sitting outside harry room that was unusual at first when the healers asked them to leave they got an earful of angry weasley women which was daunting to say the least but today he hadntheard a raised word from either of them as they were shown the door they knew time was running out remus leaned his head back against the wall if only george would give up this vendetta but no that wasntfair being a werewolf was one thing but a vampire fred was as good as dead unless the vampire who bit him was found and staked charlie and george had been gone nearly two weeks now chasing lead after lead killing vampires that had helped voldemort cause so far they had destroyed eight while sustaining only minor injuries themselves none of them had been the correct vampire now there had been no word for two days from them and all the weasleys were on pins and needles especially fred who was detained on the west wing of the first floor in the life threatening creature induced injury ward of the hospital ron was trying to keep him occupied and positive but then he was only out of the hospital bed for hours at a time himself that bond was the difficulty still draining magical energy from ron and yet it was now the only hope they had for harry now harry wasntrecovering his wounds had been extremely slow to heal and the healers could only point to the link that was forged between the weasleys and himself the fraterdum singletus but that should help him recover ginny had insisted he can take whatever he needs from us yes he should agreed the healer an older woman with sad eyes who caressed harry forehead as though he was her own child and i sure it is what has kept him alive this far but even though he can take the magical energy from you to survive i think he fighting it i dontunderstand why ginny had started sobbing and arthur had pulled her into his arms teary eyed himself ron sitting exhausted and pale said he is taking some i can feel it he ll be all right ginny harry was in a coma but he was still harry it made sense that he would fight it just after that ginny had come up with an idea to get around harry perhaps if they could all get together all the brothers and ginny who shared that bond with harry and somehow communicate to him that they were all right that they had energy to spare oh it was a long shot as no one knew how much harry could hear or understand what was happening around him but it just might work if only george would come home remus thoughts strayed to hogwarts now closed and dark the battle there had been fierce and surprising voldemort had sent the dementors to swarm the castle while most of the order was still fighting house elves and aurors inside only a few desperate order members were able to get outside to use their patronuses and hold them off they had been trying to get to hagrid who had unexpectedly charged off on his own angrily waving his umbrella at the intruders the dementors were drawn to him remus whose eagle patronus was on its way watched in horror as they swarmed in a dark halo over the half giant circling so tightly that hagrid was hidden from view then something totally miraculous happened something that could not be rationally explained flowing onto the field scurried hundreds of spiders from smaller ones that could barely be seen to larger ones that made remus pull back in disgust they were all heading straight for hagrid and a dark shadow or what remus thought was a shadow crawled onto the pitch it was gargantuan moving at a speed that defied its size over its head it held an enormous limp corpse and it was headed right for hagrid alarmed remus began to run down the path and he arrived just in time to see the enormous spider laid a manticore corpse at unconscious hagrid feet then hagrid was picked up bodily by the large spider which used four legs to wave up at the dementors in impotent rage the smaller spiders were swaying in place all over the stands giving the entire arena the illusion of movement remus was horrified contemplating attack and it was a few moments more before his stunned mind could realize that the creature had actually saved hagrid from the dementors and saved everyone possibly from the manticore as well hagrid had always had an unusual bond with large creatures could this creature be repaying his friendship now then there was the sound of hoofbeats and remus swung around to see something else his mind deemed impossible centaurs heading for the castle shouting in surprise remus started to follow then stopped remembering hagrid when he turned around the enormous spider was crawling off with his large unmoving burden and the dementors had pulled back up into the sky remus fighting himself for just a moment to trust something as monstrous as that spider sprinted for the castle the centaurs parted to let him through then turned to stand guard amazingly enough after that the dementors couldntget past them remus had stood in awe as the dementors came forward time after time only to pull away as soon as the centaurs moved in their direction centaurs and spiders one of them a towering wreck of a spider had come from the forest to hagrid rescue could it be that hagrid had recruited them for the fight against voldemort or had they come out of some sense of loyalty to the friendly half giant either way as a result the castle had been protected hours later to the amazement of all the dementors had frozen in midair and their bodies dissolved into dark mist in under a minute all traces of the dark beings had been driven away by a gentle wind rejoicing from behind their barricade the order members had gathered themselves and set out to clear the castle they were soon joined by the centaurs who then proved to be invaluable in routing out bad house elves and evil aurors and freeing harry very worried friends on the third floor who had been trapped in a room defending themselves from occasional attacks remus had been there to rescue them had seen the devastation on their faces as they recounted how harry had been taken from them remus had been at a loss to understand why the castle had betrayed them so badly there followed a mass exodus down to the dungeon where they had found a pile of ash next to the smoldering remains of lucius malfoy wand draco had turned white at the sight before wandering away putting up a hand to stop hermione from following harry had not been found ginny had been enraged inconsolable the rest had tried to comfort each other but tears ran freely it was hours before word reached them of what severus had done and where harry had been taken hell manor snape hadntbetrayed them after all an attack had been mounted the most diverse in wizarding history every able bodied witch and wizard of age the order could scrounge up as well as some younger who refused to be left behind as this fight was for harry as well as the freedom of the wizarding world the young ones were allowed to come accompanied by grawp whose anger at the sight of unconscious hagrid made him an ideal attacker house elves who had proved themselves loyal and a few goblins that bill weasley had befriended in his work as a cursebreaker unfortunately the wizarding wireless broadcast had reached them as they traveled and it was impossible to describe the horror and rage as they listened to voldemort torture and kill their friends and loved ones harry had been unfailingly brave and his terrible pain his tears had fueled the ensuing battle that battle at hell manor had been something raw bloody and fierce sirius would have loved it remus smiled a smile that quickly faded the element of surprise had gained them far more than would have been expected even though voldemort forces were called in quickly in the end they had formed a deadly arrowhead that moved slowly forward to the entrance of hell manor no matter what creatures stood in their way it had been a bloody merciless march though they had tried to contain the kids far to the inside as back up for those spearheading the attack their strategy moved from defensive to violent offensive the closer they had gotten to the entrance many had fallen and been apparated out but the middle of the pack had survived and run inside ahead of those still battling that was the reason remus had been so late had only gotten to harry after voldemort had possessed him it wasntright here he sat old used up and past his prime while harry lay dying how could he face sirius after footsteps came echoing down the hall multiple footsteps determined footsteps remus sat up expectantly and as the first weasley came around the corner lurched to his feet it was charlie followed by fred helping a weak looking george oi remus charlie called to him let get the boy who lived back on his feet eh remus smiled as he saw fred face no longer haggard and deeply shadowed the redhead had gotten his natural color back and was smiling though george was injured a bandage wound around his right arm and his walk favoring his left leg the slight relaxed smile on his face crowed his success remus shook charlie hand enthusiastically good to see you charlie of course but where s bill here called bill good naturedly as he came around the corner and so itsy he said as he ruffled ron hair beside him cut it out ron grouched i taller than you now ginny down the hall was shrieking out to them fred george you did it mrs weasley overwhelmed just cried and held her arms out for someone to fill them fred picked ginny up and swung her around yes he did it the stubborn old goat george grinned and thumped fred on the ear didntwant a vampire bat in the family we re batty enough as it is he did have a little help you know charlie put in over top of his mum head she was held tight in his arms sniffing and resting against his chest as though this was food for her soul little being the operative word there george said with bated breath as fred helped lower him to the bench by harry room good show george remus reached out to put a hand on his shoulder i didntlike your chances out there alone or not but you did a man work your family has much to thank you for george clearly taken aback by remus words turned positively scarlet and fiddled with the bandage on his arm charlie grinned oh come on remus bill groaned dontyou know better than to directly praise one of the twins it ll go straight to his head as it should fred said staunchly giving george a nudge oh just shut up about him and let get inside ginny urged harry needs us mrs weasley reached out to grab ginny hand of course dear the brothers exchanged grim determined looks bill opened the door for the others after you he said gallantly remus filed in the room with the others surprised to see that even with this many people harry room still appeared far too large for one young man in one bed it was a nice room the nicest st mungo had to offer soft buttercream colored walls dark rose wooden floors carved ivory lamps hung around the room and a glowing sky light overhead then remus forced his eyes upon the occupant in the bed noticing as he did so that he wasntthe only one uncomfortable doing so the weasley brothers were shifting a lot as they stood by harry bed listening to him take breath after labored breath looking at him before glancing away with good reason harry looked terrible he d been cleaned up but his skin still held a ghastly gray pallor that no healer had been able to correct most of him was under cover of blankets but remus knew more than he could see harry broken finger hadnthealed it remained swollen and had to be spelled clean of blood collecting there every day as well as the injury to his left knee his back was still raw and he necessarily hovered over his bed instead of lying snugly against the sheets a desperate measure to get his back to heal small things but of major concern since no one knew why he wasnthealing or what psychic or magical injuries harry had sustained on the inside if harry did not heal soon then the toll on his body would be too great he would die so ron spoke up and then cleared his throat what do have to do all hold hands or what ginny nodded do we all know what to do yes remus nodded and waited for them to get into position tense looks went around the circle as the weasleys stepped forward around harry bed and grabbed hands looking around remus set the scene in his mind they were all holding hands bill at the head of the bed beside ginny who was holding charlie hand next came george wincing already at the pull on his injured arm and then fred who was gripping ron hand bill and ron very gently took harry hands remus stepped up behind ron and focused briefly on harry who up close looked even more fragile than the last time remus had seen him is everyone ready the weasleys with determined looks on their faces nodded remus raised his wand and whispered procclumens into harry mind he placed the image of the weasleys around him their concern and love for harry palpable they are well now harry you protected them as long as you could now you must let them help you they would rather give part of themselves to you than to have you leave them forever they love you harry as do i if i could give you what i have left i would take what i cantgive harry take what they can please surely harry wouldntcontinue to ignore the bond surely a whisper of wind blew through the room ginny looked around with bright eyes then focused back on harry that right come on harry let us help you a silver glow suddenly bathed bill face he looked down at his hand in shock where it held harry s the silver glow came from inside his grip that it he whispered go on harry then he threw his head back in sudden swift agony and fell to his knees shocked everyone stared i okay bill said voice tight but hold on get ready the light was suddenly in ginny hand where hers clasped bill s oh she took several deep breaths and then gasped her eyes grew wide and she slowly sank to the floor by bill ginny mrs weasley cried are you oh my oh charlie though he stayed on his feet leaned on the bed heavily as the silver light traveled through him and out of his other hand fred then george quickly received the same jolt and gripped each other hand tightly as they fought the pain ron pale as a ghost by this time was nonetheless determined and steady as it came his turn that right harry do it do it i ready he whispered through gritted teeth the light seemed to glow the brightest as it traveled his body and from ron violent response it seemed to hurt him the most he went to his knees his back arching his body shaking but he did not let go of harry hand or of george s now a complete circuit was made and remus watched in stunned amazement and a little concern as the weasleys fought to breathe to stay upright and to be faithful to provide for harry needs it was ten minutes later at least when ron finally dropped harry hand and fell back in a slump remus caught him and helped him back to collapse on a chair are you all right ron fine just just gonna half a mo he said groggily mrs weasley scurried over to him touching and patting him kissing his hair and murmuring motherly things tears in her eyes george relaxed next and sat down abruptly on the floor eyes wide and blinking fred moved more slowly grasping the bed on his way down anyone catch the name of that bus wha bus george said vaguely catching himself on his good arm as he swayed the one that just hit me a bus hit you george asked looking confused didntit hit you oh he looked at his injured arm and smiled vaguely yeah i think it did oh you two mrs weasley chided as she touched both of them are you all right they both nodded but seemed glad to lean on her charlie released ginny hand and started walking it off limping and working his hands as though they had cramped badly bloody hell he muttered ginny once released pulled herself up by the bedrails pale as harry now she stared down at him intently looking for a sign of change mrs weasley stood and curried over to her hands out wide ginevra are you all right ginny nodded her gaze fixed on harry bill the last one to be freed stood still as harry hand dropped from his weaving a bit back and forth on his feet he walked over on shaky legs and sat in the nearest chair at least we know now why he wasntdoing it that might have killed someone if they tried to take it on all at once shaking his head in wonder he said did we did we do it i dontknow ginny said sounding tearful he looks the same to me she sat down abruptly on the bed does he to you remus leaned forward to see harry more clearly perhaps but i dontdoubt that what you just sacrificed will do him some good ginny give it time remus looked around at the weasleys splayed about the room many people will thank you for what you did today i know i do the light in the room darkened slowly as the day faded and the weasleys didntstir remus left reluctantly after a few hours feeling the need to check on several aurors who were still recovering as well ginny who had figured on staying indefinitely saying something vague to herself about until the bloody boy wakes up was surprised to find the room still so crowded someone had brought in more chairs and hermione brought in a platter of food but ginny didntwant to sit or eat she just watched harry was it her imagination or was he less pale now after dark a healer came in to give harry a potion for sustenance and general healing despair fought to take ginny as she watched the healer wave her wand and harry limp body respond as directed but then ginny gasped harry hand the left one the un bandaged one had twitched leaning forward ginny watched his fingers emotion gathering strength like a forest catching on fire harry heads around the room perked up what is it ginny charlie said jumping to his feet he he moved i think slowly the family gathered around the bed forcing the healer to squeeze between them to escape i d better get the head healer she called out a bit alarmed by the tension and intensity on their faces the weasleys and hermione stood staring at harry willing him to move to wake c mon harry c mon ron whispered tears filling his eyes hermione gripped his hand but said nothing and then there it was a flutter of eyelashes a grimace and harry gave a soft moan the room erupted in cheers he awake he awake harry all right we did it we did it harry opened his eyes to find ginny beside him in happy tears and the rest of the weasleys alternating between hugging each other vigorously slapping each other on the back and doing a silly jig around the room mad he pronounced in a croaking voice starkers the whole lot of you but they hardly stopped preferring to celebrate after three long weeks of worry mad about you ginny whispered as she leaned down are you all right he tried to smile you mean besides the racking pain yes she laughed through her tears besides that i dunno i just and then tears came swallowing him whole despite his fiercest efforts to hold them back neville was dead dumbledore was dead mcgonagall percy snape had died to protect him and and harry sobbed into his damaged hands fierce grief ripping into him after a minute he realized that the room was emptying itself and the cacophony of somewhat quieter voices went down the hallway but harry could hear more celebrations already beginning he is awake cheers came echoing back harry potter is awake footsteps came running approaching the door in a mad rush and harry turned away he couldntface them not now ginny stood briefly and the door slammed shut locking with a firm click someone was trying to force the door then trying to spell it open open this door open it right now i say sorry ginny called out in a sweet voice come back later he resting young lady we need to get in to see harry potter this is of grave medical concern i sure it is ginny snapped back but you wontbe getting in for a while yet he fine harry tried to smile but tears kept getting in the way he turned his head aside into ginny thigh and let them come it was miserable horrible the sobs wrenched at his chest and there was no end in sight his head hurt his back his leg his hand as well as his heart but he couldntstop eventually he became aware of ginny holding him kissing his hair murmuring words of love and comfort ceaselessly a few of her tears dropped on his arm and he suddenly found himself shuddering to a stop ginny wiped his face with a tissue gently and he took it from her with his good well better hand he blew his nose weakly and felt the bottom suddenly drop out from under him he could barely keep his eyes open ginny started combing her fingers through his hair and he soon found himself drifting i i wanted shhhh harry sleep all alright with a hurting but lighter heart he slept when harry awoke the room was still quiet and vacant though he had the sense that some time had passed ginny harry she was by his side in an instant handing him his glasses which had apparently survived even hell manor as ginny came into sharp focus he could see the relief on her face were you worried it was just that you were so still and it was like you d never woken up how long he croaked just two hours feel better harry checked himself then nodded he did feel better though strange ginny smiled so happily that her dimple came out of hiding i let a few of them in to give you a potion for pain especially but i kicked them back out as soon as they were done harry finally thought to put into words something he d been wondering ever since he woke up why am i floating because of your back of course it was a bloody mess harry his eyes lost in the familiar beauty of ginny face reached out to take her hand he smiled probably a bit too big i love you oh i love you too she teared up leaned over and kissed his hand pressing her cheek against his skin i especially love you on pain medicine you re so funny harry grinned finding himself funny as well and all i doing is lying here imagine how funny i ll be when i get up i still just glad you re awake i didntthink you d ever wake up neither did i harry turned his thoughts to the subject of being dead which he almost had been it seemed a fascinating thing suddenly you know i was ready to go to be with my parents again and sirius but then when i saw sirius i promised him i d try harder to stay and to fight so i did ginny stared at him a moment then caressed his face with a gentle hand smiling does this mean i get to keep you this seemed a strange question to harry what will you marry me harry blinked several times mouth slightly agape shocked beyond thought you mean you want to marry me of course i do do you think i d do all this go to hell manor and fight death eaters hold you dying in my lap while sending you memories then sit around for three weeks while you lie dead to the world then give up half my magical energy just to let you go off and marry some manky veela or half witted beauxbatons witch who doesntknow anything about you harry was reaching for ginny greatly concerned because she by the end of her rant was standing up shouting at him i sorry i sorry of course i ll marry you i love you i dontwant any monkey veela or half baton girl or any other girl i want you ginny of course i do please sit back down ginny wiped away a few tears and sat taking harry hand sorry it been hard they sat in silence for some moments before identical warm smiles started sprouting on their faces harry was slowly rubbing her hands with his the truth slowly dawning on him he d done it he d killed voldemort the world was an open place to him now he and ginny could marry would marry and if they got married then there would be a lot more kissing and other things harry felt his face flame you know ginny ventured it going to be difficult to get married without the entire wizarding world barging in and taking over really harry said quickly trying to get his mind off the very exciting train it had been on er why that he wondered aloud the whole wizarding world had tuned into that broadcast they didntwant to of course but it was too important to miss so they all heard you defy voldemort and how brave you were harry shifted in the bed feeling his happiness deflate like a punctured balloon then you heard it too ginny nodded i sorry about percy terribly sorry she nodded again and took a deep breath it been hardest on mum but let not think about that right now she looked at him with a sweet smile are you ready for the healers now er sure he lied ginny unlocked the door and a rush of healers came in lecturing and chiding as they headed for harry it was a bit overwhelming as harry was unbundled medicated cleaned and ultimately made more comfortable hermione and ron came in grinning at some point after harry was redressed you look great mate ron said looking pale and weak you look terrible harry replied hating that he had once again drained ron worth it still look better than you did earlier ron returned hermione stood at the head of his bed smoothing back harry hair tentatively she bent over and whispered to him you are an amazing wizard harry potter now no more worry as she straightened up harry was amazed to see how much older and mature she looked ron came to stand beside her his arm loped over her shoulders stop whispering sweet nothings to him hermione ginny got that covered already oh you ve nothing to worry about hermione waved a hand at him vaguely i love harry like you love ginny ron made a face eugh well maybe not exactly hermione laughed but you get the point how draco harry suddenly thought to ask he wanted to come but felt odd he canthear your thoughts anymore that a relief harry and ginny said at the same time then laughed yes i not sure what he ll do now he lost his whole family and all of his friends hermione said pensively no he hasntlost all of his friends harry said firmly keep an eye on him for him will you until i get out of here ron grumbled but hermione nodded of course ginny leaned over and gave harry a kiss what that for for being so you she said with a smile you re looking much better mr potter the head healer beamed as she walked back over to the bed and lowered him down so that he was finally resting on the bed even your back is healing nicely now it a miracle it was love he said back softly looking at ron who promptly flushed and ginny who grasped his hand smiling oh now isntthat sweet the healer cooed ginny glared at her and the witch backed off i ll just go tidy up a bit outside call us if you need anything anything at all but harry laying there his friends nearby looking at the love of his life couldntthink of a thing he needed author note here i am all sniffly at the end after all thanks so much to all my readers without whom i never would have finished this thanks for your constant encouragement and patience and for those of you who found the story wanting in so many ways my deepest apologies i am still learning thanks to jk rowling without whom none of this would have been conceived what a great world for us to play in thanks to melindaleo without whom i never would have written any of this you re such a great friend and to chele my dear beta without whom this story would have been so much less than it was it been a great four years great in addition to the wonderful help of my usual beta mmmusings the re writing of the end of this chapter came as a direct result from melindaleo feedback thanks to both of my friends and fellow writers without you both this story would never have been written chapter four untrebled but not untroubled harry slipped into the tower and called out a greeting to his polyjuice double the harry that was charlie turned around with a relieved expression and immediately crossed to him harry he gave him a quick once over and grasped him warmly by the shoulders you all right yeah i fine charlie broke out in a wide un harry like grin if you ever answer that question any other way i ll know something really wrong he clapped harry once more on the shoulders and let him go so madame pomfrey got you all healed up then yeah i fine harry answered again trying harder to sound upbeat really good then charlie face lost all traces of a smile but what the bloody hell happened how could he stop you mid portkey harry shook his head dunno something to do with the connection i think but i broke free it fine charlie nodded but didntrelax his stance listen mate he said looking away briefly i dontknow how to say this but i dontthink you re in for a very good year harry stomach tensed as he stood and waited for the explanation that charlie obviously didntwant to give his look alike fidgeted then paced over to the window and stood staring out at the sky this may have seemed strange to someone who didntknow the weasleys as well as harry did but he knew this was merely evidence of the serious nature of charlie thoughts ron tended to deliberate in the same slow way if it was something that he was able to be unemotional about and it often proved to be a strength so harry waited and as he waited he had a good view of the weasley red that was starting to lighten the dark hair gathered at the nape of charlie as harry neck harry stared at it suddenly remembering the way malfoy had looked as him and remembering that lucius often wore his hair pulled back in a ponytail i definitely getting my hair cut harry mumbled what charlie said turning round nothing harry said quickly it just the only reason i let my hair grow out was because i couldntget out of the house to get it cut and now seeing it on everyone else i just i just want to be me again he stared at the floor feeling foolish charlie brightened oh well that an easy one to fix i cut my own hair you know i can do yours easy harry looked up really sure i can even practice on my hair before it goes back watch charlie pulled his wand out from the back pocket of his jeans with a wink i make a good harry potter dontyou think harry smiled and half sighed you make a better one than i do charlie grinned it a simple spell all you do is fix the cut you want in your mind wave the wand around your head three times and say abscissa coma his mostly jet black hair suddenly sprung free from its band and settled back into the familiarly messy short style that harry was used to seeing on himself there all kinds of fancier spells but no need for us blokes to use those what d you think harry watched in amazement as charlie hair chose that moment to slowly turn red in a rippling wave and lay flat again you and tonks would make quite a pair charlie looked startled what that your hair gone red again polyjuice potion must be wearing off charlie lifted a hand to scruff through his hair yeah nymphadora is something else charlie said in an odd voice harry stared at him you d better not let her hear you calling her that she a bit clumsy but she can still land some pretty strong hexes charlie cleared his throat and straightened up as if getting on with business want me to fix your hair yeah thanks harry walked over and stood still as charlie waved his wand around his head three times closed his eyes and said abscissa coma there was a tug all around his scalp and a lightness that made him want to run his fingers through his hair but then an image of his father scruffing up his own hair on purpose popped into his mind and harry stopped himself he didntever want to get vain not like that thanks charlie now what were you going to say earlier something about this year not being a good one for me charlie mouth set in a grim line and he shook his head i know it always been a bit rough here for you what with all the extra pressure and attention and all he looked off at the window again but i dontthink this kind attention is normal he turned a greenish gaze to harry that was meandering its way back to brown suddenly reminding harry of ginny maybe i just didntknow you were getting so many threats before were you harry stared at him blankly threats he searched his memory no i mean not beyond the dursleys or malfoy or his dad or well tom of course but after that it just the occasional defense against the dark arts teacher going mad on me most people just stare or try to conceal things or occasionally accuse me of being slytherin heir who threatened you charlie shook his head and freckles broke on his widening nose he scratched at them absently who didn t bloody hell harry seems like everyone was either trying to get my autograph or tell me how voldemort was going to do me in and how they were going to help him or trying to get into my pants harry blinked who was trying into your pants charlie grinned your pants mate not mine and i not answering that question as i d have to incriminate several young witches who should have bloody well known better hopefully i got my message across harry blinked again not sure if he was exactly relieved to hear that charlie had attempted to head off some admirers probably he should feel relieved yes except for the kissing thing would it be possible to kiss a girl like that someone who just knew his name and wanted to kiss him because he was famous possible yeah but maybe not so very nice but at least he might get to kiss a girl that way he was going to have to give this some thought i can see where your mind is stuck harry and not that i blame you charlie said slapping harry on the shoulder but you should really be thinking more along the lines of who threatening your life i pretty sure it was all just intimidation tactics probably typical stuff for death eaters in training but i dontknow i going to talk to dumbledore about it before i leave give him all the names well i mean if i leave if yeah something making me want to hang around i know the order wanted me to work at some other stuff right now but i dunno seems like i might be needed here harry first impulse came and went he knew better than to say he didntneed help if it hadntbeen for the weasleys he d never have survived the summer and malfoy had already warned him of something about the slytherins similar to what charlie said it couldnthurt to have more eyes watching them it would be nice to have you around charlie charlie whose bland muggle sweatshirt was now stretching tight across his widening chest looked surprised guess we finally got through to you eh what with you being an honorary weasley and all that good i ll let you know what dumbledore says thanks charlie for everything harry gave him a nod before turning toward the door i d better get downstairs yeah mate that feast smells fabulous i think i ll have to work my way down to the kitchens and nick a few things just tell dobby that i sent you and he ll do you right dobby yeah got it thanks mate harry turned and ran a hand through his hair feeling its strange but familiar messiness oy harry dropped his hand self consciously and turned you got your universal poison antidote with you right harry felt the bicep of his left arm where a thin leather band fit snugly on the inside of his arm he found nestled the small vial given to him by snape to counteract poison in any food he was served yeah it there good got mine too charlie tapped on his chest to indicate the vial concealed down underneath his sweatshirt given to him as it was to all the widely known members of the order of the phoenix with the rise of voldemort death eaters they were now all in danger happy eating charlie called after him harry waved and walked to the stairs with his mind now set on unpleasant things here at hogwarts he wasntplanning on needing to use the antidote at every meal but if something seemed amiss or if he suddenly felt wrong after a meal he was under strict orders to let a pellet of the crystallized potion melt on his tongue harry sighed he d worn the antidote band long enough that he d forgotten about it until charlie reminded him now he could feel it rubbing with every swing of his arm reminding him of the agony he d endured after eating that poisoned chocolate cake at the dursleys and reminding him of the fact that he really really didntwant to go through that again harry took the stairs as quickly as he could fixing his mind on the familiar sights and sounds of the dark castle around him and letting his memories recede after a few minutes the tenderness of the bruises around his abdomen had trebled he decided that he d better get back to the infirmary later for that other healing potion he d skipped out on better that than having to answer all the questions his roommates would have regarding his purpled torso they were going to have enough questions about the antidote band and the wand holder strapped to his right forearm as well as any rumors about his summer they d heard as harry reached the last landing a gentle roar of voices greeted him from the great hall and for just a moment the blossoming warmth of familiarity overtook him and he felt like he was home giddiness filled him an aura of excitement left over from his first year here and the new feelings of being cared for and liked no matter what else happened he would never forget the way this strange magical place had welcomed him and given him sanctuary from such a miserable existence but he reminded himself with a slowly sobering face things are changing have already changed too much from that first year he stopped at the foot of the stairs needing to catch his breath for he wasntin optimum shape after his nearly deadly summer he took the time to remember charlie words and malfoy warning hogwarts castle wasntreally home and the other students werentjust neutral background noise each of them would have to choose a side in this war if they hadntalready and suffer the consequences of their choice from what charlie said it sounded as if many of them already had against the boy who lived but harry knew that despite that he wouldntbe alone in the fight against tom at least the d a might stand with him and most of his own house there was a core group among them that he could trust but beyond that until he knew for certain where someone stood he would have to treat all the students with suspicion this was a war a war tom had started and harry couldntafford any more mistakes with a resigned sigh he picked up moody overused but wise mantra constant vigilance he entered through the tall oaken doors with a determined stride taking in the bright lights the babble of voices and the aroma of the coming feast as he made his way to the gryffindor table a vacant place had been left between ron and hermione and he slid into his seat there returning the bright smiles of those nearest him all the brighter because they knew now it was really him he saw relief in ron s neville and hermione eyes and mischief in ginny s he suddenly wondered what the small redhead been doing to poor charlie as harry sorry about your summer harry neville said in a low voice and sorry i didntmake it to your birthday party harry was thrown for a moment but then realized that most of the summer happenings were not going to be kept secret since both sides knew of them well seeing as how we didntreally have a party that fine harry smiled easily there were a few too many extra guests around at the time yeah neville said in an even lower voice dementors sorry i wasntthere harry harry gave neville a smile feeling intuitively that here was someone he could trust with no qualms neville had stood by his side at the department of mysteries braving even the cruciatus curse to try to help him but still harry shook his head i glad you werentthere neville it was touch and go what that harry seamus was looking over at them from where he sat by neville somethin about dementors seamus hadntchanged much over the summer judging by the lively interest in his eyes but his face had thickened and his jaw seemed heavier than before oh nothing really ginny said airily harry just fought off about two hundred dementors this summer seamus eyes widened they were attacking my house at the time i didntfight them alone ginny harry corrected your whole family and hermione were there too and dumbledore as well remember ginny shrugged i remember fainting i know i wasntmuch help two hundred seamus asked looking at ron hermione ginny and harry as if trying to decide where the joke lay bugger he said under his breath neville face was fearful at first but then resolve settled there harry waited for more questions but none came no one seemed to know what to say about that but at least seamus wasntcalling anyone a liar that was a definite improvement over last year dean turned around the join the conversation and asked seamus what was going on harry noticed that dean seemed to be looking past seamus on several occasions toward ginny ron took the moment to lean closer to harry good to see you mate ron ventured i mean really see you harry shook his head ron had said that far too loud seamus sharp eyes were already on them again didntyou see harry on the train oh ron is harry official bodyguard now ginny put in quickly so he always worried whenever he out of eyesight official eh dean spoke up what that supposed to mean harry and i are going to have the same schedule ron said boldly overdoing it a bit that what it means dumbledore talked to me about it himself harry turned to stare at ron beside him what shhh hermione whispered gesturing to dumbledore standing at the teacher table he getting ready to speak ron harry said in a low dangerous tone what exactly did dumbledore say to you but ron had turned to look at the front ears flaming red at the tips harry held himself still trying to breathe quietly people were keeping secrets from him again and he didntlike it if official meant that ron was assigned duty to him and was to take the fall for harry if there was ever any danger no no way that was not going to happen but this was not the time to deal with it harry forced himself to take deep breaths and to restrain from giving ron a good hard thump the hall around him had grown quiet ready for the headmaster to speak welcome to hogwarts for another year professor dumbledore began with a smile it has been a summer full of activities for all of us some more beneficial than others and here he shot a look in harry direction harry slowly clenched his left hand into a fist and felt the antidote band tighten reassuringly against his bicep this year we have a unique challenge set before us but hold what am i going on about how the mind addles as the years pass this is a time for sorting and not for talking bring in the first years as dumbledore returned to his seat harry took his first real look at the teacher table and his gaze zeroed in on the middle aged witch beside hagrid she had a soft wrinkled face with a pleasantly lived in sort of look like a favorite sweater whose colors had faded in the wash it was hard to see from this distance but he thought she had pretty blue eyes that would be joanna haverlime the new defense against the dark arts teacher that dumbledore had told him about she wore no hat only a bright blue turban that made harry think of quirrell what was she hiding underneath that turban he wondered ron leaned back and shifted his head so that he could speak quietly to harry you dontthink you know who gone back to hiding on people heads do you ron eyes were trained on haverlime he too strong for that now when he comes here next time he wontbe hiding next time ron turned full around to stare at harry his face pale harry knew that look his friend had it whenever the prophecy came up ron finally cursed under his breath and turned back around canthe just leave people alone then the doors opened slowly and harry swung round to see cho chang leading in the first years toward the front where professor mcgonagall stood leaning on her cane harry spared a venomous thought for dolores umbridge the reason mcgonagall needed a cane as ginny leaned across the table to him cho is head girl this year didntwe tell you harry shook his head startled and looked back to the asian girl cho hadnteven been a prefect the year before had she along with badge on her chest there was a new coldness in her face that harry didntlike the look of altering the simple beauty he d once blushed over she had changed behind her the first years were clustered in a long thin pack most of them shivering and looking around apprehensively harry gaze was drawn to a messy haired tow headed boy near the front whose robes were too short for his long frame he was a good deal taller than his fellow first years but in spite of that there was a neglected air about him and his large dark eyes looked as if his wildest dreams and worst nightmares were coming true at the same time directly behind him were walking three short brown headed girls so alike that harry felt he was seeing the same girl three times over ginny murmured something low under her breath and harry turned to see her watching the girls go by with a nasty look on her face a few more rows of students went by of all shapes sizes and hair colors and then the final student sauntered by a tall thin girl with short spiky hair separated from the pack something about her face and hair reminded him of madame hooch dontyou think she looks a bit like madame hooch neville asked in a puzzled tone there were several murmured agreements spooky that is ron summed up the sorting hat was already on its stool and began to sing as soon as the first years were gathered at the front of the room welcome one and all to hogwarts listen well to all my rhymes though there have been years of import this one trumps them all with signs not since the founders split asunder has this castle known such dread not the rumbling of distant thunder but of drum beats for the dead gryffindor you have the valor to prevail and guard the truth though your job is not to conquer but protect one neath your roof ravenclaw re think your thinking find a way to do things right knowledge just might be misleading all the more seek keen insight hufflepuff there none so loyal though you ve lost been bound by grief break your shackles and show your strength fight for dearly held beliefs slytherin you are divided split by power fear and greed find your hope and use your cunning go when one who worthy leads once four houses worked together i living proof i cannot lie work as one dear sister brother unite as one or you may die harry mouth had fallen open and he shut it with a gentle snap that was not what he d been expecting the shock of it made him angry as he swallowed to moisten his dry mouth so it was going to be a bad year so what he already knew that three times over but from the look of the changed faces around him he knew that the hat had made its point ron had his head in his hands ginny looked around well we d better start taking up a collection then she said brightly harry stared at her along with quite a few other people what for ron finally asked well obviously dumbledore needs a new hat she said with a sigh that one gone positively mopey there was a moment of stunned silence and then laughs broke out over the table harry smiled watching ginny grin her slow mischievous grin and suddenly had to stop himself from reaching out to touch her hand where it lay on the table where had that impulse come from hermione leaned against him laughing a hiccupy laugh oh harry what are we going to do the first thing harry thought was we but he didnthave a leg to stand on with that old argument so he kept quiet once again he had to remind himself that they knew the dangers of being his friend of trying to fight tom and they wanted to stand with him anyway so it was ron who answered her dontworry we ll think of something mione harry glanced over at ginny and saw that she had been staring at him a steely glint in her eyes there too was someone he could trust tuck her away someplace safe potter she your greatest liability harry turned away from ginny malfoy sly voice echoing in his mind he could trust her yes but he had to watch out for her as well if malfoy was right she was in grave danger just because of her connection to him harry kept his gaze averted the less the other students saw him looking at her the better chapter 5 the treacherous twitchties harry looked around the great hall it wasntjust ron and hermione who looked sobered and frightened by the sorting hat speech a lot of them were staring over at the gryffindors who had just been laughing at ginny remark obviously wondering what could possibly be funny probably most of them had come here trying to forget the state of the world out there trying to forget that tom was building an army starting a war they had thought hogwarts was going to shield them and it would but not so that they could hide from responsibility that wasntgoing to work the hat had just called for action of which harry definitely approved and in which he was already mightily entrenched they look terrified poor things ginny was looking back up at the front where the first years were pale and wide eyed several clutching at the others a few were looking around the hall as if to say is the hat supposed to say that the faculty looked a bit shaken as well evidenced by the long silence even dumbledore was sober they ll be fine as soon as they get sorted hermione said in return her voice also full of empathy unless they re in slytherin ron growled aye seamus spoke up there ll be no living with those wankers this year not if they do what they said they were going to on the express harry cut his eyes over at ron who nodded that he would fill him in later seamus didntnotice looks like malfoy made it after all wonder why he wasnton the train though of course many of them could have answered seamus question no one did harry looked over at the end of the slytherin table where malfoy sat at least a seat away from his other house mates was that his choice or were the slytherins against him now harry wondered curiously he had reckoned they would still bow and scrape to malfoy out of habit if nothing else but the blond looked comfortable in his exile if that what it was he was watching the first years with narrowed eyes thus it was with a marked stillness that the sorting began appleby hazel was the first name to be called out by professor mcgonagall a tiny girl with shining blond hair scurried forth into the quiet climbing the few stairs to the stool on which sat the sorting hat she had been so lost among the flock of first years that harry hadnteven seen her hazel stopped at the stool turned and paused mcgonagall standing back with the hat now raised and ready but hazel didntsit she was twisting her fingers in front of her biting at her bottom lip nervously harry wondered if the words of the sorting hat were running through the first year mind they must have been because she remained standing and the tension grew harry shot a covert glance at ginny who was holding her breath then looked back to the front if hazel sat she would be committing herself to hogwarts and to the action called for by the hat harry understood her hesitancy just as professor mcgonagall made a move to step towards hazel the girl sat the entire room seemed to shift with a sigh of relief the hat was placed on hazel head and she closed her eyes tight hufflepuff the hat shouted and the hufflepuff table erupted in wild applause as if making up for the intense silence two seconds before the sorting after that went more easily each student was called forth showing their nervousness in various ways and after the proclamation was sent to their house tables with relieved smiles harry figured he shouldnthave been surprised when the tall girl with spiky hair was announced midway as violet hooch she took the stairs firmly and sat down on the stool with a loud plunk the hat yelled out immediately gryffindor violet face lit up with a wide grin and she pumped the air once with her first she headed for their table greeted by the ecstatic cheers and whistles of her new house i didntknow madame hooch had a daughter ginny said did anybody else everyone shook their heads might be a niece or something hermione suggested hope she tries out for the quidditch team ron said craning his head to see where she sat at the front of the table she a first year ron hermione reminded him doesntmatter if she good ron said promptly looking over at harry right harry harry nodded glad to see everyone talking more normally now his disquiet grew again as the next three students went slytherin was it his imagination or was slytherin getting more than their fair share of first years the serious looks being exchanged between his housemates told him that they were wondering the same thing ginny was staring at the slytherin table twitchtie unelda was called out amid the quiet buzz of voices why are they even here ginny hissed to no one in particular one guess ron said shooting another look in harry direction harry ignored him and looked up front see one of the three nearly identical brown haired girls at the front she turned rigidly and took a seat on the stool completely pale beneath the short fringe of hair on her forehead as soon as the hat was placed on her head it proclaimed slytherin looking relieved she headed to her look a likes getting a high five from both on her way to the table twitchtie uprima called out professor mcgonagall next seeming to lean heavier on her cane as the sorting went on another brown haired girl with delicate features identical to the last took the stool she however had no fringe but all her hair was pulled back from her forehead and tied neatly at the back the hat sat on her head for a long time and harry found himself trying to commit the differences between the twitchties to memory sensing that it might be important finally the hat shouted ravenclaw harry watched the smug look on uprima face curiously as she headed over to the lightly applauding ravenclaw table she gave the last twitchtie girl a high five as well then the hall grew quiet as twitchtie uzimay took to the platform it was like seeing the same girl up there for the third time only uzimay had short brown hair tucked behind her ears and no fringe she sat on the stool with clenched fists and eyes closed as though the sorting hat might hurt her harry gave hermione a questioning glance but his friend was watching the proceedings with a keen eye when he looked back at uzimay she was still frozen in place but her pale face had started to turn red uzimay was trying to talk the hat out of something the silence faltered a bit as the sorting hat deliberated past a minute uzimay had started whispering something ron was groaning about his empty stomach when the hat finally sang out slytherin uzimay eyes shot open and she jumped up off the stool ripping the hat off and tossing it at professor mcgonagall her face was stormy like she d rather hex somebody than give them a high five that a relief ginny said in a low voice why harry asked ginny leaned in over the table and hermione ron and harry copied her the twitchties are all dark wizards i heard mum and dad talking if they ve sent their girls here instead of durmstrang it not for the education harry frowned and ron and hermione gave each other dark looks i wonder which house she wanted to be in ron mused as he scruffed at his hair leaving it mussed harry smiled faintly it always reminded him of his father to see him doing that isntit obvious hermione whispered nodding her head at where uzimay was sitting staring blankly at harry i only wonder why harry watched as uzimay exchanged glances with her sister sitting across the slytherin table from her and with the other at the ravenclaw table all three of them turned to look at harry one after the other he could read nothing from their expressions but their stares oppressed him he shifted in his seat dontworry harry ginny whispered we ll keep an eye on them harry shook his head no ginny he whispered just he couldntfind words to say what he knew he shouldntand just gave up looking away again and then it hit him maybe the twitchties were some of the ones who had threatened charlie harry he could probably ask charlie he probably should later ginny was sitting rigid in her chair now and harry turned to the front with a sigh there was only one more student to sort the thin boy with messy blond hair he looked frozen by the silence awaiting his name wafting tobias mcgonagall called out finally and this time harry thought he saw a tiny smile on her face tobias gave a start when his name was called and then stepped up to the stool he turned and faced the crowd blanching a bit at the sight he grabbed the stool tightly as the hat went on his head gryffindor it called out right away tobias smiled and shot up from the stool almost running for the table cheering the loudest harry watched him with a smile liking the first year already he had the feeling that tobias might be muggleborn and was glad he d be in gryffindor where he wouldntbe subjected to pureblood hysteria dumbledore raised his hands to speak well that was as i like to say a sorting worthy of the setting now we shall move on to the surprise section of the oh but i getting ahead of myself again you are all certainly hungry dumbledore smiled and harry guessed that his slips of the tongue were purposefully done to whet the students appetite for what was coming after dinner something dumbledore was going to enjoy surely before we eat i have only a short speech to give he waved away the groans of the hungry students it is more like a poem than a speech i fear it is thus eating rather than working repairs the hungry boy and thinking rather than hexing might yet prevent a war but whosoever gives a fig to one who will not fight can find a well to drink from when the dark has drained the light there just a random thought or two now let dig in as the food appeared on the table harry found himself more interested in dumbledore words than the dishes ron elbowed him to reach something and harry leaned out of the way whatever dumbledore meaning had been it was as clear as mud to harry he d have to ask hermione later for now he just wanted to eat and think and listen the subject of conversation during dinner was the sorting hat song nearly all the way through and it was interesting to hear what the others thought about it they all thought harry to be the one who needing protecting despite his protests when ron started to vehemently proclaim that harry did need protecting harry changed the subject with ginny help ron was getting far too close to giving away the prophecy and harry didntwant that he was still debating whether to even tell neville ginny and luna about it much less anyone else they moved on to debating the meaning of the slytherins following one who worthy several said that would be dumbledore then others said harry and they were back to discussing his part in the war again harry focused on the food again it was delicious as always though a few things seemed to be missing there was no bread pudding this year or steak and kidney pie both of which he typically ate harry noticed this with a bad feeling he was growing paranoid he knew it long before ron was satisfied professor dumbledore rose to his feet again now that we are all satiated well except the obvious few and here harry and hermione elbowed ron between them still tearing at a pie i shall get on with the more important things mo impo pent van eating ron mumbled through his food hermione reached across harry to fwap him on the arm this year we have the privilege of marking the deeds of a very special student here at hogwarts one who usually refuses any sort of recognition yet continues year after year to distinguish himself harry saw several smiling faces turned his way and his stomach turned to ice surely not but this time his heroics have not gone unnoticed by those who are able to reward it with public recognition this time his fight against voldemort and his death eaters was held in a more public arena and it is the public who wishes to recognize him for his bravery his skill and his leadership qualities of course i am speaking of harry potter applause rang out in the hall loud after the gasp at tom name along with a few excited shouts of agreement more heads turned his way and harry hunched over in his seat wishing for all the world that he d skipped this feast like he had last year end of term feast he should have known harry would you come forward please nope harry thought firmly he was not going to parade up to the front of the room like some preening peacock he was fine just where he was thank you until that is ron got a hold of the back of his robes and hefted him to his feet harry found himself standing unsteadily before he could knock ron hands away he glared at his ex best friend with a gaze that clearly said traitor ron quailed before the glare sorry mate but i under orders he said loud enough to be heard over the applause which had grown slowly very good mr weasley harry come forward if you would harry reluctantly moved toward the front his feet leaden trying to convince himself that if he could best lucius malfoy in a duel and he had done that then he could surely walk in front of the whole school but thinking of lucius was not conducive to peace of mind and harry found himself getting queasy he tuned in dumbledore words the minister of magic cornelius fudge mr fudge desperately wanted to be here to deliver the award himself but was unable to persuade the powers that be at hogwarts which would be myself and professor mcgonagall to allow him on the premises harry shot dumbledore a swift glance and saw the twinkling gleam in the professor eyes he d enjoyed that mr fudge was most emphatic insisting that mr potter needed a ceremony to mark the courage that upheld him when criticism rained on him from all quarters before the wizarding world acknowledged voldemort return and here of course was the expected gasp from the students and a jerk from snape at the corner of the teacher table harry noticed cornelius also mentioned mr potter leadership qualities and skill in managing to escape from the death eaters and voldemort himself at the battle at the ministry of magic which i mentioned to you last year in passing harry was shaking his head now only a few steps away from joining professor dumbledore at the dais he hadntbeen alone at the battle they had all helped each other and of course had it not been for dumbledore intervention harry would have been hit with the killing curse by tom as he stood there too stunned to even try to defend himself after all the reasons that cornelius listed i simply had to agree there is no one more deserving than harry potter of the awarding of the order of merlin second class harry froze with one foot on the top stair and jerked his head up to look at the headmaster now dumbledore continued his arms raised to the students i am sure that harry will tell you he was not alone that night at the ministry and that others helped him he would be the first to protest that luck was his friend on that night and on several other occasions when he has been in danger but this award is not given for solitary deeds of courage as spectacular as those may have been it simply recognizes the choices he has made to stay true to his beliefs to stay loyal in his friendships and to fight when evil begins to erode away the lives we have built and hope to build in the future those that have helped him along the way celebrate with him in support of him knowing that they have contributed to his cause and share this award with him the applause began again and harry couldnthelp but sneak another glance over at snape he didntlook like he was sharing that award with harry though he d helped harry escape death many times no he looked livid almost shaking with anger just as harry expected harry come here dumbledore said quietly reaching out a hand to him harry took a deep breath and then stepped up on the dais but the sick feeling in his stomach was only growing dumbledore motioned for silence then put one hand on harry shoulder harry and his voice was so quiet that it felt as if the rest of the room didntexist sirius would want you to have this if you cannot accept this for yourself accept it on his behalf he never got the recognition he deserved as harry looked up tears sprang into his eyes blurring the kindness of the wizened face from view his chest got tight and his breathing went shallow as a scroll was tucked in his hand and a medal was laid around his neck sirius did deserve to be recognized and so few knew it harry swallowed torn say a few words harry the headmaster whispered to him they are listening to you now more so than they ever have before then dumbledore stepped back leaving harry on the dais that overlooked the great hall at hogwarts alone immediately the students began clapping again harry turned to look out over the crowd of students and balked how could he speak to all of them what would he say his stomach clenched and then he saw a figure in the back that made it all worse the dark green robes and red curls gave away rita skeeter even though her face was bent over a parchment just then she looked up at harry she looked surprised to see him staring at her but she gained her composure and winked harry was taken aback why had dumbledore allowed her in when he hadntallowed fudge she held up her quill and indicated to him as if ready to take dictation and as harry looked back to dumbledore he realized that exactly what she was prepared to do dumbledore nodded encouragingly harry looked out over the crowd again even more reluctant to speak now that he knew his words would be put in print what if rita put a spin on them or what if he said something imbecilic he d never hear the end of it then his eyes jerked to the hufflepuff table where susan bones had jumped to her feet grinning and clapping loudly she yelled something he couldntunderstand but it made the ends of his mouth turn up to see her enthusiasm across the row at the ravenclaw table cho copied her clapping and standing with a far more solemn look on her face but then she smiled as she saw harry watching justin finch fletchly exploded from his place yelling and whooping and bringing several more hufflepuffs to their feet as well harry friends at the gryffindor table were already up and cheering so enthusiastically that harry was embarrassed he was glad to see that hermione and ginny had lost the worried looks they d sported at first ron was pounding on the table then a few more ravenclaws stood and clapped with smiles padma patil luna lovegood and the new twitchtie girl uprima harry thought among them the slytherin table was another story the younger years were half clapping looking guiltily away from the older years only the other twitchtie girls applauded without apology though their faces gave nothing away the sixth and seventh years refused to clap at all malfoy among them he was sitting back languidly resting one elbow on the table his glittering eyes watching harry as their eyes met malfoy smirked and inclined his head lifting his hand as if to say go ahead give it your best shot something about his smug look as if he knew harry would fail boiled harry blood his fists clenched crushing the scroll in his grip and then suddenly harry knew exactly what he wanted to say with one curt gesture he quieted the room in sudden silence the students sat back down most looking at him eagerly he began in a steady voice that carried to the back of the room when i first got on the hogwarts express six years ago i didntknow anybody except hagrid harry looked back over his shoulder to his large happily crying friend and smiled before turning back i met a few people on the train that day ron hermione oh and i saw malfoy again i guess i d met him already too pity that laughs reverberated around the room and the slytherins scowled malfoy looked unperturbed and as i met more people over the first few weeks it became clear to me that most people thought of me as the boy who lived even though i didntknow exactly who that was people knew more about me and my parents than i did there were some who thought i wanted attention craved it actually and harry paused to slide a not so covert look at snape who had it in from me from the first moment i walked in the door because i was a celebrity for no good reason harry looked back over to the students as they murmured at that now i dontmean that getting rid of tom uh voldemort the first time around wasnta big deal it was it just that i donteven remember it or understand it so having it attributed to me as though i was responsible well i just not comfortable with that i guess since then i ve had a lot of chances to prove myself and somehow i ve managed to come out on the winning side of things but people are right when they say it been luck and the protection of others and sometimes quite mystifying circumstances that have gotten me this far i know ron hermione neville luna and ginny have all risked their lives for me he added gesturing to them and ron and hermione more than once others have done the same he paused mentally thanking snape and the order members he couldntmention i have been reckless i ve even been foolish and i ve paid for that so have others he paused again his throat had gotten achy and his chest so tight that he had to take a deep breath to get enough air but it all stops here he took another long moment to collect himself willing the quavering note out of his voice pressing his lips together then he looked back up you heard what the sorting hat sang things are going to be different this year so those of you who ve been on my side who want to fight voldemort he again ignored the gasps and his cracked team of death eaters prepare yourselves i need you to watch my back he let his eyes drift over the three tables of his supporters meeting eyes whenever he could i need you to look out for signs of trouble to tell someone if a student or teacher is acting strangely or threatening you in any way if we all refuse to ignore the changes however subtle they may be and work together then evil cannot gain a foothold and there will be no need for threatening hats harry half smiled and looked over at the sorting hat a few people laughed and harry heard dumbledore chuckle behind him appreciatively then he shifted and eyed the crowd wondering who among them beyond the obvious would be the betrayers this year the ones who would work with tom who had threatened charlie and would actively seek to harm ginny and all of harry friends when he spoke again it was in a deadly still voice and for those of you who have chosen the wrong side who are plotting my downfall and scheming away in dark corners like pathetic little rats aching for your own glory watch your backs you re not going to stop me from doing what i have to do you re wasting your time and gaining yourself an enemy you do not want you may know that i ve been cursed by the avada kedarva before but also by the imperius and the cruciatus more times than i can count i ve been kissed by a dementor been bitten beaten bloodlet betrayed choked drugged poisoned possessed slashed and basically tortured you think you can do better than that want to add something on to the list dontbother take a good look i still here my advice to you is to stay out of my way and let me do what i have to do his words ended in a venomous whisper and that hissed like parseltongue through the hall he had shocked himself but the righteous anger he felt sustained him as he walked from the platform then he stopped before the reached the floor oh and the only way i ll accept this award is on behalf of my godfather sirius black who was innocent of all the charges lodged against him years ago and who lost his life in saving mine at the ministry of magic in june and also on behalf of the other members of the order of the phoenix and the d a who helped me thanks and then he walked down the long hall to his seat among a few scattered claps and murmurs to him the silence sounded better than the applause had chapter six more triple threats harry kept his eyes down at the table but did notice hermione and ginny surreptitiously wiping away tears ron sniffed a bit as well and patted harry so hard on the back that he made him cough but nobody said a word until after dumbledore had given the first years their usual warnings about the forbidden forest and announced that the list of outlawed items to be posted on argus filch door now included of course anything sold by weasleys wizarding wheezes despite the sober tone of the hat song and harry speech the mood was light as dumbledore released the first years to go with their prefects then dismissed everyone else everyone at the gryffindor table seemed to want to catch harry eye and smile supportively which was nice but as he stood the noise in the hall reached an unusual pitch and actually seemed to direct itself his way harry watched in amazement as more and more students turned his way talking pointing and moving toward him er ron harry began backing toward the table as the first of the crowd arrived all girls they were wide eyed calling out to him enthusiastically but staying a polite distance back harry noticed with relief he smiled awkwardly back quite a few da members had made their way over through the crowd to beam at him and they came closer to clap him on the back harry felt more comfortable with their presence especially susan bones who had been the first to show him her support when he was wavering on the dais hi susan have a good summer very nice and very boring thanks and you she asked eagerly i suppose it wasntvery nice but it couldnthave been worse than last year at least you d be surprised oh sorry i did hear about some of it i forgot but that was a great speech harry just great and then to his amazement she blushed he found his tongue had frozen in his mouth and was relieved when she was jostled away by a grinning justin finch fletchly i ll watch your back mate you can count on me as will i said ernie mcmillan beside him thanks harry said beginning to feel buoyed by all the support as justin and ernie disappeared back into the crowd harry saw a sea of faces all smiling and waving and trying to get his attention way to go harry smashing speech harry it was quite overwhelming one young girl sprang forward through a hole in the crowd the tiny blue eyed blonde who had gone first in the sorting i cantbelieve i meeting you harry potter she squealed in an alarming way and threw herself at harry wrapping her arms around his waist stunned arms up so that he wouldnttouch the girl harry could do nothing but stand there acutely aware of the way the girl chin was digging into his navel and the way two of his mates were laughing fit to burst robbing the cradle eh harry seamus called out dean nearly collapsing against him in laughter harry smiled weakly and looked over at ron who had been stunned into immobility as well it all right harry piped in collin creevy mind if i get a picture what harry asked him dumbly then shook his head no no pictures he bellowed creevy get back you clod came ron bellowing voice suddenly from beside harry haventyou gotten enough pictures of him yet and you ron took hold of the little first year around harry waist and gently disentangled her what house are you in i a hufflepuff she said in a dreamy voice and he smells sooooo good just like i knew he would a sudden chorus of ohhhhhhh broke out among the girls nearby and harry turned bright red confusedly trying to figure out how on earth he could smell good after fleeing from a manticore and spending hours downing potions in the hospital wing seamus laughed louder and took her arm from ron don worry i ll get her back where she belongs come along now he doesnt always smell like that you know seamus confided loudly in his soft brogue you should come around after he rank from a quidditch practice harry glared at seamus before the crowd swallowed him up then jumped when a gaggle of girls to his right squealed ooooooooooooo a sweaty harry potter one yelled louder than the others whatever had been holding them back was now done with they all squealed again and pressed in closer forcing harry to draw back as far as he could hands up in defense the table digging into his back that just just ron looked dumbfounded again as the flock of girls pressed him back as well they were reaching out to touch harry robes his hair get me out of here ron he hissed loudly over the girls heads pushing away as many hands as he could without being overtly rude yes hi no don t not the hey harry batted a pudgy brunette hand away from his scar oooooooo i touched it she said as she fell back collapsing against the crowd and pulling away the girls in front for a moment then the crowd swallowed her a crush of girls sighing out their desire to touch harry as well then they were on him hands reaching toward harry face for heaven sake a familiar voice snapped from beyond harry vision catervaductum the crowd of girls split down the middle as if jerked by an unseen hand and hermione appeared in the space ginny right behind her let him breathe would you she chided the frustrated girls crossly walking to harry she let out a loud huffing breath you all right harry he stared at the girls re settling themselves edging as close as they dared and shooting glares at hermione he swallowed what is all this he asked under his breath your fans ginny said her eyes melting with sympathy i afraid it like this everywhere now we were hoping it would be better at school her glance included hermione and ron who was shaking his head as if to clear it but thanks to that speech we love you harry cried a girl from the pack now edging their way closer again thanks to your speech ginny started again more loudly this time the fan club has come out of hiding fan club harry asked horrified i ll watch your back harry agirl shouted a chorus of agreeing voices cried out heh i ll watch anything he lets me harry spun around on that one because it sounded like a bloke but before he could make out who it had been hermione and ginny were knocked into him from behind by a surge of fans harry helped ginny as she nearly fell over the bench that enough ron roared wading through the crowd toward harry this is just just come on now ease off he said as he reached hermione and pulled her back she had her wand out and the front line of girls was edging nervously away from her i will be taking house points the next time someone pushes me is that clear hermione yelled with a fierce look in her eyes and the nearest girls scattered on harry other side ginny had her wand out as well stay back ginny cried or i ll show you what a bat bogey hex is ron looked up from where he was setting a first year girl aside and cursed just climb over the table he called to harry gesturing over the heads of the girls aye head for the hills mate seamus yelled harry went for it and there was a general outcry as he crawled up on the gryffindor table harr eeeeeee more squeals what going on a girl called from back of the crowd i cantsee has he got his shirt off or something harry turned around and bellowed i most certainly do not have my shirt off the crowd immediately quieted the girls stared at him open mouthed for some reason ginny was smiling then one girl spoke up then what re you waiting for yeah harry froze again as the crowd took up the cry at a complete loss for how to deal with this there was more yelling now more faces turning his way most seemingly in support of the idea of him stripping off his clothes and then despite his horror it suddenly struck him that some of these girls might they actually might well probably would like to kiss him he turned red again all right harry move it before we get squashed ron shouted reaching over the table to shove him on his way then turned back to the crowd wand out along with hermione and ginny go find some place better to drool come on harry i ve got your back neville called from where he was now standing on the other side of the table waiting for him harry gladly clambered down but wondered if even the enormous table would be enough of a deterrent to the crowd are you all right harry neville eyes were open wide as though he d seen a wild pack of lions devouring a hyena carcass think so dontknow what to make of that though harry said gesturing loosely to the crowd where hermione was still trying to take control no no climbing over the table you first years should find your prefects and go to your common rooms now she said loudly gesturing with her wand and you older students should know better than this she added severely house points will be taken if you do not move now harry watched in relief as most of the crowd turned away the girls seeming disappointed most of the boys polarized between highly amused or highly irritated most of the students in his year seemed to belong to the amused group they could have stepped in and helped harry thought ron was clambering over the table now to join them his long limbs spread out spider like a comparison he surely wouldnthave appreciated neville smiled hesitantly must have been sort of nice though right harry stared over at him what neville shrugged just seemed like fun you know having that many girls trying to touch you and you know well kinda fun he blushed and looked down when harry frowned that was about as fun as being attacked by a manticore yeah ron joined in as he touched ground not that you know what that like though right er harry said suddenly remembering that he actually hadnttold ron or hermione about the manticore the portkey or the mind duel with tom ouch oh ouch ouch a sudden chorus of yells came from across the table and the boys whipped around just in time to see the crowd pulling away from ginny as she crammed her wand back in a pocket her face savage when she saw harry looking at her she put her hands on her hips what just be glad you didnthear what she said she called across to him chin raised in the air then joined hermione in pushing their way toward the doors of the great hall they passed cho who was standing their with hands on hips watching harry with no expression after a nod to him she turned away as well girls completely mad harry murmured cementing his opinion of the year before he turned to ron and neville expecting agreement but ron was openly grinning guess ginny and hermione did all right though didntthey ron said with a self satisfied grin oh ginny fantastic neville joined in eagerly harry nodded but his thoughts were already back on the crowd and their hysteria over the very idea that he might have taken his shirt off him he couldntthink of anything he d be less willing to do than take his shirt off in front of a group of girls while standing on a table in the great hall harry shook his head he was beginning to understand dumbledore decision to have ron be his bodyguard he gave ron a grim smile thanks mate i owe you one too uh yeah right ron nodded gamely then took a deep breath and let it out slowly all i know is you better not make any more bloody speeches all those people pressing close like that anything could happen then he straightened and looked beyond harry hey cho cho did you see this over here there got to be a rule against this someone needs be docked house points what as she called back ron took a few steps forward to gesture the head girl over and someone took that opportunity to slip around him and beside neville harry suddenly found himself face to face with a twitchtie er hello he said haltingly ready to bolt if she threw herself at him requested that bits of his clothing come off or tried to do dark magic uprima twitchtie the girl in front of harry offered her solemn brown eyes never leaving his my friends call me prima dontlisten to what other people say about me and my sisters i always believed you about voldemort and i want to help you any way i can er thanks harry said finding himself leaning back slightly this is my friend neville longbottom he introduced him with a wave more to distract the girl than anything else how do you do uprima said properly neville stammered back f fine and you spiffing the girl couldnthave been older than eleven but there was something unnerving about the intense burning of her brown eyes as they never left harry s harry i meant to ask you here what do you think you re doing ron was suddenly there in a flurry of motion grasping uprima by the shoulders and shunting her over to the side go on find your house mates or i taking points oh bugger ron interrupted himself remembering that he wasnta prefect this year uprima turned back and said goodbye harry i ll try another time she walked away to join the throng heading out the doors a good few of them still glancing in harry direction ron was watching them with a nervous gaze neville turned to look at harry wonder what that was about dunno harry said none of this makes any sense to me gesturing to include the crowd i mean how am i supposed to deal with that well i do know one thing ron said finally turning back to harry whatever you do bloody hell mate dontmake any more speeches harry didntmake it straight to gryffindor tower after the feast dumbledore caught his eye as he was leaving and for some reason harry understood that he was needed in dumbledore office now with a sigh he headed that way arguing with ron futilely over the redhead accompanying him nothing going to happen to me in the office of the headmaster right and nothing going to happen to you on the way there or on the way back to the tower because i ll be with you see how that works easy peasy harry fumed inwardly fighting the mad urge to run a long roundabout way to the headmaster office in an effort to ditch ron harry didntlike this at all he would take it up with the headmaster at the entrance to the office ron crossed his arms and leaned against the wall to wait harry stared at him unaccountably furious sarcasm dripping from his voice what if i trip and fall going up the twisty stairs ron who will protect me then ron flushed bright red to his ears but looked away he yelled loudly at the opposite wall i will then he huffed out a breath sniffed and mumbled under his breath thick headed clot harry said nothing but turned on his heel and marched up the stairs he tried to pause and collect himself but as soon as he was at the entrance the door opened for him ah yes come in mr potter dumbledore warm voice came from inside harry entered hesitantly wondering how the headmaster had gotten here before him mr weasley sounds a bit unsettled you haventbeen baiting him now have you harry flushed as he sat in the chair not exactly just well yeah i guess so i mean he straightened up and looked steadily at the headmaster i hate this idea that he my bodyguard how could you do that to him he already felt responsible enough for me and now it just going to be ten times worse professor dumbledore eyebrows furrowed and he leaned forward how do you mean harry pressed his lips together then relented what if something does happen to me what if he cantstop it how he going to feel then the old man blue eyes lit up oh i do know the answer to that one he chirruped leaning back in his chair and looking self satisfied slowly his smile disappeared he will feel exactly as you felt last year after your godfather was killed he will feel responsible harry chest felt as if someone had chunked a fifteen stone weight on it he swallowed and let anger inflate his lungs again then why do it why make him my official bodyguard how could that help at all oh harry dumbledore murmured neither you nor i can control how others feel about us the simple fact is that you are loved my boy and there are many people who will grieve if you are lost they fear that outcome every day and must rise up to face it and fight it every single day and the sorrowful grief in dumbledore eyes left harry no doubt as to whether or not the headmaster was describing himself much as you yourself must do to give those people no relief no steps to take to prevent the loss of their loved one is to condemn them to suffer needlessly i simply gave permission for mr weasley to do what he had purposed already to do in his heart agonized harry burst out he wonteven go to his own classes he going to mine the headmaster smiled that is simply one way of looking at it i prefer to think of it this way you and he chose the same career path and must take the same courses had i not matched your schedules mr weasley most likely would have found all manner of excuses to miss his classes and find his way over to yours anyway now he will at least continue his education while also giving him the mental benefit of being of some use to you in the outcome you get a protector he gets his education and i get the relief of knowing you will not be walking these halls alone harry sat back in his chair it did make sense in a way whether or not harry wanted him to ron did feel responsible for his friend giving him a title made him feel useful harry looked up as the headmaster went on perhaps you being so familiar with mr weasley as a friend do not see the very real threat he presents to those who would do you harm harry eyes widened your friend has grown to be the tallest of all his brothers with considerable strength from his quidditch training he has a passionate temper that his years of conflict with mr malfoy have brought under strict control well most of the time dumbledore added at harry doubtful look he also has quick reflexes a strong right hook and a good background in defense techniques thanks to the d a in addition he has an instinctive and highly developed head for strategy defensive and offensive in short your friend makes the ideal companion for someone accustomed to finding himself in danger the headmaster concluded with a smile harry shook his head pleasantly surprised to see ron in a new light but then the memory of how flustered he d been during the crowd scene came back to harry ron had a long way to go before he could handle anything they threw at him harry sighed i suppose then that you ve given hermione something to do as well official researcher of the order of the phoenix he said with twinkling eyes harry stared but could find no reason to object to something so seemingly safe ginny occlumency legilimency trainee with snape harry asked horrified professor snape dumbledore corrected mildly and no she will be learning from our new defense against the dark arts professor joanna haverlime a sudden thought struck harry neville dumbledore smiled assistant of the d a and luna well and here the headmaster eyes twinkled she will be our official press liason if there anything mr fudge feels he needs to print that is in error we will have access to the quibbler to get the truth out she will be fantastic in that capacity oh i saw charlie earlier has he decided to stay then i believe a sudden flare of pain in harry scar clouded the headmaster words harry bent over fighting the instant nausea panting to breathe through it a sickening feeling of happiness coursed through him of ecstatic joy that knew no bounds encased in the familiar pain of his scar he happy harry managed to moan between breaths something happened can you discern anything else harry tried to focus on the emotions ringing through his head but could catch nothing else no he gasped bring up your shield then harry use your procclumency if you must need the calm voice of the headmaster urged without hesitation harry focused on bringing up the gray shield and felt the emotion and pain fade immediately he sighed with relief when he looked up the headmaster had a reassuring smile on his face well done harry very well done when harry stumbled out of the headmaster office ron fell into step beside him immediately looking worried what wrong my scar twinged a bit harry said with reluctance then added voldemort was happy about something the use of tom name was enough to keep ron quiet for a while which was what harry wanted he needed to think harry a soft voice caught at his mind and harry stopped it was susan bones stepping out from behind a pillar she looked as confused and troubled as he had ever seen her susan what going on he asked automatically concerned here how did you know where harry was ron stepped forward suspicion lacing his voice well i followed him of course she said with a smile a blush creeping over her round cheeks and i saw you waiting there so i knew that where he was oh ron said glancing at harry hadntthought of that i was just heading up to the tower susan harry went on feeling edgy was there something you needed well she looked at ron pointedly i was hoping to talk to you alone her gaze slid back to harry no ron said with firmness he stays with me he can speak for himself i sure susan snapped then looked entreatingly at harry just for a minute harry it ll be impossible to get you alone tomorrow that right ron said with a self satisfied smile impossible harry glared at ron then turned his gaze back on susan who was now bouncing nervously on her feet as if she needed to go to the loo harry she implored please okay harry agreed stepping toward susan but just right there pointing to an alcove and ron stays nearby what ron said in an outraged voice ever heard of a portkey harry harry saw red how dare ron remind him we re not going anywhere ron susan said in an edgy voice you ll be able to see us the entire time harry glared at ron biting back angry words before walking over to susan just for a minute susan i really need to get up to the tower of course susan said gamely she slid her hand around harry left arm getting uncomfortably close to the antidote band ron blew out a huge breath and muttered curse words under his breath but he stayed put and only watched belligerently as they walked to the alcove jerking his wand out harry took her hand away from his arm and led her over to the alcove on the right his anger dissolved by a sudden bout of misgiving he trusted her didnthe susan had been one of the most level headed students throughout all of his years here and she had an aunt in the ministry he was half hoping her talk might be inside information maybe a hint as to what had tom so happy he wanted to be able to count on her sorry to be so weird susan apologized sweetly looking a little nervous but this needed to be said alone harry dropped her hand as they reached the alcove all right what is it i wanted to apologize again for not remembering what a rough summer you had she began with a strange look in her eyes is that all harry asked looking past her to where ron stood wand trained on susan in the hallway there no need well that wasntall really she continued stepping closer harry jerked his gaze back to her then what is it he asked dread lacing his voice his brain chose this particular moment to remember charlie words about what had happened on the train several young witches who should have known better we never got to finish this she said then stepped flush to him and softly pressed her lips to his harry gasped and froze his mind whirling she was kissing him a girl was kissing him that was on his list he wanted this right it did feel good whoa this was different than with cho susan was sliding her hands into his hair now opening her mouth and slanting it against his alarmingly he had never thought of her like this never beads of sweat were popping out on his forehead and the pleasant feelings that swirled around in his stomach were suddenly tinged with nausea what was wrong with him she was too close that was it he had to get away and brought his hands up but what she doing unzipping his robe wait she had a hand into his robes that fast his shirt was up and her hand was leaving a cold burning trail down his twitching abdomen and into the waistband of his jeans too close too close no a pulse of pure rage detonated inside him and then she was landing on the floor feet away her back smacking hard harry wand was trained on her shaking harry ron was there looking between the two of them wand pointing at the ground i thought you were he trailed off and turned his wand on the now crying girl that hurt she wailed easing over onto her side harry stepped closer wand aimed more carefully now his voice was raspy as he spat out no one touches me no one got it susan eyes went wide but there was a gleam in them just before she turned away harry eyes were watering he could feel ron stare could feel the cool air against his suddenly feverish skin but as he watched susan scramble away he felt no remorse at all the fierce burning anger consumed everything else he d meant what he d said no one would touch him like that again ever chapter seven donttouch the harry and ron walked through the empty halls their footsteps echoing off the stone walls and on up the staircases into the darkness that always hid in the corners and crannies at hogwarts half of harry wanted to crawl into one of those corners and pull himself together alone the other half felt the darkness like danger lurking just out of sight and craved ron companionship the altercation with susan had left harry feeling shaky he hadntbeen able to explain to ron why he had reacted so forcefully since there was no death threat involved but his friend seemed to understand enough anyway at least enough to drop the subject for now i d have done the same thing pro lly ron owned up as they started up a long flight of rickety stairs careful to miss the trick step in the middle i mean susan bones not exactly my you know type then he looked away uncomfortably as though getting too close to a subject he didntwant to broach harry sent him a sidelong glance so ron went on what was it that dumbledore wanted you for anyway harry gave a small smile i reckon he was testing my legilimency progress for one thing and then we also had to go over what happened on the way here harry cut off there abruptly realizing that he still hadnttold ron what had happened with the portkey his friend had halted staring at him what happened to you on the way here he asked slowly you portkeyed to the grounds right what was there trouble harry stopped and waited as the stairs they were on rotated ninety degrees effectively shutting them off from their dormitory for a few minutes he muttered a curse under his breath and then looked over at ron of course there was tom had found out i was using a portkey and managed to hook on through the scar he stopped me right outside the shrieking shack where there just happened to be waiting a very nice present stopped you ron asked his eyes wide his mouth gaping is that even possible apparently how dunno the connection or something harry said shortly feeling more sure than ever that he would never willingly use a portkey again so what was the present then ron asked each word coming slower than the previous manticore ron gaped again at the bloody shrieking shack he was so loud that several students on other stairs turned to look over at them their stairs had now reached the third floor just outside the door when fluffy had been housed in their first year come on harry muttered gesturing to the landing ron loped off one hand clutched to his head i thought you got here safe he exclaimed i thought charlie was the one in danger because bloody hell i knew it was too good to hope that malfoy would get attacked a wry grin appeared on harry face well malfoy did in a way ron turned to look at him eyes eager was it the manticore yesssssss he yelled pumping a fist when harry nodded did he piss his pants the great bleeding coward harry snorted and started walking the long away around to the southern staircase he screamed like a girl started yelling about having nightmares about them all his life afraid of manticores is he ron said with glee oh this is too good so how did he end up with you i accioed my broom brilliant ron crowed and malfoy was on it i d have given anything to have seen his ferret face when he saw the manticore me too actually harry admitted as they headed down he was disillusioned at the time and slammed into me before i even knew he was there but after he raged at me for dragging him there i reminded him of his portkey and he took off ron made a disgusted sound just left you there did he bastard harry shrugged i wanted him to he not much good in situations like that ron cursed colorfully before turning back to harry so you just flew off then or did you kill the manticore kill it every hex i threw just bounced off its hide no it would have had me if i hadntgotten my broom in time but yeah i flew on to hogwarts and when i got here there was a welcoming committee what reporters or something death eaters harry corrected his friend as he took the stairs up to gryffindor tower two at a time wincing as his bruises complained ron ran up beside him highly agitated scruffing at his hair what the bloody hell death eaters why didntyou tell me i haventhad time harry said with an apologetic shrug sorry but i didntwant to tell everyone else just hermione and ginny i guess harry summed up the rest of his adventure as quickly as possible he couldntgive ron a very detailed account of the fight but was sure to mention grawp part and the nifty little communicator dumbledore had put on his broom he frowned when he remembered that he was supposed to have asked dumbledore about that the thought had struck him as he lay in the hospital wing that having something like that for the d a would be very helpful this year if anything were to go wrong as well as special portkeys made for use within in the castle in case someone needed to make a quick getaway he outlined his idea to ron who thought it was brilliant if we key them to go to dumbledore office then no matter what happening he ll know right away and the person can get away as well good thinking harry ron clapped him on the back as they stood before the portrait of the fat lady we ll just need to make sure you carry about fifteen of those and that you know who cantget hold of you in here cause well no i guess that would be even worse than staying to face whatever it was i mean if he could get a hold of you that way no more portkeys for me harry said in a tone that brooked no argument what the password salutatory salutations ron said promptly welcome back boys the fat lady said with a smile my haventyou both grown they gave her embarrassed nods and stepped through the entry once inside harry took advantage of the chaos of the common room with its group of overeager first years and escaped straight up to his room before he could be noticed ron stopped to whisper something to hermione who was still marking things off her clipboard looking capable as always in his usual room his dorm mates minus ron waited to hear the details about his summer that had been hinted at during the feast he dodged as many questions as he could and gave short answers to the rest dean and seamus eventually started grousing about harry tight lipped answers and ron having joined them earlier all too willingly picked up a full narration harry stood on the far side of the bed from them as he got ready for bed more self conscious now than ever before while undressing he still had bruises from his encounter with the manticore that hadntbeen healed a new thin jagged scar that almost went the length of his right arm as well as the potion band and the spring loaded wand holder attached to his wrist none of which he had yet explained the guys werentwatching him now though they were too caught up in the story harry listened with a detached air as he changed into his pajamas it was interesting if disturbing to hear the events told secondhand and with all the sensitivity of a wildebeest dancing the tango ron often got lost in the story so then it was my turn to be bodyguard and what do you know but an eagle owl comes pecking at the window and it s not malfoy owl seamus burst out and the other boys looked alarmed one and the same ron said nodding solemnly the boys exchanged looks then looked over at harry he saw several eyes go to the band on his arm but no one asked so so what did malfoy want neville asked nervously eyeing harry i mean you guys hadntbeen writing to each other oh screw your brain on neville ron said his voice a growl it was a trap a warning harry corrected tersely while buttoning on his pajama top that was the beginning of a trap ron continued adamantly before spearing harry with a look if malfoy hadntsent it you wouldnthave gone outside that night harry paused sure i would ve ron rolled his eyes for malfoy right harry paused again yeah he was trying to sort it out for himself before saying more but ron beat him to it so in fifth year you leave hogwarts and the last thing you hear from malfoy is a threat against your life what dean said startled oh yeah ron nodded at him death threat big as you please right there in the corridor so over the summer if death eaters show up outside your house with malfoy in tow the first thing in your mind is trap right of course seamus agreed you d have to be a complete loon to think otherwise bloody ferret but ron added triumphantly you get a note warning you of danger if you leave the house from the great slytherin prat and suddenly you re waffling they know you harry it was a brilliant plan death eaters outside his house dean asked confused ron obliged by telling the whole story while harry went over the course of events in his mind it was true that malfoy note had made him question the other boy safety at the hands of death eaters but then again seeing anyone that way beat up and bleeding and held at wand point would make harry want to interfere see ron concluded the handkerchief was a portkey and malfoy the wanker made good on his threat no harry insisted malfoy didntknow it was a portkey dean and seamus snorted ron flushed dontbe a dolt harry of course he did he was obliviated oh yeah ron said sarcastically i sure that happened right after he snogged umbridge that sent the other boys off into peals of laughter but harry wasntlaughing he believed malfoy ron was eyeing him as he went on well even if malfoy didntknow his dad was the mastermind and used him like an arse wipe and it was still a bloody brilliant plan oh yeah harry turned away brilliant uh harry neville spoke up what was that thing on your arm harry turned back poison antidote crystallized pellets just in case i think they were made from a bezoar oh the tow headed boy looked down miserably i see he seemed to be taking harry story very hard as if he were somehow responsible so the the trap worked then dean asked hesitantly not looking at harry ron continued the story on and harry took that as his cue to leave the room taking as long to brush his teeth as possible he didntwant to hear anymore about what happened he remembered it completely that kiss tonight and the feelings that came with it for some reason had brought it back in brilliant detail and all harry wanted to do was forget by the time he came back in they were at the end of that episode so if it hadntbeen for me and ginny harry would ve bled to death for sure ron said soberly the looks of the other boys had turned into pained grimaces and neville looked as if he might cry that horrible he managed to get out in a watery voice it wasnt that bad harry muttered desperate to take the pity off their faces ron snorted not bad at all that why you were laid up for two days at my house without speaking what dean and seamus chorused neville eyes were as big as saucers harry couldntstand it it wasntthat big a deal i just didntfeel like talking all right he jerked away and opened his trunk stowing his toiletries angry for some reason by the time his temper stopped churning ron was finishing the dementor story finally skimming now that harry ire was raised harry stood up and glanced over disgusted to see neville face in his hands and the other boys eyeing him as though he were a ghost he glared at ron who returned his look with such a weary look of grief that he was cut to the heart ron hadntenjoyed reliving that story at all so harry is the one we ve got to protect in gryffindor that the hat spoke about dean said soberly not that i really had any doubt and that why you ve been assigned bodyguard duty eh seamus added with a nod to ron that good to know if the year going to be anything like harry summer we ll have to be on our toes keep an eye out on slytherin especially malfoy neville just nodded his head still down especially during quidditch dean agreed hey now that lee gone and graduated they need someone to commentate the matches maybe i ll try my hand at it and keep an extra sharp eye on harry you mean try your mouth at it mate seamus said with a short bark of a laugh harry who was startled at the thought that quidditch might be more dangerous now nodded quickly that would be great thanks and i can keep an eye on all the girls for you seamus added with a sly grin you know in case there an ulterior motive somewhere in all that adoration harry felt his smile freeze on his face ron was staring at him grinning seamus went on and you know help myself to any leftovers hey dean said indignantly and would you be wantin him to have all the girls seamus exclaimed he only got one pair of lips and two hands you know harry went scarlet and turned away smiling as seamus added in a high pitched girly voice more the pity after several more randy comments and bouts of raucous laughter the other boys told the stories of their summers all of which had been less painful and more carefree than harry s though the shadow of tom had fallen over all their stories helped harry relax a bit and he felt better by the time they each pulled their hangings over to go to sleep his ribs were sore from laughing but sleep seemed only a breath away it was when he was lying still that the picture of the first years downstairs came back to him and he realized with a start that ron hadntbeen with hermione doing prefect duty harry sat up quickly wincing at the continuing pain in his abdomen why wasntron a prefect then he knew harry jerked back his hangings put on his glasses and strode over to ron bed ron he hissed as quietly as possible wha came a sleepy voice from the other side after a moment the curtains fumbled open and ron pale face showed up from the depth of crimson velvet what is it you re not a prefect harry said tersely no that righ i not ron said before yawning now go back to sleep harry stopped him from pulling the curtains back together why arentyou ron met his eyes hesitantly speaking with the air of someone stepping in front of a firing squad because i on potter duty remember his weak smile did nothing to help i cantbelieve this harry hissed so you wontget to be head boy all because of me no ron shook his head it not like that dumbledore says i sort of an unofficial prefect now no pratty badge or anything but if i do my job well now then i ll still be up for head boy when it time see ron said hopefully harry calmed somewhat but didntgive in completely you liked that pratty badge not as much as i like having you around ron pointed out easily then yawned again go back to sleep who bloody well cares if i a prefect or not harry hesitated but couldntsee any resentment in ron attitude if ron didntmind then why should he all right then he said softly go on back to sleep harry padded back over to his bed and sat down he wasntsure if no he was sure that he didnt deserve a friend as good as ron someone who was putting his whole life on hold just to be around him and protect him apparently while he d been training those last few weeks before school a lot of decisions had been made without him harry pulled off his glasses and retreated back into bed he glanced over and called out thanks ron a sleepy forgettaboutitmate rumbled out from behind the curtains harry pulled his own hangings around got under the covers and relaxed sleep came quickly escorted in on the gray screen in harry mind he should have gone up to the infirmary to get those last healing spells that was the first coherent thing harry thought after waking his ribcage was stiff and uncomfortable and his entire body was sore he wondered why until the memory of the previous day overtook him portkey squeeze brush with a manticore collision with a malfoy a life or death ride to hogwarts then the episode with susan that had taken a powerful surge of magic to deal with all in all he guessed it just made sense turning over with a groan he suddenly realized it was quiet in the room but some sort of noise had awoken him what had it uh harry neville suddenly asked from over by his bed it a quarter of eight you ve got to get up and get your schedule i brought you a piece of toast here and there were footsteps over by his trunk thanks harry mumbled and started to get up first day of school and he was already behind schedule why hadntron woken him he opened his bed hangings just as the sound of feet came pounding on the stairs outside the room someone was running full tilt as though something terrible had happened harry stomach lurched not again another normal moment twisting into a nightmare anything could have happened but his scar wasnthurting at all by the time the door was flung open harry was on his feet wand drawn heart pounding mate it was ron standing in the doorway clutching a napkin full of breakfast to his chest staring at the drawn wand what he looked around for an attacker drawing his own wand awkwardly dammit where s harry breathing again lowered his wand and neville took the opportunity to squeak out the door behind ron mumbling something about classes neville ron turned around to call after him perplexed but received only a mumbled answer harry felt a flush creep up his neck as ron turned to stare at him again harry pushed his wand back into the wrist holster and cleared his throat suddenly all his aches reappeared aggravated by his quick motion and he bit back a groan merlin what happened ron asked again finally relaxing enough to lower his wand where d you go harry asked grumpily loathe to admit he been spooked by nothing but pounding footsteps i met hermione for breakfast early and i didntthink you d sleep this long ron sounded slightly defensive i came as soon as you woke up he paused a moment before coming over why d you have your wand out harry turned to his trunk and picked up the napkin with toast on it shifting it to his bed then he opened his trunk and got out his toiletries i was half awake when i heard you running toward the door and it sounded like like something was happening and never mind how d you know i was awake huh oh this ron reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out a small oblong stone the color of cornmeal harry stepped closer to see it a dragon kidney stone takes real well to spells charlie spelled it to you so i d know how you were doing so far it working great how does it work ron chucked into harry hand and he turned it over fascinated if a little bothered by the lack of privacy it represented well it not too complicated temperature and color tell the different states you re in that color right there means you re hungry which is why i brought all the food of course if it that color and gets hot you re really hungry let see purple is sick blood red is for hurt black is for unconscious sleeping is kind of blue and waking up is yellow i like that one he confided very nice it normally just a grayish limey green color if it ever goes back to that color then well ron checked himself and trailed off awkwardly right could have used one of those this summer when did charlie do all of that harry d been told during those last weeks at the burrow that some extra protections were being made to keep him safe but this was the first time he d seen any yet dunno exactly he came by when i was standing outside of dumbledore office and gave it to me harry stood straighter so charlie did decide to stay then oh yeah ron said with a grin dumbledore tried to get him to leave but couldntexactly order him to so charlie hanging around keeping an eye on the students he said to call if you needed him i meant to tell you all of this last night but then susan came up and well it flew out of my head harry had to smile at the thought that charlie was staying around it made him feel better somehow i ll be quick he promised ron and then strode quickly to the bathroom so who brought you toast before me the redhead called after him er neville i think harry yelled over his shoulder yeah well i brought you three pieces of toast and two pieces of bacon harry brushed his teeth and washed his face as quickly as possible returning to the room at a jog see the grea fing about bein a bo yguar ron said with a full mouth as soon as harry reappeared is tha if you re la i la but it not my fau he grinned and swallowed not a bad deal all the way round yeah but i donteven know if i going to be late i dontknow my schedule yet harry lamented as he grabbed clothes and robes out of his trunk yeah we ve got to get a move on mcgonagall giving out schedules already harry pulled on some trousers with a jerk he couldnthelp but feel that ron really could have woken him up earlier so what were you and hermione meeting about anyway oh ron straightened up and paced over to the door well i wanted to see what she thought of how things were going you know harry finished dressing suddenly angrier now that he had a full picture of why ron had left him in bed he turned and straightened his covers with such a jerk that toast and napkin went flying so what did she think of my behavior last night with an aggravated sigh he peered under the bed nothing i mean yeah okay i told her what happened with susan but only because i wanted her to you know try to figure me out harry glared at ron from the floor where he had been kneeling the toast had disappeared of course not ron hastily added she just worried about you mate and you know she smart she thinks of loads things that i don t the look on ron face made harry sigh ron couldnthelp it it was just part of the way he thought harry stood up and grabbed his robe sliding it on expertly so what did hermione decide is susan off her rocker he asked in a nonchalant voice looking down at the zipper as he pulled it up or am i she wants to keep an eye on susan ron said quietly she says susan shouldntbe acting that way that it too forward for her she going to poke around a bit see if she can figure something out you know harry could fill in the blanks himself with a deep breath he reminded himself that his friends were only trying to help and that they had spent a long summer worrying about him it was only natural that they had bonded but the pang in his stomach wasntvery nice harry shook it off you were right ron last night next time i ask to be alone with somebody especially a girl hex me ron looked startled then grinned you got it mate harry ate the piece of bacon ron hadnteaten yet as they headed downstairs and talked lightly of quidditch plans katie bell was captain this year her last and things were a bit up in the air after the disastrous last year when harry hadntbeen able to play at all after attacking malfoy of course that ban had been lifted but ginny was already the seeker it helped that she wanted to try chasing but harry worried slightly that the only spot open for him would be something he didntwant ron wouldnthear of it katie would have to be completely nutters not to put you in at seeker and ginny wontcare he said earnestly she really is good at chasing we tried her out a few times and she was really fast it was apparent that the breakfast rush was quite over at they reached the great hall the heads of house were walking amongst the students giving out schedules and discussing problems still up at the faculty table were the headmaster madame hooch professor haverlime and hagrid who waved cheerily at harry and immediately started making large motions as if trying to do sign language harry caught ron sleeve hold on what hagrid saying ron squinted to see that far well either he bought a big box and wants to stuff you inside or no that gotta be it big box apparently wants to make a present out of you oh hey i know he wants you to come see him later yeah yeah that it harry nodded in agreement those large waving arms seemed to be indicating he wanted them to visit harry nodded to hagrid and moved on there got to be a more secret way of communicating that harry muttered yeah why didnthe just use an owl ron shook his head as they resumed their walk over to the table harry noticed a red head swiveling round for a glance at them and then ginny was quietly making her way toward them as her brown eyes met his his stomach quivered unexpectedly harry katie bell had just called out his name and everywhere heads turned his way harry he here hi harry the sound of voices swelled around them and then another curious sound rose above it wings but not just a few or the usual whirring of the mail call but look sharp harry dean called out loudly from the gryffindor table duck yelled seamus or you ll get and his voice was drowned out by the flurry of owls over harry head ginny reached them just in time to put up her wand and yell a spell the red light hung there suspended then exploded into a round curving disc over harry head when all the owls dropped their parchments packages and scrolls they fell onto the shield bounced and rolled to the ground on either side of him it was raining letters for almost half a minute what happening harry tried to yell to ginny over the noise she was the closest to him now and bellowed something in return her eyes still fixed on the shield harry paused watching her did she just say fan mail ron and hermione were outside the shield keeping the crowd back using a few stinging hexes when necessary two more shields suddenly sprang up to block the students cast by professor dumbledore and professor haverlime by the time the letters had ceased the hall was completely silent bloo dy hell harry when the rest of your mail getting here ron said weakly there was a second more of silence then laughter rolled through the crowd ginny ended her shield but caught hold of harry arm when he tried to step out of the circle don t she said with a fierce note in her voice nicely done mr weasley miss granger and miss weasley came dumbledore patient voice as he headed in their direction canceling his shield with a flick of his hand and thank you for the back up professor haverlime he gestured to her grandly and she nodded in return her shield disappearing now if you will please move aside he said gently to the crowd of students in front of him they parted in a rush and donttouch anything with another wave of his hand the whole deluge of parchments and packages disappeared harry breathed a sigh of relief there must have been some sort of error those couldnt have all been for him dumbledore was standing just in front of ginny now who was paler than harry had noticed at first in fact hermione and ron were standing close together now both looking extremely relieved harry turned to dumbledore puzzled quick thinking indeed although miss weasley there was already a spell in place to sort mr potter mail and check it for nasty hexes or harmful charms had the mail been allowed to fall any closer to him they would have all been drawn up automatically and sent to the owlery where mr filch has the honor of sorting harry mail himself harry looked askance at ron here and found his mate with raised eyebrows thinking the same thing that filch might be likely to overlook a few things if they would hurt harry filch had a vendetta against any rule breakers who got off with anything less painful than the rack dumbledore continued on only letters and packages that are without evil intent will be allowed to come to you mr potter and only after they are cleared today mail may take a day or two to sort i trust that is no problem harry shook his head vigorously half hoping that most of it would be questionable to keep it from being his responsibility how would he ever get time to read all of them professor why did i get so much mail that never happened before students return to your tables and if you have completed your breakfast then let move on toward class shall we with disappointed looks the students turned away in a wave harry could tell by the long held glances in his direction that some of them had hoped to speak with him and he was glad the opportunity had been thwarted now then harry most of your mail this summer was directed here to hogwarts unless it was from one of your known correspondents some of that mail was left over from then the remainder of it i afraid to say is my fault he said with a sad shake of his head that was belied by the twinkle in his eyes ms skeeter article has sent quite a shockwave through the wizarding community rife with quotes from your rather ingenious speech last night harry let his head fall forward and squeezed his eyes shut why had he mouthed off like that i afraid harry that you are once again famous but this time it is for your determination to do right and your unflinching ability to speak the truth even in the face of unspeakable evil it was only right that your words make it out to the public where it could do the most good and here he leaned down to capture harry eyes with his own where it will irritate tom the most he chuckled i must confess i laugh every time i think of tom reading that article and he did laugh now well done harry oh well done fifty points to gryffindor he called out as he crossed the floor applause rang out from the gryffindors and they pounded on the table way to go harry harry glanced over at the slytherin table out of curiosity and found them once again divided the twitchtie girls were standing by the table watching him with sober faces one of them nodded in his direction most of the other first years were already heading out the door to go to class followed by the other younger years a few glancing toward harry the older students were still lounging at the table all pointedly ignoring him malfoy was nowhere to be seen harry turned to his friends only to find ginny with her arms crossed over her chest eyeing him defiantly i just thought it would be better to be safe than sorry and if it made you mad then i dontcare harry blinked i not angry that was a brilliant shield ginny when did you learn it over the summer she said her posture slowly defrosting but if i d just let the bloody letters fall they would have disappeared anyway i thought you were in danger she said sheepishly her cheeks tinged pink danger yeah me too ron said with a loud sigh i doubt parvati will forgive me for that stinging hex very soon i just didntwant her to touch any of the letters well it was worth it we didntknow about the safeties on harry mail hermione said in a matter of fact voice and a portkey doesnthave to be keyed to one person it can take anyone who touches it harry mouth opened in an o portkeys the whole lot of them had been worried about a portkey letter and he d been oblivious it burned a little bit that they felt he needed to be protected but then well that was a fruitless train of thought to follow when was someone not trying to kill him odds were that someone had already tried at least once this morning harry said a sincere thanks to each of them in turn hermione beamed at him ron flushed and ginny flushed and beamed then professor mcgonagall approached with a small smile on her lips well mr potter you ve already earned gryffindor fifty points from the headmaster before the term even officially starts here is your schedule she handed him a parchment which is the exact same as mr weasley your eight o w l s were very very impressive due to the circumstances in which you were functioning even an o in potions mr potter splendid i d just like to say congratulations and say further that the day you become an auror i fully intend to find dolores umbridge grave and dance a jig right there on top with a last smile she turned to ron where her face immediately went back to its rather natural grim expression now mr weasley you have been allowed in potions expressly to keep an eye on mr potter but i expect you to work hard and do the homework like the gryffindor that you are i dontneed to tell you how uncomfortable it was for me to be forced to ask professor snape to make an exception in your case it was not pleasant and i do not want you to make either professor snape or myself live to regret it is that clear rom nodded with wide eyes good miss granger i expect nothing less than your best this year as always with your twelve o w l s you have already been a credit to you house finally she turned to ginny this will be quite a year for you miss weasley get plenty of rest eat well and study hard dontlet this bunch pull you into any of their shenanigans i highly desire you to remember that you are all four of you schoolchildren and that by god is all we expect you be her voice shaking with sudden emotion professor mcgonagall made fierce eye contact with them all as she reached harry her face seemed to pinch inwards and she took a shuddering breath before nodding to him she turned and exited limping her silver topped cane flashing as she hobbled on not one of them would have dared to correct professor mcgonagall but as they stood looking at each other harry saw the same sort of thoughts running through all of their minds his friends had stopped being just schoolchildren after last year at the ministry when they faced torture and death for the sake of their friend actually harry reminded himself ginny had stopped long before that when she was a first year and encountered tom diary harry as well had stopped being a child in his first year when he made the decision to stop tom before he could get to the philosopher stone because he no one else was there to do it harry shook off professor mcgonagall words if the one that fulfilled the prophecy was just another schoolchild then the whole world was doomed author note the title of this chapter comes from the fact that harry was correct and someone has tried to kill him at least once this morning that i know of the spectre of death was standing over his shoulder and cackling for almost a full minute before he was thwarted whew chapter eight fair winds turn into foul ron was nodding in approval as he read off their schedules they d had to run after professor mcgonagall and get them after she completely forgot to pass them on newt level transfiguration at nine newt level potions at eleven and newt level care of magical creatures at two not a bad schedule except for the fact that almost all the classes are completely mixed yeah and the fact that we have to spend two hours in the dungeon with snape harry said darkly snape will be nicer this year hermione said conclusively looking back and forth between the two of them from what i ve heard he actually enjoys teaching the higher level classes well as surprising as that is harry finally spoke up after trying hard to imagine snape enjoying anything other than torturing his students with impossible instructions slanderous ridicule and open derision he never had to teach a higher level class with me in it hermione gave him a sympathetic look it time for class at least potions isntfor another two hours hurrah ron said despondently as he stood ron it the beginning of term hermione snapped at him would it hurt you to try to be excited about school for just one day ron just grumbled why isnt harry getting a lecture he not excited either yes harry that true hermione said with a nod in his direction both of you need to improve your studies this year i know you have a lot on your minds but really and as the three of them moved toward the door hermione grew brisker and more authoritative with each second ron however grew gloomier as hermione outlined her plans of study for each afternoon after classes she was determined to keep an outline of all the information given in class every day so that studying would be less difficult and she would retain more it was a good plan harry guessed but after six years of knowing hermione he still didntunderstand her how could anyone care about learning stuff that much it had never seemed that important to him and now all he could think about was if any of the stuff he learned would actually come in handy when he faced tom for the last time if it didntbenefit him directly was it even worth going to class hermione would say yes but given a choice harry would take alive and failing three classes over dead but would have graduated top of his class anyday he realized that he d been silent too long as hermione slowed down to walk beside him how are you feeling this morning harry glanced over at her before mumbling i fine she glanced around the hallway before drawing closer to harry and lowering her voice ron told me exactly what happened with susan and i even more shocked than you were i think you were exactly right to push her away and if she was hurt then that her fault hermione eyes were narrowed and her face so grim that she was a bit scary at that moment what i want to know before i go talk to her no hermione don t i know you re uncomfortable with it but you donthave to be anywhere near me when i do it harry stomped down on his temper and ground out the words i dontneed you to hermione rushed on in a low voice i know you don t but the truth of the matter is that i thought i knew susan and i wouldnthave expected her to act like that either she changed a good bit over the summer or she bears serious watching harry i going to find out which now all i need to now from you is whether she has ever seemed to show an interest in you before harry shook his head checking with ron who shrugged ever flirted harry stared at her blankly i mean has she put her hand on your arm and leaned in to whisper in your ear or giggled like lavender whenever you came near hermione imitated the whispering lean fluttered her eyelashes at him in a peculiar way and harry suddenly had a realization the giggling thing that means they re flirting with me hermione rolled her eyes good grief yes although truly lavender is just giggly about all boys so i wouldnttake it personally with her has susan ever behaved like that around you before no not at wait harry paused as he remembered her during the crush after his speech she d been really funny then yeah she er blushed a bit when she was talking to me right after the sorting and all that oh hermione said in a disappointed voice well still she hasntever tried to kiss you before has she harry shook his head and started walking to transfiguration again hoping hermione would take the hint she did after declaring that she would go to dumbledore with her findngs and the subject was dropped for now harry was pleased with that since classes were sure to be extremely taxing ron harry said just as they reached class where was ginny headed uh she has care of magical creatures first thing ron said reaching to open the door for his friends to enter last i heard her say was that you should do an independent study on the nature of dreams if you re planning on sleeping this late every day harry colored slightly and ron burst out laughing as he walked by been having a few of those kinds myself lately mate oh honestly hermione said in a muffled voice transfiguration was a two hour review of six previous years of study all done in a room full of students from all four houses including a tired looking barely smirking malfoy but harry barely had time to contemplate the pleasant reasons for malfoy lack of insults as they were instructed to transform a hair pin into a beetle a beetle into a pin cushion a pin cushion into a turtle and finally a turtle into a goblet at the end of the four transfigurations the final goblet was judged on not just uniform shape and color but bonus points were given for artistic merit artistic merit ron whispered furiously to harry when mcgonagall was on the other side of the room helping terry boot capture his scuttling pin cushion both of them already had turtles of a sort on their table looking well for lack of a better word shell shocked how am i supposed to make a nice looking goblet out of a lopsided slightly soft turtle ron poked at it with his wand which sank into the turtle velvety shell and produced a squeak which startled ron is it supposed to do that ron hermione said in a low voice stop hurting your turtle if you dontlike the way it looks it your fault and anyway it doesntmatter what your turtle looks like it the will power within the spell that makes the goblet what you want it to be just concentrate harry listening to them decided to try the gray screen to help him focus better looking at the slightly gray and extremely big headed turtle in front of him he figured he had nothing to lose pulling up the gray screen in his mind harry blocked all extraneous thought setting one hand on the dodgy looking turtle sitting dumb on the table in front of him and holding up his wand on the gray screen he conjured an image of a beautiful silver chalice etched with flowing scrollwork hiding running wolves and their mates howling at the moon the stem arced inward toward the middle then flowed back out to a rounded pearl studded base with a dull satin finish it was very simple and appealing harry paused the way it came to him completely designed and whole made him wonder if he had seen it somewhere before with that image firmly in mind he waved his wand the slow rush of power from his wand was different than normal and the turtle was frustratingly slow to transform but harry didntlose concentration and when the final changes were made the chalice harry had held in his mind was now there sitting on the table he smiled and reached for it just as he heard several other gasps around him mr potter professor mcgonagall stopped before his table one hand held to her chest may i see your chalice please harry hesitated then passed it over to her good job harry hermione nodded at him then turned back to her own small perfectly formed turtle with a determined expression ron was looking at the chalice shaking his head finally professor mcgonagall looked up class this is a stunning representation of the art of transfiguration highest marks mr potter this is the worst potion ever to grace a cauldron in my newt level potions mr potter kudos on bringing my teaching career to an all time low snape said in that well articulated malicious tone reserved for harry apparently reckless bravery and consummate skill in navigating the wonders of celebrity life does not make one adept at potions no when part or all of one gray matter is taken up forming speeches to make ready to give your adoring public well then your studies can only come a dismal second or third there was the usual patter of laughter from the slytherins a few overeager high fives at harry expense though malfoy seemed to be less than involved ron was growing angry beside him as usual tensing up and clenching his fists but this was what harry had been expecting from snape stinging criticism leading into a tirade on the danger of pride and recklessness concluded by a scathing review of the speech he d been led into making by dumbledore to hear snape talk you d think harry had got up there and read off a list of his most becoming attributes followed by a demonstration of bare chested well oiled prowess only the most self delusional type of person would treat his fellow students to such a one sided display but as snape was surely realizing by now as spittle flew from his lips his words were having less and less effect on harry the gray screen that had become so useful was helping him block all response to the embittered words instead harry felt an aura of peace overtake him snape was a git but how could anyone be so mistaken did he even believe what he was saying five points from gryffindor for ignoring a professor harry perked up at that sorry sir hadntrealized that you were actually done he said with the smallest amount of irritation possible snape just glared down at him with black fathomless eyes harry met his gaze easily with no challenge no anger and saw the oddest flicker in the man eyes the hate wavered and for a moment harry saw a vision of snape bending over him at malfoy manor and he remembered how the man had risked his life to get him his wand and the potions that had given him enough strength to fight and how almost kindly he had seemed at that moment the lone voice of protection in that hour of horror snape recoiled as if struck harry blinked startled until he realized that snape had been reading his mind to have that moment flung back in his face when he was at his formidable most detestable self snape had whipped around almost immediately and was slowly walking toward the front of the room harry was not trying to read his mind but could feel from his seat that the man was desperately trying to pull himself together and for the first time harry wondered if that hated persona of the potions master was merely a role he played what other reason could there be for such a delay in his sarcastic wit the dark figure at the front of the room was standing deadly still as though he could not face the room of students at present harry looked over at ron only to find a cheshire grin on his mate face beyond him at the next table hermione looked at harry with wide eyes what did you do she mouthed at him harry shrugged beside her parvati patil gave harry a nod and look that clearly said good job slowly whispers grew in the room until snape voice rang out books out at the command in his voice the students all scrambled to get their texts out of their bookbags several knocking implements to the floor from their potion making chapter one read now without turning around snape strode toward his office opened the door and entered slamming it shut behind him at the other end of the room malfoy jumped to his feet his voice dripping venom what did you do potter harry shook his head at a complete loss to explain away something so strange i didntdo anything he finally said i was just thinking of this summer that all draco face lost all color and he looked around the room as if they were accusing him then he sat abruptly harry watched the slytherin and exchanged looks with ron harry seamus was leaning over his table to whisper to him what did you do to the two of them and can you do it every day the class tittered and giggled behind their hands all except the slytherins who had started reading almost immediately harry saw several of them shooting dirty looks in malfoy direction but he was too busy reading to notice or so harry thought until blaise venomous look was followed by a jerk that must have been a vicious kick to malfoy shin beneath the cover of the table malfoy body clenched in reflex and his eyes widened slightly but for all intents and purposes he appeared to keep reading harry felt a surge of anger against blaise but shook it off malfoy deserved whatever his mates dished out now that his body guards had deserted him in all fairness they hadntpassed the o w l for this class but neither had they been sticking by malfoy at other times either in fact they seemed to have been ignoring him harry turned back to his book determined to do the work assigned now that no one could predict the man behavior more likely than not snape would find a way to punish harry for what happened today but while he read his mind kept fogging over and puzzling back over malfoy problem his sudden transformation into a slytherin with no family and no fortune with which to prop him up he was at the bottom of his house food chain it might have been something the prat needed to experience badly after all the abuse he d dished out over the years but being powerless and bullied was something harry knew too much about to treated lightly it wasnttoo many years ago that he had been in a similar situation made a social leper by his cousin heavy handed dealings completely unable to fight back against those who lobbed insults and accusations at him powerless but not anymore harry allowed himself a sudden brief smile well maybe more like a lopsided smirk if snape reaction just now had been a correct indicator harry had just mastered occlumency lunch was eventful that day interrupted on two accounts both of them events that reverberated through the halls of hogwarts for the remainder of the year the first came mid way through harry meal he was feeling rather good about things after his first potions class of the year snape had not made a reappearance in the dungeon nor did he show up at his usual place at the faculty table to dine also absent harry noticed with a niggling of curiosity professor dumbledore was not there either professor mcgonagall was however in her usual spot engaged in a hearty discussion with hagrid and professor haverlime all three of them were shooting him rather approving looks which made harry think they must have been discussing his turtle to chalice transfiguration project the inner parts of him were beginning to glow he felt so good in fact ginny remarked to him that he looked like a cat who d fallen into a vat of cream which led into a fun discussion of harry escapades for the day by his class mates ginny seemed most impressed by dean account of the interaction with snape especially when she understood by whispered comments from hermione and a finger signal from ron that harry had actually used occlumency to block snape and only show him in his mind what he wanted him to see ginny leaned over the table and fixed harry with a very knowing smile harry smiled back expecting admiration and getting ready some humble deflecting words to say if you want that big ego of yours deflated any you know where to find me she said sweetly dean and seamus howled with laughter even ron snorted well i didn t i didntsay i thought it was so great harry protested then ginny giggled at him throwing him off completely harry turned to hermione eyebrows raised which set ron off laughing then she laughed too it seemed like everybody knew what was going on except him harry was giving up and digging back into his steak and kidney pie when a lone owl shot through the great hall causing quite a disturbance among the students owl call was always in the mornings so it was with bewilderment and great curiosity that everyone watched its course the first years were all looking confused many students automatically turned to look at harry ginny ron hermione and neville among them and harry stared right back at them what i dontthink it heading for him ginny said tersely no it not hermione agreed giving ginny a look but it must be an emergency of some kind if it couldntwait for owl call in the morning right harry said automatically hey that a howler and it was the word was repeated across the hall many times as the bright obnoxiously red letter came into view gripped by the dark barn owl talons the owl swerved in the direction of the slytherin table gasps were heard and many feet shuffled as those who couldntsee stood trying to get a better view harry was trying desperately to see who was sitting at that end of the table when someone bolted up and ran it was malfoy what he think he doing ron asked everyone loudly run malfoy pansy shrieked you coward then another rushing figure cut malfoy off and he fell sprawling on the hard stones he rolled over and had a staring contest with blaise zabini who was now standing over him with a practically feral grin on his face i think you ll want to take this one malfoy then the zooming owl was upon them and the howler dropped in malfoy lap malfoy stared at it as the envelope shook steamed and hissed he looked more shaken than harry had ever seen him but finally he made a move to grab the envelope and toss it into the air as if the very paper itself might be poisoned the howler screamed as it made a high arc in the air then exploded the proud harsh voice of lucius malfoy filled the air and harry forgot to breathe long life to the name of malfoy and death to its enemies you filthy purile vagabond how dare you how dare you continue to attend hogwarts with children of honest heritage and noble aspirations after betraying me dishonoring my name and turning your back on everything i have taught you how dare you continue to masquerade as a malfoy you have no name and are now no better off than a mudblood harry listened to every word rage building within him so that he trembled not with fear but with power fierce power that ached to blast lucius malfoy into ash his wand was clenched tightly in his hand slick with sweat let it be known that i will do everything in my power to have you thrown out of hogwarts and then i will hunt you down and revenge will be mine you nameless harry jerked to his feet sending the raging torrent of power through his wand with a primal bellow time seemed to slow and the only thing that existed was that that thing with lucius malfoy voice hatred oozed out of every pore of harry body propelling and filling the jet of red light with deadly intent halfway there the streak of red caught flame a gasp of either horror or amazement went around the hall but harry felt only satisfaction as students at the ravenclaw table hit the floor to get out of the way the howler was still spitting out curses as the ball of flame hit and with a loud satisfying whoosh the envelope went up in a roar of blue fire and disappeared harry breathed several deep breaths in and out before he could hear clearly above the loud thumping of his own heart beside him ron was also standing wand out looking stunned ginny and hermione were trading looks their expressions grim awed sighs and exclamations were still breaking across the hall and harry began to feel exposed as everyone stared he sat down and tucked his wand back up his sleeve in as little motion as possible ron lowered his wand beside harry and shuffled a bit looking fiercely around the hall finally as if he could stand it no longer he yelled well what did you expect him to do it was a very mean letter then he sat down beside harry with a thump and shifted in his seat again as if trying to get comfortable himself with what just happened hermione was the first to speak harry what spell was that he met her eyes briefly incendio i think oh she said in a surprisingly matter of fact voice well not only did you not say the incantation out loud but you also put so much power behind it that you caught the very air on fire so he said back a bit defiantly he caught glances being exchanged around the table it was a very mean letter he echoed ron weakly professor mcgonagall strident voice came from the faculty table as she stood to her feet ten points from gryffindor and a detention with filch mr potter for dangerous spellwork in the middle of the great hall and mr zabini ten points from slytherin for that outrageous display harry heart sunk but zabini who was walking away from malfoy with a smug smile only nodded and smirked in harry direction malfoy was still on the floor not moving who cares about the points harry worth it to see lucius malfoy howler blow like that dean said in an awed voice yeah neville agreed looking even more nervous than usual i dontthink i ve ever heard one that bad before that bad ron asked with an incredulous look i dontthink i could have ever come up with anything more perfect in my entire life he said in a supremely happy voice harry turned to stare at him ron hermione hissed how can you say that she leaned over the table to speak more quietly but the urgency in her voice was loud and clear you know what this means to someone like him he no one now he has no name no inheritance nothing ron scowling said how can you defend him i know it bad but come on is there anyone who paraded around their name and their pureblood status more than malfoy how absolutely perfect is it that everything he boasted about for six years was just pulled out from under him his dad said he was worse than a well a you know i mean it horrible yeah but you ve got to see how perfect it is the pleading tone of his voice softened hermione look well be that as it may if harry right then malfoy or whatever you want to call him now was disowned for trying to warn harry this summer isntthat right she turned to harry a worried expression on her face harry blinked but then nodded his stomach feeling as though someone had just dumped a live coal into it malfoy warning owl this summer had been intercepted by his father and that had started it all the portkey the torture everything malfoy hadntreally helped him but he had tried beside him ron was starting to argue back but harry mind was drifting in spite of himself he was hearing that voice again and it was as if he were still there in malfoy manor in agony ashamed of his helplessness have you ever imagined what revenge feels like harry have you harry harry harry suddenly came to with a violent shudder and realized everyone at the table was looking expectantly at him going for the obvious he mumbled i fine he shifted in his chair and waited for the inevitable harping about to begin second time in two days he d gone barking mad hermione d never let him off this time maybe he could cut out now he d almost eaten enough then he felt everyone focus shift around him and he turned to see malfoy standing unsteadily to his feet the prat moved like someone fifty years older he actually swayed lifting his head to meet the gaze of all those staring at him with something of a mix of horror and defiance he didntseem to notice harry among them as he turned and walked slowly out of the great hall to the echoing laughter of the slytherins harry gut twisted again in spite of the fact that the git was the person he most hated in the world well next to his father come on harry ron said with disgust he wasnttrying to help you when he sent that owl it was a set up the prat who cannot be named was lying from the start ginny ron turned to her ignoring the driving aughter from down the table you know what i saying dontyou there no way he telling the truth right the prat who cannot be named dean said wiping his eyes oh that a good one ron ron turned grinned and gave him a casual high five beside them seamus was laughing so hard that he was snorting pumpkin juice out of his nose right ginny ron goaded her shut it seamus ginny snapped at him you re spraying pumpkin juice like a faucet he sobered up pretty quick grabbing the napkin hermione thrust in his direction ginny paused looking over at harry with a pensive pucker between her eyebrows i dontknow harry a pretty good judge of people and i not argued ron right ginny confirmed easily but i dontknow what to think i ve always hated draco malfoy but he not draco malfoy any more is he harry felt another dull ache it was odd to try and grasp the idea that malfoy or whatever he should be called now was just as high up on lucius hit list as was harry well think whatever you want all i know is that now he has even more reason to hate you ron said pointedly before stuffing his mouth with a forkful of potatoes harry saw a few worried looks passed around the gryffindor table neville cast a sympathetic glance at harry and then looked down at his full plate of food he pushed a pea around with his fork well then hermione said in a brisk voice we ll have to keep an eye on him and make sure we know what he up to harry perked up at the tone in her voice she sounded as though she was about to launch off into a plan but just at that moment all the food on the gryffindor table vanished along with the plates silverware and goblets bloody hell ron exclaimed as if this was the last interruption in his meal he could stand i was going to eat that yorkshire pudding all right he stood up and turned around to face as much of the stunned hall as he could who did it i want my food back now i dontthink they can help you ron hermione said tugging him down by the sleeve everyone food has been taken even the faculty harry already watching the conference of teachers at their table helped tug ron back down hagrid was standing ready to walk off and professor haverlime was obviously placating him professor sprout was already on the floor moving rather quickly to the ravenclaw table professor mcgonagall determinedly limped her way down the stairs calling out for those nearby to stay seated as she headed up the main aisle and to the doors professor flitwick was making his way to the hufflepuff first years some of them were looking over at harry and whispering of course harry turned quickly away but caught a lot more heads turning to look at him he looked back down at the empty table and stared at its surface grumpily he hadntdone it maybe you should say something harry ginny whispered to him harry looked up at her like what dontstare at me i didntdo it dontbe stupid she snapped say something calming like you know dumbledore would if he were here i sure he ll be along in a minute harry said after staring at her as if she were mad and if something needs to be said one of the professors will say it that what they re here for ginny raised one very finely arched eyebrow at him as if to say you know that not true but it was true sure harry was the one or whatever but did that mean he had to go all lockhart and take up public air whenever he could he wasntgoing to do it and they could just bloody well sign someone else up if that what they wanted his gaze skipped over to the ravenclaw table where several students were apparently having the same conversation with cho chang who looked as if she were teetering on the edge of giving in she pulled her arm away from overeager girl beside her a twitchtie it looked like and started to stand just as she did the doors at the end of the great hall opened and professor dumbledore walked in accompanied by snape a nearly full flask in his hand his dark robes billowing behind him they moved rapidly into the hall and stopped midway meeting mcgonagall there there was a brief whispered conversation and then dumbledore turned outward my dear students we are so sorry to have interrupted your meal this afternoon your food will be returned shortly to you let all stand shall we the students exchanged looks as one doubtful as to the true nature of the interruption harry was among the first to stand and he studied the headmaster during the loud clatter as everyone re situated themselves standing and facing the middle of the room professor dumbledore face was serene but there was a fierce sharpness about his gaze that harry found startling how are we all feeling today we re at the halfway point of the first day perhaps we might take a little assessment anyone experiencing a loss of feeling in their limbs any excruciating pain in the abdomen anywhere else no that nice how about vomiting professor dumbledore and professor snape were turning in opposite directions looking around the room as intently as if they were using legilimency on every student in their scope harry felt snape eyes on him like laser beams and he flinched when words were suddenly cast into his mind take the poison antidote now you fool snape mouth hadnteven twitched and his gaze had moved on but harry had no doubt he had heard correctly with sudden dread blossoming in his stomach he flicked his wrist to get his wand into his hand ron head whipped over and he silently got out his wand as well harry shook his head when ron eyes met his but his friend didntput away his wand harry whispered venenum the trigger word started the spell and with a small sucking sound a pellet of the universal antidote appeared on harry right palm he popped it into his mouth and let the bitter taste envelope his tongue while dumbledore continued calling out symptoms that progressively grew lighter in seriousness harry quickly called out more pellets and gave one to ron hermione ginny neville and dean seamus was reaching for his when the great hall doors again opened this time with a bang and madame pomfrey stumbled in heaving great breaths she nodded at dumbledore and fell back against the door resting while she got her breath harry gave a pale seamus his pellet and noticed that hermione had a tight grip on ron arm harry gaze traveled back over to ginny and he was horrified to see how glassy her eyes had gone she looked pale as a ghost suddenly fear crushed his chest he d given her an antidote but only after ron and hermione what if it wasntin time what if ginny she didntanswer she swayed on her feet ginny before he knew it harry was halfway over the table reaching for her ginny what is it startled she blinked as if waking from a trance and then stared at him harry one foot on the bench behind him one hipbone carving itself into the table felt as if it took her years to answer in a tremulous voice i fine harry i fine then her gaze wandered around and took in all the people looking at the two of them and she swiped at her watering eyes leaning over suddenly in his direction ginny gave harry a quick kiss on the cheek without blinking she said it just that i d die if anything ever happened to you and in the brown warmth of her eyes harry saw that it was the absolute truth he felt hands on his arms pulling him back across the table but he had eyes only for ginny and the way that pink flush on her cheeks seemed to make her whole face glow then his feet were back on the ground and ron was jerking him around whispering sorry mate but look professor mcgonagall stood at the door striding into the room with a quick gait was charlie weasley his face was sober and he was heading right for harry that was one of the longest minutes of harry life watching the bearer of obviously bad news make his way across the long room to him in the silence that had overtaken the room his mind tossed out possibilities and just as quickly discarded them it was useless to wonder who had been attacked by tom or what trail of blood had been left by death eaters or what new threat loomed on the horizon harry squared his shoulders took a deep breath and cleared his mind whatever it was he could handle it but when charlie stopped in front of him and gestured hermione over to stand with harry surprise was the foremost thought in harry mind hermione grabbed harry hand squeezing tightly and ron eased into the space behind them harry hermione i sorry charlie began in a breathless low voice he was obviously loathe to say more but what came out of his mouth next was probably the last thing harry expected to hear it dobby dobby the house elf he dead he was found an hour or so after doing his usual clean up duties in the gryffindor rooms clutching a piece of toast in his hand he d only taken one bite chapter 9 an ill wind you may be seated students it appears that the beginning of term jitters hasntgotten to us yet professor dumbledore light hearted voice echoed about the room but harry didnthear any more of what was said dobby cantbe dead i haventeven seen him yet his eyes searched charlie s hoping for a reprieve of some kind while his mind wrestled to understand there d been no warning whatsoever it couldntbe that simple that easy for someone to die just floors away from you before you d been able to make time to see them though you were planning to but harry heart didntneed time to reason it out at all it plummeted down into the deep grooves already worn by grief sirius a sharp pang made him bow his head and all at once hope left him this was what he had to look forward to a year of this a year of loss unless he could get rid of tom before then stay with me harry the toast was poisoned charlie was saying and we need to figure out where it came from before anyone else can get hurt did you see anyone bring it up surely they didntdo all this work and then just leave it lying around for anyone to eat i did ron said in a hoarse voice from behind harry i mean i brought up some toast but we both ate it remember harry it couldnthave been that toast right because we ate it and it was fine right i mean you do feel fine you do right harry frowned something was niggling at his mind toast someone had brought him neville ron said suddenly jumping on it like a dog on a bone you said that he brought you a piece of toast too remember but you never ate it i saw it there on your bed harry whipped around and stared at neville with such sudden fury that the boy recoiled he was a traitor like wormtail bloody hell ron continued in a horrified voice i i almost ate it while you were in the loo charlie cursed low under his breath better not tell mum about that oh ron hermione said in a quiet wail grabbing on to his arm seeming too overcome to speak for a moment you you dontthink neville could have tried to poison harry on purpose do you oh poor poor dobby ron swallowed hard blue eyes wide imagine if i d just taken one bite harry felt his lips draw into a grimmer line and a huge clenching fist encircle his chest as charlie strode over to consult professor dumbledore harry gaze returned to neville his friend of so many years yet timid and shy so like wormtail in his years at hogwarts the thought at first had shocked harry but now he was wondering how he d never seen it before neville was just like peter pettigrew harry wand flicked into his hand again and he moved with purpose toward the gryffindor table harry no hermione said sharply grabbing his arm we have to find out what happened first hear his side of the story we could be wrong harry ron tugged on his other arm but said nothing harry let them hold him back for now but his hard gaze was leveled at neville whose face was changing from horrified to something slightly more determined he stood even though dean and seamus were pulling him back down dontbe daft dean counseled give him time to cool down seamus said in a placating voice but neville kept moving awkwardly stepping over the bench and walking around the table to face harry harry squared up to face him and flicked his eyes to ginny she sat watching with wide eyes shaking her head slowly looking dumbfounded harry felt furious neville hadntjust betrayed him he d betrayed all of his friends harry calm down hermione cautioned him we dontknow for sure what happened ron stepped closer in behind harry neville wand wasntdrawn but harry only gripped his all the harder ready for anything he half wished neville would try something and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the traitor he was but neville his head down only walked more slowly as he got nearer mr potter stand down professor dumbledore cast into his mind harry didntmove his wand wasntup anyway they could damn well do what they pleased but he wasntgoing to let another traitor get away with murder he d already made that mistake with pettigrew and the rat had helped the dark lord return and people had died sirius had died red sparks jutted out of the end of harry wand causing a few students to cry out the slytherins loved it do him in harry yeah a gryffindor battle to the death shut it ron yelled harry ignored them harry charlie called after him as neville stepped into range wait harry could see him jogging their way c mon potter let see you turn long bottom into a short one pansy parkinson cackled that quite enough professor mcgonagall snapped out from behind harry ten points from slytherin they groaned harry didntcare one way or the other he had eyes only for neville slowly the blonde boy head came up and his nervous eyes fixed themselves on harry he shook his head which was already trembling and barely formed the words i didntdo it harry i donteven know what ron talking about about the toast i didntdo it yeah right feeling all the eyes in the room turn back on him harry said nothing hermione pleaded with tears in her eyes listen to him harry harry glared at her surprised that she was not on his side when the poison had almost killed both he and ron but it was hard to be angry with her when she was so upset and the mantra listen to hermione took up residence in his head he nodded reluctantly charlie stepped in to take charge glad i didnthave to put you in a body bind harry now let all head up to dumbledore office he going to fetch snape and meet us there harry stomach gave a twist at the idea of snape being thrown into all of this charlie turned to ron i ve got bodyguard duty you go on to class right what ron blustered no way take a break charlie snapped one of you has to go to class and get the notes for the others so send hermione ron all but yelled stepping closer shut it itsy or i ll shut it for you charlie said tersely leaning into ron who went red i need hermione to deal with the house elves winky in quite a state and i dontknow what to tell the others some of them are even talking about wanting clothes you think you want to come and handle that harry and ron exchanged a look oh well then ron said finally his color looking more normal now okay i ll go i can see what hagrid wanted at any rate harry nodded at him then stowed his wand up his sleeve ron walked over to charlie wand out and gripped his wrist with one hand under his breath he muttered something like fraterdum singultus a shimmer of silver followed the spell and ron turned back to harry dontgo anywhere without charlie right harry nodded wondering vaguely what that spell had been ron head quirked to the side as if he was trying to figure something out then he gave a nod and headed back to the table voices began to fill the hall muttering and conjecturing as the crisis was over this way charlie gestured to the hall doors neville you first harry approved that way he could keep an eye on his ex friend a sudden flare of anger made him clench his fists he would make neville pay if he had turned traitor he would make sure everyone knew what would happen to anyone who hurt one of harry friends while trying to harm him but suddenly and vividly there came before his mind the scene in the shrieking shack when he d felt the same way facing down sirius ready to kill him for betraying his parents he d been dead wrong that time harry shook his head this was different and back then once he d found out pettigrew was the real betrayer it had been wrong to convince sirius and remus to let the rat go it had harry could feel hermione eyes on him as they walked along and he realized he d been shaking his head like a nutter he forced himself to stop they exited the hall just as it was coming back to life though the tables were as empty as before harry could hear the professors making explanations that the food would be returned as soon as it was cleared by the house elves immediately after they gained the hallway charlie pointed out to neville a side passage that harry hadntnoticed before just before the first stair they took the narrow winding way and stopped short at a portrait of a gypsy in a bar doing a rather sensual dance for some wizards in farming gear something about the men faces gave harry the feeling the farmers visited this portrait often wouldntthink this one goes to dumbledore office eh charlie said with a slight grin lascivious leprechauns he called out to the gypsy the music stopped and the gypsy turned to charlie oh eet ees a weasley boy ees et not her black eyes flashed eet has been a too long time seence i have seen one of you here een thees hallway but i teenk now perhaps there are too many of you for a rendez vous harry looked over at charlie wondering exactly what the weasley brothers had been up to at hogwarts in the years before harry had come charlie was flushed all right all right just let us through to dumbledore office please oh why deed you not say so with a sudden clap of her hands that sent her many bracelets jangling the gypsy opened the portrait thanks charlie muttered my pleasir she called after them harry angled his body to fit through the somewhat narrow opening and found himself at the base of a spiral staircase carved ornately from a dark wood the sconces on the wall threw shifting shadows and patches of light across the stone walls giving the tall cylindrical passage the illusion of constant motion harry started up after hermione and listened as charlie threw an explanation over his shoulder that bill fault always flirtin with the gypsy girl he had her convinced he was always up to no good and fred and george probably didnthelp with that either how did bill find this place hermione asked in awe taking in the height of the ceiling which sloped away into landing after landing of candlelit stone it not in hogwarts a history i almost positive the map said this room was used for storage it is charlie said as he mounted unless someone needs a quick passage to the headmaster office you know it only there if you need it which explained why it hadntshown up on the marauder map harry decided as charlie went on bill knew it on account of head boy privileges of course which he always took advantage of his own rooms own bath disgusting it was he snorted quidditch heroes dontget nearly the same perks you know harry just girls harry found himself smiling at that and was pleased to notice that his chest felt less constricted now he could breathe easy for the first time since hearing that voice just in time to climb this mountain of stairs hermione hung back to whisper to him you re doing it again arentyou harry glanced over at her puzzled you re not speaking harry paused realizing that it was true and feeling instinctively that it was necessary he d broken out in a rage after sirius died and he couldntlet himself do that again silence was his control harry shrugged and kept walking hermione kept pace with him for a minute tossing a few warnings at him about needing to be able to tell what had happened when they got to dumbledore office harry finally gave her a look and she backed off that more than anything else told him that she was truly worried about him she moved up to charlie and asked him about the name he d called ron was it itsy it was and charlie explained he d nicknamed ron and ginny itsy and bitsy when they used to always try to tag along with him and bill he still used it sometimes when ron needed to be put in his place harry had to smile again then hermione asked about the spell he and ron had performed but charlie wouldntexplain just switching bodyguards that all he said more than once hermione fell silent then and over the next few minutes harry had plenty of time to contemplate neville role in the poisoning and try as he might even as angry as he was he just couldntforce himself to honestly believe that the gentle almost painfully loyal boy would willingly harm him the imperius however was a definite possibility since neville had had such trouble in fourth year throwing that curse off when moody alias crouch had put it on him a more remote possibility was someone using a polyjuice potion but harry really didntwant to consider that it was hard enough trying to figure out who to trust this year without wondering if everyone was who they said they were too they reached the top silent except for the ringing echoes of their footsteps and walked through the ornately carved door one at a time charlie going in between neville and harry after winding their way through one more very narrow tunnel there was a doorway guarded by two more gargoyles identical to the ones guarding the main doorway to dumbledore office gargantuan gobstoppers charlie said readily and the gargoyles stepped aside the door opened with a vertical whoosh and harry followed the others inside hanging slightly back to think the fierce anger that had flooded him at first was gone now he was almost certain neville would know nothing about the poison and there would be no one to punish no one to take responsibility for dobby death harry could feel a well of hatred and despair bubbling up inside he took the only seat left in the room with a loud flump and scrubbed at his face with his hands with the barest flicker of interest he realized that dumbledore and mcgonagall were already present in the room and seemed to be studying him a horrible lump had lodged in his throat and all he wanted to do was escape back down the hallway before he did something he regretted professor dumbledore cleared his throat today we have lost a good friend to hogwarts a pioneer of the house elf cause and one who never ceased to care for others dobby was an example for all of us in loyalty and in diligence grief and weeping at his loss are to be expected harry jaw clenched and he tried to swallow but even more so keen investigation and swift justice are to be pursued the ministry of magic does not investigate the deaths of house elves but we at hogwarts cannot let this crime go unpunished with great speed and delicacy and with all the power of mind we can spare let us delve into the past and see for ourselves what happened so that we may prevent its passing again neville was nodding looking eager to delve away at that moment harry hated him his scar seared and a rumbling feeling of nausea and unpleasant happiness ran through him but he just closed his eyes and waited until they dissipated tom liked his thoughts these thoughts of hatred and despair with a wrench harry pulled up the gray screen in his mind and felt the blessedness of relief harry would you permit us to use the pensieve and see for ourselves what you remember of this morning harry startled from his thoughts opened his eyes and nodded dumbledore stood and went to the cabinet against the wall with a gesture the doors opened and a flood of gray shimmering light unfolded across the ceiling and dripped down the walls the pensieve moved to the center of the room at dumbledore directive and alighted on the floor its contents sloshing thickly once there the headmaster gestured for harry to stand beside him it is a painless procedure harry and needs only for you to focus on the memory perhaps if you use your procclumency screen the memory will be clear enough harry closed his eyes again and for a moment continued to enjoy the blankness of the dove gray screen welcoming its soft iridescent warmth he wished he could wrap himself up in it and just be alone for a while he wondered what would happen if he did harry when you are ready visualize the scene from this morning when you first became aware that someone had brought you the toast we need to see as much detail and as little bias as you can provide remember it exactly as it happened and harry did he remembered waking up late feeling stiff and sore from the day before and being surprised by neville voice just outside his bed hangings that should have seemed strange enough to begin with and harry wondered how he could have ever ignored it but the memory went on with harry over the top response to ron pounding footsteps and then him going to the loo ohno and then having the whole conversation about susan oh help before the toast actually fell to the floor harry jerked and opened his eyes if the toast hadntfallen he would have eaten it he was going to but he got mad at ron and jerked the covers and the toast had disappeared harry shook his head feeling stupid is that it harry the headmaster said in a kind voice harry looked up at dumbledore with pained eyes mutely asking if it had to be shown the headmaster nodded without a word then put his wand to harry head a stream of light clung to the wand when he pulled it away and there was a curious shifting sensation as if the contents of harry mind were re settling themselves it didnthurt but it felt strange and made him want to scratch the inside of his head very good very good dumbledore said in a low voice have a seat harry and a lemon drop he gestured to the tin on his desk in a whisper he added you most likely wontenjoy this part harry paused looking at the contents of the tin morosely and finally taking a lemon drop he popped it in his mouth as he took his seat and his taste buds went into overload they werentjust lemon drops they were super sour lemon drops and the citric acid on them was well into the second layer of skin on his tongue before he was forced to chew on it as soon as he did a soothing sugary syrup erupted from its center and for some reason he felt calmer hm that was why dumbledore was always offering those things now with clarity harry could see that what was about to happen was more ironic than tragic it had to be a payback yeah that was it a cosmic retribution of sorts for the time harry had given into curiosity and viewed snape embarrassing memory in the pensieve now a roomful of people were going to see an unguarded moment of his and he felt like he d rather do a month of detentions with snape than suffer through it as the headmaster said a few words preparing everyone for what they were going to view harry started to wonder where snape had gone off to he would have had a field day with this snarking out comments on the futility of trying to get harry to focus on anything smirking as he waited for the curtain to come up and reveal harry idiocy for everyone then dumbledore was finished speaking and he gestured to everyone to come closer hermione put a hand on harry arm as they walked forward joining charlie neville mcgonagall and dumbledore around the pensieve harry tried not to look at their faces he sighed half hoping neville would have a go at him now and interrupt the pensieve session while simultaneously proving to everyone that he was guilty but no neville was sandwiched in between charlie and professor mcgonagall now looking as uncomfortable as harry felt dumbledore directed everyone to touch the rim of the bowl and harry noticed the look of awe on hermione face he could tell she d been dying to use one of these then her eyes met his and her free hand took his firmly harry took a deep breath staring down into the gray swirling depths of the pool and then they were flipping forward through a kaleidoscope of color and shapes until they landed in harry bed of course in real life there wouldnthave been room for all of them in there but here they all managed somehow to be standing inside the bed hangings looking down at memory harry on the bed harry winced and muttered a curse there he was in his pajamas just waking up and groaning about his sore muscles he looked like such a wimp all bed headed and skinny in his pajamas memory neville was speaking now sounding normal if a bit nervous but then he always did lately didnthe memory harry was still turning over in bed stretching out his muscles painfully and present time harry bit back a groan at least snape wasnthere to see it although harry gaze shot to dumbledore as he watched the bedclothes ripped open would the headmaster show the pensieve memory to snape dread laced harry stomach of course he would harry cursed again then realized he should be paying attention in the memory ron was just entering the room hands full of food and there harry stood like an utter prat wand out as if fighting off hordes of death eaters neville was flipping through his books over on the side fumbling curiously as though looking for something present harry frowned wondering if that was really what he had been doing at the time or if that was something harry mind was filling in since it was blank then memory neville was heading out the door at a rush obviously in a hurry to get to somewhere harry looked over to where present neville was watching the scene and shaking his head looking amazed back over on the trunk was the piece of toast and harry watched as his memory self picked it up only to move it and to later knock it to the floor he felt an utter clot the only other surprising thing was how many times the episode with susan was mentioned which made harry want to crawl under the table but finally painfully the memory was done and they were all back in dumbledore office horror etched on every face that was entirely too close for comfort the headmaster said looking gravely at harry as usual though we do our best harry there are insidious dangers which creep through the cracks your universal antidote pellets would have reversed the poison immediately had you maintained enough calm to remember them venenum mr potter yes sir i remember he said in a subdued voice the headmaster gestured to the chairs if you would all please be seated again only harry and professor mcgonagall sat hermione clutched one of harry shoulders fiercely as if she could keep him safe by holding on charlie was pacing wand clenched in his hand face set like granite his eyes kept straying to neville who was thunderstruck rooted to the ground where the pensieve had been dumbledore was maneuvering the pensieve back into the closet when hermione could wait no longer her hand gave a convulsive twinge on harry shoulder and she threw the words out at neville hurriedly that wasntyou was it you wouldnt do that to harry would you neville was still frozen so she went on looking at the faces around her last year neville risked his life to save harry s he went with us to the department of mysteries and he stuck by harry even after he was injured and tortured and miss granger began the headmaster who was now watching carefully but neville cut in of course i wouldnttry to poison harry he almost yelled his eyes looking suspiciously wet of course not he my friend of course i wouldntdo that to him how could i when he got so many people after him already and he done nothing but do the things i couldnt do harry stared at him not quite understanding and neville flushed i mean i not as brave as him and i dontknow what to do all the time like he does and and well somehow it was nearly me all those people all of them could be after me he grew so pale that harry was concerned i found out about it this summer harry about the prophecy great uncle algie told me on my birthday that i could have been the one and then it all slid into place harry suddenly understood the strange looks he d been getting from neville looks of guilt something he must have been feeling for not being the boy who lived when i found out i just wanted to hide but i couldn t not when harry being so brave neville looked down abashedly so i got a new wand i studied all month long i practiced just to be of some use to harry this year neville took a breath now looking harry right in the eye standing straight and completely unlike the round faced forgetful boy that harry had known for so long i swear harry i swear i did not betray you i havent and i wont and whoever did that is going to pay as soon as i find out who it was who took my face i wouldntdo that to you harry i wouldn t and harry found that in the face of such earnestness he could do little but believe there was a sudden lightness in his chest and he took in a deep breath that he hadntrealized he d needed despite himself his vision grew watery and his mouth turned up at the corners the pain of betrayal fell blissfully away instead of betrayal he had true friendship and another person he could count on i believe you neville harry said simply and he felt everyone in the room stir in relief as do i professor dumbledore broke in with a familiar twinkle in his eyes and it is an unusual and wonderful conclusion however if you did not bring the toast to harry then i afraid we must consider the possibility that another gryffindor has used a polyjuice potion a gryffindor echoed harry but it doesnthave to be does it they had to have had the password hermione said sitting slowly into her chair although if he came in with some other gryffindors who just thought that it was neville and so didntmake him say it they might have made it incredibly easy for him whoever it was she paled it has happened before and that is the precise reason that we must follow the rules miss granger professor mcgonagall said sharply it must be the practice of the dorm to only allow one person at a time from now on so that each person may prove who he or she is by their knowledge of the password and i believe we are down one prefect in the gryffindor sixth year dormitory albus as i have been reminding you all week the headmaster nodded gravely yes minerva and i think now i have found my trustworthy prefect for the boys dormitory tell me mr longbottom what do you think your gran would say if you wrote home that you had made prefect neville jaw dropped and the headmaster smiled merrily wonderful well i suppose that would be perfectly acceptable albus though goodness knows why you had to make such a production out of it professor mcgonagall said a bit crossly one might think that you didnttrust my boys at all the marauder map harry suddenly exclaimed his mind taking a sudden turn that the answer if i had looked at the map this morning i would have seen the true name of the imposter and i would have known not to eat the toast quickly he explained the amazing properties of the map merciful heavens professor mcgonagall said in an undertone that would take an enormous amount of ingenuity and power to construct something of that caliber who did you say made the map the marauders harry answered feeling a stirring of pride a group headed by my father and sirius black also including remus lupin and peter pettigrew astonishing and you say you have this map professor mcgonagall gave the headmaster a stern look as though he were responsible and then requested to see it indeed professor dumbledore sighed i afraid we may have use for that artifact harry more use than you at the moment that map is singularly helpful in the way that it sees through polyjuice potion the current aides i have access to do not detect that type of dark magic and so have been rendered useless and whose fault is that spoke up a portrait from the wall for the first time former headmaster phineas nigellus i told you several times that divesting the headmaster office of all dark devices would run you to ruin and here you are he said with smug satisfaction ah phineas dumbledore said amiably i hardly think we are at ruin a sniffing noise came from the portrait phineas had turned away a matter of semantics ruin is upon you whether you recognize it or not the castle is rampant with spies and plots and all of them center around that boy you would do well to immobilize him attach him to your robes and be done with it harry anger flashed but before he could speak dumbledore had lifted a hand to stop him and harry choked down on his words we are hardly unaware of the seriousness of the situation phineas but i am of the opinion that harry was prophesied to be the one because he is the very sort of person that can take a dire situation such as this and not only handle it but excel in the midst of it and push others along with him as has been evidenced by the amazing proclamation tonight by our very own neville longbottom he gave neville a warm smile which the boy blushingly returned then the headmaster turned his approving smile on harry they may try to knock harry down to put the fear of voldemort into him and to keep him from his destiny but they will not prevail they cannot he is much stronger and more determined than they know indeed more than even tom knows heat was flaming the sides of harry face and yet he could feel a cold chill going down his spine how could anyone have that much faith in him how could he possibly justify it do all those wonderful things when he was just himself just harry but hermione was smiling at him and nodding with shining eyes and there wasntroom in charlie proud gaze for doubt nor was there any in professor mcgonagall eyes only a strange but familiar approval and dawning respect neville was smiling nodding at him smearing away a tear that right he said they wontprevail harry not if we have anything to say about it a n thanks so much for the reviews guys i wish i had more time to answer them all but alas i do read them promise please review so that i know how i doing and what you d like to see fraterdum singultus brothers until the final breath
