 disclaimer i dontown harry potter i dontown any original characters but i ll say so if i ever do summery they said the book was legendary left by the four most memorable pranksters of the past but when the book is found it transports the reader back in time when hermione granger wakes up to find herself in the past with the marauders she receives the worst shock of her life this story although it is non hbp compatible will have minor spoilers enjoy still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter one the book of mischief hermione will you shut up already ron snapped impatiently as she stomped after harry and ron as they made their way to the library but ron the bloody book isnt real hermione said exasperatedly ron rolled his eyes and muttered darkly under his breath all right all right we get it hermione just just let us look for it anyways you can i dunno check out a book for the essay due on thursday harry said soothingly as hermione gave him an angry look dontcomplain come on it supposed to be made by the marauders and in case you re forgetting who they are i know perfectly well who they are i just dontsee why you believe in this silly nonsense honestly if you re so eager about it go ask professor lupin dumbledore said he was staying for good this year hermione said shrilly ask lupin are you mad ron cried as they rounded a corner hermione glowered at him we cantask him about it he ll just deny it and tell us not to look for it and then he ll go get it and and destroy it or something no he won t hermione argued harry rolled his eyes as they bickered back and forth for several minutes whilst they walked to the library it was in the beginning of december in their seventh year and the trio had overheard a conversation about a certain book left by the four pranksters a week before harry and ron immediately set out to find it both curious and excited to see what it held since james potter had been a marauder harry wasntexactly going to give up his search so easily ron was right by his side hermione however insisted it wasntreal that it was just a legend she could understand why they were looking for it and if it was real which she highly doubted what would it contain anyways hermione it legendary we have to look for it ron said hence the word legend ron hermione bickered god you two fight like an old married couple harry muttered loudly enough for them to hear hermione stumbled shutting her mouth blushing furiously and purposely not looking at ron whom she knew was doing the same thing as her it was common knowledge for the whole gryffindor house and most of the school that hermione and ron liked each other after ron had let it slip to the twins that he had non platonic feelings for hermione of course fred and george had tried numerous times to set them up or to get hermione to admit her feelings back which of course she had fancied ron since second year but she wasntabout to admit that she was waiting for him to stop being so immature and make his move okay we re here hermione go find that big book and we can finish our essays later we ll be scouting the library for the book of mischief harry said as the boys watched her retreating back angrily pick an isle and walk down it they turned and went to the other side of the library so how do we know where to look ron asked harry harry shrugged maybe we should go ask hermione she seemed rather mad at us i bet she d like to help harry said with a guilty half smile no she ll just snap at us mostly me again we can do this without her ron assured harry sighed but nodded they walked around a bit until they found a table and depositing their school bags they started searching since hermione had taken the far left side of the library ron and harry spilt the middle and right side each searching nearly ten shelves apiece the restricted section didntcount but harry privately thought that if they didnt find anything he would come back in his invisibility cloak as harry looked over numerous books each one as unlikely as the next his mind started to wander what if hermione was right what if the book of mischief wasntreal no it is harry told himself but as he looked over books he crossed the dragon section quickly the thought of hermione being right made him more determined to find the damned book harry wasntexactly sure what he was looking for was he expecting the title to pop out at him or should he look in a certain book or section of the library he kept walking slowly thinking if his father and his three best friends had made the legendary book where would he put it harry didntthink his dad would put it out in the open no he would ve definitely hidden it somewhere only a true prankster would look harry subconsciously thought of sending an owl to fred and george once they had overheard the rumor from the staffroom harry and ron had told fred and george about it they of course had heard all about it and had been searching the school for it since their third year as he walked to the next isle his mind wandered even more what was he looking for he had to find the book but he had no clue as it where it was maybe it was hidden in the common room or maybe in a book or maybe somewhere only the marauders had access to the shrieking shack harry whispered suddenly quickly he turned around running across the library in search of ron x x x as harry agreed on taking the middle of the library ron went and started to look from the beginning he decided to look in some books in their indexes if the title seemed to relate to the book he started in the a s the first shelf took a long time to go through since every title had some relevance to the book of mischief or maybe it was ron imagination that author of the wizarding world had something to do with the marauders he furrowed his eyebrows and kept looking wondering if he would find anything ron weasley attention span wasntvery long and it shortened considerably when he was doing boring tasks looking over titles broken bindings crushed pages and covers his mind was somewhere else completely he couldnthelp but think about hermione they had been friends since first year and thank god they were because ron agreed with harry that without her they would ve failed their owl s and by the time third year had come upon them even ron could admit he and hermione had gotten exceptionally close even though they were fighting he felt bad afterwards making her cry so many times about crookshanks and scabbers but she had already forgiven him and then fourth year lord he had been an idiot he still couldnt believe that krum had asked hermione to the ball ron still didnt know what had made him so mad but ron just remembered being furious at both hermione and krum fifth year was interesting ron had thought a lot about hermione over the summer and he supposed he was being kind of a git about the house elf thing so that year he tried not to do it so much but even so he couldnthelp but make her mad a few times it was almost amusing to see her angry but not so much when she snapped at him and what really made him mad that year was when the subject turned to krum a pen pal hermione had said ron didntbelieve him for a moment if krum wanted to be her pen pal then ron was as rich as the malfoys but viktor krum didntcome up a lot and ron was glad about it then that year was his first year on the quidditch team he would never forget his first game not because it was his first but because hermione had kissed him of course it was only on the cheek but she seemed slightly flustered about it she had kissed harry on the cheek before but ron knew perfectly well that it was for luck and it was nothing more than a friendly kiss still it mad ron a bit mad when hermione kissed harry and not him sixth year had gone by in a flash he had grown considerably closer to hermione and despite the relationship with lavender that nearly tore hermione in two even he could see it and he was dense often they were as close as ever he just wished that after he had ditched lavender he would ve done something to instigate a relationship with hermione women confused him a lot he tried to stop thinking about hermione but couldn t her face loomed in his mind her name made his heart skip her smile lit up the room he didntknow why he was attracted to her so but he just was and she knew all because of his stupidity when he told fred and george but hermione didntseem to mind more than enough times he had heard squeals and giggles from the girls dormitory that sounded strangely like hermione and ginny so he knew that the girls were gossiping about him he wasntexactly sure maybe they were maybe they weren t ron ron snapped out of his thoughts and looked wildly around he heard harry footsteps grow louder until he jumped around a corner ron had been standing in one spot for all of five minutes his hand suspended in midair harry looked strangely at him and ron lowered his hand his ears turning red what did you find anything ron asked harry shook his head but smiled widely no but i just thought of a brilliant idea what if my dad and the others put the book where no one except for them could get it harry said excitedly ron narrowed his eyes thinking then as it clicked he looked suspiciously at harry both excited and curious harry you dontsuppose yes ron they must ve put it in the shrieking shack harry cried ron grinned and they took off down the isle to grab their book bags they sped around a corner and hitching their bags over their shoulders started sprinting out of the library they slowed down enormously when madam pince looked up dangerously from her desk at the running children and they smiled innocently and walked out of the library just as the closed the doors they heard a high frightened scream they both froze looking at each other hermione they said together they burst back into the library madam pince looking around with a bemused expression and they passed her quickly and ran down an isle they reached the middle and stopped looking at each other they silently agreed to split up and look for her ron went left harry went right and they started quickly down the isles when ron came to the last one before the restricted section he stopped a funny feeling creeping over him something was wrong he could feel it he stopped and slowly went around the corner looking fearfully down the isle what if something bad had happened to hermione he walked down spotting something lying in a heap on the floor he ran towards it dust flying up from the floor he stood over it looking down it was her book bag crumpled and abandoned he turned and looked over his shoulder and then back down the isle where was she harry ron called his voice trembling ron heard his hurrying footsteps and harry rounded the corner is she harry started to say but stopped ron had a weird look on his face harry stared down at the book bag lying on the floor it was hermione s he bent over gradually and picked it up he could feel the numerous books weighing the material down the gravity pulling it towards the floor harry looked from the book bag up to ron who was staring at hermione possession as if it were her dead body something happened to her harry ron croaked harry felt scared now what who did we should go get the map harry sputtered suddenly handing her bag to ron harry couldntthink of anything else to do ron nodded and together they turned and ran from the library ron holding hermione book bag with his life x x x hermione let out an angry sigh but nevertheless split from them and walked up an old isle when they reached the library madam pince was at her desk busying herself with the list of the entire library she was mumbling angry dark words under her breath and hermione giggled silently there was a small section of the library that had immensely old books in it each over a thousand pages and no one particularly liked to read them of course couples used the advantage of the small section to snog like crazy because no one would interrupt them as hermione peered down the old dusty isle with thick volumes she saw to her satisfaction that the isle was unoccupied she quickly went down it running her fingers along the bindings making dust stick to her hands and drop like feathers down to the floor the essay due on thursday it was currently tuesday was on an ancient potion that snape had set for them it also had ties to the dark arts because of its effects and professor lupin had told the class to do some side research though it wasnthomework his eyes twinkled in hermione direction as she smiled thinking she would go all out and complete it as an essay and do some research once again defense against the dark arts was her favorite subject maybe it was lupin presence that had made it so fun or maybe it was the most appealing to her the last time she had loved it so was in her third year when professor lupin had come for the first time she didntknow what was so special about him but he just seemed to make learning fun to the biggest extent and she liked him a lot for that hermione quickly came upon a thick volume called ancient spells and potions that seemed as if it had not been touched for nearly twenty years she pulled it out opening the book slowly so she wouldntdamage the binding and a musty smell rose from the book and she wrinkled her nose the pages were thick and yellow stained here and there with what seemed to be water or a drink of some sort she flipped over the pages and finding nothing satisfactory in the book she snapped it shut and went to go put it on the shelf but something caught her eye and confused and suspicious she pulled the book in her hands back gently bending to set it on the floor curious she stood on her tiptoes and looked far into the large shelf it seemed as if the wood of the shelf had been smashed open and something had been stuffed in there presumably a book her heart was pounding against her ribcage now and she thought hard was this the book harry and ron had been talking about was it the book of mischief if it was she didntknow what she would do she certainly couldntcall ron he would never let her live it down and harry could never keep something so interesting and exciting a secret for long from ron and he would find out and get mad at her one thing was for certain if it was the book than she was in trouble but so far she didntknow what it was trembling all over she reached back into the shelf and gently tugged at the corner of the book forced under the wood after a minute or so of careful pulling she snatched it out it was small maybe the size of her two hands thick and looking just as old as the rest of the books it was a deep scarlet with gold bindings and gold trimmed pages the stitching coming out and the binding slightly broken shaking with excitement and fear she carefully opened the cover inside the face of the book were four names her heart skipped a beat as she read them james potter sirius black remus lupin peter pettigrew she was amazed scared and unsure of what to do surely this had to be the book there could be no other name for it she quickly turned to the first page her eyes were wide as she read the inscription you hold in your hands the book of mischief no prefect ruling abiding prat should read this unless you ve got enough cause this book holds every prank and plan ever performed it was hidden for the next person to find it apparently that d be you for a gift of amazement please turn thirteen pages forward instinctively she started flipping pages furiously now she knew it was the book of mischief what could page thirteen hold in store for her as she reached it she stopped closing her eyes and taking a deep breath it was a legend it couldntbe true but it was breathing slowly she opened her eyes and started to read tucking an unruly lock of brown hair behind her ear she read over the words the latin pouring through her head sinking into her mind as her eyes swam over the text down a stanza and then read more quietly she read the passage out loud the dead language rolling off of her tongue commodo servo lectio porro ado pro donum ut est in repono vobis vos mos reperio ut nisivos es certus lepor lepos porro est vacuus rememdium sic pradecidentivis operor fulcio nonnullus causa iam verum exsisto told is est non viaticus nusquam of genus taman vos ero irretitus in a scelestus vicis warp undeviginti annus tergiversatio good luck to you she was confused as she finished reading she knew latin but not very well she would have to take the book and translate the paragraph if she ever wanted to understand it but then as she went to take a step towards the table at the end of the isle to sit down something strange started to happen her legs wouldntmove in fact they felt oddly warm heat spreading up from her toes terrified she looked down her feet looked normal though they were rooted to the ground she looked at the book frightened and unsure of what to do and to her confusion and horror the pages of the book started to get lighter as if there was a brightness coming from the depths of it the bindings started to split light forcing its way out hitting her face and blinding her momentarily and then started consuming the entire book she stood frozen horrorstruck as the blinding light spread across the page and touched her fingers and then rapidly traveled up to her hands instantly her common sense started to kick in as it spread over her arms and across her torso she let out a piercing scream and tried to drop the book and then quite suddenly she fell forward into space her feet leaving the ground she was falling into blackness flying away x x x author notes as most of you readers are probably wondering by now what the weird passage was when hermione read out of the book of mischief it was in latin it ll do you some good to translate that if you ve got the time because i think it like homework heh heh i a bit evil yes but i think you ll have some fun there is a time inscription in the latin for nineteen years backwards from the current time in hogwarts is 1997 i know this because harry was born in 1980 11 years later its 1991 his first year plus 6 years to go until his 7th year equals up to 1997 it says somewhere in the sorcerer stone i think that james and lily got married a year after their seventh year and then had harry 9 months later so minus 9 months and a year from 1980 and you get almost 1978 the marauder 7th year so 1997 minus 19 is 1978 there your math reference and usually i suck at math if you have proof that it was give or take a year when james and lily married and had harry review me so i wontscrew it up even more so did that paragraph screw you up here the simple math of it 1997 hermione 7th year 1978 the marauder 7th year 0019 years apart there two extra years on there because i guessing that lily and james were out of school for a year when they married had harry and were murdered harry is 17 but hermione is 18 her birthday is september 19 so it wont matter because she was in the right age group sorry i had to clarify everything because if i didn t i d be confusing myself and no one wants that thanks so much lainie for beta ing this for me you rule thanks for reading please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter but a few random characters well guys sorry about the holdup i know you re all highly anticipating this chapter after the horribly mean cliffhanger i left you with so let us waste no time chitchatting but reading instead still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter ten flawless possibilities let go she screamed terrified as they laughed maliciously at her help help they picked her up and followed lucius holding the kicking and utterly scared girl over their shoulders anyone that had heard her screaming wouldnthave helped her anyways and she realized this with a fearful pang as they dragged her into the gloomy woods where her screams would not penetrate the silence hermione had never been so scared in her life as they dragged her into the woods she was breathless and shrieking her voice hoarse squirming made little difference but at one point she had fussed so hard she had been dropped and she fled about two feet before she was tackled again it was quite a while before they stopped moving and by that time hermione had sobbed into her hands stopped crying and stared at the ground with hard empty eyes accepting the fact the very cold very bitter fact that she was not going to be released any time soon and she was stuck with these slytherins until lucius commanded her freedom she was doomed and she knew it lucius was too bloody smart to be a blonde but then his son had witty retorts and stinging insults so malfoy junior must ve inherited his father intelligence she didnt particularly doubt it truth be told she was grabbed around the waist abruptly and by the next moment lucius had her pinned to the tree by her shoulders the small throng of slytherins closed their tight knit circle around them and she started shaking visibly again she also noticed that a shallow tinge of darkness was falling over the woods they were in and if she even escaped that day she d get back to hogwarts by nightfall all right granger there isntany sense in chitchat so let get straight to the point lucius growled hermione bit back the fear in her throat and tried to think rapidly lucius knew there was no doubt about that but could she fool him or at least try to could she play stupid and demand what was going on she didntthink that it was a possibility but she had fooled everyone else hadntshe but she had acted so surprised so scared when he had announced her surname so what were the chances that she could trick him into believing that she was stunned to hear another name besides jane lewis she needed to take that plunge and even if she got caught it would be worth the risk when she got out of this well if she got out of this she d have to do some quick actions to assure that she was indeed safe until she was pulled back into the future why do you keep calling me that it sounded innocent but suddenly that sick feeling in her stomach rose up and on the verge of vomiting she withheld it the sick smile that spread over his face was an automatic giveaway that lucius knew what she was doing and would not be fooled all she could remember all the times that she had been wary and stunned at the implications that his wording had caused and she knew he could too she set herself up for this one and no amount of playing innocent could get her away but she still had one option left abide by his ways but not say anything that could help voldemort as far as he knew she was oblivious to what was happening behind the scenes for the future or the order she did not know the extent as to how much lucius knew lucius chuckled softly his eyes gleaming in darkened triumph the twisted smile on his face was unnerving and she was scared i know you arentgoing to play stupid with me granger he purred touching her cheek she flinched the slytherins laughed you re a monster she whispered not quite sure if she was just as angry as she was scared he bared his teeth at her smiling almost mocking her but it dropped when she spoke again you re just as bad as voldemort there was a collective gasp mutters ensued and lucius looked livid somehow you dirty stupid little mongrel dontyou dare speak his name he hissed the grip on her shoulders tightened considerably and she felt like he was about to snap her bones cleanly in half why not i not about to cower at the name like you she sneered and where did this bravery come from she knew this would result in some violent action of his towards her so was she just asking for it or being totally reckless and it did result in some violent action of his he threw her to the ground suddenly and she let out a yelp as he tried to kick her and she only just managed to dodge it the slytherins moved in closer their faces dark and waiting to be allowed revenge how could you attack me she cried outraged his answer was a blow hard on her calf and she yelled out in pain easy he snarled you do anything that displeases me and i do this he moved to the side of her and before she could register enough to move away from him she fell over her body pressed into the snow after his foot collided with her ribs he was literally beating her up i not playing games with you mudblood he growled softly i will not hesitate to hurt you in anyway if you do anything that displeases you i know she snapped cradling her wounds he made a vicious movement and she recoiled instantly the ring around them laughed again still shuffling and it seemed waiting for something her ribs ached but he hadntkicked her hard enough to make her cry bruise probably but she was only wincing at the shooting pains blooming across her chest and lungs a hand to her side she sat up and looked at lucius who was almost pacing around her angrily he stopped and looked down at her his eyes dark and condescending the sneer on his face evident it was funny how he could appear very much in lust with her at times and seconds later he could be a vicious murdering beast you will answer my every question he told her his voice low and dangerously calm she did not nod but tilted her head slightly you will give me full detail and if you forget one little thing or two i will know she couldnthelp but feel entirely threatened by this for lucius it seemed was powerful even in these days he had connections and he was smart ever trip she had made he had seen every mistake thrown on her path he had been there to watch it happen he knew her faults already and if she didntfool him today she was in hot water what your real name she couldntthink for the life of her why he would want to know this but she couldntpossibly divulge this information however small or however important it may be jane granger he knew her surname was granger and jane was her middle name so technically she wasntlying you re lying angrily baring his teeth at her he made another vicious movement towards hermione and knocked her over by kicking her ankle as she scrambled she let out a cry of pain and collapsed against the trunk of the tree she had been pinned to earlier lucius grabbed her by the collar and pushed her up against the bark again she whimpered as the angle of her arm was pushed to an abnormal degree i not spending time with your lies granger he snarled she clamped her mouth shut and tried to face away from him squirming to be freed her arm was killing her and she hated being treated like this i know that not it so tell me this instant she shook her head furiously and with a roar he threw her to the ground and raised his foot again to strike her hermione she cried recoiling away only able to use one of her legs properly now she rubbed her ankle trying not to whimper at the pain but now she would be limping for merlin knows how long suddenly lucius grabbed her by the chin and nearly hung her by lifting her up he dug his fingernails into her chin and all of her weight was pulling her neck apart lucius summoned a few of the slytherins and in moments they were holding her upright with her arms behind her back snape came over and took lucius place his greasy hand was on her chin and she couldnthelp but try to jerk her face away what year are you originally from lucius asked her calmly his eyes steely and flashing with anger 1998 she sputtered trying to keep her face away from snape grasp if i have a son who is my wife malfoy that ll completely mess everything up if i tell you from what i know she not even in hogwarts yet hermione cried i dontcare tell me her name he roared at her no she cried that has absolutely no relevance as to why i here you re marriage is a completely different topic but you know he growled so what if i tell you chances are you ll trip up somewhere and you ll alter everything she said just like you re doing he spat back at her it was funny how incredibly right lucius malfoy could be at times there had been times where hermione had done nothing but sit and ponder how she was rearranging things her relationships with people would change the moment she fell back into 1998 that was for sure with ron with lupin and what about draco malfoy would he have any part in this at all would lucius inform his son of jane lewis more commonly known as hermione granger her whole life would change if she ever saw lucius malfoy again when she was eighteen and he was forty thirty five either way would he know that she had come back from the past and everything between lucius and jane had happened and she knew how would he be able to tell if she had come back from the past or not i not telling you malfoy hermione said calmly breathing hard to steady her heart it will change everything you cantimagine and he couldn t from what she had experienced so far and it was only february everything in his eyes would be switched around and no color would be the same no opinion in its right place and all thoughts would be backwards he looked angry that was for sure he was silent though pacing steadily and watching her the entire eyes his head lowered slightly in thought his silver eyes burning through the darkness over his eyes fine he said finally in an indignant tone perhaps he had never been denied anything before in his life that he was fighting with himself not to throw a fit but she knew that was unlikely his image was tight and perfectly upheld as a pureblood and therefore every single thing he did was for good reason or just downright tricky for once you were right granger here i ll give you something else to answer what kind of role do you play obviously you wouldntbe here unless you were important or powerful or frequently came in close contact with someone of the sort hermione was uncertain whether he was being serious asking her because he wanted needed to know or if he did know and he just wanted to see her writher in anxiousness under his gaze and implications they looked at each other and his jaw was rigid his hands clenched together behind him and his eyes burning with unsaid anger she jerked her head away uselessly from snape greasy hands and lucius waved him off rather dejectedly he let go of her face and moved out of her sight the other slytherins increased the hold on her making her struggle a bit for she could no longer feel her arms she had to think and quick lucius didntknow any of this information well hopefully at least so she could feed him false details but then how did he know her name how did he know her name was hermione granger how had he known about draco there had to be a time when she had said it and he had heard her somehow sometime when she was off guard alone she wouldntdare speak it around people questions would ensue and quickly but she had to think back on the last time she had said her own name aloud her heart nearly stopped after a moment and the one thought streaming through her mind was he stalking me there was no other solution lucius never could ve figured out her entire name without some kind of giveaway and there had never been any other time when she had mentioned aloud the snot of a son draco this explained so much more he always seemed to have an advantage over her and she felt as if everything she said every move she made would be seen and remembered for future blackmail and information for future interrogations and well it was true he had been stalking her now all hermione had to do was watch herself and find a way to keep invisible and unobtrusive for the rest of the time she was in the past but back to her current situation if lucius had only known her name from his predator like ways she wouldntbe here if she hadntslipped up on so many occasions that he could hear then she wouldntbe here but she knew one thing he didntknow anything else i wasntimportant at all she sputtered i wasntvery well liked at all in fact the only reason i came here was because she paused thinking rapidly i had a time turner my head of house applied for one so that i could take extra courses it something happened i not exactly sure but i wound up here there was dead silence and lucius seemed to think about her statement for a moment he cast his eyes to the ground running an impatient hand through his hair while the other was fisted agitatedly on his waist he turned and his back was to her and she could only try to breathe deeply to attempt to soothe her racing heart her eyelids fluttered and she stared into the blackness behind her closed eyes trying to think of anything and everything that could get her out of here quickly and any other escape routes she could use if he asked her something as risky as he had before who is the headmaster his voice was faded almost but his tone was still firm and demanding she licked her lips hesitantly would informing him that dumbledore was still headmaster hurt anything or do well she wanted to say anything but dumbledore but with her racing mind she could not draw up a name for a different headmaster or one that was alive anyways she didntknow of anyone specifically eligible for the position and she knew that she d blurt out a random name soon if she couldntthink of a proper one i i out with it granger lucius roared at her jerking around and lunging at her she seized up with fear and no coherent thought would grace her mind he grabbed her shoulders digging his nails into her cloak and giving her a stern shake he pressed his forehead to hers his lip curled and his teeth bared eyes narrowed and gleaming with rage and the abusive demeanor crying to be let out with an angry sound that was suspiciously like a hiss he pushed her away roughly into the slytherins restraining her and paced angrily away she took this time to purse her trembling lips and calm herself down this was getting out of hand but she was terrified it was getting steadily darker and if lucius pounced like that again she might just die of a seizure when lucius turned again to face her farther away and standing apart from the group she couldntmake out any of his features her heart fluttered nervously again it was dark possibly near full moon she couldnteven recall and the gryffindors must be worried sick about her and their questions what could she answer them with she was with lucius james would be suspicious hell everyone would be suspicious but james knew how she felt and remus did too so what could she do storm off and ignore everyone for trying to intrude on her business no she needed an excuse for them but now was not the time now she was dealing with lucius and trying to figure out if she could get away without screwing everything up more than it already was who is the most influential person w what she stuttered confused and slightly hysterical sounding i meant the one who always ends up saving the day the one that everyone looks up to there must be a hero in your time he said softly dangerously she could almost swear that his eyes were shining in the darkness but she wasntsure if that was a trick of light or not harry potter but she could never tell the malfoy that it would raise automatic assumptions that she would have to answer and word would get out and all hell would be loose so what could she answer the mention of him slipped from her lips before she could give it a single thought your son lucius was very still for a moment his body tenser than hers my son he asked after a moment his voice tight oh god she just made everything worse as soon as lucius went off and married narcissa they would conceive a son and draco would be raised and expected to be the hero of the world and be the king in everyone eyes making him spoiled and the snot he is now hermione trembled her breath ragged she had not only damaged the future for everything she would feel but she had influenced lives that she had never meant to when hermione did not answer but remained to have the horrific realization plastered onto her face he nodded to himself you have done well then granger lucius said quietly sounding oddly pleased let go of her we re going back the sudden release of pressure sent pins and needles flowing through her body and she couldnthelp but wince at every movement as they dragged her back through the woods limping at every step x x x where the bloody hell have you been lily nearly screamed at hermione when she stumbled back into the common room it was around nine o clock and the marauders lily and emma were grouped around the fire attempting homework or talking in low voices hermione had bits of twigs in her hair and there was a smudge of dirt on her nose her face was ghostly white and her eyes were huge and petrified she stood and swayed when lily came running up to her interrogating her profusely and then hermione positively fled from the spot up into the girls dormitory lucius had viciously forced her into silence for the moment about the kidnap into the forest and the interrogation tears leaked out of her eyes and she whimpered and clung to her pillow she didnt even want to think about it she could still feel his powerful hands the scratches on her skin and her cries of protests and she couldnt get it out of her mind she was just grateful she had made it away in time or else she would ve been raped she never wanted to see his face again but she knew oh god how she knew that keeping far away from lucius malfoy was going to be harder than dealing with remus and speaking of remus at the thought of him she promptly burst into tears x x x hermione was early down at the dungeons and she felt like she should ve had someone else to come with her she was waiting for remus since this was their first study and tutelage session and she didntknow whether he would be late or just not come at all after almost ten minutes of nervous glances at the doors ears pricked she started to quiet her madly beating heart by taking notes out of a section that hull had suggested apparently remus wasntdoing so well on this and that so and so which left hermione explaining all the basics she knew remus was fine in potions but there was just something distracting him he was the quieter one the marauder who studied and whipped all his mates into doing their homework there couldntpossibly be anything wrong with his academic concentration but then why was he assigned a tutor what was drawing his focus elsewhere the door opened and her heart stopped for a moment she could feel it safely thudding in her chest a moment later though skipping out of nervousness when remus walked in grumbling away about something and looking as if he were in a bad mood he slammed his stuff down on the table pulled open the chair and fell into it quite grumpily he looked ill and thin was full moon sometime soon hermione gave an awkward sympathetic smile look remus i know hull is a bitch remus muttered mutinously but if you re having trouble in potion s then you need help she said quietly taking out her notes and smiling faintly at his choice of words but jane i dont need help i ve just been distracted lately he cried frustrated and it really takes the mickey out of me because i stuck for merlin knows how long with but he stopped and would not look her in the eye i feel nearly the same way she agreed sounding cold he shot her a look to which she exchanged a very icy one let get started then it was an hour an a half of reciting and taking notes making a potion and cleaning it up when he had flew into a rage and knocked it over hermione had never known remus old or young to be this violent but she knew that if he was to transform soon enough then he would be angry and moody like this patiently she helped clean while remus grumbled away his back was to her but there were times when he had turned slightly and cast looks at her short and drawn out and she had seen them all her heart was fluttering but at the moment the burning in her chest she had for him was subdued she was worried about her lucius situation avoiding questions and keeping out of harms way she knew something bad was going to happen but she couldntquite place it at least not yet they gathered up their things and headed for the door and reached it at the same time a minute was spent shifting and trying to get the other to go through when they both went and were stuck pressed up against each other and close there was a single moment when the clouded serene look was in his eyes the one that she had seen at christmastime but it was gone the next moment remus nearly flew out of the doorframe and away from her she stayed relatively close behind him her wand lit and all senses alert and her cheeks warmed when she thought of their bodies pressed together all because of a door the common room was alight with flame but it was quiet remus sped off to his dormitory and hermione dropped her stuff on a table and sunk into a chair resting for a moment jane came james voice she opened her eyes and looked around he was behind her and he touched her shoulder yeah she replied stifling a yawn he beckoned her and puzzled she stood and followed him into what she assumed the head tower lily was not there and she briefly wondered where the redhead was i getting straight to the point with this james started immediately after the door was shut they were alone and she shifted on her feet where were you on valentine day somehow she had known this was coming she had known it all along but never wanted to admit it or think to herself about it because one thought led to another and she frequently started tearing up or stressing which meant that she hadntprepared an excuse james i i she searched desperately for something to say to put him off she sighed after a moment and her body seemed to deflate i canttell you without having to explain so many other things she said wearily she walked away from him and flopped down on the couch closing her eyes for a moment he jumped down next to her you need to tell me jane why was he serious his goofy very lighthearted ways werentthere anymore or not at the moment his face was stern his jaw was set and his eyes werenttwinkling with some humor he longed to say but i told you i cant he sighed for a moment and then spoke again i know you were with malfoy but doing what you looked scared out of your mind when you came back so obviously something happened she tried to swallow away the sudden uncomfortable feeling her eyes darting away from him i i can t erm what did he do to you she could ve mistaken him for harry right at that moment they were close his face hard and his eyes serious his hair mused and his glasses winking with light he was cast in shadows presumably as she was but suddenly she felt like she was safe again like she was with ron and harry and she could confide in him again he he and some other slytherins but she realized she couldn t and now that she had started speaking it was a mistake that james would not let her escape from and she was right he demanded every detail to which she complied though sparingly telling him everything would have him at risk just the raw facts were sufficient you donthave to be scared of him james assured but you dontunderstand he knows too much about me james and that not good she cried he raised an eyebrow i came here to hogwarts with a secret james she whispered malfoy knows about it i didntknow how he discovered it until today when he and the other slytherins dragged me out somewhere behind the shrieking shack but him knowing is not good is it like fatal that he knows he asked curiously but concerned she shrugged i dontreally know it could be but he s he knows that i know more and he he ll do anything to find out more she said quietly trying to avoid other events that had happened without sounding too guilty but he already knows something james confirmed and hermione nodded so what did he do to verify it i mean not everything one learns is true rumors and theories are all over the place arentthey hermione smirked a bit at him why arentyou clever like this all the time he grinned at her and gave her cheek a little pat because then i would be sexy and smart and i d be tempted at the millions of girls falling at my feet i dontthink lily would be very pleased if she walked in on girls feeding me fruits they chuckled at this but either way you haventanswered my question damn him she thought he had remembered she thought carefully about this for a moment he and a few other slytherins cornered me at the shrieking shack and dragged me out into the woods lucius kicked me around a bit and yelled his head off but nothing more nothing to kill me really she said hoping she sounded casual james frowned yes but still honestly james i sitting here with you and i perfectly healthy he did nothing to damage any major organs or anything alright she said he nodded after a moment though he didntlook entirely convinced but oh what wonderful thoughts graced her mind remember that deal we made a while back james grinned slowly the one where i would commit a wicked prank in exchange for your kissing information she blushed slightly but nodded yes that well i think i ll take you up on that deal i in need of embarrassing someone and keeping them away she said smiling for good his smile was broad when he asked malfoy must ve really done something to earn this the corners of her lips fell suddenly and she sunk back into the couch she closed her eyes for a single moment recalling malfoy mouth on her neck and her desperate attempts to get away she opened her eyes unusually dim and looked at james yeah he really did x x x author notes um i just wanna say that the moments of internal dialogue with that whole lucius hermione thing the whole cries of protest and blah blah blah well she said she didntget raped and she didn t but you remember before a couple chapters back during the first detention lucius was all over her except he did not restrain himself in the least this time and was definitely a frisky thing there was not a lot of remus tension in this one but trust me there will be until then thanks for reviewing and please review this time too disclaimer i do not own harry potter just the plot and the couple of oc you ve seen so far so read on still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter eleven mistaken implications his smile was broad when he asked malfoy must ve really done something to earn this the corners of her lips fell suddenly and she sunk back into the couch she closed her eyes for a single moment recalling malfoy mouth on her neck and her desperate attempts to get away she opened her eyes unusually dim and looked at james yeah he really did hermione wasntreally sure what she was feeling at the moment because charms had just ended and everyone was filing out of the classroom but she was left behind her heart was hammering and she was hurriedly shoving her charms notes messily into her book bag and sprinting out of the room to keep up with the crowd this would never have happened if lucius was in her class the disgust and dislike and confusion of his intents had been replaced in an instant with a sort of fearful loathing she hated him now there was no doubt about that but she was scared out of her mind at the thought of being alone with him the stress that she was under now was a lot worse she had just been informed that she was tutoring remus once a week not once a month which rather upset her however during the previous meeting with hull the potions master never actually told her a schedule for them to meet and so now it was every monday at seven in the potions room or if it was the theory he was having trouble in they went to the library still this was cause for trouble the tension of the thought of her and remus together without interruption unsupervised was unbearable not that he would pounce on her but because there would most likely be an exchange of words between them that would leave her tearing up afterwards not that he ever did that on purpose of course but it still hurt her after all after valentine day it seemed that her motives and determination had been clarified for her main focus was finding a way to get back home she needed out of this situation for there was already so much at stake and so many mistakes had been made she couldntafford to trip again because she knew very well that lucius would see it and something would happen something terrible so besides getting home again she studied like hell and tried to think of ways to keep the malfoy away from her she had already expressed this need to james who assured hermione that something good would happen in her favor and the scheming machiavellian worm named malfoy would be cast out of her life for good all she had left to do was figure out the actual dilemma she had with remus she was so confused when it came to him that she didntknow what to attempt next she didntparticularly like letting things happen naturally because that would certainly lead to a disaster currently it was monday again a week after speaking to james about the major prank and the second potions tutoring session with remus she had to admit she was quite nervous about it both being alone with him and nearing the dungeons perhaps she could engage remus in conversation or or just ask if she could accompany him down there or the other way around it didntreally matter she had dinner to face before this awful dilemma so she made it a point to remember to solve the problem while eating all students filed into the great hall in a noisy bunch laughing gossiping and lively hermione quiet and observing stuck in the thick of the throng to keep from being pulled into an abandoned area and if that happened to be an attempt of lucius she would have many witnesses and the chances of not being saved were very small gryffindors sorted into their friends and groups and cliques and hermione slid down to an empty part on the bench laughter echoed from behind her laughter she had come to know very well these past two months and james and sirius were by her in an instant after piling food directly from the platter and into his mouth sirius opened his mouth and started talking to her reminding her forcibly of ron at dinnertime she ignored the nostalgic pang in her chest and quirked an eyebrow chew and swallow sirius she said lightly the corners of her mouth lifting he grinned showing the contents of his mouth again before he miraculously swallowed the mass of food as i was saying sirius started he and james shared a grin would you like to know about our little plan so far what hermione asked and looked over to james you said you wanted something bad to happen to blondie over there didnt you james asked jerking his head towards the slytherin table she glanced nervously over there herself and saw to her relief that lucius was writing something most likely homework and paying no attention to her at all yes i did hermione said do i dare ask what this prank will be the mischievous gleam in the boys eyes was unnerving but excited her if they could get lucius to back down and stay down that would be perfect well if we told you i dontthink you would understand how badly this would affect his ego or just himself see as a female you wouldntunderstand the missing part of him and how badly that ll kill his reputation you re right i dontwant to know just tell me when you ve started it and when it ll be over or whatever i just just hurry it up alright she asked in a small voice sirius nodded happily and stuffed his face with food again but hermione saw the protective shadow in james eyes she shook her head and turned away before james could ask where lily and emma she questioned suddenly noting the absence of the two females dunno the boys echoed together and remus she asked her heart skipping a little at the sound of his name on her tongue dunno and peter the boys looked at each other hey where is peter i havent seen him since he skipped charms you know he really shouldntdo that hermione started raking her eyes over the great hall for his little mousy head it very but she stopped suddenly and her face slowly twisted into confused observation at the slytherin table lucius was talking to rose who had her arm linked with his hermione noticed he was also writing down something and talking to someone across the table whose hair was mousy brown and his figure round peter pettigrew peter shook his head took the quill from lucius and started writing something at a quick pace then pointing at the paper and tracing something lucius nodded said something to rose and in a single moment where hermione knew that it would happen he looked at hermione stationed across the hall hermione was still and lucius looked surprised to see her watching his eyes narrowed after a moment and he mouthed something to peter who spun in his seat and looked to hermione with an expression of utmost shock and fear he ducked out her vision and gathering up his hood pushed out of his seat and darted out of the hall jane jane a hand was waving in front of her face she blinked breaking the eye contact with lucius who had comprehension dawning on his face and looked to sirius are your lights on up there or what sirius asked smiling at his own joke i knew she breathed to herself ignoring both sirius and james inquiring glances i knew and i didntdo anything and now now he dealing out plans god hermione moaned and pushed herself up from the table and fleeing from the hall without looking behind her she had to put a stop to peter betrayal while she could because maybe what would it do save lily and james stop voldemort save the fate that sirius met and save harry from his miserable life she didntstop to think about the consequences because her mind was screaming at her to put a stop to this and demand peter to let her know what the hell he thought he was doing sirius and james looked at each other before shrugging they resumed eating but james still had jane on his mind questioning her words they had not seen what she was so shocked about but he knew it was at the slytherin table upon thinking that he looked up and skimmed the house to see if there was anything suspicious what he did see was not peter but lucius malfoy with rose sanders at his arm they were close very close and in a second the malfoy gave her a pat on the cheek and hurriedly left the table and exited the great hall leaving a forlorn looking rose behind it was then that james remembered that rose was remus girlfriend and then a second later he remembered that jane was having problems with lucius and having already left the malfoy must ve followed her without saying anything to sirius james got up and sprinted out of the hall wanting to find jane before lucius did and ask her what the hell had been going on sirius watched his friend leave and a confused expression spread across his face after a moment he lifted his arms and sniffed his underarms and with a satisfied look lowered them and gave a little shrug before resuming to his meal x x x jane james yelled catching up with her at last she was at the start of the seventh floor and gryffindor tower was not far away she spun on her heel and turned to him the scared look draining from her face immediately he stumbled to her panting and grabbed her shoulder to keep from falling over can t breathe he wheezed and started coughing spasmodically after a minute he took a deep breath and started talking i dontknow what the hell you saw that made you leave but i think i saw something you might ve too what she asked cautiously happen to see who was hanging off of malfoy he asked with a sarcastically happy expression remus wontbelieve that his girlfriend is cheating on him james i know he won t she said sadly whatever if i can get sirius and peter to see them together i ll have backup he explained he wouldntbelieve you she raised her eyebrows at him not that i mean that offensively but he would think i was just jealous and trying to make him break it off with rose which i wish he would hermione thought miserably exactly this is why i need sirius and peter hermione face darkened at the name of said future death eater james noticed this what what wrong with peter he asked immediately he knew that jane had no problem with sirius but she hadntreally interacted with peter so much instead of saying nothing like she knew she was supposed to she whispered he a traitor what james exclaimed hermione clapped a hand over her mouth nothing she muttered and turned at once and started walking away i crazy ignore me jane stop james said firmly when she didn t he jumped and grabbed her shoulder and upon spinning around she flinched visibly he looked down at her with concern etched into his eyes jane no james just forget it she backed out of grasp and turned i have to go tutoring session you know but forget what i said alright she said harshly spinning to face him her eyes were blazing he was surprised at how fierce she looked it doesntmatter so just forget it forget what james and hermione both jumped and searched for the source of the voice rose sanders stepped from the shadows twirling a lock of hair and looking as clever and at ease as ever have you seen remus she asked smiling at both of them hermione looked horrified and james looked suspicious james looked at rose for a long hard moment analyzing her she stared back at him quirking an eyebrow he curled his lip disgusted and after twisting his face in a snarl at her he turned and went past hermione with his back to her rose expression changed in an instant calmly the smiled faded into a triumphant smirk and she mouthed something that hermione plainly caught lucius will know shit hermione thought anxiously hearing james give the password in a soft concealed voice she ran at the chance to get away from the slytherin and pushed james out of the way and into the common room she went james turned and looked at rose not unmoved by hermione rude hurrying you dontdeserve him he said coldly what rose asked sounding scandalized you re a goddamned cheater and whatever the hell you and malfoy are up to you better stay the hell away from jane or one of you is going to get seriously hurt i promise he snarled without waiting for a response from the slytherin he turned his back on the gaping girl and left into his tower without another word after shutting the portrait he did not get the chance to see her expression melt into anger or the swish of an invisibility cloak that dropped to the floor a moment later lucius malfoy put a hand on her shoulder to calm rose it doesntmatter he whispered we got all that we needed we have the passwords you re right rose agreed quietly her face hardened she going to get it bad lucius he smiled the cruel delight evident in his eyes oh yes she is x x x hermione did not remember how she managed to convince sirius to walk down with her to the dungeons but she didntcare as long as someone was with her and sirius could protect himself on the way back which was all for the better hermione would ve asked lily but the head girl was no where to be seen and hermione couldntfind emma either so sirius was a good choice she could not risk james curious and worried nature so sirius carefree attitude certainly helped her relax a little okay so this one time in second year me and james snuck into the slytherin changing rooms right before a quidditch game and hexed all their brooms mind you this was before the game started and the captain was giving them their speech and all that good stuff so all we had to do was sneak into their broom cupboard and mutter a few well chosen phrases and tada instant win for gryffindor and polka dotted slytherin for a week sirius grinned triumphantly told you i smart he looked like a beaming child who had just won something you re so hermione started but laughed instead sexy goofy she answered and the look fell from his face dramatically before it was replaced again in laughter but sexy too right he asked hopefully jumping in front of her as they rounded the corner to the dungeons stop complimenting yourself sirius she said rolling her eyes with a smile he hopped back and forth in front of her preventing her from moving she grinned and tried to get past but with a laugh he kept her from passing him you d better say i sexy jane or you ll regret it he warned playfully no because i do not lie she said grinning all the while he looked mortally offended that mean i shall take you down he said in a mock battle cry he darted forward grabbing her around the waist and flinging her over his shoulder he spun around quickly so she was yelling in delight at the dizziness put me down sirius hermione laughed gotta admit it he said joyfully voices echoed up the hall coming closer and hermione knew that sirius would make her look like an idiot if he didntput her down fine she yelled the room spinning before her eyes i admit it you re sexy thank you sirius said triumphantly still holding hermione over his shoulder the voices were stronger and two girls turned the corner talking it was emma and lily who stopped dead at the sight of sirius and hermione emma dahling i didntsee you at dinner you either lils where did you gals run off too sirius inquired happily oblivious to hermione quiet mews to be let down potions room lily said shortly looking suspiciously confused at hermione and sirius now where are you two going potions room what a coincidence huh sirius asked jovially he stopped and looked at emma who was glaring at hermione backside emma love are you alright you ve got a little vein popping out on your forehead fine she snarled absolutely bloody fine without another word she stormed past sirius knocking hard into his shoulder thundering up the hall she turned briefly and gave a very exasperated hermione a threatening look hermione looked surprised at this but could say nothing as the girl retreated lily rolled her eyes anyway si remus is already down there i had to talk to hull and he was hoping he could get a session out of me instead of jane lily told him i ve got to go now bye hmm mooney trying to switch tutors now is he sirius said to himself interestedly sirius hermione asked yes jane darling put me down she said dryly oh yes that sure thing he pulled her off his shoulder still smiling brightly oh came the echo of lily voice from up the hall hermione and sirius turned to look at her malfoy is in there too apparently he got a detention for running into a teacher and being all rude about it he a right piece of work being all nasty to remus take care not to let him kill you eh she gave a little laugh and continued on her way oh great that just perfect hermione thought sarcastically remus and lucius was just about the worst thing she could ask for in her current situation lucius is not going to let this night go by without doing something to his advantage he going to screw my relationship up with remus even more oh well doesntthat make your day all jolly and bright sirius commented with a sigh shall we skip this session of yours then jane oooh then let go to the kitchens and get ice cream it scary how much you resembled a three year old right then hermione said wryly and no i shall not skive you can come but i doubt anything will hold your attention span for that long hah i was just joking sirius he lifted an eyebrow and lunged at her grinning he got her head in the crook of his arm and started rubbing her scalp very hard with his knuckles noogie he cried happily sirius ouch no stop ow ow my hair is already bushy leave me ow alone she protested thrashing about uncle who sirius asked rubbing harder mercy hermione cried frantically desperate to get away from this childish torture no mercy for you he answered you re sexy she blurted and was let go of immediately she fell back to the floor but she was happy that she was released sirius looked proud but held out a hand to help her up hermione pulled out her wand and tapped his hand suspiciously and he whipped back his fingers and pulled out his own wand and pointed it at her looking ready to duel but very amused she rolled her eyes and stood tucking her wand back into her pocket sirius mirroring her movements well i suppose i can make it from here thanks for walking with me she said appreciatively he ruffled his hair and smiled back differently from before no problem jane shall i pick you up saaaay nine o clock for what she asked well aware of how he was acting she hoped he was only joking around we can go to the kitchens and then get ice cream he shouted flinging up his arms with a happy squeal you re stupid she laughed and turned to go down the hall and sexy he called after her she grinned but did not turn back she tried to hold onto the laughter that had been echoing from her since she and sirius left gryffindor tower but as soon as she would push open the potion door laying eyes on both lucius and remus the happiness would drain instantly replacing it with anxiousness and panic how in the hell was she supposed to handle this grimacing for the events that were about to come hermione tentatively reached out for the wooden door and opened it silently she took a moment to gather her wits before stepping in where she was met with lucius and remus but she did not expect to see them talking civilly even if remus did look slightly suspicious well all that stuff that rose was telling you wasnta bunch of lies lupin she told me the little hussy was doing the exact same thing lucius was saying he suddenly looked up spotting hermione and grinned no humor behind his smile but only cold delight well speak of the devil lucius said softly and turned around after throwing remus an i told yah so kind of look glaring suspiciously at the back of malfoy head hermione moved around and sat across the desk from remus ignoring the fluttery and nervous rhythm of her heart she dropped her book bag onto the table noticing the weird look that remus had on his face as he watched her movements almost as if he were looking for something specific before she sighed impatiently as the contents of her bag spilled out great she sighed and started picking things up her things had spilled as far lucius and quills books and inks were lying around like little picking them up with haste she did not notice lucius bend down to retrieve something that had fallen on the floor remus silent and observing watched malfoy movements and fascinated expression as he looked over the notebook before triumph gleamed in his eyes lucius pocketed this new possession smirking successfully remus gingery eyes following his actions what malfoy had stowed away was something so precious something that hermione had come to treasure with secrets both personal and informational they held the complex reasoning of her mind and about time every little note that she had taken on time travel had been scribbled into corners and free spaces with stars and arrows pointing to them woven in with the precious information were her worried thoughts and how she was going to deal with life back with harry and ron how she would handle remus as a teacher and what new dangers and obstacles she would face with draco malfoy things that should never cross the mind of a girl her age had been recorded and by the time she realized that lucius had a hold of the notebook it would be too late to stop him alright she said finally stuffing her charms book into her bag and shutting the clasp i thought it might be wise to work on theory since you seem to have no trouble making the potions and the essays and written comprehension can really confuse some people he fine in theory lewis said hull voice she walked from her office and sat down at her desk with a tired sigh it the brewing he terrible at the last potion he handed in was supposed to be a pepper up potion as an extra grade it was purple oh said hermione in a small voice wincing involuntarily in the final stages the pepper up potion was a thick reddish color no where near the lavender purple that hermione was imagining well i mean hermione glanced at lucius whose hands were working very slowly over a cauldron moving up and down over one spot he was listening i just thought it would be more appropriate to try some theory again because he may be excellent in it but he may just need to review bottom line hermione did not want remus and lucius and herself in the same room together most likely unsupervised with hull out of the picture lucius would let the implications fly and she would be done for shut it lewis you re helping him brew another pepper up potion and when you hand it in it mustntbe anything lower than an e or i ll have your head understand the professor warned yes hermione agreed reluctantly good the teacher relaxed for a moment before letting out a yawn and pulling out some papers for a moment hermione joyfully thought she was going to sit there at her desk and grade papers but a moment later hull stood up shuffling the parchment and worry set in through hermione body i ll be up with minerva i have business with her hull informed the three of them there better be no funny things going on because i ll know about it and when i do you will wish you didnt take potions class dont we already hermione asked herself skeptically however she remained silent as the professor gave them each a threatening glance straightened her papers and walked out of the dungeons there was an eerie silence and hermione stared at the door desperate for it to swing back open with the professor exclaiming just joking and then proceeding to grade papers but after a minute of her internal whining it remained shut and she knew all hope was gone sighing worriedly hermione turned back to remus who was staring at her with a scrutinizing look that vanished once she looked at him she wondered briefly what it was for what she had done but she couldnt concentrate on it very long she just wanted to get out well i still think reviewing theory would help let go up to the library shall we hermione said to remus trying to keep her voice low still though lucius heard her words and smiled in his cruel delight i dontthink so jane love lucius said silkily cutting off remus before he even had a chance to speak hermione dropped her head into her hands and just wanted to cry from her fearful frustration we all know how you love to escape to your precious library but you ll have to sit this one out you cantleave here he said calmly but she could still hear the smugness in his voice i wontlet you you donthave any power over me she snarled whipping around to face him lucius had leaned back in his chair his legs propped up on the table and his sleeves pushed up over his forearms it struck her suddenly that with his hair pulled back and his sleeves pushed up that he was undeniably handsome stupid female hormones go die she thought angrily oh really he asked mocking curiosity granger he mouthed at her and hermione bristled however he was far from done he only had a certain amount of time to prove what he had to and he was not letting his detention go to waste what about the time when you and i were out in the woods and when i told you to do something you would just do it he was talking about the kidnapping of course but remus didntknow that hermione was very tempted to turn around to see if she could convince him otherwise then what lucius was saying but that would be setting herself up lucius was playing with his words and however truthful they were they were misleading shut up malfoy she hissed eyes narrowed that nobody business neither of us wants to hear your rubbish nobody business but ours and i really dontmind sharing it with lupin here i mean who does he have to tell lucius gave an imperial little laugh and hermione wanted to strangle him remus had remained silent since she had stepped foot into the dungeons and she knew he was trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind their words though he could not she was very afraid that he was going to get the wrong idea and she knew that no matter what she did to prevent it she was going to say the wrong thing well i want you to shut the hell up malfoy it as much my business as it is yours so shut up she spat he smirked haughtily and yet everyone seems to be part of your business do i recall you running down the slytherin corridor most likely instigated by the snogging couple of rose and lupin just so you could come running into my arms enough she yelled hermione now feared to look at remus not wanting to see the disgust directed towards her as he surely relived the memory also she could not stand the ashamed feeling she got when she thought about it herself how could she have done that just for revenge on remus when he didnteven seem to care you came running to me just so you could make lupin here jealous lucius said softly eyes gleaming shut up she snarled too quickly she knew her defensive tone was an obvious give away that it was true but she was quick to defend herself in hopes of the last minute convincing that a lie is it remus asked quietly and hermione turned to face him involuntarily she bit her lip and looked at him worried but remaining silent he looked nervous but suspiciously so as if he was daring himself to believe hermione after hermione prolonged pause he spoke again if that wasntit jane then why did you seriously fancy malfoy oh no she thought frantically i should ve seen this coming what the hell am i supposed to say yes lewis did you lucius inquired interestedly leaning forward in his chair to look closer at her hermione face hard and uncertain looked between lucius sitting in all his fair haired glory his prestigious wealth and quick wit and remus dark haired quiet secretive and confused lucius knew what was going on and had every intention of steering it in a favorable direction and remus was being fed these lies and misleading things she was being put in such a bad light how was she supposed to get out of this i i didntdo it for anything like that she said suddenly not to make you jealous remus and not because i fancied malfoy i did it because i needed too she couldntfinish that sentence it would be the most obvious giveaway that she was that desperate for remus and she didntwant to shame herself like that i dontknow she mumbled finally i think you do know jane lucius said quietly and when she turned to glare at him she saw the clever amused look in his eyes i think you know exactly how you feel and i think you know a lot more dontyou hermione narrowed her eyes knowing exactly what he was getting at no i don t she snarled now kindly mind your own goddamned business because if you haventnoticed this is a tutoring session and you re preventing me from tutoring remus now stop it with your damned interrogation and leave me alone she sat properly in her seat again frustrated to the point of tears but she blinked them angrily away and told herself to focus on remus and forget entirely about lucius malfoy knew too much and she kept wishing desperately that if she ignored him hard enough he would go away and she would pretend that was the truth for as long as she could just as long as it kept her sane now remus i know you do fine in theory so just list off the names of the ingredients for the pepper up potion hermione instructed wearily rubbing one eye and looking at him expectantly through the other remus face was hard and his eyes narrowed in thought as he stared over her shoulder at something remus malfoy right remus blurted out suddenly hermione could picture the vicious smile that would spread over his face at remus words and she didnthave to turn around to know that it had no he isn t just ignore him she snapped she was hoping to god that remus wasntdrawing his own ideas with the implications that the nefarious malfoy had supplied and if he had then hermione was in deep trouble he right and so is rose and so is everyone else remus accused suddenly looking angry there something weird going on with you you know way too much and you re causing all this trouble and and you re just getting in the way of everything what with you why cantyou just be simple and normal hermione stared at him clearly shocked at his words that had sent her mind reeling how could he say something like that are my mistakes really that noticeable does does he really mean it they told me about the stupid shit you were doing and i didnt believe it i wouldn t how could i believe that someone like someone like you could do something as awful as that he cried pushing up from his seat and standing poised and tense ready to spring at her in accusation or flee from the dungeons in disgust or disbelief it not true she yelled immediately none of it is they re lying to you no jane you re lying to me remus snarled james cloak malfoy and his biased ways and the way you just knew what you were doing there more jane and donteven try to deny it because i know there something you re hiding something huge she gaped at him appalled and shocked and panicked it was absurd that he was accusing her of a huge secret when he was a bloody werewolf it was unfair and uncalled for and she was so angry and confused that nothing made sense anymore except justifying herself and getting defensive oh remus i wouldntbe talking about me hiding secrets if i were you she growled softly his eyes narrowed dangerously and she stood and clenched her fists at her side you with your disappearing and shifty looks and changing moods and and but she refused to let herself finish what she was desperate to say sounds like you know the beast pretty well jane lucius said offhandedly and she spun around with a snarl shut your damn mouth malfoy she snarled again i mean i think you fancying him and all is a complete waste of time he not even fit for human standards let alone yours he filth malfoy scoffed crossing his arms oh shut it you i dontwant to hear it from you how he horrible and below everyone because he not just because he a werewolf doesntmake a bastard like you any better than him she exclaimed he better than you ll ever be hermione didntunderstand the shocked but very delighted look on lucius face that had appeared as soon as she had finished talking nor did she know why remus had started making sputtering choking noises she glanced over her shoulder at him to find his face pale and sickly looking his mouth moving wordlessly and his eyes huge he lifted a shaking arm and pointed at her accusingly still stunned what she asked confused malfoy chair slammed to the ground and he jumped up form his seat in delight he seemed to be giddy with something but the truth was hermione had just revealed something very important and dangerous and do you think i lying now lupin lucius asked in a rush grinning and staring at hermione she turned to him her face twisted up in uncertainty she didntknow what was so important and whatever it was lucius was making a big deal out of it what going on she demanded upset you remus could barely speak she turned to face him again whirling around wondering if it was just her or if both remus and malfoy had gone insane what she asked now urging for an answer what did i say hermione stopped dead and her past words hit her like a train what did i say only moments before her confused state she had claimed that remus was better than lucius could ever be werewolf or not werewolf or not oh she squeaked her body tensed up as if she had been subjected to petrificus totalus and she racked her mind desperately for any excuse to say something in her defense that wasntimpossible and wouldntscrew up her situation anymore or for a way to get out of the room out of the dungeons and out of hogwarts forever well getting out of the dungeons would simply have to do she took a swift look at the viciously triumphant looking malfoy a glance at the shocked steadily angering remus before making a speedy grab for her book bag and sprinting for the door however professor hull happened to choose this moment to open the door just as hermione was reaching for it no hermione yelled in panic what do you think you re doing lewis hull demanded i was leaving hermione rushed to say no you re not your session with lupin isntover yet sit down hull snapped the teacher took a moment to look at remus and at malfoy why are you gaping lupin sit down look over those notes and finish your potion hull worked her way through the potions room and plopped down at her desk after a moment of shuffling papers she looked up to see hermione still standing at the door looking pale remus lupin clutching the table like it was the only thing that could save him from hell and lucius sporting a very happy expression almost as if christmas had come early well hull barked sit down all of you get back to the cauldron malfoy and lewis and lupin finish that potion or i ll throw you both in detention remus dropped into his face drawing shaky deep breaths and stared at the cauldron and blank parchment set before him sending hermione a victorious look lucius hesitantly sat down in his seat and picked up the sponge like thing and scrubbed halfheartedly at the cauldron hermione was frozen in the doorway torn between following the teacher directions and continuing her tutoring session or turning and running as far and as fast as she could the air was tense in the room and she knew it was because remus was feeling a raging mix of emotions and he had every reason too she had let them know she let it slip that he was a werewolf and there wasnteven a time for her to mumble that she had seen his transformation or that she had noticed his peculiar absences she had been so wrapped up in herself that she hadntnoticed remus slinking away every 28 days and coming back beat up a day or two later time then was just blending into one huge mess and she could even pick out his scarred face fresh from the shrieking shack after the full moon remus was not going to trust her at all anymore and chances were the marauders would be against her she prayed to merlin that james and sirius would still help her still get back at lucius for her and that she could find a way to stay away from the blonde forever because now that she had said something as huge as that she was done for lucius was never going to leave her alone remus was going to be on guard and suspicious for the rest of the time she was there and hermione was going to go insane she was sure of it she didntwant to face either of them not when she felt to miserable and scared and confused with remus and malfoy when she had said something so terrible she didntwant to push herself to get through the session however short it must ve been she didntwant to be with anyone else she wanted to be alone for good she decided in a split second and a moment later she was sprinting down the dungeon hallway her heavy book bag swinging against her leg and her mind refusing to acknowledge the screaming of her teacher to get back to tutoring remus she was not looking back she decided not today and not for the rest of the time that she was stuck in 1979 x x x author notes well originally i wasntgoing to end it here but a lot later there are a few more events that need to take place before hermione gets herself in a safe position and before she can think without worrying about lucius at her heels it gonna be a long ride guys but i think this story is at it halfway point i not really sure now i would appreciate tremendously if you would please review because at the moment this is my most favored story and i really want this to go successfully summer is near and i ve been typing like mad and having so many ideas so updates will come quickly and i broke the mold for you i was going to update like two other stories before letting this one out but i figured what the hell and gave you all a treat thanks for reading and please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just this plot and a few original characters very sorry for the long wait i started the next chapter on about all of my other stories and picked up another story that will not be published under this name but i decided this was most wanted and did it anyways good news this story is drawing to a close i know that inspires a freak attack on many of you but i mean in like ten chapters it might be done maybe even 7 or something i dunno yet but that doesntmatter on with the story still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twelve taking control she decided in a split second and a moment later she was sprinting down the dungeon hallway her heavy book bag swinging against her leg and her mind refusing to acknowledge the screaming of her teacher to get back to tutoring remus she was not looking back she decided not today and not for the rest of the time that she was stuck in 1979 hermione wasntstupid she knew that the stunt she pulled in the potions room was going to cost her a lot not only would she face consequences from her professor but now she would have lucius pulling her around like a puppet and remus glaring at her and spreading vicious lies to his friends well that what she expected him to do anyways she wasntsure what had made her spurt out remus is a werewolf in front of him and malfoy because it sure as hell was not a good thing it was something so terrible of her she was sure to become friendless and despised in a very short amount of time with no one to watch out for malfoy when she wasntlooking now she was hiding out on her bed curtains drawn around her concealing her from the rest of the world while she sulked and punished herself for something so tremendously stupid what had made her do that only a fool would ve done something as stupid as that and then ran away in fear but as long as she had been in 1979 with the marauders and lucius malfoy hermione seemed to be changing noticeably and even she seemed to notice it too she wasntthinking hard enough all her cautious ways seemed to disappear and the things she was doing because of remus well they were stupid stupid stupid stupid there was no other word to describe it but she mused that it was what happened when you fell in love if this is what you call love hermione thought miserably she turned over and pressed her face into her pillow ejecting a forlorn wail now she had time to think over her situation with possible solutions but all she could do was watch remus shocked face play over and over again in her mind like a broken record if lucius hadntprovoked her intentionally then it never would ve happened she sighed and flipped into her back fingering the corner of her pillow she needed to do something about lucius something to ensure that he would never come back to haunt her again to hurt her to taunt her anything she needed to be rid of him and for good the prank she thought wearily james and sirius were taking too long and she wanted the misfortune to happen to malfoy now not later she was very impatient for it to happen but now that she had proverbially fallen flat on her face after tripping over the biggest secret a person could have he would be cornering her faster than she could blink there was nothing else she could do she would have to trust james and sirius to get rid of him and if nothing else worked she could go to dumbledore or mcgonagall or something and enlist their help for time travel she sat up suddenly thinking she had been this silly all along why hadntshe thought of it before the answer struck her so hard that she felt like an idiot all over again more foolish than ever before hermione had recommended it to harry to ron to everybody but never to herself she had too much pride to do it because she knew she could do it herself but not this time if she was going to be out of harm way from malfoy then she needed to do it she had to swallow her pride march up to his office and tell dumbledore of her situation it was the only thing she could think of the only man powerful enough to keep the malicious blonde away from her soon she promised herself soon i ll go and see him and malfoy will know who in charge again x x x meals were quite a lonely time for hermione although she had not been officially shunned from the group of marauders remus deadly look was enough to drive her away she did not want to intrude on them especially him right after letting remus know she had something to hide something big james and sirius did not seem hostile towards her at all in fact as she followed them morosely to their next class charms the two boys fell back and walked beside her for a quick chat you ll be happy to know that our prank will start tomorrow at dinner james informed her happily grinning she smiled faintly but inside her heart was soaring with relief thank you she said the tension draining out of her slowly but surely malfoy wontknow until he goes to bed tomorrow night but if we re lucky enough sirius grinned at her and suddenly there was a dangerous twinkle in his eye prongs do you think we can ensure that he ll find out by tomorrow night james opened his eyes a little wider you choose the girl and i can get the potions from hull mooney and wormtail can come down with me and talk to her while i use the cloak to fetch it james planned and how do we get it into a slytherin goblet sirius asked thinking somewhat harder than james said boy scratched his chin mooney we ll tell him the basics and after assuring him his stupid little girlfriend is fine he ll drop it in the right place james said sirius grinned widely at him and if that doesntwork we ll think of something they both looked at hermione you re going to love this jane even though you wontexperience it firsthand you ll hear the rumors or we can just tell you either way and his ego will be so bruised he wontcome after you for a while because he ll be too angry to admit what happened sirius promised her drawing an arm around her shoulders and shaking her in excitement how long will it last for hermione questioned curious to what they were about to do to malfoy but too eager to know how much time she had to herself a good two weeks james said and started laughing to himself sirius joined in and drew his arm tighter around hermione then grabbed her by the shoulders and brought her closer he never going to forget this and neither will the rest of the school all because of you jane think about that a wicked prank by the new girl you ll go down in history for this he cried smiling he released her and clapped hands with james i cant wait for tomorrow james said neither can i sirius agreed they looked at each other smiled and then ran quickly to catch up with the rest of their friends watching remus and peter being pulled aside and informed hermione couldnt help but smile just a little revenge was sweet the class filed into the room gossiping as they pulled out their essays and books for class hermione chose a seat towards the back of the gryffindors closer to the door and farther away from the slytherins malfoy had not yet entered the room and she was glad for it the farther away she was from him the better she dumped her book bag on her desk and pulled out the necessary things for class parchment her ink well a quill her books and her wand she dated the blank parchment put charms notes at the top of it and waited patiently for the tiny professor flitwick to come in and start hermione wondered what the prank was going to do to lucius would affect his exterior look or haunt him on the inside would it be noticeable to the public or only to him hermione had no clue not even with the obvious insinuations that james and sirius had supplied before it made her nervous to think about how extreme this prank would be and if she would get into any trouble not by the staff no but by lucius and his stupid little cronies they would be sure to come after her no matter what if not soon after malfoy was affected her thoughts were too jumbled and rushed in her head that she couldnt keep track of what she was thinking she need to write everything down all ideas all worries so she could go back and muse on them later when she had a free moment she dug around absentmindedly in her bag for her journal wondering where the rest of the class was why hadntclass started yet and why the girls seemed to be gossiping more than usual when her hand hadntfound what it was looking for she sighed and brought the bag to her desk and peered inside of it there were not a lot of things in there and through the items she could see her journal was not one of them she blinked confused and even though awful ideas rushed into her head she was determined not to panic it was probably wedged beneath another book or just hidden out of sight or something calmly she extracted everything left and placed it on her desk only to find an empty bag and a desk filled with textbooks but no journal now she was starting to panic she unzipped smaller pockets and emptied them out in a rush flinging items on the floor her breath was heavy and uneven and when she started to shake it vigorously upside down muttering loudly to herself in a panicked voice people started looking at her funny journal she mumbled anxiously where is it she said loudly trying to drown out her hammering heart where my journal she demanded of no one looking around in alarm and scanning the floor for anything that resembled it she refused to acknowledge what happened to it even though she knew what had the horrible dread resting in her stomach confirmed it where is it she shrieked gaining the attention of the entire class voices died down conversations stopped and all eyes turned to hermione searching frantically through the rubbish strewn about the desk and floor you re looking for your journal jane asked a polite voice and her blood ran cold she looked up at the hard look on remus face james gave him a weird look hermione remained silent afraid that if she opened her mouth she would vomit from fear lucius malfoy has it he had it since yesterday maybe now you ll know what it like to be the center of gossip he hissed at her so viciously that all of his friends and nearly all of the gryffindors looked at him like he was crazy hermione knew she knew lucius had it she knew remus would know and she knew that he was going to be happy that she was in deep trouble she never imagined being in this situation forced to give into lucius malfoy advances or either suffer the consequences of being subject to remus hate she should ve kept her mouth shut but she knew it wouldnthave worked in the first place she had set herself up gained his hatred and now all she had to do was await the request that malfoy had in order to get her journal back and she knew that it wouldntbe very good remus glared at her and she was unable to rip her gaze from his furious spiteful look she felt such a rush of dread and self humiliation that she could not stop her lip from trembling or the few tears that dripped out of her eyes only then was she able to cover her face and turn her back on the one she adored that brought her this unending pain flitwick conveniently chose this moment to enter the classroom from his office so sorry i late i couldntfind those essays from before miss lewis would you mind cleaning up that mess he squeaked hermione got to her feet and nodded wiping the stray tears from her face and picking up her belongings and placing them slowly back into her bag she was aware that every eye was watching her movements flitwick began talking and when she was done she sat down at her desk and pressed her palms into her eyes she was no longer crying but gods how she wanted to remus hated her she knew he did she had revealed his biggest secret to a very powerful student who knew about hermione granger and so many other things and now with her journal in his grasp hermione was royally screwed the lock her brain echoed suddenly she gave a hiccup and sat up a bit straighter she had a lock on her journal perhaps she was safe after all because if malfoy could ve figure out how to unlock it there was no harm to be done she just hoped very hard that her lock was too hard for him to figure out but if he ever did that would be the end for hermione she dropped her head into her folded arms and suppressed a miserable noise get to your seats you are five minutes late for class flitwick snapped hermione didnthave to look to know that malfoy and his followers had just showed up there was a burning feeling of desperation overridden by extreme self loathing she had gotten herself into this situation and it felt like she would do anything anything to get out of it however if malfoy hadntpushed her so much she wouldntbe so deep into trouble it was partially her fault for not defending herself or thinking quick enough and the rest was because of him she sniffed away her anger and let her eyes rise up to meet lucius smirk he was completely across the room and yet she could not help but feel the fear crawling up on her flesh he was going to milk this opportunity for all its worth and she was going to be dead by the end of it well dead is a bit of an exaggeration she thought to herself but then again she couldntbe so sure she watched as malfoy and his little group proceeded to take out their homework and such lucius chose to extract something extra her journal she spied the lock on it observing the careful twist in it and her body deflated in relief he hadnt figured it out after all just what she had wanted he stacked different books atop her journal and then after throwing her a victorious look started listening to flitwick hermione attempted to listen but her eyes were glued on lucius wondering why he seemed so smug parchment was rustling and she dug around in her bag for some also taking notes as the teacher spoke and watching lucius at the same time he did not seem to enthusiastic about his work and after a hard sigh that hermione could hear across the room he leaned back and whispered to a fellow slytherin who nodded after a moment malfoy handed the parchment to him and dug a few galleons out of his pocket and handed it to the slytherin hermione narrowed her eyes in disgust malfoy was paying someone to take notes for him however malfoy seemed to have good reason for this for the next moment he pulled hermione journal from the pile on his desk and looked at it for a moment it was a long moment in which hermione quill made a large ink stain on her parchment and her heart was hammering against her chest he leaned over and said something to rose who failed to respond malfoy frowned at her flipped over the journal and then peered at the lock again and then demanded something of rose again hermione smirked at the annoyed look she gave lucius before snapping at him he looked mildly affronted but said nothing more brow arched in nonchalance he drew out his wand and held it to hermione journal and then in the tense moment where she was leaning forwards in her seat watching with narrowed scared eyes he looked up at her hermione was nervous and it was plainly displayed on her face lucius lifted his eyes his face sharp and hooded and with the twisted smile on his face reminded her suddenly of the murderer he would become and she shivered he held up the journal giving it the tiniest of shakes and she narrowed her eyes he couldntknow how could he know there was no way that he could guess the letters of her lock never mind get them in the right spot it had taken hermione ages and ages to figure out a password and a lock strong enough to secure her journal from the snooping lavender and parvati not to mention ginny at times but in the end she had managed it foolproof too she thought proudly malfoy never could ve guessed it still insecure though hermione watched malfoy closely he shot her a smug look and turned to rose shielding the journal out of view the slytherin girl muttered something to him reached into her bag and lucius turned even more so hermione was glaring at his robed back when he turned hermione stared at her journal again her open journal time seemed to freeze for a moment and her heart felt as if it had burst the color dulled and nothing appeared as bright as the empty white pages brighter than any sun ever could have been what the hell the journal was open near the beginning perhaps twenty pages in or so hermione had filled that journal until the very end staining each and every page leaving the precious few pages blank that she now used sparingly which means breath seeped back into her lungs and she relaxed time skipped echoing the slowing beat of her heart and logic stumbled back into her it counterfeit i knew it i knew it lucius had switched her journal with another at the very last moment let him think he right a clever voice whispered to her and she smiled at the thought when she could think again her brain working fast enough to plan ahead nit pick for mistakes and little things she might trip over in the future despite her doing so many times in the past and allow herself a success party hermione saw the hesitance and panic creep into malfoy eyes she realized he must ve seen her terror fade into relief and she focused on seizing back up plastering horror and desperation back onto her frozen features it worked rose was peering over malfoy shoulder and she too was smiling in success hermione forged a little trembling of fear before letting her face drop into her hands allowing the happy grin to overtake her face again yes she whispered to herself the lying jerk he ll never push me around again to the rest of the class who merely glanced at hermione at one point or another thought she was crying or extremely upset only remus who had been watching the exchange between hermione and lucius with angry relish directed towards hermione of course and cautious curiosity caught the enormous relief that had settled in jane eyes for a single moment before the wheels turned and she feigned desperation again remus knew and if he told a single person lucius would know too the werewolf turned around and scowled fiercely angry at his self doubt there was no doubt that he could be vicious enough to tell rose and dammit he would he was sure of it x x x surprised arentyou lucius asked softly stepping out of the shadow of the corridor hermione after deliberately talking to the professor when class let out tried to act surprised at his appearance she stiffened at malfoy victorious stance but held her head high you re a dirty cheat give me back my journal you jerk she hissed he chuckled and went to speak but hermione already having semi rehearsed something in her mind cut him off of course it not that simple is it you ve got something precious of mine something that you ll know i ll do nearly anything to get back so you milk this for all it worth i ll end up doing something that that gets me deeper into this mess called lucius malfoy so you know what i say malfoy she growled keep it lucius clearly did not expect this outburst of hermione s and stood stunned while she huffed triumphantly and turned and marched away stupid little bugger she thought annoyed i hope i can do this all the a hand clapped over her mouth muffling the gasp of shock that escaped her mouth with a moment thought a moment where her back was shoved against a wall her shoulders painfully away of the nails biting into her flesh she realized it was lucius in his anger listen to me you stupid little mudblood he snarled at her his face inches from hermione s his eyes were gleaming in fury and it gave hermione pleasure to note that her refusal could have such an effect clearly you do not understand what i have of yours he spat what you have of mine she asked sounding interested you mean the journal that you canteven open hermione saw the iota of shock that appeared and was suppressed for an instant and knew she had been right she smiled maliciously at him you re stupid malfoy to think that i would fall for that to her own surprise he grinned at her and it was not cruel or smug but different and you re stupid to think that i wouldnthave a back up plan suddenly lucius was flush up against hermione his mouth pressed to her his arms wound into her so tightly that her own arms were flailing over his shoulders she grabbed at him suffocating and furious and trying to get away there was a little click somewhere to her right followed by a flash and the next second she was free of lucius but burdened with worry and confusion once again lucius folded his arms triumphantly while rose stepped forward bearing a large camera with a visible light bulb holding it smugly she gave it a little shake at hermione mocking her helplessness hermione could imagine a picture that would be herself and lucius snogging like crazy their arms wound around each other and both of them flush against the wall but when it was finally in the developing potion hermione would have one hell of a time explaining it here your journal back mudblood rose said she tossed it at hermione feet and the girl wiped her mouth and tried to ignore the growing anxiousness not that it was of any use of course you ve probably got a lot of little white secrets that you would guard your life with in case it tainted your perfect record rose smirked at her maliciously and stepped back next to lucius they wore the exact look victorious dark and strategizing what they would do with that picture with the million of possibilities well things would be bad very bad actually for hermione when distributed and distributed it would be x x x near midnight hermione finally fell asleep despite the anxiousness that had been residing in her heart for the past few hours still tossing and turning she managed to fall into twisted dreams where she was blinded by the moonlight and lucius chased her right into the heart of the forbidden forest allowing remus in his monstrous form to leap on her and rip her to shreds however on the opposite side of the castle dropping far into the dungeons rose was carefully dipping the photograph from earlier into a solution while lucius slowly poured the developing potion into the mix they let it settle a while before drawing it slowly out of the liquid and hanging it up to dry together malfoy and rose stood and admired the blackmail they had acquired what our caption lucius asked rose the girl thought a moment before shrugging perhaps we wontneed one we can say she came onto you which you know will be believed most of the slytherins think she a little whore anyway with my help rose said proudly and with lupin complaining about her left and right i have gryffindors whining their arses off about her too so her own are against her so this wontharm me i presume lucius said slowly sounding as if he was thinking hard about whether this picture would backfire or not not enough to affect you some will think that you re romping around with the mudblood but when i tell the right people they wontthink it after all rose said assuring him i wontlet it harm you lucius she said softly he looked over at her and a suggestive look spread over his face the same expression that was already on hers after these photos dry lucius drawled smoothly smirking we could head back up to my chambers if you like you know the malfoy name deserves the respect of privacy rose grinned at him and leaned over and kissed him deeply after a moment i there she agreed they smirked at each other x x x james rubbed his hands together vigorously his glasses ignited with the reflection of the spewing potion his grin was sly and mischievous and he looked up to his counterpart for confirmation almost ready padfoot he asked giggling madly to himself this was not the first time they had created this potion and each time they had slipped it into drinks it had the proper effect much to their immense amusement almost done prongs sirius informed him happily he disappeared for a moment behind the cauldron before reappearing with a flask of grey powder that he poured into his hand before sprinkling it into the cauldron by the pricking of my thumb he sang cackling something wicked this way comes he shook the rest of the powder in and grabbed a mixing ladle cawing and cackling evilly like an old witch james looked at his brow raised before joining in with the evil laughter they stood over the brewing concoction and laughing maniacally together they were illuminated against the darkness their shadows thrown against the wall in grotesque shapes it seemed that all mischief had been awakened that night whether its intent for evil or vindication x x x the next morning hermione woke with a feeling of ultimate dread resting on her chest it seemed that a little voice whispered for her to skive the entire day to forget about lessons and to plan her getaway without the worry of both malfoy and remus on her shoulders but what about dumbledore you have to talk to him another part of her mind chided she frowned and agreed though reluctantly he the only one who can help you now look at the terrible mess you re in so clamping her eyes shut with trepidation she continued with her daily morning routine not hearing the gossip of the other girls not seeing the murderous look emma had on her face as she glared into hermione back nor the angry gleam in lily eyes none of it hermione was oblivious because the only thing she had to worry about today was listening to the daily news of the castle that was sure to spread through certain girls and to steer clear of the slytherins she walked slowly down to the great hall trying not to think of what people would look like when they saw her surely with the photo that rose took last night she was going to use it to her advantage and make hermione look like some some common scarlet woman or something she cupped her forehead in frustration at ron words and tried to ignore the painful twinge at the memory of his face she did not have to wait long however because as soon as she opened her eyes another face entered abruptly making her look away in shame remus came running up to her looking excited sirius was next to him and they both looked hyped up about something jane are you ready for it remus asked excitedly hermione did not reply but tried to push past him not letting herself think about the hope and desperation and everything else that rose up in her remus and sirius exchanged a look and then grabbed hermione by the arm jane it me james remus james apparently whispered hermione looked up at him and sure enough she could see the dangerous twinkle of mischief in his eyes that had never been present in remus james what in the world she hissed pulling him aside from the stream of hungry students alright listen i donthave much time to explain this james said hastily i stole a pre made polyjuice potion from hull and took it this morning to look like remus remus the dear kid is in a very deep sleep since sirius here cleverly force fed him some sleeping draught when we left last night we also stole some amortentia from hull james is going to put the secret revenge potion we made last night into a goblet of pumpkin juice and put the love stuff into another then looking like remus he will go and sit down next to his girlfriend as a chat accidentally leaving the original goblets in the places of the slytherin goblets and taking their goblets instead malfoy will drink the right one and the girl we ve chosen will drink the love potion it will kick in later tonight and they ll get down to business and when malfoy thinks he on top of the world james and sirius shared a knowing dangerous look he ll be knocked down and the whole school will know hermione shook her head in exasperation gods i donteven want to know what you re doing she sighed good because we wonttell you just watch and learn and listen to the news otherwise now we must be leaving sirius said and without warning both boys leaned in bearing cheeks what she asked bemused lily and emma always give us kisses of good luck before we pull pranks james explained you re the nearest female just do it half confused and very suspicious she gave them both a fleeting kiss on the cheek and mumbled good luck before they both hit her on the shoulder playfully and sprinted off those boys are one of a kind she muttered to herself and continued on her way to breakfast she did not see the few gryffindor girls gasp in shock at her kissing nor did she see the meeting of emma lily and the girls who had witnessed all hermione dropped down on the bench looking around sirius was sitting down a few seats from her looking subtly across the hall with an apprehensive look to his face he glanced over at hermione and smirked gave her a thumbs up and jerked his head towards the slytherins hermione scanned the hall and say remus james actually as clear as day he was sitting next to rose chatting away his feet kicking absentmindedly in the pathway between the ravenclaw and slytherin table he swung his legs over the bench for a moment and placed two goblets down hermione could see rose asking the question that was rather obvious what was with the second goblet but james seemed to handle it with ease and rose accepted james scooted closer to the girl laughing ignoring the other dirty looks the slytherins were giving him rose started laughing heavily and hermione saw him shift his arm awkwardly moving a goblet far over in the process it was not lucius seat but another s more slytherin poured into the hall lucius malfoy included hermione avoided looking at him thinking about him worry about him and simply watched as the events took place he stood in front of james telling him coldly to scram and hermione watched as james miraculously took the slytherin goblets from the table instead of the original ones he came back with a little strut in his step and sat down across from sirius beaming with eagerness hermione flew from her seat how how did you manage that she sputtered unbelieving years of practice james boasted hermione gave a little sigh and how did you know the goblets from one another she asked half curious and half impatient they were marked he answered and who was the girl how did you know she would sit next to him hermione asked him in a rush well sirius checked before we went in and because she usually sits near malfoy we thought it would work he said but who was the girl she urged oh narcissa black he said offhandedly when hermione eyes widened and her jaw dropped he gave her a strange look dear god she whispered to herself no i think i just what james begged knowing that hermione would not answer him as she had done it before pleeeeease tell me jane pretty please he whined hermione stood grabbed her bag and rushed up to the staff table unaware of the looks she was receiving she ran up to professor dumbledore who was conversing with mcgonagall over something professor hermione interrupted quite rudely the headmaster looked at her kindly and mcgonagall eyebrows rose in disapproval i need to have a meeting with you badly and quite soon maybe today right now i afraid not today miss lewis perhaps after dinner tomorrow night he suggested hermione bounced on her toes thinking rapidly are you sure why not today what about after dinner she rushed at him desperate to talk to him alone she needed out right now she hadntrealized what she had been doing the damage she had created until just now what is so urgent that needs to be talked about miss lewis dumbledore asked everything she gushed anxiously i ve i ve done too much i ve messed things please professor i cantstand to mess the rest up anymore i need to do something dumbledore sighed and placed his chin on his long fingers thinking deeply he twisted a piece of silvery hair around his fingers before dropping them to the table and looking at hermione again the only time i have that is available for a large amount of time is tomorrow at 9 o clock in the evening i have free time then and i can talk to you and give you my undivided attention then is that alright that late he inquired hermione twisted the hem of her uniform in nervous thought chewing her lip and hoping praying that things would be alright till then they would have to be or else she was screwed royally and utterly screwed yes she answered in a whisper i can manage until then good the password is ice mice i sorry it cannot be managed sooner miss lewis dumbledore apologized hermione mumbled something smiling halfheartedly in somewhat appreciation before slowly returning to her seat sirius was left alone at the table and hermione sat across from she noted that remus was it james this time again was walking into the hall rubbing his eyes blearily making her think that the real remus had just woken up and james was off morphing back into himself in safety lily was already eating breakfast talking to emma she turned back to sirius to ask him an important question but he was engaged in conversation with remus who gave her a cold look out of the corner of his eye she flushed and turned to lily and emma it felt like a long time since hermione had talked to lily and emma even just in passing would either girl ignore her because of the lack of communication hermione swallowed her nervousness and slid down the bench to spare a few words and demand to know where james was hermione seemed unable to interrupt their conversation so she sat awkwardly until they noticed her sitting and listening to their words hermione was actually very uninterested in what they had to say mostly because of the urgency of the situation and lastly because well frankly she didntgive a damn hi lily she blurted and could ve smacked herself the redhead raised an eyebrow but smiled kindly uh i was wondering if you knew where james was no actually i haventseen him this morning he might be down in the kitchens since sirius tends to eat all his favorite things before he gets down here why do you ask lily asked i just needed to talk to him about something is all hermione said trying to keep her worried heart from blasting out of her chest why dontyou ask sirius emma suggested in a tone that was somewhat friendly but implied otherwise hermione looked over at her and was surprised to see the girl glaring daggers at her he talking to remus hermione said feeling very small all of a sudden oh too scared to talk to remus just because you fancy him emma asked loudly several people including sirius and remus himself looked over at emma words hermione flushed feeling incredibly embarrassed to the point of tears but she held them back and looked stonily at emma no hermione seethed i just dontwant to talk to sirius because he reminds me of your hideous face she snarled the people who had been listening all gaped at hermione words and several of them sniggered emma looked shocked to the point beyond words thanks lily hermione said more harshly then she intended she snatched up her back stood and marched out of the hall with her head in the air with the luxury of privacy her face twisted up in anger and frustration and tears welled in her eyes before she angrily brushed them away she could afford to think about remus right now she had to think about her and staying safe and getting home hermione hadntrealized what she had set in motion or how delicate time really was the potions that james had distributed went to lucius and narcissa it was almost written in stone they would sleep together tonight and maybe it was possible that tonight draco malfoy would be conceived but of course there were technicalities what year was narcissa in wasnt lucius an average parent being around 35 when draco was 15 or something of the likes that would be impossible for draco to be conceived that night her beating heart slowed considerably in her chest and allowed her to think logically she did the math in her head and assured herself that it was not because of her the malfoy would be born lucius was near 35 when draco was 15 taking 15 from 35 you got 2 and taking lucius age from now which was either 17 or 18 it could be a year or two until draco was finally conceived it not because of me calm down hermione whispered to her mind slowly relax start planning and quit worrying she had to figure out what she was doing and fast but first she needed to find james and needed his help for good x x x mmmph james managed to mumble through a mouthful of food staring at hermione as she burst through the kitchens door james what year is narcissa black in she asked hurriedly he swallowed the food thoughtfully thinking fifth i think but it obvious she fancies malfoy and i ve heard sirius mocking her words before see his dad called a gathering of the family or something and narcissa bellatrix and andromeda are all sisters yeah i know she said offhandedly but andromeda is a sixth year and bellatrix has already graduated right i mean that mean narcissa the youngest james eyed her suspiciously what it to you i mean you seemed all hyped up about it just because hermione supplied immediately i just i needed to know for future reference nice pun granger her mind muttered sarcastically well at least it wasnta lie she countered james was silent as he stared at her this thing about narcissa and especially lucius is about about that gigantic secret you ve got isntit he asked cautiously hermione heart hammering in her chest twisted her blouse in her hands yes she said quietly after a long tense moment her eyes did not meet his and she continued to stare at the floor just him though but now now that the prank has been set in motion i pulled her into it too hermione groaned in self frustration to herself she moved and plopped down onto the bench across from james she dropped her hands to the table in worry james what am i suppose to do after tonight malfoy will never leave me alone and it made her skin crawl to think about it and you and sirius cantalways be guarding me so there will be a chance james that he will be able to corner me she was slightly surprised to see james grasping her hand in a concerned way and she knew his feelings were brotherly you can tell me you know jane if it something that bad i wouldntsay a thing he said softly staring into her eyes she argued with herself fiercely finding herself succumbing to his secure look not even lily she found herself asking hesitantly a minute after james withdrew his hand and laughed into his fingers not even lily i promise he assured her grinning his smiled faded into a worried look about anything though it doesnt have to be what you re hiding i just you re so helpless and i ve seen remus and lily like this before and it didntfeel good to not help them he told her kind of awkwardly she nodded after a moment lucius malfoy knows what i hiding and so does rose remus bloody girlfriend she said snarling the last bit merlin she hated rose and if i dontgive them what they want they ll spread it lie about it and it ll be the end of me what do they want james blurted unable to stop himself hermione sighed into her hands information she mumbled well he wants to bed me i would think that was his first intent but then then it wasntas important anymore but if he had the chance i know he would even if hermione stopped and would not allow herself to continue the horrible thought even if james repeated confused even if i dontwant to he would force me there isnta doubt about it she made herself confess now the huge fear she had been suppressing was recognized and even though the weight of it rested on her heart she knew james had taken some away jane he started no she snarled suddenly at him it true and you know it there no keeping him away from me even if you and sirius helped me sirius wontfor long emma bloody furious with me and i dontthink lily would appreciate me as much after you d spend so much time with me she not the jealous type if i told her the limited version of your problems she would understand she would want to help jane and if i told emma and peter and remus they d want to help you too i know it he promised her firmly hermione snorted remus no way in hell would he want to not after i blurted out that he a hermione realized her mistake just in time and snapped her mouth shut however james knew what her next word would be and a strange gleam was in his eyes werewolf he whispered and she nodded lowering her eyes that why he so angry with you i couldntfigure it out how how did you figure it out he had a really good excuse and really no one noticed when he left i already knew she mumbled miserably what james asked shocked that almost all of it james i know everyone secrets everyone past everything about everyone i know that she sucked in her breath and tested the idea of releasing this precious information i know the marauders excluding remus are illegal animagi continuing despite james stunned horrified expression she said i know lily absolutely hated your guts and only when you stopped being so damn arrogant she decided to give you a chance hermione looked sadly at his amazed shocked look i know everything james it unnatural for me and i ve been making mistakes too noticeable and malfoy has been watching me he discovered me and now he using this this knowledge against me my own knowledge she cried desperately i dontknow what to do james i i want to talk to remus so bad to apologize for my mistakes to tell him that it we i dont know but i cantsay a word to him because rose is feeding him lies he thinks i talking about him behind his back and he been wary ever since we decided to be mates james was silent looking surprised and contemplative i think he said after a long pause that you need to talk to dumbledore surely he knows he does and i talking to him tomorrow night at nine she said but james that not the point she continued desperately by then the prank will be complete malfoy will be furious and no matter what you do he ll find me and he ll get me james she finished fearfully no he won t james growled not if i have to handcuff myself to you i not leaving your side in fact tonight i ll explain it to lily and i know she wontmind understood dont think about malfoy only think about the satisfaction of lucius malfoy not being so incredible after all he remarked smugly hermione gave him a faint smile and tried to put all the trust she had within her after this whole damn fiasco into james however she found herself only relying on his word only slightly she knew and could rely on it much more that no matter what she did lucius would find her and after that there was no telling what would happen to her x x x the next day flew by so fast hermione could barely recall a period in time that had in interesting conversation an important realization or the absolute feeling of dread all she knew was that the slytherins were much more active than usual however most of them were not acting malicious towards her but sniggering about something else something horrible about their own house their own leader lucius whatever the prank had been word had slipped out and it was all because of narcissa black malfoy had been absent from classes and meals all day and hermione did not venture into her imagination to wonder why all she knew was that narcissa could be seen fluttering around the great hall during meals gossiping rapidly with various girls who rushed to tell everyone they knew and true to his word james latched himself to hermione he was next to her every class walked with her to meals and back and forth to the loo anywhere she went james went she had to admit the odd stares were annoying but she was graced by james protective personality at nine o clock when all activity dimmed to homework and quiet talking games of exploding snap and couples sneaking off to the astronomy tower james held out his arm for hermione to take and nervously she placed her hand in his elbow he escorted her to dumbledore office the platonic couple utterly silent each in apprehension and each for their own reason when they reached the door james turned to her jane no matter what dumbledore decides to do for you i hope you get the best that old kook can do wonders for anyone you ll be safe after he has his say dontworry he murmured and it seemed on a whim that he leaned down and kissed her cheek her eyes were wide but she smiled thankfully he squeezed her shoulder turned and left ice mice hermione whispered to the stone gargoyle a long grinding noise filled her ears and soon an ascending spiraling staircase was revealed to her sucking in a deep breath she slowly started up the stairs after tonight the trouble with lucius malfoy would either be a dream that she didnthave to face or a nightmare she would be forced to live but either way after dumbledore thought of a plan something bad would happen to lucius malfoy and she would delight in whatever his consequences were she knew after swallowing all of her pride that going to dumbledore was the thing she should ve done in the first place because now that she had power behind her words she was taking back the control of this mess she was in x x x author notes liked it eh i just have a couple notes the picture thing was incredibly screwed up i know that not how you take a proper picture and you certainly cannot do that rose did so forgive me secondly as i said in the beginning lucius malfoy was not originally in this time period i just stuck him here because it was convenient for me that being said lucius age is so much younger than it should be his stated age in order of the phoenix was 41 so he was 41 when draco was 15 got it good uhh please excuse the mistakes you come across or things that dont make sense i just beta d it quickly with a once over and even though i know i made mistakes i cantfind the rest of them they re sure to be in there though like it i know i did this story is past its halfway mark and i think it ll be done before 2007 or shortly after hurray please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just the character of rose sanders and emma has she even been given a surname yet anyways i hope you guys liked the last chapter and i know if you ve been waiting for some hermione remus action well this is a step closer to it enjoy ps this is a long chapter so who loves me i do i do still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter thirteen unsure of himself ice mice hermione whispered to the stone gargoyle a long grinding noise filled her ears and soon an ascending spiraling staircase was revealed to her sucking in a deep breath she slowly started up the stairs after tonight the trouble with lucius malfoy would either be a dream that she didnthave to face or a nightmare she would be forced to live but either way after dumbledore thought of a plan something bad would happen to lucius malfoy and she would delight in whatever his consequences were she knew after swallowing all of her pride that going to dumbledore was the thing she should ve done in the first place because now that she had power behind her words she was taking back the control of this mess she was in she knocked quietly and hearing the headmaster affirmation she slipped in careful to conceal her shaky steps and sat down the stillness of dumbledore office was unnerving because the hammering of her heart roared in her ears and she could hear nothing else but her nervousness lemon drop dumbledore offered kindly she was tempted to humor him just to focus on something else besides her apprehension but she knew she d be stalling no thank you she murmured he nodded and folded his long fingers on his desk now miss granger it seems that your making of this meeting was very urgent you did mention something along the lines of messing things up what exactly has happened since you ve been here he asked not unkindly hermione released a fear ridden sigh i suddenly all the fear all the trouble and worry that had been resting on her shoulders was pouring out of her like a dam that had finally broken free of its gates ever since i ve been here i ve been making tiny mistakes that no one seems to have notice so i thought i was alright but it wasnttrue professor lucius malfoy has been watching me very closely and with the help of a few of his friends he tracked me down and he cornered me so many times and he taken information from me that i didntrealize could be given everything i ve ever said he deciphered everything and i just only when she started to bury her face into her hands in shame did she discover she was crying i donthave anyone to help me i ve accidentally said that remus lupin was a werewolf so now he wonttalk to me and because he won t no one else will he dating a slytherin rose sanders whose also been helping malfoy procure information on me and she been getting remus help whether he knows it or not she sobbed her body was shaking and recognizing this dread and the horrible situation she was in was scaring the daylights out of her and i think i ve instigated so many events in the future and i cantdo anything about it and i a few jerky breathes escaped her mouth i trapped malfoy has me backed into a corner and it was only my pride that stopped me from coming to you professor and i realize how stupid i ve been i need to go home i miss ron and harry so much and and i messing things up so badly here and i cant stand it and i dontknow what to do and and she couldntspeak the agony and misery was not just falling from her eyes but her mouth the frightened desperate sobs that were suppressed into her hands were not unheard by the headmaster her chest was tightening in a bubble of worry and fear and when it burst she let out a long wail her body was shaking in the chair and she could only clutch her scalp to remind herself that she was still living still a person in the world and worst of all she managed to utter her words laced with tears he knows knows what miss granger dumbledore inquired very softly gently that i m i me he knows that i hermione granger there she said it hermione had been restricted to not saying a damn thing about her true identity to anyone but finally finally being allowed to voice her biggest worry of all was so relieving she actually gasped at her own words a sound so surprised and miserable it was almost foreign to her dumbledore looked into hermione eyes a soft understanding expression on his face she felt protected suddenly and wished she could just sink into the safe feeling that albus dumbledore radiated do you have any idea how he might ve discovered this he asked interested but grave yes she whispered one day a while back i think a month ago or something i was walking back from the library and i was talking aloud to myself scolding myself and i said something about being an idiot but i said it in third person and i just i dontknow what i was thinking she whispered dejectedly and you think he overheard you or that someone else might ve dumbledore questioned no i know he heard me he didntoverhear me he was deliberately listening she said fiercely believing this fact did you see him no but professor she swallowed the sickening feeling in her throat he been stalking me that was almost a proven fact there werentany witnesses but there had been more than one circumstance that she had discovered his presence or detected the feeling of being watched and who else would be watching her now except the predator that was after her and her information she almost expected dumbledore to demand proof of this serious accusation but instead he asked do you think he is doing this for personal usage or for a higher source voldemort hermione mind questioned did dumbledore know that lucius malfoy was a death eater or soon would be a higher source i would believe but it could be for his personal use too i suppose i not positively sure professor she admitted quietly wiping her puffy cheeks there was a long tense silence in which dumbledore did nothing except scrutinize her and she felt as if she was being x rayed because she knew dumbledore and trusted him she allowed him to use occlumency on her his gentle probing did not harm nor alert her and she tried to stay still finally he spoke withdrawing his mind from hers he sighed heavily and looked at her sadly i see there is much pressure and fear you have undergone this short time you have been here miss granger i am sorry that your pride was in the way and i am sorry that i have not sought you out to offer protection i feel it was partly my mistake to assume that you would be safe and go unnoticed by the more powerful students clearly i was mistaken it alright professor she whispered swallowing the well of sadness that was suddenly rising i ve survived this far haventi ah but you would ve survived and we know this our concern for you is the danger you re in dumbledore murmured now that lucius malfoy has precious information it is sure to be distributed to voldemort so he did know has malfoy been initiated as a death eater yet she risked cautiously honestly i do not know i would like to make assumptions but so far they have proved to be dangerous accusing lucius to be a death eater would cause great trouble for his father abraxas malfoy is extremely powerful in the wizengamot and many other places he informed hermione and so is lucius she mused she realized something abruptly and so will draco she could ve groaned out loud at this realization you need immediate protection miss granger the headmaster decided i will set up a safe house for you outside of the school and no hermione interrupted him suddenly i cantleave i what was keeping her anyways leaving would be the best option but then there would be so many unresolved fights and mysteries and it would be painful for her to stay but if she managed to fix everything she could to the best of her ability things would eventually work i need to stay she sighed i need to fix things myself i do understand i need protection but isntthere anything that will give me a constant shield of such to keep malfoy away there was a long pause and hermione could sense dumbledore thinking rapidly there is an ancient shield of magic i could evoke it is like a shield as you said and only you can control it it will only affect one person though and i take it that your choice would be lucius malfoy yes she said immediately you do realize that he may find other ways of getting to you though dumbledore spoke seriously i know she said quietly but nothing is as bad as he is and no one can hurt me as badly as him and i hate admitting that she thought to herself alright dumbledore said slowly i will do this for you however this shield will not come into effect until exactly 24 hours after it has been performed so you still have a day where you shall be unprotected seeing the grim almost terrified look on hermione face he offered you are allowed to stay in your dormitory all day if you would like meals would be brought to you no i canthide from him forever she said sternly more assuring herself that nothing would happen if she was brave if she could get away with having no protection this is not a matter of your pride miss granger this is a matter of your safety dumbledore told her firmly you need to be constantly protected until the shield beings to work and until then james potter she interjected he been helping me he been guarding me and i know a day more would do him no harm and he would readily help me miss granger are you sure in truth no she was not sure in this year in this sticky messy confusing situation hermione couldntbe sure about anything she couldnt be sure about the marauders she couldntbe sure about remus and she couldnteven be sure about her own decisions but she had to follow her own intuition or else she would never be able to take another step in life her logic now she had to question it logic would tell her to stay in the gryffindor dormitory to have meals delivered to finish essays and write her fears in her journals to keep to herself logic of course would tell her to take the safest route possible but she had discovered very recently that her own logic was failing her she began to question herself and start dabbling in the what ifs and the craziest theories but this was the wizarding world and she was dealing with lord voldemort and the marauders so thus being said what set the bar for how much information lucius had couldnthe as easily get the gryffindor password from rose who would retrieve it from remus and attack hermione when no one was there to hear her screaming or wouldnthe just have rose sneak up to the girls dormitory one night and suffocate her hermione didntknow anymore she didntknow what could happen and she didnt know what would happen somehow she knew there was a fine fuzzy line between the two of them and they would just as easily overlap each other as anything else she had made a decision to follow her head and she knew that but her heart had a say and whether she realized it or not she was listening to it now yes professor she said quietly i very sure dumbledore nodded and retrieved his wand alright and now it was all up to hermione to save herself from her own mistakes x x x it was a hard essay remus had to admit and he would rather be doing something else but in order to be doing something else he needed to finish this essay thus being said it explained why he was writing furiously and mentally cursing his professor hello love said a soft voice remus stopped looking up as rose sat down across from him wearing an attractive smile hey he murmured he didntfeel like talking to her right now or for a long time to be frank james had mentioned something about her and lucius malfoy and the nagging suspicion that the slytherin was up to something had thickened he had every reason to trust his girlfriend as she had always been on time had never slipped on any kind of excuse and had been very honest with him but still he didnttrust her and he had no idea why what subject is that for rose questioned curiously ancient runes he grumbled unhappily and it a bloody hard one so take a break rose suggested remus was tempted but he knew that she would strike up conversation with him and he wanted to avoid that no i alright i need to get this done he said well i wanted to talk to you about something she said slowly if it okay she added he took a chance and said depends on the subject he kept his eyes on the parchment and kept his quill moving quite honestly she said cautiously you and jane lewis remus looked up immediately a furious feeling rising in his chest who was rose to mention jane in front of him he only just held back his anger what about it he managed to say in a calm voice i know you never really liked her but why are you so mad at her all of a sudden i mean what did she do to you rose was feigning ignorance and remus didntknow that rose had something to accomplish she needed to set this pathetic excuse for a human against the girl who had enough information to ruin them all remus struggled with himself for a moment what was he mad at her for she told malfoy i was a werewolf his mind growled angrily but malfoy had to have known already he calling me beast left and right so malfoy did know about remus and if he hadntbefore he did now but still there was that suspicious question how the hell did jane find out it complicated remus answered finally i ve got time rose offered sincerely well i don t remus snapped at her angrily going back to his essay he did not want to talk to rose is it about her and lucius malfoy she asked innocently she noted that remus hesitated in his writing for just a moment but then continued on i already know how she romping around with him and that was ages ago he growled suddenly feeling very angry so it not what she been doing these couple of days that got you mad rose asked remus seething slammed down his quill what is it rose he shouted at her ignoring the fact that they were in a library what shit do you have to poison my mind with frankly i rather busy and i dontwant to listen to you talking right now he spat he was surprised at the words that came out of his mouth but it seemed that rose wasn t ah she deduced quietly you re jealous jealous he sputtered loudly of what them you ve got to be joking me well then what is it remus rose yelled at him standing suddenly working students were looking at them what could possibly have you livid besides them being together he threw aside his essay and matched her height towering on the other side of the table easily first of all he raged loudly they are not together and second what does it matter to you doesntit make you bloody joyous that i not talking to her rose isntthat what you wanted in the first place i cant stand to look at her but now you want to know why why arentyou happy with what you already know he roared because you still fancy her she screamed at him accusingly and i dontwant you running around with the little whore shut up remus bellowed abruptly he grabbed all of his things shoved them into his bag and turned to glare at her just leave me alone rose i donthave to prove to you that i faithful to only you just because there a girl you re insecure about and with that he turned and stormed out of the library leaving rose gaping and inevitably dealing with madam pince consequences remus stormed back to gryffindor tower alone seething and muttering angry words to himself jane was a source of great annoying and trouble to him and yet she was always on his mind lately he had been so angry with her that it blinded any other thoughts he had for her yet what other thoughts could he possibly have didnthe use to think about her in a non annoyed way in fact in a non platonic way but not anymore not when she been with malfoy so was rose right was jane with malfoy did remus actually believe that yeah i do rose been telling me all along and there definitely proof but now remus wasnttrusting rose as much as he used to prongs didn t padfoot didn t remus didnteven know if wormtail did or not the small marauder had been growing a bit distant the werewolf knew that an outsider point of view did wonders and remus always listened to the advice that they had to give so trusting rose words now and previously was out of the question he was suspicious of her intentions and proof did he even have proof besides the belief he had in his girlfriend yes i do the dungeons their kiss in front of the whole corridor valentine day and the list went on but who to say she wasntforced into all of that a little voice whispered in the back of his mind hadntsomeone mentioned that jane was having problems with malfoy dangerous problems hadntremus himself saved her from malfoy on more than one occasion i dontknow he mumbled to himself i cantthink about her right now i need sleep his walk went by surprisingly quick and he provided the password for the fat lady as soon as he reached gryffindor tower exhausted he headed right for the boys dormitory ignoring the thoughts that clouded his mind he jumped up the steps and he was grateful that it was relatively silent or else he never would ve caught their conversation he opened the door just a sliver but stopped at the voices so then dumbledore put a shield around you james asked someone yes answered jane voice hearing her remus froze and continued to eavesdrop the rush of his mind halted to a stop although he told me it takes exactly a day for it to kick it which means you ll have to attach yourself to me until half past nine tomorrow night if that alright jane said sighing but soundly relieved will do i ll explain that to lily later on he said but after malfoy is out of the way what re going to do next hesitantly jane answered i going to get my wits together and try to talk to remus i really need to explain to him the corner that i in what really going on james it horrible what he thinks of me you know what that damn slytherin is doing to him yeah i know but he trusts her and i dontknow what will change that james murmured quietly but you need to talk to him most definitely you donthave to tell him everything you told me but i ve got to what else would convince him he knows i ve got something to hide and unless i tell him what actually happening he d never forgive me jane said miserably well it not like malfoy didntalready know james muttered almost sarcastically exactly and that what malfoy wanted he wanted me to say something that would take remus trust away from me i mean he was already wary of me just because i ve done some stupid things just to make him jealous she sighed forlornly and remus felt his pulse start to race oh james she sighed her voice muffled remus knew that prongs had pulled her into a comforting embrace what am i supposed to do lily will help you james offered she wonderful with this kind of stuff and she ll talk some sense into remus but what if she can t jane cried suddenly the probability of that is much bigger than him wanting to be mates with me again much less think of me more than just a friend chances are he ll never want to look at my face again oh shut up jane prongs snapped suddenly remus has got more secrets than you and he d understand you better than anyone else so dontgo thinking he a stolid bastard who holds a grudge for life but he can be james you have no idea i mean after sirius went and but she stopped suddenly what about sirius james questioned in a soft suspicious voice nothing she muttered i canttell you why not because it would be the death of all of us that why jane yelled remus heard the mattress spring creak and her pacing footsteps look james i already explained this to you i canttell you anything i ve already told you too much and i ve no choice but to tell remus and lily and i dontwant to it puts them in danger and it puts me in danger but if you told them they could avoid it no she shouted at james you dontunderstand then please explain it to me james said softly c mere no james i just she sniffled i need to go back up to my room i need to think i appreciate your help all the same though had remus registered her words fast enough he would ve been able to move fast enough to avoid getting caught but alas jane opened the door just as remus pulled his ear from the crack in the door she tensed up immediately her brown were eyes alight with shock and fear her chest still with surprise remus took a step back stumbling over his feet and gaped at her james was staring at his friend in surprise clutching a bedpost remus james cried suddenly and with the yelping of his voice jane wiped the tears furiously from her eyes and rushed past remus the horror of what was happening suddenly hit remus full on in the chest and he fell back into the wall as james started for him remus turned and ran more baffled and mortified than he had ever been in his life the crushing weight of how he really felt drowning him however he was not the only confused soul that night x x x the next morning hermione was waiting patiently for james to go down to breakfast she chose to listen instead of watch because she would rather not meet the glares of certain people as they left for breakfast james came down finally with lily they were deep in conversation their voices low they moved off the staircase stepping aside hermione watched them carefully hoping that whatever james was telling lily would be accepted the head girl turned and beckoned hermione over and cautiously she went she found herself pulled into lily fierce embrace and suddenly hermione was hugging her back finding that lily was the only one of the females that had the motherly comfort so young dont let him hurt you jane lily whispered firmly in her ear he ll only get to you if you left him i know hermione murmured her voice tight lily pulled back and looked her in the eyes concerned out of her mind i so sorry for being mad at you all along i had no idea what was going on lily apologized hermione smiled faintly and nodded i sorry for not explaining she muttered quietly lily touched her shoulder in a sisterly way and then turned and left without james for breakfast james watched his girlfriend leave a distant look in his eyes before he turned to hermione he held out his elbow milady he offered throwing a charming smile at hermione she grinned and tucked her hand in the crook of his arm and together they walked so here what in queue for today lily is going to talk to remus for you and try to enlighten him a little bit about what going on i gave her minimum details of everything you told me and she agreed james informed her hermione smiled at him and then took a re glance at the boy who was talking it suddenly struck her so hard how much harry looked like his father although hermione had seen harry compassion and love from lily nature james had a soft heart deep beneath his arrogance jane sorry hermione apologize snapping out of her nostalgic reverie thank you though for talking to her for me i feel like i too cowardly to do it myself not a problem i dontknow if remus will agree to talk with you today so i gave her a deadline of a week james said offhandedly you gave your girlfriend a deadline why not hermione scoffed playfully and rolled her eyes at him anyways the prank has been completed somewhat the potion has taken its effect narcissa black is blabbing her head off about it to everyone and the only thing sirius and i are waiting for is for malfoy to make another appearance when he does we ll have sirius on your other arm james said happily grinning what about emma hermione knew that somehow she had tread onto dangerous ground james looked slightly crestfallen i forgot about that he murmured to himself he sighed and looked down at the girl holding onto his arm they re fighting emma can be one jealous bitch and she convinced you re out to steal sirius that ridiculous why would i fancy sirius she cried throwing her hands up exasperatedly well you did tell her you didntfancy remus but that was ages ago harry she complained cupping her forehead jane he sighed hermione looked up at him you called me harry again god she muttered to herself i sorry james you just i know he interrupted softly he smiled at her and she could not stop the faint upturn of her lips james was one of a kind hermione hated calling him harry but yet she got the two boys mixed up so easily especially when james was being so kind like this so emma thinks that because you said you dontfancy remus you must fancy sirius and she ll have none of that james announced airily waving his hands about in a feminine fashion hermione had to laugh aloud at this so i just have to tell her i dontfancy sirius hermione reasoned not only that james added sighing you ll have to tell her you fancy remus i cantdo that she said scandalized she mad at me as it is and she ll just go and spread that about the whole school it not like the whole school doesntalready know jane james said sharply looking over at her why worry about the gossip that already there they ll think i a floozy she sighed they already think you re a floozy he pointed out i mean with all this rubbish about you and lucius malfoy jane you ve got nowhere to go but up dontworry about it hermione heaved a worried sigh and decided that james was right alright hermione agreed quietly i ll tell her good james said just be prepared to announce it when we get into the great hall i have to do it at breakfast hermione uttered horrified you ll procrastinate james spoke wisely and plus lily bracing herself to hold emma back as soon as you start talking to her emma looking for a fight today and you re going to have to stop it before it happens dear god james grinned wickedly and that entertainment for me catfight hermione rolled her eyes no wonder i mix him up with harry she thought sarcastically x x x now james ordered hermione grimaced bracing herself and slowly left james side she approached emma back glancing up lily who was watching carefully you have to do this remember hermione nodded and left the safety of james side hermione reached out and tapped emma shoulder her fingers shaking emma she asked quietly the girl went still and then slowly dangerously turned to face hermione there was an enraged glint in emma eyes and hermione realized just what she was dealing with this isntgoing to be easy hermione she thought to herself but you cantbe a coward face her what emma spat hermione took a silent deep breath i need to talk to you and to apologize to you hermione said quickly before she lost her nerve emma turned for a moment and then got out of her seat and stood staring hermione in the eye james was silent and unmoving behind hermione and lily was creeping up on the other side of them the group of students in the general area had sensed the tension and now they were all waiting for the instigation to a fight emma looked at hermione expectantly and hermione started to speak rapidly look emma i sorry for what i said the other day i was in a terrible mood and i was just being mean to everyone she apologized so far there had been no stumbles in her words but that did not guarantee her safety and i wanted to apologize about the whole fiasco between sirius and i she said there it was the first fatal mistake hermione realized instantly what she had said what it implied and went to fix it quickly let me rephrase that i smack hermione went silent unmoving and suddenly realized her cheek was aflame emma had struck her and now she was seething i knew it emma screamed at her and rose her fist again i knew you were fooling around with him lily jumped forward and grabbed emma around the waist before she could lunge at hermione she started screaming incoherent words and soon there were students cheering them on the teachers noticed the steadily brewing fight and they moved towards the gryffindor girls no hermione roared back sirius and i are friends i dont fancy him i swear to god there was a terrifying anger in hermione that she could not suppress and the urge to strike emma back across the face was alarming her she fought herself though and hermione remained logical that such a lie you told us you didntfancy remus so who else would you go after emma snarled back desperately trying to break free of lily grasp james help me you imbecile lily shouted at him he jumped forward but suddenly he was too late emma shrieked and lunged for hermione who moved out of the way just in time i lied emma i lied i did fancy remus and now hermione realized that remus was in earshot and very much interested in what was going on say it jane james yelled at her this was her moment of truth it was now or never for hermione and as much as time seemed to stand still at that very moment she said it she yelled it aloud she screamed it to the gods she shouted it at emma at lily at james at sirius and at remus i do fancy remus hermione screamed at emma i did and i always have i ve been in such a mess about malfoy that i couldntdo a damn thing about it because the damned slytherin wouldntlet me she bellowed i fancy him alright i fancy remus lupin are you all happy now she exclaimed her voice ringing through the hall conversations had died down and everyone was silent trembling hermione stared back at emma and understood that tears had been falling quite steadily down her cheeks she went to speak but all that came out was a broken sob and still she had never discovered what courage possessed her to do it she turned to remus looked him straight in the eye and spoke to him and i sorry for all that i ve done to you she croaked her whole body trembling remus was tense and he was stunned his auburn eyes were wide with surprise and his mouth had fallen open never had hermione felt something so strong rush through her as she stared at him there was spark anyone could see it hell everyone did see it he closed his mouth blinked a few times and nodded at her hermione could ve yelled out in joy but instead she let out a wail turned on her heel and ran from the scene as fast as she could james looked after her and went to follow her hurriedly lily grabbed his arm and shook her head this needs female attention james just watch emma she whispered and with that she took off after hermione following the trail of tears that were splattered on the ground x x x hermione didntcare that she was missing class she didntcare that a ruthless teacher or two would deduct points for her absence at the moment she couldntgive a damn about anything except for him maybe there was a chance for her redemption she couldnttell she had broken down in front of too many people to count and remus had seen how miserable she really was if it werentfor the fact that she had just recently blurted his darkest secret out to a very powerful person than maybe she had a chance for his forgiveness otherwise she believed that he wished her to rot in hell lily predictably found hermione sobbing her heart out on her bed the hangings wrenched shut the head girl slowly opened the door careful to be almost silent however there was an audible creak and hermione sniffed sharply quiet for a moment go away lily she moaned her voice muffled presumably into a pillow totally ignoring her wish lily approached the bed pulling the curtains back slowly i admire you she whispered gently it took some damn nerve to say all of that especially in front of remus at the mention of his name hermione wailed into her pillow lily rubbed her shoulder soothingly murmuring comforting words to her you ve been through so much these last couple of months and i think we ve all been a bit ignorant as to what been going on of course you ve been ignorant hermione spat still sounding miserable i canttell anyone what going on how bad of a mistake was it to say that it caught lily attention who been stopping you hermione knew that she would end up telling lily the pathetic story of how badly lucius was controlling her malfoy he got people doing his dirty work for him all over the place and and he even got remus against me whether he knows it or not lily laughed remus is an onlooker on all of this jane trust me she comforted hermione turned sitting up and staring lily in the eyes frantic no lily you dontknow what i talking about and you dontknow what i talking about lily countered grinning hermione sniffed warily and looked at her expectantly remus and sanders got into a huge fight in the library today she thinks that remus is jealous of the non existent relationship between you and malfoy and sanders is jealous of you lily explained brightly an unusual mischievous glint in her eyes what hermione was stunned and he was so uptight about it he said and i quote what shit do you have to poison my mind with remus was so livid with her lemme tell you lily said matter of factly but how how could she suspect him i mean he showed me nothing but hermione sighed and shook her head realization falling upon her false pretenses maybe she needed to say that because lucius wanted to make sure he had remus under control rose was playing him for a fool again what lily asked immediately hermione groaned lily you have no idea how much control lucius malfoy has over this situation it like he controls where i go who i with who my friends are you know the reason most of you stopped talking to me was because remus was ignoring me and i mean why would you neglect a friend you ve known for seven years instead of a friend you ve known for months lily looked guilty and hermione knew she had caught the girl red handed exactly lily so all malfoy had to do was tell rose to set remus against me and voila so it has been done rose has been keeping remus under close watch because as soon as he starts to regard me with neutral feelings the slytherins are in trouble hermione explained swiftly relieved that she was piecing together most of the mystery but that still doesntexplain why remus has suddenly started to mistrust his own girlfriend lily murmured quietly james said something to him i think he seen rose acting more than friendly with malfoy and he would only tell remus what had happened if it was better for them to separate which is what we want lily deduced exactly hermione wiped her puffy cheeks and watched as lily was pulled into a furious storm of thought we need to do it lily whispered what he ll never break it off with her i mean look this is revenge for you isntit lily reasoned yeah but james and sirius have already done something for me hermione said but only to keep lucius away from you we need remus to like you again maybe even fancy you lily planned good luck with that hermione mumbled sarcastically lily scowled it ll never happen with that pessimistic mood jane lily said hermione sighed into her hands and thought miserably what else have i to loose fine she agreed quietly lily beamed but this better work oh it will dontworry lily said mischievously she grinned and grabbed hermione wrist i ll need a day or so to plan this so we need to get to class hermione sat up a little straighter oh god she moaned i forgot this is going to be hell just shut up and let go so hermione allowed herself to be pulled along she had a day to face malfoy and rose and she was not looking forward to that malfoy surely had to be in classes today or else there would be consequences he was going to be livid with her and hermione knew it she just had to watch her back for just a few a few more hours with james help of course and she d be safe and protected but it wasntjust lucius malfoy she had to avoid remus it seemed had much more potential in hurting her in a very different way than lucius malfoy ever had and everybody knew it x x x author notes hokay that is completed i really hope you liked that chapter it originally was supposed to be waaaaay longer than this with like millions of different things going on but hopefully i can fit that into the next chapter i got caught up with the dialogue and the progress between remus and hermione and forgot about the events that needed to take place instead hehe so we re one chapter closer to the end i hope you guys are pulling through oh and i am still on hiatus but i just felt bad for you guys so like always please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just jane lewis and rose and some other people i have a tendency to end up splitting chapters in half because they re already so big does not accept them anywho here the second half of last chapter enjoy because we are drawing to a close still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter fourteen a dangerous revenge so hermione allowed herself to be pulled along she had a day to face malfoy and rose and she was not looking forward to that malfoy surely had to be in classes today or else there would be consequences he was going to be livid with her and hermione knew it she just had to watch her back for just a few a few more hours with james help of course and she d be safe and protected but it wasntjust lucius malfoy she had to avoid remus it seemed had much more potential in hurting her in a very different way than lucius malfoy ever had and everybody knew it hermione did not want to be in class today she did not want to be near the population of the world much less the school she did not want to be anywhere in the vicinity of remus lupin it was very fortunate for her however that despite her sobbing outburst that the entire school did hear it was not the main focus of the day oh no today that title was reserved for one person only lucius malfoy in the back of her mind hermione really did know what had occurred that faithful night when lucius and narcissa had a little fun she didnt want to acknowledge it because owning up to knowing about it meant a lot of trouble for her still she knew and it just helped to make her day a little brighter hull presumably was in a bad mood lily and hermione were late for class and points were taken off of the gryffindor house few people looked at them but instead were staring at malfoy and giggling like a disease had been released hermione cautiously sat down next to lucius still frustrated that he was her partner through all of this chaos he had put her through but clearly amused by the day events malfoy had his forehead cupped and was glaring at the table a faint flush to his cheeks hermione smirked a little and glanced over at him she wanted to embarrass him so badly but she knew she never would at least not to his face well dontlet their late entrance interrupt you continue with your potions hull barked students bustled around the room retrieving and dispersing ingredients about their table hermione glanced at the board and took down the notes necessary for the potion there was nothing on their table and hermione sighed got up and went to the cabinet to fetch some things for the potion she was pushing things aside when she heard a little cough excuse me she froze at the voice familiar and sounding sincere she turned slowly her body like stone to face remus i uh i need ingredients oh she squeaked and jumped out of his way go go ahead well no i ll wait if you still need it fine hermione interrupted terribly humiliated she was positive that remus could hear her roaring heart she brushed a lock of hair out of her face and by the heat of her cheeks she knew she was a flustered scarlet remus was quiet as he moved things around when he was done he hesitated and turned stiffly around to face her he stopped and looked at her his mouth open as if he wanted desperately to say something but there was just a plug in his throat listen jane i lewis hull barked remus looked half relieved and half exasperated at the professor interruption hermione couldntdecipher what she felt over the panic in her mind yes she answered her voice unusually high because you thought it fit to leave in the middle of lupin last tutoring session i want you two back here tonight she instructed the mention of their last session drained the color from hermione face tonight hermione repeated thinking quickly when 9 15 hull replied hermione was suddenly overcome by dread she would have to step into slytherin territory at night most likely alone before the shield was completed this spelled out disaster for her more than anything else i need james here with me she mused hastily he needs to be down her in his cloak good you can come lupin hull inquired eyeing him sharply he nodded hermione chanced a fleeting look at him and he looked rather nervous avoiding eye contact he turned and went back to his partner hermione sighed wishing to steady the beating of her heart this session tonight meant so many things and however awkward it might start out to be she felt as if there would be some progression between the two of them perhaps remus was going to apologize to her had hull not interrupted them it was a very nice thought but hermione knew better than to assume she began pushing aside more things until she found the powder that she needed she grabbed it took a vile of salamander blood turned around to return to her seat before dropping everything on the floor malfoy was right up against her and hermione shoved herself up against the cabinet overcome with a sudden fear and a deep urge to get away from him you listen to me granger lucius whispered slowly his voice hoarse and serious i will get you back for this all of this you cannot get away with it i will hunt you down dont you dare doubt me fortunately for hermione the marauders and everyone else noticed malfoy threatening her lily waltzed up to the pair of them without hesitation in her step smirking hey malfoy is it just me or are your trousers a bit looser lily asked loudly the room broke out into snickers and malfoy whipped around and faced the courageous muggle born did you loose weight or did something else get smaller however furious lucius malfoy was he was mortified and the red of his face took away whatever intimidation he had people were shrieking with laughter at lily comment and the redhead smirked grabbed some new ingredients and returned to her seat with a spring in her step lucius gave hermione a deadly glare i will get you for this he mouthed and despite the nervousness she felt at this she laughed in his face quiet hull snarled malfoy return to your seat and shut your mouth before i give you another detention get bent you old hag malfoy spat back at her the class was in an uncontrollable uproar at this and when malfoy stormed out of the room no one cared that hull chased after him screaming her head off hermione returned to her seat feeling pleased with the situation she turned to lily and grinned i love you she cried that was brilliant lily smirked flicked her hair over her shoulder and laughed along with the rest of the group it took a moment for hermione to notice remus staring intensely at her but as soon as the moment came he looked away hermione settled back to her work finding herself more pleased than she thought possible maybe today might be a good day x x x narcissa black was a very flirtatious person and she had to admit she enjoyed what she got in the end she knew most girls disliked her many of them in her own house but she had friends far and wide and could easily be called popular today she was seeking out her younger sister andromeda because the girl was a 4th year and had probably received the wrong story of narcissa brilliant discovery smirking she pounced on her sister out in the courtyard scaring the daylights out of her tell me what you ve heard narcissa said at once andromeda quickly adopted her sister excited mood i heard malfoy has no goods and that he uses and illusion spell instead andromeda told her is it true i know i d get the story from you cissa but no one believed me oh dear i will tell you come on narcissa said hastily pulling her sibling away from the group of friends all eager for the gossip he had goods but they re very narcissa startled giggling and she couldntspeak for a minute oh merlin how should i say this tiny andromeda supplied curiously exactly narcissa cried and the two girls were trembling with laughter he been so mortified about it i cantbelieve it well there got to be something wrong then andromeda said thinking about it yes i knew that a number of my friends have been his bedmate before and i ve heard nothing but good stories from them no someone interfered who then andromeda asked the two of them started walking slowly into the foyer talking quietly i have an idea narcissa whispered cautiously looking around to make sure that no one was listening you know that new mudblood in gryffindor who lucius has been pursuing isnt her surname lewis or something i know i ve heard rose sanders complaining about her andromeda commented yes her narcissa answered well i know she doesntlike him very much so this must be her revenge or something of the likes you think she that brave to do something like that especially in her situation andromeda asked quietly i cantbe sure but cousin cissa how are you sleep with anything tiny lately the voice was very sarcastic and narcissa twitched in annoyance before she turned to face sirius black and his friend potter go away you fool narcissa spat potter and sirius grinned at each other malfoy not as good as he usually is in bed huh that what i ve been hearing the boys laughed at this but then again why would he put in much effort for a menial 6th year well you know siri it is the truth after all i mean it was common knowledge before potter said sounding half serious before he started snorting but tell us cissa how is he her face twisted in anger narcissa replied it none of your business who i with ah but it the school business if half of your friends werentas loose mouthed as they are then no one would know sirius countered andromeda watched silently her mind swirling with thought these boys seemed to know an awfully large amount of information for gryffindors you did it andromeda accused suddenly her voice small sirius and james looked at her surprised and narcissa smiled proudly aw little andro you better shut your face before you get hurt sirius said sweetly talking is for adults only dont you dare insult her sirius black or you ll find yourself worse off than lucius malfoy narcissa snarled whipping out her wand she pointed it threateningly at the two boys you both did it and every time this story gets retold you ll be in it andromeda said eyes narrowed you cantget away with doing this to lucius you sound protective potter said offhandedly perhaps you d like to sleep with him too at andromeda flush of humiliation narcissa spat at them you better watch it you lowly fools if we cantget to you there are plenty of easier ways to hurt those girls you strive to protect so much both gryffindors took offense at this snarling potter said i d kill you all before you got near them narcissa smiled darkly weaving her arm between her sister s and started to stroll away well then you better watch them closely she called over her shoulder a plan already formulating in her mind the girls entered the castle with no further response from sirius or potter what going on cissa what re you going to do andromeda asked cautiously angered at the boys threats and words toward her sister she answered i getting revenge for you and lucius it time they felt the fear she said in a low voice eyes narrowed she marched for the great hall leaving a pondering andromeda behind come on we have gossip to spread she called over her shoulder to her younger sister frowning andromeda followed she had a feeling things were about to get a lot worse x x x bastards bastards bastards james chanted stabbing his food lily sighed annoyed and continued eating bastards sirius agreed holding his cup towards james bastards james muttered clinking the glasses together before downing the liquid he went back to chanting and hermione almost lost her mind shut up she cried they won t lily said shaking her head hermione cried out and started banging her head on the table the marauders were all eating dinner and so far the day had gone by without incident for hermione she was relieved really but nervous for the night to come bad things were going to happen and she knew it malfoy had been absent for the rest of the day and she had seen narcissa black fluttering about the great hall talking to every female she could find soon enough the tale was heard by everyone this is ridiculous hermione heard remus cry from several seats away what the hell is going on she hadntnoticed until she looked around every eye that was trained on the gryffindors seemed to be dark furious and vengeful this is not good lily muttered taking james hand in her he was still chanting but he looked up and around his words weak and dying bastards he asked quietly he looked to sirius who was unusually pale prongs this is bad sirius said suddenly i didntbelieve her i really didn t what going on lily demanded they re just girls they cantdo much james answered sirius somewhat hesitant malfoy has too many cronies to count we ve faced them all before but nothing like this has every happened to malfoy we might be green and silver for years he cried it might be worse than green and silver hermione said quietly finally understanding what the boys were talking about it might be a lot worse james and sirius exchanged worried looks and james suddenly grabbed lily protectively the redhead was still with surprise and suspicion i not leaving your side tonight james declared loudly in her ear um i have an eardrum and i need to keep it so please no screaming lily replied wincing where emma sirius asked standing up and looking around i haventseen her all day lily informed him mooney sirius asked remus looked up emma seen her around at all nope remus answered nor have i seen wormtail or rose or malfoy or he stopped suddenly what did you two do he asked suspiciously hermione buried her head in her hands and realized finally that the consequences of james and sirius actions would not only affect them but her as well wonderful she muttered sarcastically x x x it was an obscene amount of homework they all agreed but hermione and lily were the only ones that seemed to want to get it done right at that moment potter lily growled and not for the first time that night will you shut up and do something no james answered aiming at quill at sirius and cheering when it hit him on the nose sirius giggled and did the same to james then leave lily ordered frustrated i trying to do some work head boy and you re distracting me you need to calm down lilykins james sniffed at her ducking out of the quill way sirius groaned jumped down to the floor and started searching for it no you need to grow up lily spat she threw down her quill i realize you want to be near us but you need to shut your damn face or i ll do it for you kinky james said dryly and how will you do that ugh lily shrieked she stood and started shoving all of her things into her bag papers were being ripped in half book pages crumpled but lily took no notice of it you are so immature potter she snatched up her back threw her hair over her shoulder and stormed out of the library lilykins please please wait james hurried after her clearly amused by his girlfriend attitude hermione shook her head ignoring the painful memory of her and ron lily and james seemed to represent the two of them whether hermione and ron were dating or not jane sirius called from under the table are you wearing blue knickers or green i canttell from this angle sirius hermione whispered in outrage and quickly leaned under the table sirius was cackling to himself a few good meters away happy that he had tricked her he climbed up and settled into a chair across from hermione so jane he started hermione quirked an eyebrow and stared at him sirius stared back unblinking what was with that outburst in the great hall he asked finally hermione looked away fingering her quill nervously and trying desperately to act busy with her essay mmmph she mumbled at last unsure of how to answer unmoved by her nonverbal response sirius started to talk you know i do think mooney fancies you and i think he has for a while i mean i know he been dating that hot slytherin whore but still prongs did that for the longest time just to make lily jealous did it work hermione asked very interested all of a sudden eventually sirius said slowly inspecting his fingernails but see mooney isntlike prongs he very reserved you could say and he also a lot smarter than us so what he does to make you fancy him would usually work well he really didnthave to do much hermione muttered sirius grinned at her and she buried her head into her hands i dontknow why he been ignoring himself though he been acting very different ever since you came into the picture sirius informed her why are you being so helpful hermione asked suspiciously sirius smiled happily at her because it nice to be loved that why he answered there was a long silent pause between her response a silence in which she scrutinized him carefully with a hard look what do you mean she asked finally unsure of what sirius could ve meant dont you have to be somewhere at nine sirius asked loudly ignoring her question hermione looked at her watch damn she muttered will you walk with me sirius she asked quietly sure he said anything to get out of this library lily seems to be married to it hermione laughed awkwardly at this knowing several people had said the same about her walking down to the dungeons wasntso bad because sirius was just as bouncy and lighthearted as he usually was thankfully he said nothing of remus and herself so their conversation was smooth and humorous so uh what going on between you and emma she asked carefully this subject could be easily directed towards her and remus but she was willing to risk that to find out if emma was still angry with her truthfully i have no idea ever since this morning she disappeared i looked for her at lunch and the class after that so that why you werentin charms hermione interrupted yeah but i couldntfind her anywhere that strange didn t uh someone say that peter was missing too she inquired remus said that sirius corrected throwing a playful smirk at her but wormtail been really distant lately do you know why she replied cautiously this was very dangerous ground for her to be treading on she knew but getting sirius opinion on his traitorous best friend was too good to resist no idea he replied and hermione accepted that this conversation was not destined to continue what time is it sirius asked her hermione yawned and rolled up her sleeve reading the time it just about sirius hermione and sirius turned around emma was running down the hallway emma sirius yelled joyfully she jumped into his arms and hugged him tightly where have you been i needed to think she answered slowly emma turned to hermione who tried to seem calm and not expectant of an apology jane she started i still donttrust you which means in so many words that i donttrust sirius however i can respect the fact that you being in love with remus might confuse you since i never thought anyone would want to be with him which is why you fancied sirius but i know you two never did anything hermione jaw dropped you re joking surely she spluttered emma gave her a cold look does it look like it not waiting for hermione stammering response she took sirius by the arm and pulled him away so siri i just need to talk to you about a few things and they were gone leaving hermione alone and surely vulnerable come back hermione whispered slowly freezing up in terror sirius had left james was with lily she hadnta damn clue where remus was but she wished he was here just to keep her company calm down and take out your wand you stupid fool her mind chided hermione did as such and taking a deep breath she continued down the hallway her body on high alert for anything out of the ordinary she walked quickly almost jogging but she forced herself to stay under control any moment now lucius and his stupid friends would jump out from behind a corner and grab her and she would be done for she glanced down hurriedly at her watch 9 08 just a few more minutes and she would be within the safety of a classroom under the supervision of a teacher just a short time until lucius could never hurt her again just a few minutes until she would be alone with remus and things would slowly patch back together hopefully she turned a corner and almost ran into another girl i sorry hermione gasped stepping back i was just in a hurry and they were slytherins all of them hermione stopped short gazing at the pack of girls before her with wide eyes and now everything seemed to fit they re just girls they cantdo much hermione recognized the leader of the group as narcissa stunning in youth narcissa would keep her elegant looks until the day she died hermione knew but that just hid the awful interior well well look who it is mudblood lewis narcissa drawled she could already be a malfoy hermione thought suddenly aware of the fear in her throat she took a timid step back her mind blank with fear until narcissa wand was trained to hermione i have a wand and i hermione granger what the hell expelliarmus hermione snarled suddenly confundus petrificus totalus there was a wild shriek among the girls several of them panicking at the hexes that were thrown hermione took the chance that she had and ran like hell stop her narcissa shrieked her voice a commanding force the girls took chase after hermione who was now flooded with fear and could do nothing but run find safety was all she could manage to think hide hermione was far ahead of the slytherins but they could easily catch up with her sprinting she rounded another corner and spotted a door she grabbed the handle threw herself inside without a moment hesitation and closed the door quickly pressing herself up to the wood hermione listened there were angry cries and rushing footsteps as the mob of girls ran by she listened carefully waiting until echoes of their footsteps had faded into the night that was close she whispered to herself breathing deeply her heart was racing in panic and she knew that she had closely avoiding an attack she had no idea what they would ve done to her had hermione not fought back at once but she knew whatever they would ve done it wouldnthave been very pretty too close she dimmed her wand light and hurried back down the corridor she needed to get to hull room and now she stopped at a corner peeking around before continuing her way she would hurry yes but she would be more cautious she hurried down into the darkness relieved that she was almost to her destination she stopped for a moment panting and studied her watch 9 13 two minutes only two minutes surely she could last that long picking up her pace again she slowly jogged down the hallway just another turn and hull classroom was there in the middle of the hall she was going to get there easily and there was no way that she could be attacked now definitely not yet as that comforting thought graced her mind hermione knew around the last corner he would be waiting she slowed down and stopped around her was the ever consuming darkness her dim wand the only source of light and safety from here she could turn around and go back or face malfoy once and for all she didnthave a choice really she knew that if she went back he would catch up and either way he would get her she moved before she lost her nerve and exactly as she had predicted there stood malfoy and his gang you dontlook surprised malfoy drawled that because i not i knew you would be at this last corner hermione said quietly you cantdo anything to me not with hull door right there she expecting me this very minute all i have to do is scream and she ll come and you ll be expelled hermione threatened smirking lucius ignited his wand and looked into her eyes suddenly she was overcome and terrified her body restrained and her screaming muffled her captor struggled to hold her still from behind but hermione frightened body could not be halted which is exactly why we re not staying lucius said dryly he signaled to his followers and led the way slowly away from hermione only safety now she was in the clutches of lucius malfoy and he was not going to allow her to escape not again tonight she would be his once and for all x x x why am i always late remus muttered angrily shoving chocolate into his mouth the full moon was coming and he was growing weaker he had to hurry though or jane was going to be wandering around in slytherin territory looking for him i doubt it he thought bitterly to himself she got to think of me as the biggest arse in the world rubbing his eyes in weariness he continued down the hall it was always dark in this castle and he particularly hated these dungeons they were abnormally creepy and it always felt as if there were someone lurking just beyond sight hidden by the infinite shadows waiting to kill or maybe that just me he thought cynically my alter ego hah it was sad that he thought of himself that way but really remus hated his vicious problem merlin he would ve done anything just to not be a werewolf for a month just once just one sweet time but he knew it was impossible sighing he flung open hull door sorry i late he called i got caught up on some homework remus put down his things and looked at the professor who was sitting at her desk with a very annoyed look on her face where jane remus asked suddenly he glanced around none of her things were there i was about to ask you the same thing lupin go find her hull ordered i ll be waiting i get to run around in the dark splendid remus thought savagely he threw a mean look at hull and left the room he ambled around aimlessly for a few minutes his ears pricked but his mind undoubtedly bored he didntmind looking for jane but he just hated that she wasntthere or making herself easier to find jane remus called hull is livid his voice echoed and faded into the swallowing darkness he had a lingering feeling that his voice was unheard jane he called out again wonderful where the hell is she he moved a bit faster now remembering that he had once saved her from lucius malfoy down in these hallways maybe tonight she needed to be saved again shit he realized knowing at once that malfoy had her held captive he ran around screaming her name his heart racing in fear he stumbled the light feeble and breaking as he moved quickly and ungracefully jane he shouted his voice clearly panicked jan he was met with a sight so shocking that the bellow died right in his throat he could not see through them but still he had a horrible dreadful feeling in his stomach what was going on there was a small crowd of slytherins all spectators to the surely disgusting horrifying display before them his feet were heavy almost cemented into the ground but he forced himself to push through them he stopped his mouth open in shock and his emotions surging in fury they had silenced jane lewis taken away her wand and banded her hands to the wall tears were streaming down her cheeks her face twisted into miserable fear she was screaming but no one could hear her no one there wanted to her hear her terrified voice not even remus it would ve split his heart in pieces malfoy was up against her doing as he wished with her helpless trembling body her shirt was open her skin naked and more exposed than remus had ever imagined it to be one hand was twined in her hand pulling back her neck to a painful angle and the other he couldntsee remus didntwant to think about where it could be we ve all been waiting for this remus a voice said quietly to his left he turned to his girlfriend stunned at her pleased smile she deserved it so much the surreal shocking reality took a hold on him suddenly and remus felt like god was shaking him furiously things seemed to stop for a moment his vision splitting in two bile rising in his throat before he gained just a little control of his own body he was startled by his own yelling but forced it once he understood it was him stop it remus shrieked at malfoy stop he was lost in his own fury remus attacked malfoy without warning and ripped the slytherin off of jane malfoy was thrown the floor but still he looked up at remus and smiled darkly wiping his mouth he smirked you cantprotect her anymore lupin malfoy drawled smiling she mine she mine you jerk remus screamed dont ever go near her again he was panting jaggedly his body hunched and tensed and resembling his werewolf state more than he would ve liked to admit leave remus roared all of you get out of here malfoy stood and brushed himself off he had accomplished what he wanted and he would only fight the mudblood indirectly from now on he threw a twisted smile at remus turned and left the rest of the group silently followed a mixture of girls and boys rose approached remus cautiously a hesitant look about her face remus dont ever talk to me again you sick bitch remus snarled his knuckles white as he clenched his wand i cant believe i ever trusted you he gave her a stony cold look she stared at remus unmoved before her expression gave way to one of pure anger she turned and left without another word and remus could not have been more grateful the anger and disgust dissipating from his body he immediately turned to jane her head was hung her body sagging on the binds at her wrists he undid them quickly and caught her as she fell to the floor finite he murmured his wand to her throat a small broken noise slipped from her throat before she crumbled in remus arms he held her without feeling guilty that he had arrived late he was just thankful he had arrived in time to save her he stroked her hair shushing her feeling almost as miserable for jane as he did for himself once a month this was the worst thing he could imagine ever happening to her the ordeal the girl had gone through ever since she had arrived had been because of him malfoy did just as much as him but remus knew the bastard didntcare what he did to jane shh remus whispered they re gone you re safe with me he added silently her only response was her muffled sobs she pulled her clothing around her exposed torso and buried her head into his shoulder tonight both of them forgot the painful things they felt for each other x x x janie please i sorry james pleaded hermione was silently doing her homework in the library and james potter was on his knees in front of her begging it was lily she distracted me i we hermione gave him a cold look he looked timid bastards he asked in a small voice his eyes round hermione lifted her head in the air and started to put away her things james jumped up and tried to stop her but she gave him a very cold look he recoiled noticeably and she continued on her way please you should ve been there she snarled whipping around to face him james resembled a very lost frightened puppy however she narrowed her eyes at him and stalked out of the library james frowned feeling very depressed it wasnthis fault it really wasn t he knew he had to protect jane and he knew she needed his help but the girl was brilliant she had a wand and she had that armor against malfoy that doesntcut it prongs he thought miserably to himself dropping down into a chair and cupping his face he rubbed his eyes something might ve happened and it was because you werentthere james dug around in his bag and pulled out a small object wiping the surface he lowered his face to the mirror and whispered sirius black sirius face appeared bright as ever prongsie m boy sirius were you with jane last night round 9 he asked quickly sirius pretended to stroke his chin in thought but then nodded till emma ambushed me and brought me to the room of requirement he informed with a suggestive smirk james narrowed his eyes thinking what did she say to you about what sirius asked anything involving jane or remus prongs answered she said some weird rubbish about jane being in love with remus but loving me just because she could and then she was rambling on and on about how jane was gonna get it for trying to seduce me seriously as if she actually needed to seduce me sirius laughed merlin james groaned this is bad okay thanks padfoot i have to find mooney has he got his mirror on him lemme check sirius put down the mirror for a moment and disappeared james listened intently to his rustling yeah he got it good there was a significant pause tense before sirius spoke again what going on prongs why are you so into their business he asked quietly because something is wrong padfoot there a damn traitor in our house and i need to know who it is james murmured he stared at sirius through the mirror and the boy looked back his grey eyes haunted she wouldn t sirius whispered at last finally understanding what james had implied james nodded sadly i have to talk to mooney first dontsay anything sirius sirius looked upset broken even that his friend would do this to him it wasnther sirius protested weakly well who was it then james hissed angry there isntanyone else in our house that would set jane up sirius looked away sighed heavily and the mirror faded to black james regretted hurting his best mate so but really jane needed protection from everyone even herself james growled in frustration and slammed the mirror onto the table wishing his friends werentso loyal so hurting them would not hurt him so badly he hated doing this but jane lewis had trusted james so much she had so many secrets and she was on the brink of loosing everything her life before anything else she had told him once that if she were to be honest they would all die everyone and probably everything james would ve thought this absurd and mocked her for saying something so idiotic but then her voice was terrified her eyes wide with fear as she allowed him the information after that he found himself completely indebted to her remus lupin he whispered to the mirror it was a long time before remus picked up annoyed remus hissed at james what i in the middle of something how bad was jane after last night james asked quietly remus looked solemn suddenly i cantsay at the moment we need to talk something is very wrong prongs remus whispered glancing around james nodded grimly his eyes hard and i know just how it happened x x x lily pressed herself up against the door her ear glued to the wood she kept still avoided breathing and focused all of the will in her body to understand what she was hearing we only have one more chance to do this danes rose said quietly the armor against lucius has already been started so he cant

gesture his face extremely uncomfortable and sighed it hard i sorry he apologized i feel like it her business you didntcare before james snapped i am so privy to this information if you were privy to this information savvy are you a pirate remus asked suspiciously indeed caption potter head of the butt pirates splendid remus said dryly you re avoiding the conversation james accused and he incessantly pestered for the details of malfoy attack look prongs i cant remus cried it didnthappen to me and she not going to say anything about it james interrupted gravely think about it victims of sexual harassment or any kind of that shit never talk about it because they think they re making a big deal out of it what if jane was raped mooney you think she going to shout out to the great hall that she was raped by lucius malfoy no remus muttered yeah exactly she d think that she was weaker than a twig if she did that because that what happens james explained now my point is we need to help her i know remus moaned he buried his face in his hands but refused to speak anymore tell me remus james growled prongs remus james screamed jumping up the werewolf flinched terrified remus got up slowly and walked away pacing he stopped for a moment and turned around and looked at james his face twisted with emotion he started his words forced and broken but quickly the story fell from his lips they she was up against the wall malfoy was being savage with her he wanted to shut her up like someone dousing a fire he was all over her and all of her clothes were ripped and hanging off and there were so many people just just watching it was disgusting remus concluded feeling nauseous at the thought james was silent his eyes pensive in grim thought remus seemed helpless his movements shaky as he relived the experience and i couldntmove i couldntdo a damn thing about it and when i finally just snapped they left and and she was so broken i think i think it might ve happened james remus whispered cautiously he might ve but he couldntgo on he turned away his throat dry and tight like a fist was closing around his windpipe forced her james supplied quietly yes remus grunted he turned back to james his eyes shining with vindication it horrible well we need to do something about it and we need to help jane james exclaimed running a hand through his hair in agitation yeah i realize this but without warning lily came tumbling through the door panting she was shaking like a leaf her face terrified and she looked panicked about something james she shrieked james looked more frightened than remus had ever seen him as lily ran to him lily what lily grabbed him and shook him hard and remus was surprised at her anger how could we be so stupid she bellowed she looked livid but still wild out her mind remus took a tiny step backwards breathe lily and tell me what happened james instructed sternly lily growled loudly and started shaking james it jane you fool we ve all been so blind she s lily stopped suddenly and quieted where is sirius she whispered darkly james looked into her eyes and there was a brief moment where remus felt as if they were a single person ying and yang separated by the barriers of a body but conjoined in mind and he well he was out of the picture you know dontyou james asked grimly the stupid bitch she been doing it all along lily snarled i listened james and i know what they re doing i know what they re going to do to her we have to stop this james murmured remus had had enough lily and james did this sometimes this weird thing where they were the same person and had the exact same thoughts onlookers were forgotten and only they could hear each other he hated it enough remus bellowed tell me what the hell is going on lily and james exchanged a dark look there are things you need to know lily began slowly i only know so much but what i do know is more important than anything else and james can verify it well what is it remus asked confused you might want to sit remus lily suggested but he remained standing she took a breath the thoughts in her mind confused and jumbled but overall she grasped what needed to be done and began jane is not who we think however she could not imagine the things that she had started to unravel x x x hermione was very pleased with herself that she had successfully blocked prior events from her mind completely she knew what had happened to her yes but she refused to acknowledge it she would do things very normally and never would the horrifying memory cross her mind still though every little thing she did reminded her of the night slytherins yelling crowds anything would trigger it and again she would be reminded hermione hated thinking about it hated the little things that snatched the event from the safe she had stored it away in but she had to and she knew it she would relive it pick apart every little detail and slowly her heart would turn to stone about the matter it didnt matter to her anymore no matter how painful it had been because now it couldnthurt her anymore transfiguration just a foot that alright potions still a lot to be completed hermione was muttering to herself again recording all the essays and homework that had to be done she was with lily in the library and both of them were working hard did we have herbology lily hermione asked absentmindedly no hermione scribbled that down astronomy nope when was the essay due in next wednesday lily had been very brusque with hermione lately and it did not escape the brunette things were getting a bit odd lily james and remus were frequently found whispering to each other looking paranoid and frustrated hermione would not allow her mind to stray to things that they could be discussing peter had entered the picture again and however much it angered hermione she said nothing she realized she was straying again from the group but then it wasntas if she were spectacularly close with them to begin with not since the very beginning peter mother had been murdered everyone had been wondering what was going on with him and for weeks she had been dead hermione had overheard sirius and james talking about it for they had approached him several times she sighed and put away her things ever since that night hermione had been someone else entirely off in a distant place her intellect was still there her morals but her spirit had gone completely everyone had noticed just as she had but no one said a word i ll see you lily hermione said quietly standing i have things to do elsewhere alright bye lily said absently hermione looked at her for a moment before she finally left lily waited a good five minutes until she stood up and approached madam pince err i was wondering if you had any detailed books on organizations lily inquired madam pince gave her a suspicious look what do you mean organizations she demanded shifting uncomfortably lily answered like famous groups of people that err did things so pathetic her mind moaned are you looking for something specific lily didntknow how subtly she could ask about the touchy subject she had in mind what she was looking for well she wasntsure if it was even known to the world i trying to research some group called the illimni she replied uncomfortably madam pince went very still and gave lily a searching look the redhead was confused for just a moment before she understood what a mistake she had made the librarian looked shocked but soon her eyes flashed with anger leave miss evans pince ordered sharply but wait out madam pince snapped ignoring lily protests the redhead narrowed her eyes a snarl on her lips but turned on her heel and stormed away hag she whispered viciously to herself there has to be something in here lily grabbed her things thinking harder than she had in a while where would the precious information be and how could she get it the restricted section a note her mind supplied who going to give me a note she asked herself bitterly there another way surely angry she hitched her bag over her shoulder and left the library she could inquire remus about it that boy knew more useless rubbish than lily did still though it was likely that remus hadnta clue about this odd group lily had never heard of it before and she read a lot on the other hand she had more pressing matters to deal with lily entered the great hall a good time later and sat down next to emma for lunch hey em she said brightly what the hell is with all this homework while the conversation progressed lily smiled to herself she needed to brush up on her subtlety anyway and investigating emma intentions and motivations was the perfect way to do it x x x narcissa sashayed down the hallway very aware that several males were watching her she smirked to herself and continued on her way alone in slytherin territory she was just waiting for someone to approach her it was a common thing to be confronted but she was used to the exchanges down in the dungeons and she handled the verbal attacks like an entrepreneur would deal with business however she was not expecting lucius malfoy to be her main attention today he approached her silently and with an arm around her waist he only startled narcissa hello there she purred she enjoyed being around lucius malfoy they thought the very alike and had the same acquaintances both of them were of very prestigious pureblood families a smirk played across his lips suggestion in his eyes i was wondering if i might have a word with you he said smoothly she nodded smiling alone he added in a whisper and she noticed the look in his eyes looking away she stopped the snicker that longed to slip from her lips well lucius dear the last time that happened i experienced very little i dontmean to be blunt but i would rather it not happen again she said delicately she refused to look back at him knowing that the laughter in her eyes would be cruel lucius chuckled for a moment before leaning down to her ear indeed he agreed and nipped her neck she gave him a surprised look i wanted to persuade you now there is much more to be discussed again narcissa they stopped walking for a moment and he took her hands in his own she looked up to him searching his eyes before smiling he did the same satisfied he bent down and kissed her and pulled her body against his this time you will experience much more he murmured against her lips she giggled and wound her hands around his neck deepening the kiss they were sharing within moments they were engrossed in each other their bodies moving in a sensual rhythm only stopped by their clothing let go she breathed breaking their kiss for only a moment grabbing his hand she led him away hurriedly to a more private place where they could enjoy each other the talk narcissa would spread about the next day would only be positive about lucius much to his content and the only gossip about him soon after would be that narcissa had found herself a permanent bedmate and possibly the best companion she would ever have x x x cloak you why james stammered to lily demanding in fact how did you know i had one come off it potter lily sighed just give me the damn thing tell me why first he insisted lily sighed and sat down on the edge of his bed knowing she would never get anywhere unless she told james what she knew i was in the library and i asked madam pince if she had any books on this group called the illimni and she went bonkers and sent me out it either in the restricted section or dumbledore has it lily explained twisting her hands worriedly and this has what to do with jane james inquired sitting next to her lily shook her head and after a long moment where they could only hear each other breathing lily answered i dontknow but i think everything she looked back up at james her emerald green eyes round with fear james what the hell is happening he pulled lily into an embrace and the two of them were still thoughts racing through their minds but their bodies tense with distraught i coming with you he murmured lily pulled away from him and shook her head no i ve got something you need to do for me it concerns emma lily said darkly he narrowed his eyes as she went on i need to look through her things and i need to hide something from her like what lily stood and started pacing thinking deeply jane journal i know she got one because that day she went into hysterics in charms but i just dontknow where she keeps it emma likes the dorm so i need you to keep her engaged in conversation while i look around alright james agreed what should i talk to her about i cantreally focus on conversation with girls lily threw him a dirty look and he smiled cheekily i actually very serious lilykins girls are hard to talk to they ramble a lot i aware of this lily snapped i am female if you haventnoticed oh i ve noticed he said suggestively and she rolled her eyes sirius or peter mum or something just ask her about her life and she ll start talking as fast as the wind just ask questions about sirius lily instructed she ll get suspicious james said with a sigh lily thought for a moment you re right but then again they haventbeen the closest couple lately and she knows that just act the part of the concerned mate she ll buy it lily said hopefully james muttered sinking back into his bed lily crossed the room and lied next to him you can always dig through her stuff another day i want to go with you tonight in case something happens alright lily agreed you can talk to her tomorrow then he nodded and pulled her close holding each other lily felt so helpless in this string of events still she wanted to do everything that she could it has to work james she assured him quietly he reached up and ran a hand over her cheek coiling her auburn hair in his fingers with a sigh he nodded it better lily or something worse is going to happen x x x emma wrung her hands frowning and nervous she was supposed to meet rose almost a quarter of an hour ago and the slytherin hadntshown up emma hated standing in the dark like a fool if a prefect came by at this time of night she was done for she jumped at the sudden sound to her right but deflated in relief as rose stepped out of the darkness the slytherin looked mildly annoyed sorry i late she said coldly not sorry at all do you have it emma shifted and shook her head i i couldntfind it i ripped everything apart but it was gone rose let out a deep growl and took a menacing step closer to the girl you knew about this danes you had this mission for a long time and did you do it no you stupid little gryffindor i knew you couldntdo this emma was silent she didnttrust herself to say another word to the head of the illimni or else she was done for out of the group and publicly humiliated emma life could just be destroyed if she made the wrong move rose sighed sharply and started pacing after a moment of thought she turned back on emma looking furious but desperate you are the only one who can do this danes i ll give you another week and some help you do this or you know what ll happen emma swallowed the fear in her throat and nodded i ll find a way i promise rose face twisted up in disgust and she gave emma a condescending look you better she hissed without another word she turned on her heel and disappeared into the darkness emma sighed rubbed her weary eyes and ignored the flutter of terror in her heart she turned lit up her wand and walked back to her dormitory as quickly as she could ten feet or so from where she had been standing lily and james exchanged a dark look under the invisibility cloak lily wasntlying that was for sure let go james murmured silently with the marauder map in hand the couple made their way to the library intending to solve more of the mystery that they had been tangled in x x x slowly emma tacked the photos on the bulletin board one by one with only the glow of the fire to guide her hands a dark look on her face she imagined the damage she was doing to hermione granger and smiled a little to herself she took a moment to admire her work the numerous pictures showing the muggle born in the arms of lucius malfoy gave a very bad name to jane lewis all still photographs they were only dipped in ink for moments before taken out had they been left in any longer the moving image of hermione would ve looked terrified and looking desperately for escape and the right idea would be planted in everyone minds instead the brunette looked like she was pulling malfoy closer getting deeper into their kiss emma reached into her pocket and pulled out the headline that she wanted to accompany photos she held it against the bulletin searching her pocket for a tack and froze at the sound of a familiar cough s sirius she stammered stepping away from the pictures at once suddenly nothing made sense any more to her sirius looked angry betrayed awful things were going to happen to her family just because her boyfriend caught her in the middle of the night she groped around for an excuse tears streamed down her cheeks as her mind raced she let out a weak noise and fell to her knees crawling toward him begging silently they made me she wailed covering her face with a kind of fake shame that made her want to laugh they were going to kill me sniffing she looked back up to her boyfriend they had been growing a bit distant lately and this was going to create a bigger rift between them they needed to keep together or else her cover was blown still she wanted them to be close but not too close she could only see half of his face by the way he was standing the fire was low and his face was illuminated with a soft orange glow he was staring at the ground but she could still see the sinew of his clenched jaw please believe me she whispered sitting upright she clutched around and stood for a second moving toward him slowly he looked up at her sharply believe what emma that it really wasnt you that none of this damage this shit that is happening to an innocent person isntbecause of you he snarled he grabbed hold of her suddenly digging his hands into her arms she let out a squeak of pain as he started shaking her rather violently why would you do this he bellowed furious how she ripped away from him you dontunderstand sirius she growled you have no idea what been going on because of her people are in danger and i trying to stop it or trying to promote it he spat back i may not be the fastest broom in the shed but do not feed me this rubbish and expect me to believe it you lying little whore ex cuse me she shrieked you you she trembled with rage and wanted to shake him and hurt him so badly you cannot call me unfaithful i worshipped you i still do i would never cheat on you i not accusing you of that emma he spat you re an attention whore this is all for you isntit everyone liked jane more you got jealous so this is just some scheme you made up to make her look bad why he demanded shaking his hands he lunged and grabbed her shoulders again why he repeated quietly this time emma looked up at him and started to cry she sunk into his arms bawling into his shoulder her body weak and needing his support without a word of protest or questions he had his arms around her trying to soothe her trying to be the boyfriend and the love that he had always been to her and secretly she smiled it was true he was not the smartest thing but even the bare facts led him to the wrong conclusion she hugged sirius closer to her grateful for this protective source that would blind the truth that had been discovered but not understood whatever he would say wouldntbe as bad as it could be x x x remus sighed and flipped the page not bothering to take notes he couldnt even focus on this essay anymore at the moments things were insane james and lily had somehow morphed permanently into the same person knowing exactly what was going on in each others mind sirius and emma were acting incredibly odd as if they were fighting but confused about being angry and jane he couldnteven think about her anymore well he could think about the non existing jane that he wished was real not this strange incredible girl with a false identity and a lot of information he rubbed his eyes wearily and started to pack up his things he couldntget homework done now there was a dangerous mystery that the marauders had been pulled into remus especially he needed to help more than anyone else after all he was the one that did this damage indirectly or not he shoved his things into his bag stuffing papers into notebooks and quills through assignments he was so distracted so angry that he fumbled with whatever was in his hand and the contents of his bag spilled all over the floor before he could prevent it cursing so loudly the librarian hissed at him he grumbled and put things back in his bag as hastily as he could he groped around scanning for anything he might ve missed when he clutched an object that he hadntthought about in a long time slowly remus lifted the small book to his face the christmas present that jane had given him it had been empty when she had given it to him but he remembered turning the book over he saw the initials inscribed into the back hg and rl sitting atop each other he ran a finger over the grove of them and was plunged into deep thought they called her granger h granger was jane lewis remus tried putting things together and couldntcome to a logical conclusion things were working out not with everything they had discovered they were missing one thing one huge important clue that would bring all of the mess together so they could stop it remus just couldntfigure out what they needed to know whatever it was but maybe maybe they werent examining the details correctly maybe things had to be done outside of the box and suddenly a glorious clarifying thought came upon him he hurriedly shoved the book into his pocket and crammed the rest of the things into his bag quickly he ran from the library and sprinted all the way to gryffindor tower his heart racing as he pondered the idea that was so crazy that it could be possible canis major remus panted coming to a halt in front of the portrait it swung forward and remus pushed through the people with ordinary lives walking slowly as they gossiped and laughed needing pursue the things in his own temperamental life remus flew faster than he ever had throwing the door to the boys dormitory open he lunged for james bed tripping on his own cloak and toppling into james trunk cursing and rolling over remus threw the top open and dug around furiously muttering madly to himself his eyes were round and his fingers were trembling as his hand brushed the object he was looking for oh merlin he moaned digging it out as he fought to control the panic that was seizing him please please let this be right he ripped out the marauders map opened it quickly and held his wand to it i solemnly swear remus shrieked and fell backwards clasping the map to his chest like a first born son w why are you in here emma was sitting innocently on sirius bed she looked so calm and ignorant instead of curious as to what remus could ve been doing that it raised suspicion in the werewolf immediately i waiting for sirius she replied smoothly she stared at him straight in the eye and did not bother to glance at the map remus gave her a hard long look folding up the precious parchment in his hands and putting it slowly into his pocket he not here remus said finally breaking the cold silence emma remained still but arched an eyebrow at him get out remus blurted and felt proud and ashamed at the same time you canttell me what to do lupin she sneered crossing her arms over her chest i waiting for my boyfriend i can do whatever the hell i please if it concerns him remus took a glance at sirius area things seemed as messy and disgusting as they usually did however one area was just to clean to be called his own it seemed as if someone had been snooping and attempted to cover their tracks so he wouldntmind you going through his things remus asked with mock curiosity emma let out a hiss and remus narrowed his eyes at her out emma get the hell out emma face twisted up in a snarl but she stood up nevertheless let me tell you something you deranged little beast she spat when everything gets messy everyone will know that you started it i ll make sure of that she stormed past him shoving him out of her path and slammed the door as hard as she could on her way out remus glared at the still door his ears still ringing from the scream of the door checking to see that no one else was in the dormitory remus jumped onto his bed and pulled out his map unfolding the delicate edges i solemnly swear that i am up to no good he whispered as quietly as he could inky blackness spread out over the parchment as a spider would spin her web intricate details words and numbers glowing runes and soft edges twisted and morphed until everything was still in his hands remus inspected the map with such meticulous thoroughness it seemed to take him hours to do he checked every last crevice and spot that was listed on the castle he studied every floor examined each tower and observed every last nook and cranny of the grounds that was sketched on the map she was nowhere to be found not h granger or jane lewis nowhere remus sighed and fell back onto his bed thinking with a sort of desperateness that it scared him to recognize it what was his motivation really why was he doing this for some stranger you re in love something whispered in the back of his mind some irrational drunk voice that he didntlike to listen to very often things were logical in that part of his mind i cantbe love like that isntreal he argued bitterly remus had had a hard life and the only love he had every felt was from friends and family he couldntexpect a girl to fall in love with him the werewolf yes it is you just haventfound it until now remus was very tempted to just scream out in frustration instead of that he cleared his mind as best as he could and thought where would i go to be alone the whomping willow he thought immediately or remus sat up abruptly and scanned the map for the seventh floor sure enough there was a single person walking quickly down the hallway slowing down at certain times and speeding up at others it was her jane lewis h granger hermione granger his fingers reached out and touched the name delicately as his mind started racing jane hermione whoever the hell she was needed help he had solved one mystery and now he needed to solve another he glanced back down at her name and sighed he traced her path a few times and looked ahead to her destination in her path there were a number of unmoving people waiting by a corner names flashed through his mind black black parkinson danes black avery snape nott malfoy slytherins traitors no remus yelled mischief managed remus stuffed the map into his pocket grabbed his wand and ran faster than he had ever in his life he tore out of the dormitory and the gryffindor tower knocking people over and yelling in panic as he sprinted things seemed to slow down his body much heavier and more difficult to move than ever his breath was caught in his throat his heart clawing its way out of his chest blood roaring in his ears suddenly it was all a blur a scream of surprise echoed in his ears pain erupted in his body and when he opened his eyes he had her in his arms hermione granger remus had a vice grip on her arm and an arm strung around her waist tightly he wrenched her closer and picked her up oblivious to her noises of confusion and protest he started running the way she had come with her squirming body in his arms remus you maniac she yelled kicking at him angrily put me down quiet he hissed he screeched to a stop and dropped her she squeaked as she hit the floor but started yelling again as he grabbed her hand and dragged her down the hallway you have to move he shouted at her his voice tight and frightened hermione heard and recognized his tone and suddenly the color in her face drained she understood the two of them started sprinting down the hallway running away from the danger that had been waiting for them hearts pounding they passed the room of requirement remus tried to stop so suddenly that he fell over thinking out loud he ran back and forth by the room of requirement while hermione shifted shaking with anxiousness a safe place a safe place a safe place he muttered hastily his hands trembling as he ran them through his hair a wooden door appeared and remus grabbed hermione around the waist snatched the doorknob and threw her in jumping in after her they were closed up in a replica of the gryffindor common room with no one in it except the two them remus stumbled and fell to the ground he was shaking hard feeling so worried and panicked that it felt as if someone had tried to kill him he curled up into a ball and the terror that ran through his body finally came to rest in the pit of his stomach remus hermione touched his shoulder worriedly and jumped back when the boy turned and started retching remus huddled to the ground the vile spilling from his body laced with the fear that had been overcoming him he coughed his throat burning and fell away from the vomit on the ground he let out a shaky sigh and ran his hands over his face pressing his palms into his stinging eyes he felt her hands on his shoulders gentle and comforting are you alright remus hermione asked quietly concerned more about him than anything else that was happening at the moment he lowered his hands and stared up at her she realized that he looked ready to start crying speechless and worried she did the only thing she could she pulled him into an embrace and tried not to cry in the fear of what was happening they were close tied together and inseparable fierce and worried it was a long time before either of them released the tension from their bodies and pulled away from the comfort that they gave each other what happening she asked her voice barely more than a whispered she looked at him unable to find anything within her except a dry scared sob that could express how lost she felt he said nothing but instead slowly reached up and touched her cheek hermione brown eyes were round with confusion and worry but she remained silent he stroked her cheek his icy fingers trembling his eyes were mournful and dark she wished she could soothe his mind put a stop to whatever was causing this strange behavior tell me remus tell me what they did she urged quietly what wrong please merlin please let me help you he shook his head and let out a dry cold laugh you canthelp me god no one can help me he looked up at her again almost fondly this time he reached up and stroked her cheek a faint smile on his lips let me help you please let all of us help you he murmured back you re too proud you know how combined forces work better let me help you please you can t she argued back at once she dropped her eyes i cantendanger you any of you you re all too precious to harm she didntbother to look at remus and with a bitterness that seemed to break her own heart she stood up and walked away from him you wouldntunderstand remus just let me be i can do this on my own i know i can help you if you ll just let me he protested standing up himself wiping his mouth he dug around in his pockets and found chocolate and shoved it in his mouth needing the spurt of energy more than ever hermione shook her head remus swallowed taking the time to search for the right way into winning her over you re convinced you re alone and you re not i dontknow why you cantsee that there are so many people that want to help you he objected his voice a sad moan hermione whipped around and faced him her eyes hard you haventseen the pictures have you remus confusion struck him and he knew that something was wrong that something else had been added to this concoction what pictures you remember that day in charms when i couldntfind my journal and i started going frantic you remember how malfoy always seemed to have a hold over me well now everyone knows because the pictures they took of him forcing himself on me made me look like a tramp she yelled scandalized and humiliated her throat was suddenly tied up dry and tight and she couldnt swallow the knot that had appeared they tricked me again and again i couldntdo a damn thing about it and malfoy knew it she screamed tears falling from her furious bitter eyes so he shoved me against a wall and stupid rose sanders got pictures and they re still they dont move hermione struggled for a moment a growl in her throat that clawed its way out in a scream of raw anger why she bellowed her body shaking from the anger that was pouring through her why me why always me remus remained silent as she started snatching objects and hurling them into the nearest wall a guttural bestial noise following every smash remus sunk down to the floor next to the mantle place cringing as every breakable object in the room was destroyed hermione fought her emotions and anger until there was nothing else in her to fight against quiet gasping sobs followed as she finally calmed down cradling her head in her arms against the couch she sniffed and brushed away the last of her tears when she came to her senses at last she looked up to remus who was staring at her with a sort of intensity that she hadntseen before in him i can help you he offered simply he shrugged and rubbed his eyes there nothing else i can do or say than that i know you dontwant my help but hell you need it and i know it scares you to admit that you dontget it remus she answered her voice thick from her tears no you dontget it jane he shot back at once and suddenly to him it all made sense remus you just have to hermione hermione went absolutely silent her eyes wide and her mouth open in shock her movement ceased as the blood in her veins ran cold hermione granger for merlin sake he yelled remus pushed himself up and crossed to her you couldnthide it forever you know not from them and not from me he explained in a hard voice i dontknow why you couldnthave been honest from the start why would i care who you were who you are i could ask you the very same question she shot back at once unsure of where her courage had come from i scared of people knowing who i am like you are afraid of people knowing what you are dont hold that against me he mumbled dropping into the couch next to her i not holding it against you remus and i never was from the start i knew who you were what you were and you know i loved you anyway she cried dontyou see that none of this matters you loved me he repeated immediately his tone had changed suddenly and he sounded almost faint i did and i do she confirmed quietly she lowered her eyes and refused to meet his gaze you just couldntlove me back remus and i accepted that hermione his tone god it was familiar she looked up at him a strange feeling rising in her chest and confusion in her eyes i was just scared to love you back but i not not anymore the air around them changed with amazing speed the bitterness was now replaced with a new sort of tension passion he leaned forward and kissed her very lightly on the lips hermione eyes fluttered shut and the world of misery and fear that she had

boyfriend resembled an obnoxiously cute puppy with a stubborn attitude go lily snapped pushing all of her weight against his shoulder in a gigantic heave james shoved back trying to get back into their dormitory but lily refused to let him please i can t it too hard he protested feeling very reluctant i dont wanna he whined shaking his body around in a tantrum potter the hardest thing you will ever do is getting back on my good side if you dontdo this lily threatened bristling you agreed to this but that was yesterday lily do it she screamed sending james ducking for cover okay was his whimpering reply he slowly peered out from behind the sofa do i get a reward besides moral fiber she asked dryly please as if i need anymore he said haughtily you ve got about as much moral fiber as a damn banana potter which has fiber james pointed out brightly lily shot him a look but then nodded you ll get a reward you dog but just get up we need to do this quickly lily instructed james stood and she pulled him over to the door remember just ask about sirius and if you mess this up no reward james gasped agreed james nodded good now go lily opened the door and shoved him in the head boy scanned the room for the familiar face and saw emma doing homework by the fireplace he darted towards the couch but approached her slowly he watched lily creep up the dormitory stairs sitting down next to emma he pulled himself together why are you writing an essay he asked curiously emma quill was dancing across the page and it did not falter for a moment not looking up she replied it for potions you ve got one too you know i do emma turned and gave him a dry look similar to the one lily gave him earlier he smiled cheekily at her s alright i can do it anytime james declared sinking back into the sofa like next week it due tomorrow potter oh i can do it next week then there were a few minutes of silence as james watched emma write out her essay furiously he was searching his mind for some way to stall her so that he could keep her attention away from the essay but still make her finish it once they were done what up with you and sirius he blurted and was pleased that it sounded casual almost instantly her quill came to a halt she looked up at him suspiciously what do you mean she asked him sharply her eyes glinting well you know are you fight no why she interrupted him her voice low it just seems like it everything is all james shrugged and gesticulated it was a movement so random he couldnteven decipher what he had meant to say emma gave him a confused look circus like circus what a circus he asked interested she opened her mouth to answer by golly yes it is circus like nothing is circus like except a circus and sales on shoes she said seriously arching an eyebrow at him what about sales on jackets or brooms he retorted crossing his arms it not all about shoes oh it all about shoes potter she intoned wisely and went back to her essay it not all about shoes he snapped look over on the bulletin board there a sign for a broom what the hell james toppled off the couch in shock stumbling he ran over to the bulletin board and plucked the revealing picture off speechless he gaped at the picture and rushed back over to emma and waved it in her face look emma he cried emma glanced at the photo and for a brief second james felt like something odd happened in the air around him before she shrugged and went back to her essay nice picture she said sarcastically james stared at her amazed that emma was masking her dislike for jane so much but then it occurred to him she was the one who had done it it had to be her you donteven care he asked sounding stunned maybe he could find a crack in this perfect little mask of hers nope he sighed heavily and lowered it this is horrible do you know who did it nope he gave a loud dramatic sigh and shoved the picture in his pocket i need to find out he paused and smirked at the clever idea that crossed his mind oh i can ask sirius he said he was done here late last night he might know emma whipped around and looked at him for a single moment she looked very frightened but then she recovered so easily it almost appeared as if the fear was never there he wouldntknow he was with me last night if you catch my drift james shot her a victorious look i know he told me how much fun you had emma face was devoid of emotion but she seemed to be searching him was he playing off her lie to cover his own stupidity or was he aware of her lie and mocking her i jimmy james james winced at the nickname lily came skipping over to them and plopped down on the couch found my shoes she declared took me forever though we need to clean up there agreed emma said heartily lily laughed and for a moment they all looked at each other emma looked calm and lighthearted but lily knew her well enough to spot the anxiousness in her eyes glancing at james she saw that his arrogant hazel eyes held more pride than usual well i want some ice cream come to the kitchens with me she asked james he nodded want me to bring some back for you lily asked emma the other girl shook her head too distracting i need to finish this essay and your boyfriend hasnt been helping any emma complained throwing an irritated look at the head boy he grinned well i ll get rid of him see you later lily said pulling james by the hand and leading him out stepping out of the gryffindor tower lily turned to him well james slowly pulled out the revealing pictures of jane and lily clapped a hand over her mouth eyes round as galleons in shock who emma james answered simply i did some smooth talking and with my cleverness i discovered it was her what cleverness you mean the kind where you can tell where the milk is a week old what is with the insults today evans one would think you hated me he said sounding melodramatic however he threw an arm around her shoulders fondly and pulled her closer well i have jane diary it a very strange lock she got lily muttered pulling out the book it was a medium sized book with very wide but short pages the old faded leather was peeling off in several places and it was hard to distinguish that it had even been red the lock was a twisted knob looking as if it had been hacked off an old willow tree and pasted on it sat atop the cover which was like the extra material in the back folded over onto the front of the journal protecting the vertical edges of the pages in the worn piece of wood were three little spaces empty of any patterns or weathering james took it from lily hands now very interested in how to open it neither of them wanted to read her private thoughts but this lock was so interesting that the challenge of figuring it out would be immensely entertaining how do you do it james asked softly he was entranced by this book and lily was too the couple walked slowly prodding at the diary with their wands and determination in their hearts it could be a combination or something lily suggested it might be initials or an acronym james intoned they looked at each other and lily put the journal away ice cream first mystery later she said stoutly how about ice cream re ward and then mystery james proposed lily shook her head laughing james ice cream was your reward damn x x x narcissa scuttled over to her sister darting through the crowded slytherin common room after speaking with rose narcissa had concocted the perfect means of revenge on those gryffindor boys and on the new target mudblood granger it had just occurred to her in herbology and of course she had to tell her sister andromeda had a way of finding all the technicalities of their plans and together they fixed them with ease up narcissa ordered tugging on her little sister sleeve andromeda was sitting with darien parkinson and having a good time while doing so narcissa knew her sister was bothered by her interruption but this was too important look i apologize but this is important i ll make it up to you narcissa promised the couple frowned at her you know i will andy dont call me that andromeda snapped slowly she got up and darien arm dropped from her shoulders i ll see you around yes you will he said with a wink after the boy left the black sisters went upstairs no up here narcissa said proceeding farther up the staircase past the normal dormitories but there nothing up here andromeda said look cissa you re going crazy basilicus narcissa murmured aiming her wand a door slowly appeared on the wall slowly becoming visible on the dark stony walls the black frame was soon solid and its only d cor was a serpentine handle made from pure silver twisting it the eldest black tossed her sister in and shut the door behind her andromeda stared around in wonder elegant things lined each surface of the room silver adorning everything the room was dark but voluminous silky opulent curtains fluttered by french doors and bookcases lined the walls too much to take in not seeing even a fraction of the beauty andromeda turned to her sister gaping like a fish it lucius private room narcissa explained dryly knowing what her sister was about to demand how they re the malfoys dontforget narcissa pointed out but but no time for that now narcissa said hastily listen i was thinking we promised revenge on those gryffindors right her little sister nodded obediently well i ve thought of something perfect to do it easy we can do it soon and i dontthink there will be many things to worry about we have an inside force so it make our job even easier what re you talking about andromeda asked suspiciously narcissa smirked her eyes gleaming in the darkness around them hostage what andromeda cried you that illegal narcissa we ve done it before she said pouting a little and crossing her arms over her chest it was so easily done we can t it insane andromeda protested narcissa opened her mouth to retort but there was an abrupt noise to their right turning to look lucius came out of a bathroom steam following him in heavy clouds andromeda upon sight of seeing a naked muscular malfoy with nothing more than a towel around his hips fell straight to the floor in a dead faint i think my sister fancies you a tad narcissa sighed lucius approached her grinning deviously who doesn t x x x hermione twisted her hands around anxiously the silence in the room filling her with a fluttery feeling one she couldntdecipher to be good or bad she stared into the fire her brow creased and deep her breathing was shallow and her hands shook she hadntfelt this kind of nervousness in a while too long she mused faintly how remus voiced quietly she did not flinch at the sudden noise or look at him nor did she show signs of even hearing him speak however remus remained silent feeling similar to how she did your christmas present she whispered after a long silence the crackling of the fire the only noise remus gave her an odd look at the same time digging around in his cloak for the book she was talking about this he inquired holding up the little book she turned and stared it her eyes hard but feeble she nodded can i see it he handed it to her and hermione slowly directed herself to a most familiar place thirteen pages in upon seeing the latin she closed her eyes and felt like crying shoving the book away she cupped her face pulling at her hair and wishing she could just make everything stop devastation filled every crevice of her mind and soul the feeling that she would never go home never leave this hell brimming inside of her drowning the little sanctuary she had left somewhere deep inside of her it had already been set in motion it had already been completed and now there was no way for her to end it except live it jane erm hermione remus said awkwardly what wrong please you wouldntget it remus she sniffed forcing herself to suppress the tears that were slowly suffocating her sanity explain it to me then he said firmly she looked at him an enormous sadness resting on her shoulders the nostalgia now unbearable more than ever when did you create or discover the time charm you applied to page 13 she asked quietly subtly creating a diversion the same day we found you he answered we were in the library putting the last minute touches on it well i was the rest of the marauders were being idiots he intoned dryly she nodded but there was an imperfection in the story then how if i got you the book and gave it to you for christmas how why did i come so early she breathed unaware that remus was listening to her intently she stood and started thinking her mind thrusting itself forward plunging into the logic that was hermione granger the charm was applied to the book but the book was after i came but you made the charm the same day i came there got to be a misconception in the book then perhaps 18 years and so many days but why why that in the first place hermione spun around and looked at remus searchingly there something wrong with this give me the book again she told him puzzled at her words of reasoning he handed the book to her again she flipped to page thirteen and looked at it very closely suddenly she saw what was wrong slowly she pulled on the page using the utmost care not to rip it holding the sheet in her hand she saw it was a piece of parchment cut down and folded at the edge remus did you glue this page into the book or something hermione questioned examining the parchment edges and transparency watching her hold the paper up to the light he nodded it took james forever to get it to stay i made him do it because i was too busy he explained so you didntcreate a time charm in this book you made it on parchment and pasted it into the book she confirmed well not pasted but it still not an original page from this she asked giving the small book a rattle remus nodded and another knot of tension loosened in her chest that how you traveled here wasntit he whispered eyes wide with comprehension she nodded at him the smile on her face holding no happiness it my fault no dontthink that remus she urged her expression fading into worry it if hadntbeen me it would ve been har one of my friends and that that would not have been good she said and felt a cruel sort of humor at the unimaginable image of harry stumbling into his parents and facing all the tragedy all over again ashamed at even thinking that she allowed herself to be disgusted at her own cold thoughts but it true he realized the bitter epiphany like a slap in the face if it hadntbeen for me making that stupid charm remus stop hermione said sternly it not your fault yes it is he roared flying to his feet and kicking at the table viciously all the torment you went through is my fault hermione flinched back in surprised as he screamed lashing out at the furniture around him his yelling raw and strained reverberated through the room she slowly sat down on the couch the weight of his self anger digging into her heart she tried not to feel so affected by his bitter anger but the strenuous journey she had been put through she hated to think it hated to even think about thinking it she confessed her love for him it had been mutual and it was all she would ever need but all of it was because of him remus had quieted down eventually but she never heard him give up shaking in resentment sobbing harder than she ever had so hard that it hurt her whole chest to keep in the noise and so hard that it hurt her throat to cry out she could do nothing to stop the dam from breaking she couldntbe her own little dutch boy keeping herself safe by stemming the leak of her vulnerability she immediately took comfort in his arms as he offered his embrace he couldnteven face himself right now hating to look at anything that could ve reminded him of him straining his jaw he calmed himself and focused on jane hermione just her holding her soothingly he tried to ignore the incessant pestering awareness in his mind that she was crying because she agreed with him they both knew the charm was his fault and nothing anyone said was going to change that he couldntthink of anything to say to her and she couldntforce herself to argue with his claim they were both miserable tangled in the sharp pain they had both come to familiarize themselves with remus was not only a werewolf but the bringer of pain to him and to others and hermione well she was just the center of it at the moment the impetus to the vicious events taking place before them and the ones that would soon stand in their path but only at that moment could they push everything away finding solace in one another they blamed themselves and each other but found no guilt in doing so after all it was just the truth x x x this is insane and that something i do not say sirius hissed looking down at the marauder map lily rolled her eyes at him and pushed him further down the hallway now a saturday the marauders had split up each drawn to their own activities everyone had noticed the tension between remus and jane but now it was different better almost they were not uncomfortable around each other but instead anxious about something twitchy for lack of a better adjective for they never stopped moving when they were in the same room james and remus were at the library and lily knew for a fact that they were discussing jane or rather granger she didntwant to stick her nose into that just yet first she had someone to convince and sirius being sirius it wouldntbe that hard but she needed to show him proof she down the next corridor lily pointed out her finger on the map hovering over emma name look who she with does that not say enough shut it evans sirius snapped and lily arched a reproachful eyebrow at him they ve got to be bullying her or something well think what you want black lily sneered and sirius shot her a cold look just make sure that when we peek around the corner you dontgo screaming for her got it got it he grumbled they continued on moving slower and watching the map very closely as they went they passed a broom closet and finally came to a stop right at the corner now look and be discreet she instructed he looked at her strangely that means dontbe obvious i know what it means he said haughtily okay lily agreed sarcastically sighing sirius looked around the corner showing only one of his eyes as he observed the group eyes narrowed he watched emma from behind her gestures large and her voice soft slytherins stood around her grinning some laughing quieting down a girl he recognized as rose sanders stepped forward we need to move this to an empty room i ve got something to discuss and privacy is mandatory nodding the group followed rose down the hallway moving away from sirius and lily slipping back around the corner he tried to take the map from lily who was reading it closely gimme he whined quiet i trying to memorize the names of these losers she muttered i know all of them except for one who sirius asked someone named parkinson she replied frowning in thought uhh darien parkinson sirius said his tone mocking lily forgetfulness no he was there but there was another it was a girl she said still thinking hard ring any bells sirius shook his head come to think of it you got bells in that head of yours yes i do sirius sniffed lily laughed and tugged at his elbow as she closed the map we cantmiss this conversation come on tiptoeing down the hallway the two of them approached the empty classroom the slytherins had filed into staying away from the door but close enough to hear so this should be easy we have emma as our personal insider and another to back her up should she need help all of you make sure you re in the woods by four o clock or you ll get it rose said darkly this is one of our only opportunities left since school is ending quickly we have a month and a half to uncover mudblood granger so make sure you contribute understood there were mutterings of agreements good meeting concluded you can go there was laughing and the scuffling of feet could be heard before the door opened with a loud creak that echoed the silent hallway lily realized with a gasp what was going on run she hissed lily grabbed an oblivious sirius by the hand and sprinted down the hallway rushing as fast as they could before any of the slytherins saw them hey it was too late someone had seen them round the corner lily stopped abruptly slamming to a halt and sirius rammed into her grabbing the handle of the broom closet lily opened it and jumped in pulling sirius in with her the word had spread quickly that someone traitors had eavesdropped the group was scattered in the hallway arguing and rose pushed through them furious that they had been caught shoving people out of the way she approached the broom closet they couldnthave gone anywhere else they re in here the group gathered and tightening they all watched curiously the door opened several people gasped but emma shriek was heard above them all lily evans and sirius black were snogging profusely their hair wild and their clothes wrinkled and unbuttoned they broke apart at once and stared up at the observers stilling holding each other close u uhm sirius stuttered smiling nervously hi sirius black emma started screaming incoherent words cursing him into oblivion several people clamped their hands over their ears at her incredibly high sharp voice including sirius and lily after she quieted the two gryffindors looked at the silent hysterical girl how could you do this sirius she whispered tears now streaming down her cheeks it was almost as if there were no slytherins behind her no vengeful throng of evil doing teenagers staring at her watching her hysterics fade into misery and you emma spat turning hateful eyes to lily who cringed you were my best friend she spat now you re nothing more than a stupid little mudblood lily snarled in fury and sirius grabbed her to restrain her from attacking if the redhead managed to start a fight she would be badly injured before it was broken up tears dripping from her gleaming dangerous eyes she stepped forward and slammed the door with all of her might enclosing sirius and lily into a ringing darkness there were several minutes of awkward silence before lily spoke positive that the group had left wonderful she muttered why did you have to there was no other decent excuse for us being in a broom closet lily sirius cried you think i wanted to despite the darkness sirius knew she gave him a cynical look okay that beside the point let me rephrase that do you think i want to kiss my best mate girl huh still glaring at you lily sang sirius let out a huff whatever right now we need to find our friends and explain to them what happened before they find out through the grape vine he decided calmly yeah i think you re right lily mumbled let get out of here check the map first sirius ignited his wand and checked several corridors clear he informed her sighing they slowly got out of the closet and went back to the gryffindor common room it was a tense walk and not a word was exchanged between them getting to the portrait lily supplied the password and braced herself no one said a thing to them instead students and friends shook their heads glared muttered words of disappointment and lily felt humiliated sirius bolted to the boy dormitory and lily slowly ascended her to respectable dorm however upon entering it looked as if a tornado had destroyed everything specifically lily things staring down in disbelief lily poked through all her tattered ripped things that she had loved so much books clothes parchment pictures emma x x x whoa sorry sirius apologized at once backing out of the room before he could get a good look of the couple getting friendly with each other wait a second remus and jane were now on opposite sides of the room looking so innocent that the guilt of their actions was obvious sirius grinned slowly pointing at them each in turn he shut the door and smirked at them hands on his waist well you two are something else sirius said chuckling all this time i thought you hated each other well well this is rather amusing dont get any ideas sirius remus warned you mean like i wasntthe only one getting action today he retorted and laughed you two ahh makes me laugh huh i didntthink emma would let you anywhere near her hermione said frowning sirius chuckled uncomfortably and rubbed the back of his neck funny thing about that she destroyed everything lily came storming through the door her face twisted up in anger as red as her hair i cannot believe that stupid bitch relax lily you can fix it you fix everything else anyway sirius muttered snidely lily bellowed and lunged at sirius taking him down immediately kneeling over him she grabbed him by the neck and started shaking him this is your fault she shrieked if you had just believed me in the first place she wouldnthave destroyed everything remus and hermione slowly backed away from the couple on the floor quite scared and confused you and your stupid ideas lily screamed sirius whimpered and tried to push her off but he could barely get a strong enough grip on her waist to topple her get off sirius yelled lily growled at him and swung her fist back ready to punch him sirius grabbed her free supporting hand out from underneath her and she fell onto his chest sirius seizing her before she could hit him again it was that inopportune moment that james chose to walk through the door peter in tow the two animated boys stopped talking stunned at the sight before them sirius who had been trying to shove lily off appeared to be holding her against him his hand was low on her waist the other on her arm she was on his chest lying on top of him their faces very close they broke apart immediately and lily was up in an instant anger replaced by panic james you have to believe we were joking about it james whispered his expression stunned and his face white his shocked face silenced lily immediately he barely moved his lips as he spoke wormtail and i heard about it and we thought what a laugh but this why how prongs she my bloody girlfriend sirius james exploded suddenly a vein throbbing in his neck peter squealed and ran inside for cover inconspicuously shutting the door to keep their argument unheard james sirius yelled you have to let us explain no you son of a we saw the whole thing hermione who had snuck back to remus side shouted suddenly the entire group turned and looked at them at once and hermione felt very nervous sirius was talking to us and then lily came in and she was furious emma did something to her stuff and and she was fighting with sirius not not doing that she explained her words getting firmer by the second she cast a glance at peter and saw that he looked quite uninformed as the rest of them perhaps he had no idea about this whole thing calming almost immediately james took a shaky breath and looked at lily scared and defenseless she could do nothing but look hopefully at him yet the trepidation in her eyes was evident he reached forward and took her hands his own shaking she flew into his arms at once and he held her so tightly it was almost as if she had died and come alive again and this was his only chance to ever hold her before she left once more she pressed her face into his shoulder and there was another moment of unity where no one else in the room matter before james allowed himself to put her down explain please james requested quietly lily took his hand squeezing it and at the same time she and sirius shared an awkward look i needed to convince sirius completely that emma has been the one contributing to the slytherins lily started nervously so we followed them up by the astronomy tower and they went into a room to talk about something them as in whom james asked lily shook her head and muttered under her breath a group of slytherins called the illimni and there were about 15 of them i suppose no one noticed hermione clap her hand over her mouth in shock except remus anyway we overheard them talking about lily stopped and uncomfortably looked at hermione jane they said something about her no they said something about someone named granger sirius corrected oblivious to lily deliberate name switch the group turned and looked at jane she slowly stumbled back on the bed leaning over her knees with her head in her hands ignoring sirius lily continued and they started to leave and we were right outside the door we ran but someone saw us so we jumped inside the broom closet and sirius made the very good point that the only excuse worthy enough for being inside a broom closet was snogging and that was how they found us lily mumbled mortified james nodded his face calm but his eyes hard alright i understand and i have no reason to doubt either one of you so despite how much this is bothering me i going to believe you james spoke his voice strained i would never sirius said softly james nodded but did not meet his eyes sirius shot lily a helpless look and she shrugged well this is uncomfortable peter commented after a few minutes of stiff silence sirius chuckled but no one else did i know something that will take our minds off this horrible situation sirius said brightly no sirius remus blurted mooney and jane are together again everyone turned and looked at said couple remus was gaping and no one could see jane face she was doubled over with her face in her hands clutching her unruly locks tightly in her fingers thanks padfoot remus snapped now could you guys just get out they all exchanged looks and soon they shuffled out once peter had quietly closed the door behind him remus moved to hermione quickly look sirius is just an idiot go find him remus hermione said sounding as if she had a bad head cold go to him explain it to him and make sure he not in his stupid mode when you explain it alright he nodded while you re at it just tell them all bring them all back here but donttalk to me please she whispered she brought her legs up onto remus bed and hugged a pillow to her chest just pretend that i not here and speak as freely as you want i couldn t he protested gently sitting by her side he hesitantly touched her cheek do it please just get it over with they wonteven know i here tell them i went to the hospital wing she told him sounding determined after a moment where he was lost in her eyes filled with tired acceptance he nodded he stood went around to james trunk and fished out his invisibility cloak he lifted it up and placed it over her body smiling faintly at him she took the corner and pulled it over her head disappearing from sight only for you he whispered and the meaning was not lost on her sighing remus left the room and went to seek out his friends finally able to

acceptance he nodded he stood went around to james trunk and fished out his invisibility cloak he lifted it up and placed it over her body smiling faintly at him she took the corner and pulled it over her head disappearing from sight only for you he whispered and the meaning was not lost on her sighing remus left the room and went to seek out his friends finally able to explain the chaotic web of lies and distorted truths that had captured them all using the map remus was able to hunt down all of his friends quite easily finding them in the kitchens he tickled the pear and surprised them momentarily where your girlfriend mooney sirius slurred through a mouth full of ice cream scooping more of the melting desert in his mouth remus wrinkled his nose i brought her to the hospital wing so she could get some calming draught remus lied easily they all grinned at remus knowing that he had not denied sirius claim and therefore was acknowledging the truth remus sat down beside peter with a sigh pulling a bowl of ice cream towards him no chocolate he observed sirius ate it peter informed him the black grinned sheepishly to remus annoyed look so lily asked swiveling around the melting desert in her bowl why didntyou stay down there with her i wanted to talk to you guys he said slowly some enlightenment on current events would be appreciated would it not did she say you could lily asked seriously remus shook his head she wontbe mad though she knew that you were all bound to find out one way or another remus explained somewhat grimly however i think we need to go back to the dormitory the castle walls have many ears sirius and james looked around in mock curiosity and lily rolled her eyes at their fake idiocy fine we are in slytherin territory anyway exactly remus agreed it took them twice as long to get back to the gryffindor common rooms as it did for remus to find them it was thoroughly annoying having james and sirius prancing around like fools while each moment remus grew more and more anxious jane hermione he corrected himself quickly was hidden away in their dormitory if by any chance someone discovered her just lying under an invisibility cloak on remus bed nonetheless it would lead to some sticky questions finally they all filed in remus leading them he cautiously sat around on his own bed feeling around for hermione very discreetly so that he wouldntsit on her lily eventually closed the door and crossed her arms over her chest looking impatient so what did she tell you that we dontalready know lily asked briskly she looked like an entrepreneur dealing with business that kept her up late at night searching for an answer to the problems james and sirius were quiet peter was staring at the ground shuffling his feet remus observed them all silently for a moment feeling the heavy weight of hermione distress falling upon his shoulders well as you said before lily jane lewis isntreal he started slowly very aware that hermione was listening to his words he looked around at his friends i found out after some investigation and interrogation that she is in fact hermione granger so that her first name lily mused nodding i mean h granger could ve been hector dagworth granger who peter asked founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers remus supplied offhandedly do you know her middle name remus lily inquired her initials could be hdg she suggested then that would make her a man sirius piped up having the same initials as that potioneer guy they fell silent and looked to remus who shrugged i not really sure what her middle name is but he stopped after a moment examining the possibility of something he happened to notice i think it jane jane james repeated confused do explain yourself mr mooney well maybe she was in a haste to create a name and using your middle name is quite clever because who ever wants to use it perhaps that why remus suggested although i not sure at all so what does any of this mean sirius asked bemused i think i the one who been neglected here none of you seem surprised but i completely in the dark think sirius lily urged taking the lead where have you heard the name granger before sirius and lily looked at each other and his gaze was hard searching before he realized no he gasped understanding lily nodded sadly so emma and those damned slytherins are all plotting against jane dont forget about the trouble with malfoy james added gravely sirius was quiet as he calculated all this stunning information trying to comprehend the danger that was around them malfoy wanted her then and not just in bed he wanted information from of her sirius concluded thinking harder with each moment when she found some way to steer clear of him and get protection that even he couldntbreak he recruited other means to corner her yes remus said sadly understanding the wretched life that hermione had had to live with so far but i know why he doing it i do too james interjected she told me once that she knew everything about everybody and none of it was gossip she knew every secret every hidden thing everything she knew remus was a werewolf all this time she knew that lily hated me before this year that we were all illegal animagi she had information and malfoy wanted it but that doesntexplain how sirius mused stroking his jaw in thought james was proud that his best mate was displaying his intellect true sirius black could be the biggest idiot in the world but he wasntthe stupidest he could be smart when the time called for it i know how remus whispered well aware that now all eyes were on his unwavering and intense he took a deep breath to shake the tremble out of his hands i brought her here she from the future a long pregnant pause followed his confession and remus felt as if he were high on some type of drug a strong one and experiencing a trip that was caught between terrifying and interesting he stopped breathing only looking around in search of some sort of response from his friends but none came he almost expected them to start howling with laughter but none of them did he stared around at them observing how they were all clutching something as if their life depended on it as if they were going to fall off the face of the earth into a swallowing blackness that would cut off their breath he wanted something from them now in return for revealing a terrible secret that insane lily uttered after blinking several times her voice was strained and fluttery but it possible we were at the library that day prongs way back when before hermione showed up remember how you guys were just joking around and i was doing immense research well i created a time charm and applied it to paper that same day later you pasted it in the book hermione gave me for christmas when she read it in her time she read the page that had the time charm on it and was thrown back to the day i created it remus explained carefully that impossible james said in a hushed voice but it true peter murmured in a small voice she came from 1998 how remus was totally floored that peter knew the mousy gryffindor shrugged looking upset i overheard some slytherins talking the illimni they know all about hermione granger and they have information on her a lot of information they knew shortly after she got here and lucius malfoy took the lead to exploit her secret she had no where to go and no one to turn to peter muttered staring at the ground as if he wanted to burn a hole through it lily moved toward him slowly peter how did you know this wormtail james asked softly sounding concerned remus was glued to his bed feeling hermione tense up beside him under the invisibility cloak peter slumped against the wall and turned his face away lily knew automatically that something was wrong terribly wrong and so did james the marauders rushed to his side moved by their friend behavior my mother was murdered peter told them finally his voice weak and trembling he looked up towards them with shining eyes murdered he let out a tight noise sliding to the ground as he sobbed into his arms muffling the noise finally admitting the terrible event to his friends when he had shunned their help before there were several minutes of condolence and murmurs of sympathy before remus spoke again how does that have to do with hermione remus lily snarled looking furious how can you be so mean give him some peace no no it alright peter sniffed pushing lily away she scowled how did this happen peter lily asked gently he wiped his eyes hastily his fingers still quivering it was reported as an accident but i know that wasntit he whimpered fighting the sadness that was creeping over him he coughed a few times and looked to remus i ve just been locking myself up in places were no one goes closets the vanishing cabinet old passageways no one has ever found me he explained in a tired voice but people come near me all the time and it frequently the illimni they have meetings close to me and i hear almost everything they say we have to tell dumbledore sirius declared suddenly this is too risky and we canthandle this alone no remus protested sharply knowing that hermione wanted this to be anything but public wanting to desperately avoid that subject remus turned his attention on something he was still ignorant about do you know that the illimni is no idea peter said all i know is that it a bunch of slytherins mostly girls that have banded together to just be bitches i dontunderstand it one bit but they re united under something isnt malfoy in it though lily asked confused peter shook his head no but he does things for them at first he was dealing with hermione granger alone but then he wanted help and they provided it where he saw fit peter explained he evil this we know remus said darkly speaking of malfoy being evil has she told you yet remus james asked carefully i haventasked her remus whispered what happened now sirius inquired lily nodding in agreement james and remus exchanged an uncomfortable look padfoot you remember that night you me lily and jane were in the library sirius nodded only because it was the first and last time ever i was in there he said james glared at him padfoot you re in there all the time you liar james pointed out sirius shushed him actually you re right and i dontremember so be more specific it was a day or so after emma and jane had that fight in the great hall and after jane admitted to fancying me in front of everyone remus supplied growing red in the face sirius grinned in fact i do remember that day continue well after me and lily left and after you left jane to go be with emma jane was attacked james said slowly by malfoy lily suddenly understood what that meant and she blanched oh no she breathed in horror and james nodded remus told me what happened and it wasntpretty we re not entirely sure of the smallest details but james broke off before hesitantly telling the story it was brief and to the point but he explained what remus had told him and left them all in a shocked hanging silence did he lily struggled with herself still stunned at the retelling force her we dontknow james said quietly remus didntask and she didnttell you need to ask her as soon as you can sirius ordered remus his eyes hard this is getting out of hand and she got to tell someone look i donteven know the full story okay padfoot things are hard for her right now and i not troubling her even further by making her relive something so awful remus argued with a growl in his voice besides james started we have another problem too he reached into his pocket and revealed the picture of hermione and lucius still and colorless remus was the only one who seemed outraged grabbing the picture he stared at it feeling a torrent of untamable emotions that got the best of him who did this he roared emma sirius said coldly i caught her posting them late one night i took the rest down but they re still all over the school can teachers see them lily asked no peter answered they re posted in every common room and a charm was applied to them only students can see them and only purebloods can handle them why purebloods james asked because most of purebloods are in slytherin and therefore will only use that power for evil like they usually do peter said darkly muttering under his breath this is another trick of theirs sirius said it to cut off allies so she wonthave any friends this is almost an advantage to us if you think about it lily began slowly everyone thinks badly of hermione or rather jane lewis so no one will want to befriend her if we let people gossip like they gossip rumors about her will become so twisted they ll be far from any sort of truth and how is this good sirius asked yeah i am also missing the goodness of this situation james agreed lily sneered at him we re her allies and since she trusts all of us more than anyone anything she says to us wontbe known by anyone else and therefore we can keep any information hidden lily explained so that a grain of happiness in the misery she ll experience remus said bitterly sure she ll have us but if everyone thinks badly of her you know how cruel hogwarts can be especially the blokes in our year true lily agreed apprehensively but i dontknow how else to look at it what else can we do there was a long pause before sirius spoke we undermine them care to supply a brilliant plan remus asked dryly we already have a spy sirius said gesturing towards peter we use him to procure information to overcome them what if i dontwant to be the spy peter asked in a small voice then you wontbe lily comforted as sirius scowled how else can we do it he demanded dont forget that james has an invisibility cloak and the marauders map it wontbe that hard lily argued hotly you cant make peter do something he doesntwant to but wormtail is already doing so well sirius bickered lily narrowed her eyes how can you ask him to do this when he going through such a hard time she demanded lily and sirius began to quarrel loudly back and forth and in this time james went searching around for his invisibility cloak wanting it as soon as lily mentioned it remus grew nervous as james reached the bottom of his chest still not having found his treasured invisibility cloak the werewolf could hear his heart in his throat more loudly than lily and sirius screaming at each other where my cloak james asked himself quietly he looked up and locked eyes with remus who was slowly loosing the color in his face mooney where d you put my cloak james demanded somehow knowing his friend had taken it remus jaw tightened as james stood holding out his hand cloak mooney james ordered remus stared up at him silently wishing he could conceive a lie clever enough to get him out of this situation but his mind was shutting down in panic where is it he shouted lily and sirius quieted peter perked curiously at the tension nowhere remus croaked finally i donthave it it not in here he said quickly james narrowed his eyes and started scrutinizing remus things thoroughly without stopping to think remus shoved james as hard as he could away from his bed stop it he yelled panicking what would they do if they found hermione i told you i donthave it james growled and jumped forward the two boys were locked in a fight their arms tied around each other as they grappled for the upper hand sirius slyly snuck up behind them and started poking around remus things it took him only a moment to discover james invisibility cloak he grabbed a fistful of it and pulled in the same moment james bent remus over struggling to have him in a headlock and remus watched helplessly as sirius gathered up the cloak he went to scream in alarm but as soon as sirius snatched the cloak all eyes were on remus bed plain and simple remus halted his fighting and was still searching around the room with his eyes where the hell did hermione go james let him go and stared at him suspiciously taking his possession from sirius what were you hiding mooney he asked nothing remus answered quickly and the hastiness of his voice caught everyone attention james narrowed his eyes and remus wildly invented a lie i jane erm hermione birthday is coming up soon a and i was hiding her present and i thought if lily saw it she d go and tell hermione what it was lily made an indignant noise you re shit at lying mooney sirius said simply the werewolf turned sharply and threw a dirty look at sirius i not lying he stated firmly i serious mooney sirius said well thanks for clearing that up remus mocked deadpan sirius glared at him there no present on your bed mooney remus ignored that why so eager to avoid the subject remus james asked delicately taking a step closer as sirius did remus felt distinctly as if he was being purposely caged in and he didntlike that err lily a little help here remus asked nervously i kind of curious too remus she admitted what were you hiding all eyes were on him and he felt as if they were drowning him in guilt he didntknow what to do except step back away from them for each step they took towards him suddenly hermione appeared across the room remus stared at her in shock but she moved swiftly and silently towards the door the opening door caught peter eye and his jaw dropped as he spied hermione she put a finger to her lips and escaped unnoticed peter was gaping like a fish overcome with relief remus pushed past them and ran out the door after his girlfriend james lily and sirius were left confused facing a disbelieving peter who looked like a goldfish nobody seemed to know what was going on anymore x x x despite the alarming large amount of homework she had remus managed to persuade hermione to accompany him to hogsmeade with the rest of the group the homework the teachers were piling on for the n e w t was creating many sleep deprived students including hermione hey remus said falling back behind the group of laughing marauders to talk to hermione she seemed to be in no hurry and he soon was walking in time with her hi she replied quietly she smiled at him and he returned it silently he took her hand after a moment and they laced their fingers together it was quiet for a long time remus was perfectly content with just walking with her but then something began to nag at him the air around them was tenser than it should ve been and he knew something was wrong what wrong he asked before he could think about his conclusion hermione shook her head but he felt her knuckles tighten hermione nothing she choked he immediately stopped moving in front of her trying to look into her eyes and determine what the hell was going on but she refused to let him remus i fine stop it she protested trying to maneuver her way around him tell me he demanded sternly she looked up at him finally and a tear fell from her cheek wiping it away in frustration she told him sirius was able to figure it all out about malfoy in a matter of minutes sirius how much longer did it take me weeks months she asked herself angrily how can i be so foolish remus she whispered you re not stupid he argued gently touching her arm fondly starting to walk again a lot was going on and it doesntmatter how long it took you you ve figured it out now and that all that matters eyes shining she stared back at him dont lie she whispered and tried to suppress the trembling of her lip i ve been more foolish than i have in my entire life and i dontknow why hermione no you re not stupid remus protested taking her hand again you re smarter than lily she shook her head and laughed hollowly i not talking about books anymore she murmured she smiled somewhat sadly and looked back up at him every since i met you i ve just been a mess remus was taken aback i m not really sure how to respond to that he said slowly she smiled reminiscing you messed up my head and made me doubt myself and confused me more than she trailed off and gazed into space more than ron it was a weird realization but hermione suddenly knew it was true ron was remus except simpler and red headed he liked sports rather than books and liked hermione for her and not just her intellect she loved him for that in fact she loved both of them for liking her at all she was hard to accept and she knew that she was odd pushy and a show off but granted she could never do that before hogwarts is he one of your mates from home remus asked quietly she nodded then sighed but i like you better if that any consolidation he more of a james well no a sirius too she said and grinned at remus laughter he likes food and quidditch incredibly so in fact his room has posters of the chudley cannons all over and it is so bright did you love him remus asked quietly reaching his hand up around her waist she thought for a moment before pulling remus closer and resting her head on his shoulder yeah she responded i did love him but it wasntlove at first sight like it was with you remus i treasure that more why was she telling him this did it even matter to him hermione was sort of rambling on about love and remus and ron and it was all just a handful of confusing emotions thrown into a bowl and mixed together before she could get the correct measurements she was having a tough life and she was allowed to ramble she was allowed to love hell she could do whatever she wanted remus said nothing but simply looked at her she stopped pulling him to a halt and took his face in her hands and kissed him hard he was taken by surprise for a moment but without another moment to spare he twined his hands through her hand and pulled her close their breath becoming one their souls merging hey lovebirds get a room james jeered cackling hermione and remus broke apart after a moment grinning sheepishly c mon remus murmured gazing at her she smiled faintly but he could see the mesmerized look in her eyes he pulled her along to catch up to the group placing a hand around her waist again sooo sirius sang where to first three broomsticks lily suggested eagerly quidditch store peter added quickly zonko s james and sirius cried hooking arms and dancing bookstore hermione asked remus he grinned and nodded james stopped the group and put on a fake mask of concentration arr we be splitting up he growled in a raspy voice imitating a pirate the group exchanged looks and nodded sirius was dancing in his spot ecstatic that they were going to zonko s lily cant go alone savvy james said seriously adopting his normal tone potter i not a child i can handle a butterbeer quite nicely thanks lily sniffed i ll just join up with remus and jan hermione sorry at the bookstore afterwards err actually everyone can just keep calling me jane hermione said quietly in the awkward silence that followed her request they all nodded glancing at each other yeah james said slowly still feeling awkward so let go then sirius cheered and grabbed james by the collar flying faster than the wind the two of them sprinted towards the joke shop lily sighed and left peter gave a little wave and headed in the opposite direction hermione and remus looked at each other and smiled knowing that they were not going to the bookshop at all strolling slowly hermione asked so where would be the best place to go uninterrupted remus shrugged well madam puddifoot always have snogging couples year round so it d be nothing new i like peace and quiet how about the shrieking shack she suggested and he grinned at her insinuation what if people hear shrieking he inquired smirking she laughed and hit him on the arm i wontbe scared that for sure she answered he chuckled and threw an arm around her fondly and together they walked down the street admiring the mild breeze and the perfect weather x x x lily slapped down two knuts on the bar and took her butterbeer i should ve just gone with james she mused i look like such a fool in here by myself still though she sat down at an empty table facing the window she absent mindedly sipped her butterbeer thinking about recent events this whole conception of jane lewis being someone else someone from the future was mind boggling the knowledge that hermione was faced with and tortured with each and every day was too difficult for lily to understand and that was saying something lily understood mostly everything but how had the slytherins come to pursue her who was the one that knew that hermione had precious information that could determine the outcome between major things life death war anything anything that tampered with this knowledge or anything that got in the way would surely change the future forever and no mistake can be undone but then how can it be a mistake lily mused tracing the rim of her bottle the law of time is confusing no one is allowed to go back and meddle because they d end up killing themselves or something but then if you see yourself and kill yourself that traveled from the past how is the original person still alive it was baffling and terribly difficult to understand there is a fate for us all and each step we take is predetermined so how can we change that lily huffed at the difficult concept but was determined to unlock the enigma she faced grabbing parchment from her bag she jotted down notes and drew diagrams to help understand the paradox that was time travel she chewed on her quill and tried thinking outside the box kept thinking as logically as possible and even writing her mutterings down but nothing worked maybe it my beliefs she thought nodding i believe in fate so maybe i cantunderstand it like that pushing aside her ideas about destiny she attempted to understand it once again still nothing worked frustrated lily slammed down her quill and took a large swig of her drink great she thought sarcastically now it cold she pushed it aside and stared angrily down at her diagrams brainstorming how about an example she thought smiling faintly she flipped her parchment to the blank side and started drawing i need a situation hermione and remus perfect excited lily drew a few little stick figures and labeled them with initials hermione1 is from the future before she traveled into the past remus1 is from now before hermione came hermione2 is the hermione that is now here in the past and remus2 is remus of the future affected by hermione2 that traveled into the past lily hand flourished with ideas as her quill danced across the paper filling in little ideas and notes about her stick figures she sketched in circles and curves lines and squares that connected things and diagram boxes that referred to another idea that was relevant satisfied lily crossed her arms and examined her work pondering the possibilities of this explanation but then another thought crossed her mind what if hermione2 was pregnant with remus2 child but had not given birth yet would that mean that hermione2 would go back to her own time with a huge belly or would that mean that hermione1 was supposed to already be pregnant but then as she became hermione2 she would be pregnant even before she and remus were intimate oi this is hurting my head enough of that she muttered i cantgrasp head nor tail of time travel maybe hermione could actually explain it to me sighing lily checked her watch wondering if it was too early to crash remus and hermione bookshop date she snorted at the idea it was only quarter to four and lily decided to wait a little while longer shoving her parchment about time into her bag she clutched her cold butterbeer and drank it slowly anyway quarter to four four o clock make sure you re in the woods by four o clock or you ll get it we only have a month and a half to uncover mudblood granger oh shit lily gasped starting up in a panic she jumped out of her chair and dashed out of the three broomsticks into the freezing cold clouds had gathered and looked ominous still nothing was going to stop lily from helping hermione pulling out her wand with haste she rounded a corner and ran as fast as she could up the street searching for anyone that knew what was going on that could come to her aid running into zonko s lily ran up to the counter and crashed into it james potter she gasped the cashier gave her an odd look was he here left ten minutes ago the boy informed her the redhead swore under her breath and raced back out of the store running for the bookstore doing the very same thing she did at the bookstore lily slammed into the counter and demanded of the cashier if remus lupin had been into the store yet not today the lady informed her damn you lily yelled her heart faint she turned and jogged towards the exit panting slowing down before the door she thought if remus is with hermione she should be safe and occupied lily thought with a grimace but then where are they if they arentin there she pressed up against the bay windows and stared out into the cold that seemed to be lifting students were filing out again and things were busy and business was fruitful just before looking away a group caught lily eye slytherins huddled by the corner of a building up the street were talking in a tightly knit group lily spotted lucius malfoy automatically his platinum hair giving him away at once i have to follow them and warn someone she thought grimly pulling her hood up tightly around her hair she slowly exited the bookshop following the group of purebloods as they left to congregate elsewhere it was easy to trail behind them a good few meters or so as everyone was now out and about as the weather swung back favorably she looked like another person going to another shop just like everyone else but as they neared the forest it was becoming harder and harder to remain inconspicuous more than once people glanced back and lily was quick to look down or fiddle with her shoe laces or dig inside her bag but she knew that wasntenough deciding she was too close she entered the last shop before the trail to the shrieking shack as one member of the group looked at her she waited just a few seconds before pressing up against the glass and watching them trot away trying to think like sherlock holmes she discreetly left the shop and ambled around near the one across the street watching them disappear from sight the slytherins were now dispersed and broken up traveling in small groups or pairs instead of one crowd as they headed towards the woods feeling nauseated lily followed them keeping to the edge of the forest wanting to immediately hide behind any tree if someone were to turn around to see her she kept low and off of the path keeping close but just out of sight lily chased after them moving as quickly as she dared they rounded the last bend and being far behind them she had to stalk them faster or else faced loosing them jumping into the path she clutched her wand tighter and darted around the corner she halted with confusion almost immediately and stared around there was no one all of the people she had been following the slytherins who were conspiring against hermione were gone where did they go she asked herself wide eyed and desperately confused turning on her heel she knew it would be best if she found more help instead of entering the woods however she was no more than a step in the opposite direction before fear overcame her and a scream burst from her throat x x x the shrieking shack was dank and slowly rotting away dust floated through the air the boards creaked and moths had eaten most of the furniture still neither remus nor hermione paid any attention to that lying atop cloaks and vests the couple was heatedly kissing their shirts undone and hair askew they were engrossed in each other interlocked in each others hands and embrace there was not a moment where either of them lay still arching caressing gliding hands the heat between them was fierce hermione had never felt like this before had never felt so wanted when she had this chance to be with him alone and passionate she had never expected this to be the outcome his adroitness was not the source of her pleasure but instead the bliss that was soaring through her because she was with him each sliver of skin that he touched made her shiver with relief each shard of a moan that rose up in her throat quick to be suppressed by gasping and his own fervent kissing caused her heart to augment in joy pressed up against him shuddering with pleasure each time he shifted she did each time he ran a hand down her back or inched her fingers up her shirt her movements were the same causing them to appear as one their bodies moved in an undeniable rhythm shifting up and to the side down and forwards until the movement was so perfect it seemed to be a movie on repeat he cradled her in his arms kissing her neck as she pulled him closer fingers automatically running through his hair grasping his neck to encourage the heat he was creating and gliding her hands over his shoulders and chest she angled her body to match his like placing a puzzle piece with its partner she groaned with pleasure as he slid his hands down her sides slow to move from her waist and hips wanting more wanting anything to feed this fire inside of her she took her shirt by the shoulders and tugged the material off of her heated torso remus stopped for a moment propping himself up on his elbow to stare down at her it was not the sight of her nearly bare body that mesmerized him but the desire within her eyes the passionate mixture of lust and love that her irises expressed he smiled faintly and touched her cheek a knot tightening in the back of his throat that disallowed him from speaking or feeling he was numb with emotion something so indescribable he wouldntbe able to name it even if he cleared his mind he lowered himself slowly and tilted his lips to hers she put her fingertips to his mouth and stopped him letting her fingers run over his chapped powerful lips i took off something now so do you she told him softly smirking he grinned widely and started laughing kneeling over her almost straddling her he pulled off his shirt with one great thrust and hermione admired his bare upper half lean and imperfect scars were etched into his skin scars from claws and from teeth imprinted into his body forever still she felt a bubble of excitement burst inside of her propping herself up on her elbows she smiled at him her eyes full of desire he leaned down and pulled her mouth to his clutching her neck and waist running a hand over her naked waist and over her chest before grasping her head he smiled into her lips as they fell back against the floor enjoying the feel of her skin on his like souls rubbing up against each other a buzzing noise soon became apparent and at first neither of them noticed it hermione was kissing along his jaw grasping his hair and he was at her shoulder sliding the strap down her arm planting feathery kisses along the skin it passed wait she murmured finally they pulled apart and looked at each other listening and remus abruptly realized what the noise was rather angry at whoever was requesting to talk to him remus dug around in his cloak pocket for the mirror what he snapped as sirius face appeared opening his mouth to speak sirius looked at him closely frowning you re not wearing a shirt mooney and oh is that jane in the background with no shirt on remus hermione hissed shifting the werewolf turned so that his topless girlfriend was no longer in view what d you want padfoot i busy remus growled sirius frowned you re not at the bookstore prongs they arentat the bookstore sirius called over his shoulder gimme that james face appeared and glared at remus but his anger faded into confusion hey you arentwearing a shirt thanks we ve established that remus clipped now what is it have you seen lily james asked looking a tad bit worried we cantfind her no but i sure she s remus was silenced as a bloodcurdling scream shattered his sentence james eyes widened with horror and the mirror went dark remus twisted around to hermione who looked very pale c mon we have to get dressed and help her moving frantically the two of them dressed with haste pleasure replaced in their minds with apprehension pulling their cloaks over their uniforms remus took hermione by the hand as they hurried towards the fence of the shrieking shack anxious to find someone who might help them they stopped at the crest of the hill that overlooked the famous shack and waited for a moment in silence within minutes james and sirius came racing around the corner their cloaks billowing as they sprinted have you seen her at all since we split up james demanded of remus and the werewolf shook his head why didntyou go to the bookstore like you said rubbing her neck uncomfortably hermione said we didntthink it would be a problem if we just ventured off somewhere private sirius chortled quietly and hermione flushed okay well that fine except that we cantfind lily james roared where the hell could she be he glared around at each of them including sirius as if he could intimidate an answer out of them hermione hesitantly opened her mouth to suggest an idea but all thought escaped her mind as a hauntingly familiar whistle echoed from the forest the group turned towards the sound hermione blanched and started shaking flashes of memories burning into her eyelids oh no she moaned covering her face to hide her fear what what is it james demanded taking her by the shoulders and giving her a good shake she looked into his hazel eyes and saw how terrified he really was the slytherins have lily she whispered james let go of her his mouth open and trembling she clenched her jaw and nodded to his horrified denial looking at each of them she viciously shoved the fear out of her mind and led them up into the forest to where the slytherins had kept her captive wanting to push the craven feelings away and become the courageous gryffindor she was determined to be soon enough the four of them entered a small clearing that held a flock of slytherins green and silver displayed proudly and a single gryffindor that was held still with a wand against her throat lucius malfoy smirked as hermione led them down the path clutching remus hand her stomach lurched at the sight of malfoy and she was forced to relive random shards of the awful night he made her experience but the shield against him would do no good here not only would it be useless against his memory but if hermione were to will lucius away james would never get lily back let her go malfoy james snarled she didntdo anything malfoy lips curled into a twisted smile she a mudblood that crime enough he said calmly james twitched in fury and sirius kept a tight grip on his arm to hold him back however all four of them glared at malfoy as if they wanted to stab him to death and revive him just for the pleasure of murdering him a second time what do you want malfoy james growled trying to vainly shake free of sirius grasp the world seemed to come to a crashing ominous halt as lucius smiled maliciously and slowly pointed to hermione i want her x x x author notes does a little dance that was an awesome chapter i sorry but it

time what do you want malfoy james growled trying to vainly shake free of sirius grasp the world seemed to come to a crashing ominous halt as lucius smiled maliciously and pointed to hermione i want her her james spluttered throwing a fleeting glance at hermione who was clutching remus like the apocalypse was upon them what do you want with her prongs this is ridiculous remus snarled under his breath holding the trembling girl close we cant trade them he doesntwant anything else james whispered hysterically he gazed at lily worriedly but she seemed to be alright one of the slytherins in front of her was jeering at her and she kicked him between the legs smirking as he doubled over in pain you cannot be seriously thinking about trading them remus hissed we can take them on and get lily back without having to cause hermione any harm it jane remus hermione added quietly but there was panic lacing her voice if he finds out that you all know they wontlet lily go until she reveals information and then we re pressed with a decision she got a point sirius said without knowing it they had pulled into a little huddle and were conversing like a team setting out to discover the best attack on the field peter ask if he wants anything else peter suggested with a shrug james whipped around anything else malfoy just not her he spat lucius gave him a chilling smile i wontaccept what i did not ask for he drawled you know what i want hermione nerves were crackling with nervousness lily was about to be hurt because of her and they werentdoing anything about it hermione knew that she needed to be strong but doing that did not oblige her to step in for lily although she knew james wanted it they do need a spy hermione thought anxiously to herself and malfoy really cantdo anything else to me not since i ve got the charm but that just him she remembered the charm works against him only a and there are so many other people but i ve got to i cantlet this go on any longer if i dontshow him that i wontbe pushed around any longer then he ll never leave me alone she was so dazed and distraught that she hardly noticed james and remus snarling at each other like two hungry wolves over a small piece of meat before she could rethink before she could let anyone else protest even herself she slipped her hand out of remus and turned around to face the slytherins fine she said clearly and remus ranting came to a stuttering halt are you mad he shrieked promptly grabbing her and clutching her to his chest remus think about it she whispered james is right we can take them on and lily and i can get away before they know what happening and we can fight them no remus yelled and hermione winced i not letting you this is absurd you cantcontrol me remus she warned i doing this for all of us so dontyou dare try and stop me how can you put yourself in this much danger he whispered his eyes round please don t he murmured pleadingly we can find another way i ll trick him then she whispered putting her lips to his ear i ll hurt him and we can start a riot and we ll get away i know it no trust me she urged he looked very torn between the idea of her being safe and the idea of trusting her please his jaw clenched very tight his lips pressed together hard to stop their quivering he let go of her reluctantly she smiled sadly and turned to face the malfoy standing a little in front of the marauders she pointed a firm finger at lily let her go first she ordered lucius smirked and gestured towards the people that were holding her such a pretty little mudblood one of them cooed snidely and as james snarled lily kicked him in the shins bastard she spat twisting out of the slytherins grasp hermione watched as she pulled free glaring at malfoy hatefully before sprinting back over to james and into his arms lucius took a step towards hermione smiling darkly at her as he drew his wand hermione was poised though and a sly look crossed her face as she faced him i will him as far away as possible was the gleeful thought that flooded her mind and every nerve of her body before anyone could understand what was going on it appeared as if some unseen force had punched malfoy square in the stomach and sent him flying hundreds of feet backwards as lucius was yelling in fear the group of people in the clearing watched his flight in shock that was mingled with awe lucius landed with an audible noise and a painful groan echoed over the silent people hermione was broken out of her reverie of happiness joyous that she had successfully hurt lucius by wishing that she had taken the opportunity to run get her he snarled and as hermione clenched in fear the slytherins turned as one run hermione shrieked fleeing herself james grabbed lily and flung him over her shoulder and started sprinting sirius and peter close behind hermione raced towards them taking remus hand as he ran alongside her and they fled together suddenly hermione felt her ankles give out and with a cry she fell to the ground trip jinx she yelled and remus grabbed and arm and dragged her up and they ran harder than before but the fall was their downfall because in the next moment hermione was victim to locomotor mortis her muscles locking up and her knees buckling she dropped to the ground like a stone managing to turn face up finite remus supplied quickly impedimenta locomotor mortis densaugeo he shrieked sending down slytherins as they attacked petrificus totalus remus barely managed to shield himself of the jinx and helping hermione stand up she launched herself into attack mode confundus expelliarmus she screamed furiously turning this way and that she threw babbling charms and hexes jinxes and charms and managed to strip them of all their wands and consciousness petrificus totalus tarantallegra stupefy lucius hadntcaught up with the group and hermione was feeling invigorated and impulsive fire surged through her veins and all she wanted was the sweet taste of revenge by kicking his arse come on remus urged pulling her away by the wrist the marauders were waiting hesitantly a few meters away having seen hermione take the entire group down no she snarled struggling to rip her wrist away from remus i want to take him on too let see how powerful he is all alone she shouted bristling she felt as if she was facing draco malfoy and not his father she felt as if this was ron tugging on her sleeve and harry and ginny were waiting uncertainly a few paces away she felt as if he had called her a mudblood and her revenge was scaring the hell out of him but no matter how much she pretended lucius malfoy was much more dangerous than what she believed at that moment and remus knew that they all knew that he can hurt you remus reminded her quietly let just go logic crashed over her and fighting the bitter swell of acceptance that she was weak inside she turned and ran as fast as she could past the marauders who caught on and started following her silently moving swiftly she led them to the shrieking shack and into the tunnel this is a good ideal malfoy ll think that we ve gone out the regular path and cut through the woods to stop us remus pointed out and since everyone here knows about this tunnel and the shrieking shack it just makes our job easier right wasnt i right hermione asked him as they made it safely back to the castle watching as james was singing out happily twirling lily around in his arms and constantly kissing her giggling mouth hermione still felt twinges of adrenaline through her veins and remus sighed in defeat how could i not be scared though after everything that he done to you remus asked quietly taking her hand hermione stared into his ginger eyes and couldntfind the right words to say to him i dontknow why i did it remus she confessed in a low voice it was stupid but then again i ve not been myself lately remus tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and leaned down putting his forehead against hers dontdo it again he said with a crooked smile i dontwant him taking over another time hermione felt her insides twist up with something she couldntquite place whether it was at his words or the rush of affection she felt at his protective words she smiled up into his eyes wishing that it had always been like this wishing that she had never made the utterly foolish mistakes that she had before i wontlet him she promised in a whisper truly remus questioned and hermione nodded firmly then let go to dumbledore and have him expelled his words sent a wave crashing into her and her head jerked back away from his as she considered his suggestion expel lucius malfoy is that possible hermione wondered well yes yes it is despite the disbelief and doubt that had originally flooded her hermione felt like christmas had come early expel him they could expel him everything that he had ever done to her all the paranoia that had been haunting her the torment she had been putting herself through would now be faced with the ultimate revenge eradicating him i promised myself that i wontdo this any longer she thought firmly i not putting up with him he taking away all of my power and now i going to take away his she hadntfelt this happy in such a long time she bounced with euphoria into remus arms and embraced him kissing his cheeks as he spun her around she jumped down at last and feeling such a rush her face split into a wide grin yes yes let do it she cried and grabbed his hands and danced around remus started laughing wildly but it was nothing compared to hermione delirious mirth has she escaped the looney ward sirius whispered to peter who was standing nearby they were watching hermione bounce around uncontrollably beaming brighter than a beacon and happier than she had ever been before maybe mooney proposed to her peter suggested sirius seemed to consider this thought before he gasped wormtail oh me oh my mooney looney he rhymed and he and peter hooked arms and danced around imitating the other couple laughing merrily okay who got the chocolate james demanded angrily seeing the energy rush between his friends you know you ve got to share i have chocolate remus said pulling it out of his cloak but it a whole bar you never have a full bar james whispered excitedly remus shrugged what going on then remus had a brilliant idea hermione said and pulled james closer within seconds the whole group wanted to hear and they formed a little huddle let have malfoy expelled can we do that lily asked hermione nodded if we have incriminating evidence against him then yes we certainly can she said gleefully why haventyou thought of this before then sirius asked hermione her face fell instantaneously and remus shot sirius a dirty look i i dontknow actually she admitted in a small voice i ve been feeling rather powerless lately hermione distinctively cheerful aura suddenly diminished and everyone could see the confidence draining from her eyes we ll still do it lily piped up he done plenty and we ve got witnesses but lily peter started hesitantly so does he hermione and remus exchanged a worried glance we can do it he said finally i wontrest until he gone she remained silent and cast a forlorn look towards the ground james put a sympathetic hand on her shoulder and she looked up with heavy eyes if we cantget rid of him we ll get rid of his power a brief thought crossed her mind and hermione caught it before it could escape with trained hands like a cat entrapping a bird examining his words she found that his idea was in a way ideal and more so than remus idea cut off his power and he ll have no where to go she realized just like he did to me she knew then that she would put heart and soul into finding as much evidence as possible to finally prosecute the students that had been indirectly causing her all of this trouble his followers the illimni x x x a group of boys huddled outside of the great hall whispering to each other and shoving each other around like mates do it was lunchtime and only stray students were out in the corridors now as a few students filed out of the greenhouses and walked slowly up the path the boys seemed to start up with excitement here she comes here she comes a ravenclaw hissed the boys dug around in their cloak pockets searching for coins a pair of gryffindors walked by and the boy let out a whistle jane lewis looking nice i d like some company tonight care to stop by the chattering girls stopped dead in their tracks turning slowly to face the audacious boy who dared speak out among his friends the brave one was pushed forward a few steps by his sniggering mates c mon ignore these prats a redhead known as lily said coldly as she glared the other one jane lewis tensed up visibly and the ravenclaw smirked aw dontignore me i know how you like it he spoke up and his mates started howling with laughter the boy chuckled himself i even brought more money than you re used to jane faced him and glared and her hand suddenly withdrew its wand her knuckles white and clenched her lips lifted in a snarl no herm furnunculus she screamed the ravenclaw boy started shrieking in blistering pain and soon he lost all control of his body as his face erupted in hideous swelling boils the two gryffindors left the scene before anyone could stop them those little it the damn pictures hermione seethed the ones that the slytherins took they ve made me out to be a a scarlet woman lily gave her a sideways look and hermione flushed partly out of frustration and out of embarrassment sorry she muttered my friend says that sometimes it grown on me oh ronald you imbecile she thought wistfully thinking only good things about him she missed him she really did and it was amazing how much he had affected her here she was saying his ridiculous phrases we have to take them down lily said angrily well we can t we arentpureblood hermione huffed hitching her bag over her shoulder then again that never stopped me before yeah if you canttouch them then get your mates to do it for you lily pointed out and hermione nodded and we can also bring them to an authority attention if it hasntbeen already and they ll take em right down except i still dontknow anyone in this school very much excluding the marauders and you hermione added and lily smiled oh dontworry we ve got your typical rats in every house that love to spill to the professors michellyn parker in hufflepuff damocles belby in ravenclaw calum o boyle in gryffindor did you say damocles belby hermione interrupted and lily nodded after a moment you seem to recognize the name the redhead responded slowly hermione agreed a plan stitching itself together meticulously in her head that because i do she said anyway mustntlinger any longer you re avoiding the subject lily stated knowingly thank you i had no idea hermione said sarcastically lily snorted and the two girls entered the great hall for lunch whad toog you doh long sirius asked through a mouthful of food lily grimaced as pre chewed chicken fell from his mouth we were having a discussion with professor sprout lily said looking disgusted as she watched sirius eat his meal about james asked also piling lunch into his mouth defense against the dark arts lily said sarcastically looking for extra credit on that essay she gave us remus asked hermione knowingly she nodded carefully choosing food remus i was wondering when is your birthday hermione asked as casually as she could already happened james supplied as he overhead mooney here turned eighteen it was spectacular sirius chimed in what are you talking about it was an awful birthday i never even got a party or presents remus cried throwing chicken at sirius and james who ducked i remembered peter said i just didntsay anything he smiled sheepishly at remus look it fine though we never did much anyway remus said hermione was unintentionally shoved out of the conversation as the marauders relived their birthdays and the parties that accompanied the dates i ll get him a belated present then he ll love it hermione thought with a grin not bothering to become involved in their laughing anecdotes hermione chose to think about a few certain things mainly peter she knew that a year or so from now peter pettigrew would utterly betray the potters and everyone friend he had and cross over to voldemort becoming another loathsome death eater but why hermione pondered observing peter as he and the marauders joked around retelling stories and throwing food at each other he looks up to the three of them more than anything how could he betray them she thought for a moment and the scent of murder drifted through her mind his mother was murdered of course maybe that explains a few things perhaps he was seeking vengeance or power over his enemies he also said he knew in a way what happened they reported a death but he knew it was a murder so how could he not say anything what was going on with his mother that made him believe she was murdered for it hermione stopped eating her hand halfway in the air holding a sandwich and sat there pensively succumbing to the thought of peter mysterious betrayal and all the things that must ve instigated it hermione tapped her cheek maybe she was connected to voldemort and perhaps peter wanted to make up for his mothers mistakes but that doesntexplain why he would betray his best friends well she is a family member the thing was hermione didntknow enough about peter to make a logical argument and conclusion she had neglected the chance of getting to know him and thus left the horrifying mystery of his betrayal out in the open without being able to solve it maybe i could ask remus discreetly of course she mused there was nothing else she really could do unless she drew peter aside and had a good one on one conversation well his mother died so i could be offering condolences hermione sighed and cupped her head in her hands this is so difficult jane janie jane hermione gave james a dry look we thought of something very brilliant for this shall we say plan expel see we can go to the room of requirement and take a pensieve or two empty out our memories and give them to dumbledore i was planning on doing that later hermione said wearily and sirius snickered as james face fell well i thought it was brilliant he mumbled lily patted his arm sympathetically anyway i off to the library i want a head start on sprout essay and i ve a few other things to do hermione explained slinging her bag over her shoulder she snatched a biscuit gave a little wave and left the hall as she walked she knew that perhaps she should feel scared being all alone in the corridor without anyone to help her but she didnt need any help and she proved more than capable of defending herself when she took on the group of slytherins it was only malfoy that worried her yet malfoy was taken care of he couldnttouch her couldntcome anywhere near her and she was protected from him forever what about the illimni they re still in power longer than i thought hermione trudged slowly her head hung as she dissected the idea of these females still thriving i think rose might be their leader she been having an awful lot of help from malfoy though so i dontunderstand why they haventjoined forces with the death eaters yet or maybe they have but that doesntexplain why lucius has been doing everything for them and they only doing so little for themselves what in it for him voldemort of course she whispered in comprehension if he can control a group of people inside a school and destroy lives in mere months voldemort will think very highly of him making lucius as powerful as he is today she murmured oh this is just awful hermione moaned in anxiousness what awful hermione spun around to see remus catching up to her a smile on his face just thinking she mumbled lacing her fingers in his as he took her hand you seem to do that a lot he observed she nodded i ve got a lot to think about she admitted listen remus i wanted to talk to you about something anyway i was thinking instead of having malfoy expelled we have all of his allies expelled or suspended she suggested and remus considered this this cuts off all of his power he said and hermione nodded eagerly exactly it just what i wanted malfoy played the same game taking away all of my friends and making me powerless so i thought why not him why canti do the very same thing she asked excitedly so who first the girls once we get rid of the illimni then he ll be forced to turn to his only other friends therefore singling them out hermione started heatedly he ll put himself in such a position that he wontbe able to do anything you knew about the illimni i nearly forgot what is it remus asked interested well she began lowering her voice immensely it a group of girls that at first wanted to be voldemort most prized death eaters however he didntwant females doing his dirty work since girls are known to be a bit more squeamish so they banded together and after making sure death eaters in the school were watching them destroyed people lives doing this made them valuable to voldemort because not only did some of the girls possess bloodlust but a vast amount went on to become spies so so basically they re junior death eaters remus whispered wide eyed and hermione nodded and malfoy is the one that watching him isnthe he going to give you know who the thumbs up on these girls say his name remus fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself hermione said with a curt nod and no malfoy actually controlling them while instead it seems that he guiding them doing so voldemort will see malfoy as a valuable death eater and he ll be very powerful huh remus and hermione continued on in silence hermione thinking deeply about malfoy and the influences he had and remus about hermione or rather the jane lewis he had seemed to know despite their talk in the room of requirement when remus had finally revealed hermione for who she was he still knew very little about her he knew the basics and he knew how anxious she was he knew she was studious fierce intelligent beyond comprehension and beautiful beyond words she was homesick and brave scared and weak at the same time and more courageous than a gryffindor could be she was selfless and understanding clever and kind and still a complete enigma to him she was willing to open up to him yet she refused to shed light on certain topics he understood that she might be preventing major mistakes in the future but still she could at least spare that excuse instead of changing the subject without warning she could pretend to own up to her glaringly obvious mistakes ones that she did not admit while she admitted others she admits that malfoy was controlling her yet she doesntshed light on how she wontaccept help in fear of being weak remus thought heavily she proud but less now than ever what did malfoy do to you remus blurted suddenly before he could think about what reaction his words would provoke hermione stiffed and said nothing hermione he he just hurt me she muttered staring at the ground you know that not what i talking about remus said quietly you donthave to tell me what happen but just the extent of his actions he thought about his words and deduced that they sounded a little selfish and mean well sorry i didntmean it like that he apologized what i mean is i concerned we re all concerned about what he did to you and we just want to help you we ve speculated but hermione still remained silent did he rape you he asked sounding worried hermione gripped her schoolbag tightly and then sighed raggedly i dontwant to talk about it she said finally she grimaced at the implication of her ignoring the question but she didntcare she didntwant to analyze what had happened to see what he really had done to her did he remus asked sharply grabbing her arm hermione wouldntlook at him and her face was burning in shame this isntsomething stupid i being entirely serious no he didn t she shouted suddenly but merlin knows if you hadntshown up that he would ve he was so close to it remus but i couldntdo a damn thing about it she looked steadily at him and felt a surge of emotion rush through her before she let out a tight noise i was a puppet in his hands i was so useless hermione no i dontwant to hear that you re sorry remus or that you re sympathetic and that you want to help me because there nothing to help she screamed it already over it already happened and there no use dwelling on the past remus stood still watching her emotions crumble the wall she had built around herself he felt horrible for bringing it up and making her relive it but he knew that it had to be done one time or another carefully moving towards her he pulled her into an embrace and she sniffed bitterly into his shoulder i didntmean to make you think about it but remus muttered into silence and hermione nodded into his shoulder pulling back and wiping her face i know remus i sorry for yelling at you but it was just i haventbeen weak since now i ve never been victim to power like that before i couldntstop him because he wasntusing magic a and i didntknow what to do she whispered and remus smiled half heartedly knowing just how bitter she felt and unable to convey that in any expression sometimes it better to accept the things we refuse to face remus said quietly thinking they haunt us continually and until we force them away they will always be there hermione knew he was thinking distantly about his werewolf form but she knew he was referring to malfoy being in the dilemma she was in she pressed his face into his shoulder and sighed it is better to succumb to pain than try to stop it she mumbled into his robes once it hits you fully fledged and angry you can determine how to control it remus said nothing but held her tighter intertwining his fingers around her and into her hair embracing her as they stood together once again they seemed to merge as one in spirit rather than two similar and different people the tension of their bodies filled each crevice the other had no curve went unfilled and no breath was out of beat with the other neither of them knew anything else at that moment than each other and gladly they would each wish that all they ever knew was each other x x x james awkwardly gathered up three large basins carved with ancient runes and quaint markings spelled woven into the stuff echoes spilling off the mist at the bottom okay take this or i will drop it most deliberately james snapped graciously handing over the large bowls to peter and lily who scooped them up i dontthink we ll need that many lily said hesitantly looking down at the old bowl in her hands one pensieve can hold a lifetime supply of memories james and peter immediately put the others down but hermione asked arenti the only one providing evidence no argued remus at once i ve seen a fair share of bad doings from lucius malfoy especially to you and so have i james piped up when hermione demanded james remained silent thinking well never but but he always said things saying things isntgoing to get him expelled james hermione hissed the most i ll get from that is a restraining order never mind she added to their looks of confusion despite lily nod of agreement i the only one that seen anything remus said quietly but only to jane sirius interrupted we all saw what they did to lily as if cued the group turned and looked at lily they err startled me stunned me and when i woke up they had a wand against my throat and you were all there she didnteven have a chance to kick their arses james said sadly and hermione inferred that lily had already filled her boyfriend in well that not incriminating malfoy just his loser friends hermione said angrily i mean that is what i want but it would be a bit nice to have him gone and out of the way for a while you ve got it all hermione lily comforted dumbledore knows you surely he d believe you over a slytherin that slimy bunch of traitors hermione tried not to look nervously over at peter all right hermione agreed finally she drew her wand and set the basin in remus hands mulling over the painful terrifying annoying and plainly frustrating memories that were all connected to malfoy she thought hard about the night he caught her at last the night remus saved her her wand hand trembling the small wooden rod left her temple with a stream of iridescent silver mercuric liquid mist encasing it like a blanket around a baby placing that into the pensieve she did the same thing this time thinking hard about valentine day the list went on and on his attacks and his clever remarks that eventually led her to trouble whether it was being backed into a corner or being shoved up against a wall by the time she was finished she felt like crying and screaming out in anger at the same time so torn by the extremely different emotions all she could do was wail and yours remus hermione said sniffling after she had stopped grieving over her memories remus clenched his wand and closed his eyes slowly the imagery in his head bringing nothing but seething fury slowly he withdrew the night that malfoy exposed hermione quite literally and placed it within the basin then recalling the very first time he had stopped malfoy he thought about the night where they had on similar terms decided to be friends and ignore the attraction between them anything else sirius asked and remus shook his head sirius thought for a moment wait lily and i saw the meeting of that slytherin group remember and then the closet incident happened sirius turned a faint pink and james shot him a glare yeah agreed lily and i was also the one they kidnapped too i can put that into the pensieve sirius and james also decided to pull whatever evidence they had pulling the silvery memories from their temples they stored the memories in the pensieve and looked at their thoughts in fascination glimpses of opaque faces at the surface before they died away hermione sighed tired and just wanted to get this over with all she could think about was how nice it would be to sleep to just forget about this awful mess she was in for just a moment to just be at peace let go she murmured and feeling particularly out of place for a minute led the group of teenagers towards dumbledore office x x x this is exceptional evidence dumbledore said at last in response to the anxiousness and demands of the gryffindors however i cannot use expulsion without giving a student a fair chance to defend themselves james growled in protest and sirius actually swore i will call the select students out of classes and give them each one day to procure witnesses and allies for their defense should they not produce anything or if i can easily disprove their claim they will be expelled alright remus said quietly he looked at hermione and she could sense that whatever he was about to say he didntmean it it is only fair he whispered and hermione smiled faintly squeezing his hand lily nodded taking james by the hand whispering an audible thank you and turned and left james doing the same one by one they all nodded in appreciation and left until hermione was left gesturing for remus to go along without her hermione sat nervously clutching her skirt in her hands and trying to decide what piece of news she should deliver to the headmaster first would it be worthy of detention or worthy of facing azkaban they know hermione said quietly knowing the old man had heard her they all do even peter about me how dumbledore was aware somehow of what she was talking about he did not sound angry or disappointed but merely curious hermione shifted truth be told i not exactly sure lily and sirius overheard some slytherins talking and peter been unintentionally eavesdropping on several meetings of the illimni and i also suspect that the marauders used their um device it helps with pranks you see hermione said weakly what do you mean helps with pranks dumbledore inquired smiling hermione knew telling him would bring no consequences on the boys they ve made a map that shows the locations of every person in this school and their name one of them must ve finally pieced together that jane lewis was never on the map and hermione granger was someone they didntknow she responded dumbledore nodded and with a slight pause segued onto a fragile subject speaking with a most careful tone to his voice i terribly sorry for all that you ve had to endure miss granger i can only promise you that i will look for all the evidence and support i can to have mr malfoy expelled something like that should not have happened especially not in this castle but things have a way of going unseen especially when power is involved dumbledore murmured miss granger it alright professor hermione whispered closing her eyes and forcing herself to picture again the horrible night mistakes and fear are what help us to move forward it has already happened and i can only heal but thank you she said at last looking sincerely at him i think it would be ideal if we didntdiscuss it though dumbledore agreed silently and abruptly switched the subject have you any ideas of what future plans the illimni might have no sir hermione answered grateful that he accepted her request the only one of us that might would be peter and i dontknow how open he is ever since his mother passed away ah yes the murder dumbledore murmured hermione narrowed her eyes knowing something wasntright murder do you have any suspects professor hermione asked quickly they listed it as an accident but peter suspected otherwise lord voldemort of course dumbledore sighed standing slowly hermione watched him as he stepped silently over to the side of the room and opening a cabinet door with a mirror on it he allowed a pool of silver light to dance on the floor our pensieves she realized lord voldemort is growing stronger he said gravely more and more join him everyday he wants nothing more than to indefinitely eliminate the ranks i have built by creating a spy the potters have been a close helpful family since the beginning of the order of the phoenix voldemort is well aware of this and i can only surmise that he is trying to get through quietly by means of james potter hermione gasped but peter peter mother hermione burst out confused sirius black is a close friend of james is he not dumbledore asked and she nodded bemused as to what sirius had to do with it the blacks have mostly been true to their name they dabble in the dark arts and they only wish to see me dead young sirius however is the only black to ever practice the light hermione sat in the silence as dumbledore voice finally faded and she was not puzzled any longer she knew very well what dumbledore was implying what he was trying to plant into hermione mind and she understood if not sirius then peter they are such close friends hermione realized sadly sirius family must ve seen the opportunity and told their master precisely by doing such to mr pettigrew mother mr potter will be vulnerable dumbledore explained but that not his mother hermione protested ah but can a brother especially one who loves so deeply not feel the misfortune the other has had hermione bowed her head disturbed that james and peter were as close as the headmaster implied and that dumbledore could sense it better than anyone else now because you now understand what mr pettigrew is currently enduring his vulnerability will spread without his group of friends and you in fact will be most affected dumbledore predicted in a low voice since the beginning the girls in the illimni have been very clever they wield power but force others to do it for them can you not think of someone that truly knows who you are and is or has harmed you lucius malfoy of course hermione answered but he using the illimni not the other way around by controlling a group like that which has power all over the school then lord voldemort will hold him in his high praises ah you ve stumbled upon that they are unknowingly using each other which is undeniably bad for them i believe you know why miss granger dumbledore was smiling mysteriously and hermione thought for a moment wondering what on earth he was talking about allies she said suddenly the allies together they are strong but apart they are weak yes i doubt lucius malfoy knows that he is dealing with such a force and shoving you around puts his position in danger does it not it does can you do anything about it i ve tried several times but the malfoys are most influential young mr malfoy has a strong hold over the slytherin house as you can see and despite all the evidence you have here against him i fear it will not be enough that fine hermione said grimly i want his resources to be taken away i want him to feel as if there no where to turn anymore revenge is something not to be taken lightly it is a very powerful thing dumbledore reminded her quietly and so is justice she retorted fiercely he deserves all the pain he gets sir dumbledore sighed and remained silent hermione felt a bit awkward and cast her mind out to the thousands of other questions troubling her will i be sent to azkaban she whispered i revealed my identity they know i from the future so does lord voldemort my dear but how dumbledore smiled ruefully and hermione scrutinized him carefully as he reached into his robes and gingerly retrieved a small object he began to unwrap its velvety cover and soon hermione gasped because of this lying in his hand was a time turner x x x author notes well that was something interesting eh i ve been trying to figure out with the entire who is she and how do you know bit and this was my only solution but dontworry it only a quick detour i promise aiming for 30 chapters thanks for reading and please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just several original characters and this plot that was suddenly dead for a long time jeez sorry about the wait my bad i had a lot a stuff going on enough of my chatter on with the story still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter nineteen hidden opportunities will i be sent to azkaban she whispered i revealed my identity they know i from the future so does lord voldemort my dear but how dumbledore smiled ruefully and hermione scrutinized him carefully as he reached into his robes and gingerly retrieved a small object he began to unwrap its velvety cover and soon h ermione gasped because of lying in his hand was a time turner hermione for a moment did nothing but stare at the small object in his hand wiped clean of any emotion that should ve overwhelmed her her gasp came straight before this right before the crisp feeling of nothingness and again after the abrupt flood of memories from third year she blinked hard and looked back at her headmaster dumbledore tilted his head forward almost grimly and held out the object to the girl before him hermione took it gingerly careful not to turn the time wheel the one that had thrown her hours back in time in third year i cantthink of that now hermione thought firmly to herself she couldntafford to dwell i ve got to go back haventi hermione asked dumbledore quietly she gazed down at the golden colored object complete with ridges and sand enhanced magic and wards power flowing from it to her fingertips i would myself miss granger but i have a feeling that if a student saw double of me bad things would arise quickly and that is almost irrelevant because that is not how i remember it he said gently hermione lifted her gaze to meet his eyes and she nodded i ll do what i must professor after all it already happened hasntit she laughed a little at this but it was bitter dumbledore only smiled ruefully you ll go back to tom riddle time when i taught transfiguration and he was still merely an ambitious cunning schoolboy in 1943 all you will be doing miss granger is walking into my classroom and handing me a note written by myself then you will come back to this time dumbledore explained slowly sitting down at this desk with a tired sigh still his clear blue eyes twinkled at her hermione nodded comprehending the task it was actually quite simple but lately she had been turning simple things into complex dangerous ones but sir what about voldemort how does he ascertain who i am hermione blurted at once i mean after all you said this was started by my going back in time the thing is miss granger i not exactly certain as to when tom riddle first saw you or realized who you were dumbledore murmured it is a mystery to me and if i did know you would not be here sir hermione started slowly if your task for me is to go back to 1943 hand you a note and travel back to this very moment why couldnti just use this time turner to go forward to 1997 because it was not a time turner that brought you dumbledore deduced it was a time charm woven into a book correct yes hermione muttered wondering for a brief second how dumbledore knew how she had arrived you ll tell yourself the exact date and time i arrived wontyou in the note who i am and the purpose of my being here and several other important matters miss granger if there was any means possible to hurl you through time back to your own time it would be done immediately dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and looked wearier than hermione had ever seen him unfortunately you stumbled upon an invention that was not mine and i do not know the extension or its properties or magic time can only run its path before you are placed where you ought to be it all right sir i dontknow when i ll be going home and i aware it could be at any given moment so i am making the best of this now it closer to the end of the year and i not sure if i ll be here tomorrow or not hermione turned the precious piece in her hands over rotating it very slowly i prepared for the worst but i yearn for the best but i know that guarantees nothing dumbledore folded his hands on his desk long fingers laced together the silence that hovered in the air between them was not awkward but pensive more than anything i ready sir hermione whispered all you must do it take my note do not read it or open it at any costs for then it will be useless and i shanttrust it find my classroom and hand it to me avoid speaking with any other students unless you absolutely must the headmaster said firmly it simply for your safety i understand dumbledore took his wand and stood he summoned a book large and ancient its dank smell pouring off like the ancient whispering spells that hermione knew were hidden inside the professor opened to the middle and touching the tip of his wand to the book slowly began waving the rod in circular patterns he switched to intricate movements before placing a hard final rap on the yellowy page like the contents of a cauldron appearing out of its mist a small piece of parchment slowly emerged folded over and sealed with stamped wax hermione stared at the newborn looking parchment as dumbledore held it i wrote it just a few days ago he informed her somehow i knew this day would come shortly after a half smile crept onto her face it would have to things do not happen slowly at hogwarts come here beckoning her hermione took a few steps towards dumbledore and traded the time turner for the note he carefully undid its golden chain and gently looped it around hermione neck she ignored the cold metal and forced a calm breath through her lungs remember miss granger speak to no one he reminded her quickly revolving the time wheel faster and faster before everything was slipping away i know the laws she managed to say before reality seemed to be caught in a mixing machine rotating slowly but progressing rapidly she was familiar with this but hermione couldnthelp but feel slightly nauseated as dumbledore office dissolved from her vision only to be replaced by blurs bright and vivid that swarmed around her like angry bees she clamped her eyes shut praying that this would be over shortly that nothing would go wrong this time it was almost as if she had touched a portkey the spinning world slammed to a halt and hermione almost fell to her knees wobbling she pushed away the sickness and looked around she was in the headmaster office only it was professor dippet s thanking the gods that headmaster dippet wasntin his office at the moment hermione pocketed the precious note tucked the time turner into her shirt and crept out of the cavernous room quickly and silently she raced down the stairs careful to stay on her toes to avoid the sound of her heels and fled into the hallway as soon as she reached the bottom hermione heart hammered in her chest but she knew it shouldntbe a reason to delay her racing up the halls ones etched in her memories like her very own house she quickly took the route to the transfiguration room turning the last corner she walked swiftly to the door at last relieved that it was nearly over and stood in the threshold the appreciative feeling withered when the professor who was not dumbledore who wasnteven male halted her lecture and stared at hermione one by one students began to turn in their seats and look but by then hermione had enough tact to flee they moved the room hermione whispered to herself panicking why did they move the transfiguration room moving hurriedly hermione detoured through the majority of the castle glimpsing class after class all which were taught by teachers unknown to her she felt almost as if dumbledore had played a trick on her and was waiting to pop out at her but her headmaster was not amused by that sort of humor she paused by a corner and leant against it ruminating there were only several obvious places left those she would check indefinitely but the question nagging her was why would they move the room this shouldnthappen it not crop rotation it would just be easier if they were in the same place maybe but she could not supply herself with any kind of answer that would satisfy her confusion i wasting time she thought angrily to herself she shook her head and turned to the corner promptly ramming into another student they both went flailing on the floor at the sudden impact and by the time hermione had began to apologize watch it you fool i should give you a detention for this hermione had knocked over a handsome looking boy dark haired and dark eyed she flustered momentarily but bristled without other delay watch yourself you myopic prat hermione snarled she stood indignantly and brushed herself off before pointing an accusing finger in the boys face and if you had any decency to actually read the head book she saw to her disgust that the jerk was head boy you would be enlightened by the fact that accidents are hardly worthy of detentions giving him a haughty look hermione turned on her heel and left the open mouthed boy on the floor it was only seconds before his hurried footsteps caught up with her he jumped in front of her and stopped her actually holding onto her shoulder hermione glanced at his hand and then observed now that he isntangry he looks much better who are you he boy demanded immediately hermione cocked an eyebrow and shrugged his hand off her shoulder no one important she said stoutly and brushed past him however the boy kept up with her brisk pace and walked alongside her i ve never seen you before he said curiously looking her over i blend easily hermione supplied shortly upping her pace a bit really you re the type of girl that sticks out if you ask me he said with a smooth smile hermione walk faltered and the boy grabbed at the opportunity he stepped in front of her and hermione was suddenly nose to nose with the attractive boy she gasped and jumped away sorry he said with a charming smile she eyed him warily why are you still talking to me i must ve made it clear by now that you are not on my priority list hermione said flatly because you had the audacity to yell at me he said with a shrug and you re quite pretty for some reason this enraged hermione so you thought i d talk to you then just because you tell me i pretty means absolute rubbish to me lies are the charmer weapon and i not yielding so you ll be divulged on on whatever it is you want to know she hissed at him she stormed away from him this time and for a few seconds she heard nothing before his footsteps once again strode beside her i like you he said easily you re brave and you re an idiot hermione retorted cantyou take a hint cant you take a hint he countered with ease i being sincere no you re not hermione snapped go away people must not treat you nicely the boy said quietly and hermione heart seized up painfully in all honestly if you cannot believe me when i tell you that you re pretty than boys just must be awful to you hermione forced herself to walk faster her throat closing up as he continued talking to me it really makes no sense why would someone as pretty as you be tortured in school or otherwise he asked her his curious tone almost gently taunting her beauty means nothing hermione hissed whipping around to face him because cruelty would be nothing without beauty dontyou know they walk hand in hand and scar everyone just as evenly as the other believe me the boy urged taking a step closer to her hermione sneered at him why even if you re telling the truth there little to no chance that you want nothing more from me than to have my skirt around my ankles which you will deny hermione pointed out bluntly as he opened his mouth to protest there nothing you can say that will convince me otherwise tell me your name and i ll go away the boy said quietly hermione struggled with his request debating whether she wanted to disobey dumbledore or have this conniving boy on her tail before she had an idea she looked at him jane lewis i a gryffindor and i capricious i new and i ll be gone as soon as you start looking for me again because i have a habit of switches schools is that enough information to satisfy you pity the boy said ignoring her last comment you would ve made an excellent addition to slytherin i muggle born hermione informed him at once the boy quirked an eye brow still he sighed i sure with the right people guiding you you would ve fit in with my friends just fine and if you had a shred of selflessness you would ve made an excellent gryffindor hermione said imitating his sigh the boy smiled at her well jane lewis it is sad that i ll never see you again but please i am being honest and i do at least value this one meeting we had he said sincerely hermione gave him an almost exasperated look now i must be off to transfiguration with dumbledore hermione interrupted immediately the boy nodded and hermione smiled truly for the first time i ll come with you then together they walked to the transfiguration room silence between them every now and then the slytherin boy would turn a bit and look at her and after she matched his stare unwaveringly he would smile almost secretly before leading again they passed the threshold and while the boy took his seat hermione nervously walked up to the professor he had auburn hair and looked younger than she could ever imagine him to be he smiled good naturedly at her blue eyes still twinkling and took the note outstretched in hermione hand she moved off to the side knowing very well that the entire class was looking at her without thinking first hermione eyes sought out the charming boy that had accompanied her back she found him almost immediately he was sitting next to another slytherin a boy with long pale blonde hair the two boys were whispering to each other before the dark haired one looked up at her smiling hermione couldnthelp herself she smiled back almost involuntarily and something inside her chest did a somersault her eyes drifted a bit and she gazed at his blonde friend it happened as if she had stepped out onto a rotary despite the fact that she had seen all the traffic all the warning signs and bright lights she had still been hit head on by a bus it was a malfoy another wave of a horrifying epiphany crashed into her the malfoys were all slytherin had gained their power by supporting voldemort by the start if this was a malfoy it had to be abraxas malfoy which only meant the dark haired boy was tom riddle the color drained from her face before hermione could turn around she did so at once knowing that riddle had seen her blanch knowing that he would be curious knowing that he would never forget the name jane lewis and hermione knew at that very moment that she had brought this upon herself without knowing snapped out of her alarming thoughts dumbledore chuckle caught her attention as he poured over his own hand written note hermione swallowed the dread that had already overwhelmed her and stared at the soon to be headmaster well this is just extraordinary the auburn haired dumbledore chortled please miss lewis my office is there and i would like you to make yourself comfortable the class ends shortly but until then i appreciate it sir hermione said shakily avoiding eye contact with anyone she crossed the room again and entered dumbledore office aware that each student was watching her curious but no one more so than tom riddle she closed the door and collapsed onto the nearest chair how could i have done this she thought in agony dumbledore explicitly told me not to talk to anyone let alone give out my name i ve brought this upon myself she sat wallowing in the chaotic desperate thoughts that swirled in her mind only looking up when the sound of moving chattering students broke through her reverie and dumbledore entered the room he smiled at her and gave the little note a shake this is quite interesting miss granger i very surprised with this note why sir is it just well its unanticipated arrival that surprises you hermione asked precisely dumbledore chuckled i understand its contents completely though and i told that a certain hermione granger is neck deep in trouble though he gave her a look raising an eyebrow it not mischief hermione hastened to say i having problems with certain people dumbledore nodded knowingly glancing again down at his note with his curly looped cursive that hermione imagined to be defined and elegant slytherins generally dumbledore informed her and hermione confirmed with a curt nod well miss granger i surmise that your time here is over you ve done your duty and i sure you d like to get home to 1979 that only my temporary home actually hermione corrected him i from 1997 oh hmm i wonder why i didntstate that in the letter irrelevant probably hermione guessed well no that not irrelevant at all i just must ve forgotten dumbledore said and hermione found this slightly suspicious but did nothing dumbledore was a brilliant wizard a genius among his kind but he was by no means perfect i suppose i ll leave then hermione said wringing her hands i ve got a lot to do i ll see you soon dumbledore said with an amused smile and she actually laughed she pulled out the time turner from her shirt and slowly began rotating the time wheel like before the colors and images were caught in a revolving mixer and hermione was caught in the midst of it however neither hermione nor dumbledore were aware of two slytherins crouching outside his office intent on catching every word they said and very prepared with an excuse should dumbledore suddenly open his office door she closed her eyes shut and after the spinning came to a halt hermione shoved the nausea away echoes of student voices surrounded her and hermione opened her eyes to find herself in the middle of the charms room luckily no one was in the room not even flitwick hermione released a sigh of relief and after tucking in the time turner out of sight exited the room no no that not what happened at all you prat lily angry voice snapped hermione spun on her heel to find herself face to face with the marauders and lily james had his arm slung over her shoulder but the couple was fighting oh really then tell me dearest hermi jane the group stopped as remus blurted out the name the marauders all stared at her werentyou just in dumbledore office remus asked i was but i i cantexplain i have to go hermione pushed past them all hastily ignoring the protesting inquiries and hurried remus caught up with her you ve got to explain this to me remus said to her keeping up with her pace hermione was reminded of tom riddle pursuing her incessantly in the hallway even as she strove to walk faster i will hermione promised pushing the new memory out of her mind but i cantnow i have to get back to dumbledore how did you just appear in the charms room remus asked and hermione made an ambiguous gesture but said nothing jane come with me remus hermione said suddenly come with me to dumbledore office but wait outside when i come out we ll spend the day together all right remus was silent but after a moment agreed you ll tell me yes she muttered right now i ve got somewhere to be though just wait okay they walked as swiftly as possible to the headmaster office hermione left remus at the base of the stairs and ascended as quickly as possible as she opened the door she glimpsed herself dissolving into the air and dumbledore looking relatively pleased i ve done it sir hermione informed him closing the door may i ask though why did you move the transfiguration room a certain tragedy happened within the school and headmaster dippet thought it would be wise if we changed the location of each room hoping to avoid any further devastation dumbledore said quietly the chamber of secrets hermione said suddenly of course you wanted to confuse the basilisk i can only guess you ve researched it well well in second year i hermione stopped suddenly dumbledore didntknow what would happen in her second year and if she told him now that would be rearranging the future i read hogwarts a history and decided to research further on the subject smart recovery she awarded herself interesting did you find anything worth remembering dumbledore was testing her hermione decided suddenly too much i kept a mirror on me at all times i wasntrisking anything she said with a faint smile clever dumbledore complimented he switched subjects abruptly almost as if the thought popped into his mind and he voiced it aloud before it left did you tell anyone your name miss granger yes hermione whispered ashamed professor you ve got to understand though i was looking for your room and this insolent boy just kept following me and annoying me finally he asked for my name in exchanged for peace i told him i was jane lewis sir ah yes i remember you entered the room with tom riddle did you not she nodded i hadntrealized but that only explains how he knows jane lewis and not me sir well it quite a simple inference if tom riddle knew your name was jane lewis and he appeared very curious as to whom you were tom would go to any lengths to investigate he was a very officious boy charming but nosy dumbledore sighed now may i have the time turner back hermione nodded and drew the chain from her shirt gathered it from around her neck and gave it to him thank you and since your task is complete you may leave thank you sir hermione said she stood smiled and left wanting nothing more than to relax for a very very long time x x x a few days later in charms a hufflepuff interrupted the gryffindor slytherin class professor flitwick was heatedly explaining the effects of reverse charm combined with an engorgement charm and stopped abruptly what he snapped at the student the tiny professor normally was very amiable but he was very enthusiastic about the combination he was detailing and wasntpleased with the interruption professor dumbledore sent me sir the student said he handed flitwick a note and the teacher read over it hermione grabbed remus hand and squeezed it nervously they exchanged a look and they both knew that dumbledore was calling the guilty incriminated slytherins to his office anxiety flooded hermione and she wanted nothing more than to bury her head in remus shoulder and wish that everything was just over they cantdo anything to you remus comforted in a whisper no one in here can touch you i still worried remus hermione admitted reluctantly even if malfoy isnthere they can still i ll protect you remus said at once and she gazed up into his eyes he was just as uneasy as she was but more than willing to sacrifice himself to anything that discomforted her love swelled up like a balloon in her chest and she couldntstop herself from kissing him their lips met and despite the fact that it did not last very long hermione felt more passion than she would have if they had been snogging for hours get a room sirius teased remus shot him a look but grinned will the following people please go to the headmaster office flitwick started slowly one by one slytherins stood and left as they were called glaring at hermione darkly as they went there was only one good thing about the glares malfoy was not among them dumbledore had taken the liberty to change all of malfoy classes and his entire schedule to fit around hermione s now she never saw him not even in the hallways and rarely at meals she couldnthave been more grateful towards the headmaster we ll have to be extra careful these next few days hermione murmured to remus picking up her quill again flitwick had continued talking and she and remus took notes diligently but were still apprehensive we ll just stay in the common room then remus said and i ll follow you like a puppy you re funny hermione said sarcastically but she gave him an affectionate look after the day was over and the marauders had all settled into their nightly routine cramming in last minute homework and then procrastinating like they were paid for it hermione and remus decided to go the library but hermione wanted to look over the marauders map first who are you looking for remus kept asking curiously but hermione smiled secretively as she looked for damocles belby she spread the map out on remus bed unfolding corners and looking for the creator of the wolfsbane potion no one just looking she teased pushing the map just out of his reach as remus tried to grab at it he knocked her shoulder playfully and she giggled arms snaked around her remus buried his face in her neck and held on to her tightly tell me he whispered as he kissed her neck sending shivers down her spine never she countered hoarsely she twisted around and soon they were kissing each other the map left forgotten lately hermione had been so occupied by the trouble haunting her that both she and remus put their relationship aside it was if every moment they could ve been together enjoying themselves something happened that put hermione in danger or her friends in danger and it took enormous effort to fix it things now however were slowing down the past week although she had faced slytherins tom riddle and countless people and situations was overfilling with studies the seventh years had newt s and they were just around the corner danger was replaced by studying attacks by exams her heart twinged as remus wound his fingers slowly through her hair kissing her fiercely she shifted lifting herself onto him so that they could be closer touching making up for the intimacy that hadnthappened but should ve hermione wrapped her arms around his neck tilting her body to fit his it pained hermione to think about times before when she and remus had been so close to being with each other but people had kept them apart she didntlike admitting to herself that she was being a fool before the attraction between she and remus was undeniable and her fear of of what really of rejection of peer pressure of others had kept them apart she cherished this now this connection to him this perfect relationship more than ever thought she would remus went out of his way for her accepted things didntfight with her remus had secrets too secrets that were just as dangerous as hers secrets that hurt just as much as hers did that was why they were perfect for each other they understood they didnthave to explain they just were lily and james shared the same type of relationship with each other and for a while neither remus or hermione understood how they completed each other so perfectly now though they did the couple split apart for a moment and the friction that was heating up the fire that quenched more from them brought them back together in a moment she kissed his neck planting kisses along his jaw tracing his veins with her lips circles in his skin with her tongue someone going to walk in remus croaked a hoarse moan slipping from him as hermione gently bit his neck i dontcare keep going she urged cold hands slid up her waist bunching her clothes up she gasped at the temperature of his hands and she felt the chuckle deep in his throat her hands were frantically peeling away his cloak doing away with his buttons digging until she found his bare flesh her own clothes were pulled off each new inch of revealed skin kissed with thanks slowly anointing her shoulder and throat with his lips he undid her buttons at a painfully slow speed and hermione pushed his hands away and almost ripped the garment off her torso she had never felt this kind of fire this sort of heat that was burning up like a fever a sickness that she never wanted to get rid of her white school shirt was pulled off slowly the gleaming ball of her shoulder inviting his mouth remus slid his hands up her waist looking into her eyes are we are we going to he didntneed to say it hermione nodded slowly biting her lip and breathing slowly she wasntgoing to hesitate or put this off there was something deep inside of her that yearned for remus completely a force so strong she didntknow how she could ve overlooked it avoided it not known about it she leaned and kissed him lightly at first shifting to a more comfortable position and as they slowly intertwined they fell back on the bed his hands were hesitant slow touching the clasp of her bra but not doing anything to it kissing him encouragingly she arched her back just a little into his hands but he did nothing it alright go ahead she murmured into his lips eyes closed i i just erm she pulled back from his lips nose to nose with him and gazed into his gingery eyes he was just uncertain she knew but she smiled hermione lifted herself to sit up straddling him looking fondly down remus bare chested and sweating stared up at her as he panted hermione leaned and her arms shifted her fingers played with the clasp slowly and began to unhook it alright so maybe you were right but i did not shake on that bet woah just as soon as james and sirius opened the door they slammed it shut as fast as hermione threw herself off the bed to hide why does this keep happening to us hermione muttered into the floor remus let out a choked noise i need a very cold shower are you two decent yet remus and hermione quickly pulled their clothes back on and yelled their permission for the two boys to enter james and sirius opened the door hesitantly peeking in before opening the door remus glared and hermione tried not to look too mortified usually you lock the door sirius said after a moment of uncomfortable silence no one spoke for a few minutes as they chose to stare at each other awkwardly until hermione cleared her throat i think we should just go to the library hermione said quietly to remus the werewolf agreed quickly and together they grabbed their things the marauders map and pushed past the silent boys the door slammed in their wake and sirius couldnthelp but comment well i certainly never realized how fine jane was james gave him a look what about that time you saw her through my mirror in the shrieking shack yeah but she was far away then sirius pointed out james rolled his eyes x x x remus selected a table farthest away from madam pince desk so that she would not be breathing down their necks remus pulled out a pile of books and began writing down notes picking important facts and dates memorizing them one by one for the newt s hermione on the other hand was observing the marauders map still looking for damocles belby dumbledore had told her that she was exempt from newt s this disappointed hermione for she always enjoyed the satisfied feeling after she completed the test however dumbledore said it was for reasons pertaining to the test in the future she might take the exact exam again her finger grazed over the map sweeping over names and trying desperately to find this damocles boy hoping he was in the library and at last she found him and he was only a few shelves away i ll be right back hermione told remus he smiled nodding and went back to his work while hermione sought out the soon to be creator of the wolfsbane potion damocles belby looked like the sort of student that others picked on pudgy intelligent arrogant spotty and awkward there was sympathy for him because hermione knew exactly how hard life was when students disliked someone cautiously she approached him damocles looked up from his work tiny little notes crammed onto his parchment certain parts underlined and brightened magically to stand out hermione smiled politely hi she said can i sit here without waiting for his answer she did and the sandy haired ravenclaw stared suspiciously at him i jane lewis i know who you are he sneered rudely and hermione quirked an eyebrow mildly affronted what do you want cantyou see i busy she ignored his comment honestly i ve come to make a deal with you i heard you sleep around a lot he hissed probably hoping to scare her off hermione narrowed her eyes i know about the wolfsbane potion belby damocles belby annoyed face twisted up unpleasantly blanched within moments and he gaped at her oh and i dontsleep around i got into a fight with a slytherin so she posted nasty things about me understood belby said nothing and hermione got straight down to business now look damocles i know you re having a hard time with the potion so i ve come to help you i know how you can complete it but in exchange for this i want something in return how did you find out he whispered shocked doesntmatter hermione said quickly looking over her shoulder you need help and i have it do you want the ingredient list or not what the catch belby asked immediately over the shock and crossing his arms over his chest like an entrepreneur i know someone that a werewolf and i want to give them a week worth of potion for their birthday hermione said no damocles blurted do you think i that stupid i ll sign a magical contract stating that i wontsay who made it where it came from what it is what in it but only that it puts my werewolf friend into a harmless wolf state hermione vowed in fact to prove it to him she reached into her bag and dug out a premade contract she handed it to the wary ravenclaw belby poured over the parchment using his wand in several places and muttering spells to test it a few times the parchment glowed a faint yellow but proceeded to do nothing else hermione examined her nails all i want is to make my friend feel better she said flatly and all you want is fame and success right people to get off your back and instead worship you claim you a genius believe me i know and i can help you damocles why should i trust you didntyou date lucius malfoy hermione cringed pushing aside the memory it a long story really but i only did it to get back at someone i fancied it turned into a horrible mess and now malfoy and i dontgo near each other hermione said with a sigh which is true because i d never let him near me damocles looked at hermione for a long hard moment and she stared back he scrutinized the paper then hermione again and finally the parchment again the ravenclaw sighed dipped his quill in ink and signed on the mark at the bottom sign it damocles said firmly hermione glanced over her shoulder and borrowing the quill from belby signed it quickly he snatched the paper back from her and it suddenly gleamed blue the confirmation color hermione breathed a sigh of relief happy that she had managed to find remus an adequate birthday present belated as it was pulling out a piece of parchment hermione began writing now here are the ingredients and what you need to do x x x author note so interesting chapter huh i ve had the belby wolfsbane potion idea for a really long time but i got caught up in homework school and a lot of stuff i hope you guys like this chapter especially with the tom riddle scene haha and the almost sex scene that was fun to write lol so please review disclaimer i do not own any harry potter characters note i not exactly sure if lucius malfoy was in the same year as the marauder because he 41 ootp and since draco is about the trio age either lucius was a year or two ahead of the marauder or had graduated before they had reached 5th year anyhow i going to have mr evil lucius malfoy in here let us begin still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter two living in the past hermione shrieked as she flew through the air and hit the ground painfully bending her arm her head smacked against wood and she went dizzy a trickle of blood dripping down the side of her head she groaned rolling over her head throbbing she heard yelling loud footsteps and felt someone shaking her she opened her eyes groggily and realized that everything she saw seemed to be fogged over harry she said dimly as she blinked there was a boy on his knees shaking her she blinked getting a better look he was young her age his face handsome and clever and his black hair swinging down into his face his light grey eyes looked concerned as he called to her she could hear him vaguely almost as if he were across a field of some sort her mind was still very disoriented from the past events of getting sucked into a book and she was extremely confused suddenly something in her mind snapped she looked at the boy horrified this was sirius black he had been dead for nearly two years from the newly attained information she felt dizzy and her eyes rolled back and she passed out her head falling back and hitting the floor with a clunk oi moony prongs wormtail get over here sirius called over his shoulder he and his three best friends remus lupin james potter and peter pettigrew had all gone to the library of course remus had forced them into it remus didntwant to be responsible for their bad grades when they handed in their essays sirius had been looking for a book when he heard a scream and a loud thump an isle or two over and he had decided to investigate suddenly there was pounding footsteps and three boys came running down the aisle they all stopped as they looked down at the girl passed out on the floor it was uncharacteristic for sirius to be well serious but this was an exception her head was bleeding and she looked oddly pale remus james and peter all stared at her w who is that remus asked remus lupin already eighteen looked at the girl on the floor she was simply beautiful she had thick black eyelashes a full face and lips and although her hair was a bit unruly remus thought it added to her appearance he became aware of his friends staring at him and he blushed and looked away from the girl dunno we d better bring her to the infirmary though madam pomfrey ll have our heads if we don t james said they all murmured in agreement unsure of what to do they stood for a few more seconds staring at the strange girl all wondering who she was not using their common sense remus knew they were supposed to bring her to the hospital wing but none of them were bending down to pick her up so he decided to her head rolled onto his shoulder as he stood hair sticking to the blood remus looked carefully at her sensing there was something extremely different about her he could smell her blood he knew instantly she was muggle born and how old as he was as the marauder made their way down they kept voicing the girl possible identity it wasntmichellyn of ravenclaw or emmaline in gryffindor one of lily friends and sirius girlfriend they werentexactly sure who she was and how she got to the library peter quickly pushed open the hospital wing doors and the four boys quickly made their way in madam pomfrey ooh madam pomfrey sirius yelled in a sing song voice the boys grinned at his tone mr black contain yourself i can hear you perfectly well madam pomfrey snapped she stopped in her tracks as she laid eyes on the mysterious girl in remus arms who it alright poppy i can clear everything up professor dumbledore said striding into the room he was a great deal younger his eyes holding more sparkle and mischief than they would in nineteen or so years mr lupin please put her down on the bed and kindly all of you leave i need to speak with poppy and miss well this young lady when she wakes dumbledore said the marauders exchanged glances but remus nevertheless put her down who is that james asked trying to keep his curiosity down to a minimum in front of the headmaster james and sirius were known to be extremely rebellious but they were almost docile in front of dumbledore dumbledore chuckled in the morning she will explain everything now kindly all of you leave poppy clean her up dumbledore instructed madam pomfrey nodded and immediately set to work on the mystery girl and reluctantly slowly and with many exaggerated glances at the girl they left remus was the last one to go pausing in the doorframe and looking anxiously at the beautiful pale girl dumbledore sensed his hesitation dont worry mr lupin she shall be alright dumbledore said kindly remus nodded and with a concerned frown turned and left there was no doubt in his mind that the girl would be haunting his dreams all night madam pomfrey immediately set to work on the girl she cleaned and fixed her head wound and then quickly repaired her arm then holding open the girl mouth madam pomfrey tipped back a smoking blue potion and backed away the girl started coughing and after a minute or so groaned and opened her eyes professor dumbledore walked quickly over to her sitting down in the side chair p professor hermione gasped dumbledore held up a hand to silence her it all right i aware of what happened to you miss granger there is no way to fix it until the future pulls you back dumbledore said she swallowed nodding currently you are in 1978 in your seventh year since the amount of time you ll be here is unknown we need to make up an identity for you that no one can question yes sir hermione agreed timidly he smiled please what is your middle name he asked her jane alright then your first name shall be jane then and your surname your surname will be lewis is that understood he asked firmly hermione or rather jane nodded her head you will be a transfer student from liverpool witches academy which house were you in gryffindor sir hermione answered he nodded gryffindor it is then you re in your seventh year just to inform you for reference you ll be spending the night in here and in the morning i shall send someone in to take you to your classes and show you around as if you were new you are not to speak of any knowledge of the future that you posses to anyone understood he asked sternly she nodded again he smiled i will leave you to your rest then miss lewis goodnight dumbledore got off the bed and went to the doors hermione watched him go confused and desperate to ask him something what do you mean until the future pulls me back she blurted out he stopped and turned to look at her sighing until the future truly needs you you will remain here also it is december third goodnight miss lewis he said his tone ending their conversation hermione nodded and dumbledore shut the doors madam pomfrey hustled over muttering under her breath drink this dear it a dreamless sleep potion we need you ready for tomorrow madam pomfrey said hermione took the flask from her and drained it her eyes felt instantly heavy and in seconds she dropped back against the pillow asleep the next day was confusing for hermione when she woke she had to remind herself who she was where she was what she knew and who she knew it would be a lot to remember but she knew she could handle it she got out of bed and took a shower in the girls showers that was on the far left side of the infirmary hermione had no idea there used to be showers and then got dressed she sat down on her bed and waited for someone to come in and get her around 8 30 the doors opened a girl with dark red hair falling over her shoulders walked in and bright green eyes she had a curious smile on her face but she looked nice enough hermione heart gave a leap when she realized who it was hello i lily lily evans professor dumbledore said we had a new student and i supposed to show you around lily said she had a sweet voice and her presence made hermione feel like she was in company of ginny i jane lewis hermione said as she stood up the two girls shook hands and together walked out of the hospital wing so where did you transfer from lily asked oh erm liverpool witches academy hermione said hesitantly lily nodded and continued asking her questions until the got to the great hall doors this is the great hall well inside these doors anyhow you can sit with me at breakfast and i can introduce you to my friends lily said kindly hermione nodded and she pushed open the doors it looked just like it did in 1997 except there were different people at the tables and different teachers hermione looked over at the gryffindor table and locked eyes with a cute shy looking boy he had dark sandy brown hair and amber eyes the boy stared back at hermione and she couldntmove with a sharp intake of breath she knew suddenly who it was x x x so lily told me dumbledore asked her to bring in the new girl james said stuffing pancakes into his mouth wonder if she has a boyfriend sirius said dreamily pretending to stare up at the ceiling like a lovesick boy the girl next to him slapped him on the arm and sirius grinned at her oh shut it you i only joking sirius said the girl smiled and went back to her breakfast i wonder where she from maybe she from america i heard the girls there are saucy james said with an impish grin james potter i telling lily you said that the girl next to sirius said james scowled emmaline please stop acting like a goody a man has his right to dream james replied simply you arenta man james you re a little boy emmaline said smugly sirius remus and peter snickered honestly i dont know what lily was thinking dating you what did you slip into her pumpkin juice nothing but i might slip something into yours if you dontkeep quiet you ll have pink hair for a week james threatened oi here comes lily and the new girl wow peter said all four of the boys stared at her standing nervously at the great hall doors the girl looked over and locked eyes with remus remus suddenly couldntbreathe her curly brown hair fell into her fair flushed face and her bright ginger eyes gazed into his she bit her lip tensely and lily slowly pushed her forwards toward the table suddenly remus felt a nudge in his side looks like the new girl caught your eye eh moony sirius teased shut up padfoot remus mumbled he looked down at his breakfast a moment later he could see out of the corner of his eye that across the table james and peter pushed down to let the two girls sit guys this is jane lewis she a transfer jane this is james peter sirius emmaline and remus lily said pointing the people out to jane remus dared to look up the girl was looking carefully at everyone and when she looked at remus she had a strange look on her face staring at him curiously hello everyone jane said quietly her voice was soft and frightened and remus secretly knew how she felt hi they all chorused together then the meal started everyone started asking her questions making jokes telling stories and pointing out teachers then they went back to their own conversations james put his arm around lily and pulled her closer and she grinned he was whispering quietly into her ear and she giggled every few seconds hermione let the smallest of grins slip onto her face as she watched them so jane sirius started hermione looked at him he was handsome no doubt about that he had an almost addictive smile on his face his light eyes flashing suggestively hermione smiled how did you get into the library without anyone noticing did you apparate he asked you cantapparate inside of hogwarts hermione and remus said together they looked at each other and hermione blushed and looked down at her plate remus accidentally dropped his fork and dove under the table to retrieve it he came back up with an extremely red face err no i came in here and i was looking for the headmaster office and when i asked someone they said to go find two big wooden doors i found two doors and entered but found myself in the library instead hermione lied quickly sirius nodded hermione looked around but avoided remus gaze that darted back to her every few seconds she looked around the hall her eyes landing on the slytherin table her heart skipped a beat when she saw someone who looked suspiciously like draco malfoy except there was something different the boy still had the platinum blonde hair the sharp silver eyes and the pale pointed face but he seemed even more cruel and arrogant than draco who that hermione asked disgusted remus turned and followed her eyes quickly he turned back around a scowl on his face that lucius malfoy he a git i wouldntgo near him if i were you jane he trouble remus warned hermione nodded grimly he probably doesntlike muggle borns either she muttered glaring at lucius how did you know that remus asked suspiciously hermione cleared her throat uncomfortably well err her voice was unusually high i dontknow he in slytherin all of them are pureblooded biased prats arent they she asked remus nodded still looking doubtfully at her she gave him a half smile and went back to her breakfast the day went by fast the four marauders were in her class as were lily and emmaline but unfortunately so were most of the slytherins when they set eyes on hermione they broke out in whispers lucius malfoy stared hungrily at her throughout every class that they shared hermione always got the creeps when she felt his gaze on her it was worse than when draco looked at her however she always planted herself in between lily and emmaline so no harm came to her lunch and dinner came and went quickly hermione and lily were a bit late for dinner because they had to stay back to discuss the homework with the potions master who wouldntlet hermione off for not having her homework however since hermione was new the potions master agreed in the end to let her off lily went across the table to sit with james and the only spot left was next to remus c can i sit here hermione asked as she approached the empty spot next to him he looked up surprised and nodded moving over hermione noticed the color in his cheeks tinge slightly pink dinner was very awkward hermione accidentally spilled her pumpkin juice and then put her elbow in the butter this had the marauder in hysterical laughter and even remus had a sheepish grin hermione laughed along as well still bright red in the face remus kept dropping his utensils his hands shaking a little no one seemed to notice sirius and emmaline hermione had learned from lily were a couple sirius was flirting and making her laugh every few seconds lily and james were quiet close still whispering to each other and chuckling peter had a glazed over look as he stared across the table through a gap of people at someone across the hall remus kept glancing at her every few seconds out of the corner of his eye and a few times she glanced back it was unnerving for her to be sitting with people who were almost all dead hermione was quiet the entire meal trying not to speak so much so she could conceal her embarrassment and nervousness and thankfully no one spoke directly to her they all left for the common room afterwards discussing the monstrous essay the potions master professor hull had set for them due in two days of course hermione had read enough of the library to easily do the essay after dinner hermione lily and emmaline set immediately on their essays hermione finished first and helped her fellow girls in the corner remus quietly finished his constantly glancing at hermione merlin jane how did you finish that so quickly emmaline asked as she finally put down her quill it was nearly nine o clock lily was still working nonstop on hers scribbling furiously there was ink on her cheeks hermione shrugged dunno i just know this stuff like the back of my hand hermione answered emmaline grinned hermione and emmaline decided to help lily finish hers since she was having a hard time around a quarter past nine sirius james and peter all came down from the boys dormitory they all had mischievous grins on their faces moony james whispered as they all sat down around him peter glanced over his shoulder at the three girls working and looked back at remus with an excited grin what remus asked cautiously the three boys grinned looking like they did before they planned their before full moon adventure or pulled a prank we just got the greatest idea sirius started let pull something on jane she the new girl let give her a scare no remus said instantly they looked curiously at him then james split into a grin ooh i see how it is moony james said he cleared his throat loudly and the color in remus face drained remus knew exactly what james was going to do he scrambled to get his stuff into his bag as james stood up and looked at the three girls remus and jane sittin in a tree james started to sing remus darted for the staircase as james kept singing k i s s i n g he sang louder peter and sirius were roaring with laughter rolling on the floor emmaline hermione and lily looked up listening to him first comes lu u urve then comes marriage hermione turned a bright pink and muttered goodnight under her breath grabbed her stuff and hightailed it for the girls staircase the three remaining marauders pointed at her and bellowed with laughter and she sprinted up the staircase she ran into someone and horrified found remus white in the face desperately trying to get into the boys dormitory door which was planted quite inconveniently before the split in the staircase to the girls dormitory door wontopen he squeaked she stared at him still in shock before nodding quickly and scrambling up her own staircase one it had split away from the boys by the time the door had shut she could hear the entire common room ringing with laughter hermione sat down on the bed shaking she rubbed her arms trying to rid herself of the mortified and embarrassed feeling that was extremely humiliating sure she felt awkward and very self conscious in front of remus and he seemed accident prone and embarrassed and it was only her first day she put her head in her hands taking a deep breath it could be worse but when she thought about it she didntknow how it could be any worse jane said a soft voice hermione jumped lily and emmaline came into the dorm shutting the door behind them there wasntanymore laughter in the common room we re so sorry about those gits emmaline said jerking her head down towards the common room hermione smiled it all right she said quietly emmaline and lily exchanged glances good because we told them off emma and i arentgoing to talk to james and sirius for a few days mortifying you like that on your first day we ll help get them back somehow lily said hermione looked up and giggled that was funny though i mean after when i thought about it hermione said they all laughed the girls changed into their pajamas and got into bed slowly as ten o clock rolled in all the girls came up and went to sleep lily emmaline and hermione were the last ones to fall asleep they were talking quietly back and forth so how was your first day lily asked from next to hermione she yawned fun very very fun hermione answered thinking a little bit about remus he was quiet he was smart and he was very ungraceful near her she smiled to herself and how about remus emmaline asked cautiously he cute hermione answered without thinking oh god did i say that out loud she shrieked as the girls started giggling yes but dontworry we ll never tell lily said as the two girls giggled x x x author notes well i hope you liked that either way please review in the mean time here is the latin phrase from last chapter

though still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty sweet retribution sign it damocles said firmly hermione glanced over her shoulder and borrowing the quill from belby signed it quickly he snatched the paper back from her and it suddenly gleamed blue the confirmation color hermione breathed a sigh of relief happy that she had managed to find remus an adequate birthday present belated as it was pulling out a piece of parchment hermione began writing now here are the ingredients and what you need to do the marauders had caught up with remus and hermione eventually mentioning nothing of the intrusion on the couple although sirius and james were frequently smirking lily forced them to study and hermione helped them all peacefully content that the year was wrapping up and that she had more free time than she was ever used to anyone need flashcards quick notes hermione offered pulling parchment out of her bag i need a drink sirius said under his breath ooh good idea after this is all over shall we head to hogsmeade james suggested and get pissed no lily snapped i not nursing any hangover of yours guys night only james whispered to sirius and the two boys laughed lily clearly did not approve go ahead and get piss drunk i not doing anything for you she said angrily to james he shrunk in his seat as she started yelling in fact i ll deprive you of magic advil and sleep and i ll take down the shades no lily no james whined what if i dontcome back drunk canti go and drink then return fine you retiring to bed sober lily scoffed hermione exchanged a look with remus i think i might leave this scene she said quietly as lily and james voice slowly rose higher than the recommended whisper before madam pince comes around hermione could hear the irate footsteps of the librarian coming ever closer ready to enforce her rules the brunette pushed out of her chair before trouble arrived passing madam pince in the q section and headed for the doors she stepped into the hallway giggling a bit to herself and remus appeared right behind her she a madwoman remus commented smirking hermione laughed if she didnthouse the books i wouldntprotest to everyone jeering her the couple laughed stepping closer to each other as they did remus laced his fingers with hermione s leaning his forehead against hers i sorry i didntlock the door he murmured quietly that all right we ll just have to finish what we started some other time hermione whispered eyes closed contently they kissed silently in the hallway until someone interrupted them oh what a display makes me a tad nauseous though remarked a snide voice it belonged to rose sanders and behind her stood several other slytherin girls remus gripped hermione hand tightly your comments seem to lack any heart sanders what have your normal tricks turned you down hermione sneered clever rose said sarcastically i wouldntbe accusing rose of tricks mudblood another voice drawled hermione didnteven have to look it was narcissa black after all you re quite fond of them arentyou at least my boyfriend wontmake a living by being a murderer hermione hissed you think malfoy will go on to do great things serving for voldemort he ll be on his knees for the rest of his life black what that suggest to you remus laughed loudly narcissa growled lucius is purer than either of you could ever hope to be you mean inbred remus corrected her and hermione smiled viciously at narcissa it going to quite a shock mudblood when none of us are expelled rose said quietly squealing on us will just get you into more trouble malfoy canttouch me hermione hissed he physically restricted from coming anywhere close to me i not scared of you but you re scared of lucius narcissa drawled eyes gleaming he ll become a murderer black no one has to be clairvoyant to tell that at least strikes fear not respect remus growled malfoy the only one with any daring we ve already solved that problem and we re certainly not afraid of a group of girls rose smiled unpleasantly and remus stomach twisted infiltration is the easiest form of attack remus i would think you would know that of all people lies are the charmer weapons and promises are seductive when it comes to men what do you want hermione bellowed disturbed by rose haunting words voldemort feeds them these phrases doesnthe it over leave us alone mudblood you must understand we ve only just started the words sent chills down hermione spine what going on the library doors opened revealing james and lily sirius and peter the slytherins turned to the new group dontyou cretins have somewhere to be especially somewhere other than this school seeing as you re all about to be expelled james hissed expelled narcissa repeated looking at rose and laughing with her we might face a detention at the very least assault on another student kidnap conspiracy lily spat it all azkaban worthy if you ask me black no one cares what you think mudblood narcissa said smoothly ignoring lily and hermione snarling besides all evidence to support your claim is weak and without full support your little group will be the only thing without full support james said between the six of us your futures are ruined remus said in a low dark voice you re not powerful any longer rose grinned a maniacal bestial look creeping into her eyes the only restrictions we have are the castle walls dumbledore will protect us peter shouted abruptly rose turned sharply to peter her malicious smile widening the old fool waves his wand around and spouts nonsense haventyou figured it out she asked in mock curiosity peter shivered and glared at her dumbledore can defeat you know you peter hissed only if harry with him hermione thought to herself peter rose cooed drawing out his name and tasting it a twisted smirk on her lips you re a fool murderer he croaked peter recoiled at his own words stepping behind his friends the slytherins started laughing and close to tears peter turned and ran wait james took chase after him lily and sirius in his wake puzzled and worried remus and hermione stood their ground glaring rose smirk faded from her lips taken by a haunting malevolent look she cautiously walked to them hermione bristling and clutching remus protectively as she drew closer rose was only a half meter away now no one else would hear her words we will have revenge granger x x x a strange assortment of students were seated in a small room head of slytherin and gryffindor present along with the headmaster and surprisingly the minister of magic no one looked pleasant to see him no one spoke and discussed the latest politics in fact the spiraling screaming silence was grim the headmaster slowly unrolled a long piece of parchment and began to read the following students have been expelled for lack of sufficient evidence and alibis pandora ratum lorna knox demeter lymus liam royle rodrick shaffer theodore scythe damian slade rigel furiae and saiphio knox slytherin hung their heads sighing shortly and wishing for only a brief bitter moment that it had never happened they had backed out but they had chosen this for their lord they had to accept the bruises they gained for following him the following student will be suspended for a minimal amount of two weeks dumbledore ordered his voice deep and disapproving he recited names slowly letting each student savor the sweet taste of relief however shackled it was and went onto the next names were voiced names no one had ever questioned before names that surely had nothing to do with it but had the marauders crouched outside the door hermione and lily under the invisibility cloak and the boys secured with disillusionment charms they said nothing at the ironic role call sirius however couldntwithhold his gasp when dumbledore called regulus black among the suspended students hermione i i had no idea sirius gasped and they could all hear his breathing erratic and heavy its fine sirius hermione assured him quietly i dontrecall meeting him anyway quiet lily said suddenly they listened sharply as dumbledore said and the following students have provided sufficient evidence and solid alibis rose sanders emma danes lucius malfoy severus snape what wrong with him remus snarled suddenly he knows malfoy did all those things malfoy is powerful remus james said tensely slytherins would hail him king if they could actually do that but most of the illimni are suspended many of his leading followers were too and expelled he cantdo much now hermione interrupted remus quickly he got nowhere to go i worried for you still remus whispered and hermione heart swelled a faint smile crossed her lips but it did little to express the powerful feeling inside of her chest we best listen to the rest of the names just in case lily hushed them dumbledore might tell the suspended ones what they ve got to do it will be ever so fun to taunt them tomorrow about it those who are expelled will follow their head of house to their dormitory gather their immediate belongings and wait in the main foyer with the minister the elves will bring the remaining belongings to the train those who are suspended will form a single line and i will each give you the amount of time you will be suspended for dumbledore paused and hermione imagined him closing his eyes and speaking very reluctantly the rest are free to go we better move peter said suddenly we dontwant another closet incident ow sirius yelped as lily hit him the group rushed up the hallway and removing the charms and cloaks travelled slowly back to the gryffindor dormitory remus and hermione laced their hands together watching james and lily come together like magnets the potter put an arm around her shoulders pressing his forehead to hers they go so well together hermione reflected quietly remus nodded in agreement i wouldntbe surprised if james ended up proposing to her as soon as exams were over remus predicted and hermione laughed i can see the two of them creaking away in rocking chairs at a hundred and two they ll only have the next what two years hermione thought forlornly to herself she squeezed remus hand and ducked under his arm as he brought it around her neck she buried her head in his shoulder grateful that remus was hers and no one else s tell me they live happily ever after remus whispered softly hermione shook her head i canttell she replied i can t after everything that i ve rearranged i wonttell a soul remus promised hermione shifted and looked into his eyes if i told you you d hate me she said gravely he looked shocked they dont hermione shook her head i wouldntsay that but i not saying anything remus you know i can t it all right hermione heard the disappointed sigh but it didntseem as if remus tried to hide it the werewolf wanted happiness for everyone his friends most important and hermione was well aware but nothing could compel her to inform the devastation that would rupture in a few years time it makes me worry though remus said quietly i cantimagine doing anything without them if they were to you know you ve got much more to worry about at the moment hermione said darkly squeezing his hand thinking about peter something was not quite right about his situation and if she could only find out more i would know how loyal he really is to the dark lord x x x whatever plans hermione had concocted to investigate peter pettigrew was stopped short as the marauders all feverishly studied for their upcoming exams as april died out with a last vain gust of wind and showers every student in the castle was not without quills and parchment studying becoming a seemingly permanent habit exempt from the exams which thoroughly frustrated the girl hermione could do nothing but slowly put her affairs in order there were many things she wanted to accomplish before she was sent back to her own time give remus his present investigate peter get lucius malfoy out of her hair once and for all undermine the illimni completely and several smaller less important things however imperative those things were nothing stood above the desire to have a meaningful actually functional relationship with remus without things getting in the way it was times like these when danger was gone that she wished it could ve happened but the ominous pile of homework and the hovering shadow of newt restricted the time they could spend together for once hermione felt a tiny bit mutinous towards the headmaster the constant hours in the library however put a damper on whatever resentment managed to gather the library brought nothing but joy to her and the fact that at least she and remus could spend time together there despite the fact that the time was spent on books and not on snogging meant a great deal to her exams at least brought them together in one way may crept over the castle with warm weather and a generous warmth that was absent throughout most of spring time spent studying was usually spent outside where at least students had the option to stare at the lake or their friends for a mental respite leaving the library on a particularly warm thursday afternoon hermione traveled from the library to the grounds to meet the marauders and lily with her nose in concocting compatible concoctions her feet led her blindly down the steps around corners through the corridors and flights of stairs without having her look up turning quickly through the pages she imbibed all she could about the importance of ingredients from chapter 7 wondering if damocles belby had read this book knowing how useful it could be to him she turned another corner but stopped short at the sound of a drawling voice well well look who it is rooted to the spot heart threatening to burst out of her ribcage in fear hermione looked up from her book lucius malfoy was at the front of a handful of slytherins the few that had managed to escape expulsion in such a small number they looked much less threatening but hermione knew that at a drop of a hat the remainder of the illimni could turn up and she could be in real trouble lucius and hermione did nothing but stare at each other stock still and waiting for the other to make a move malfoy cronies behind him were all watching her hungrily wanting revenge on her more than anything else but were waiting for lucius consent but if lucius attacked hermione he would be expelled and they all knew that tensing hermione flexed her fingers and in a fluid move drew her wand seconds later the group of slytherins had done the same all except for lucius he narrowed his eyes never taking them off of her forcing her to keep eye contact expulsion does little to stop me granger lucius said quietly silver eyes gleaming more menacing then she had seen before well you seem to be doing a lot without your followers dontyou hermione spat face it malfoy you ve lost it only these castle walls that restrict me he snarled and its no secret you ll be with that dirty boyfriend of yours when school ends where else would you go granger you ve been cornered and you know it you underestimate dumbledore malfoy hermione hissed and you underestimate the dark lord you filthy little mudblood you cantdo anything at all anymore can you malfoy that must anger you so much hermione taunted how does daddy feel about that his precious little boy canteven follow through with voldemort s i am more capable than anyone lucius roared whipping out his own wand in a flash he gripped it so tightly his knuckles were white hermione laughed at him but you canteven stop one little muggle born hermione reminded him an almost vicious smile on her face her face fell into a dark deadpan look nothing you can do will enable you to touch me lucius snarled in anger and in the moments where hermione knew he would attack her not magically but lunge at her her mind retaliated in anger and followed by the noise of a gunshot malfoy was thrown off his feet and into the air he skidded to a halt far behind his team of slytherins sprawled out on the floor taking advantage of the distraction hermione turned and ran down the adjacent corridor glancing over her shoulder every few seconds ready to take down those who pursued her when hermione arrived panting the marauders knew instantly that something was wrong what what is it demanded james hermione sat down next to remus with a large gulp of air chest still heaving nothing just a spot of trouble with malfoy she said but the effect was instantaneous remus roared in anger and james and sirius leapt to their feet wands drawn looking around for the slytherin its fine hermione assured placating remus i wasnthurt no one came near me we just had a little row and then i left simplified to the smallest truth hermione admitted to herself what did malfoy say to you sirius inquired hermione chewed her lip for a moment looking around where lily she asked head duties but dontchange the subject james said hastily well but you re head boy james hermione cried reproachfully never mind it it a separate thing i ve already finished mine what did malfoy say he sort of erm threatened me but he cantcarry it out hermione added hastily as they exchanged angry looks he just said as much as sanders did that the castle walls were his only restriction you think its rubbish what he saying remus asked sharply hermione opened her mouth to retort but remus cut in he well informed we all know that and he bloody right as soon as you leave hogwarts hermione things are going to get very complicated because i have such a simple life at hogwarts hermione said sarcastically i very well aware that malfoy plans to attack after school is finished and i ve got it covered alright i going to talk to dumbledore about it about what james inquired let us know there strength in numbers hermione had an inexplicable rush of affection for the boys sitting around her she smiled have you ever heard of the fidelius charm x x x damocles belby worked easily under pressure harder than he would if he was not given a deadline much more than damned potter can say belby thought angrily to himself why dumbledore had chosen quidditch hero evans infatuated numskull potter to be head boy was simply beyond damocles he couldntstand the arrogant gryffindor not one bit but the fact that potter had beaten him damocles belby to the ravenclaw rightful spot was just intolerable time that wasntspent on the wolfsbane potion was spent pondering the possibilities of who jane lewis wanted to give the actual potion to who was a werewolf who could it be however he didntspend much time stuck on the fruitless thinking his main concern was actually getting this damned potion right if jane lewis was in fact right and not giving him the ingredients to a potion she knew was going to fail why would she just hand it all to him did fame and fortune mean nothing to her if she knows how to make this p otion i doubt she ll need to try very hard to be famous still he worried was she setting him up for a prank she did after all congregate with that annoying fool james potter of course that could mean absolutely nothing friends did little to define a person damocles couldnthelp but be a little wary though it wasntlike him to agree this easily on something that meant so much to him the thought of fame and fortune praise and to be finally accepted drove damocles on eventually he managed to get the ingredients the time and the patience to try and try again to make a successful wolfsbane potion damocles had followed every little instruction jane lewis had given him straight down to the exact color of each stage the tiniest amount of liquid to every last piece of dirt on one of the roots all that needed to be done now was to let the potion mature jane lewis was sitting amongst her gryffindor friends lupin potter black pettigrew and evans outside on a boiling sunday beneath one of the shadier trees books were piled around the group but they really seemed to be neglecting the books damocles approached the gryffindors nervously remembering quite involuntarily the number of pranks potter and black had pulled on him as he drew closer they grew quiet hello damocles jane greeted sincerely hi can i talk to you damocles asked and the brunette nodded alone sure damocles moved far enough away from the suspicious boys and talked in a low voice to jane i think it done lewis i not very sure though he added apprehensively i ve followed all the directions it the right color and you ve let it mature damocles nodded and jane did the same excellent i ll need to see it before i take some to my friend though can you meet me on the first floor in classroom eleven after dinner tonight yeah i can arrange that i might be a tad late though the cauldron a bit hard to conceal if you know what i mean disillusionment charm jane supplied offhandedly better yet invisibility charm easy enough damocles agreed alright classroom eleven after dinner tonight i ll see you bye jane and damocles parted the ravenclaw going back to the castle to attend back to his studies and jane back to her group of friends now that jane would inspect the potion damocles could stop bloody worrying jane mates waited only seconds before interrogating her about the short meeting with belby and damocles smiled he sincerely hoped all the vicious rumors about her werenttrue because this jane lewis girl seemed genuinely nice x x x why were you talking to that swot sirius asked curiously and hermione glared at him none of your business hermione sniffed can it be my business james asked hermione smiled ask no questions and i ll tell no lies hermione chanted grinning as she recalled the weasley twins saying that thinking of them of the actual weasley family caused her chest to seize up painfully for a moment i think it mooney right to know at least what if you re having an affair with that ravenclaw sirius pointed out smirking hermione turned to remus and put her hand to her forehead in mock despair oh remus i am having an affair i knew it all along remus cried feigning hurt the couple looked at each other and grinned settling back down beside remus hermione picked up a book at least tell me remus breathed in hermione ear she twisted around and smiled at him nope never it a surprise my dear hermione murmured tapping his nose he laughed and planted a swift kiss on her cheek taking the hint that the subject was closed the marauders fell back into their previous discussion the marauder map well it could just be another flaw in the system james suggested shrugging without his girlfriend it appeared that he was incapable of studying like the names for instance that just because you were too lazy to learn everyone names prongs remus shot back you re telling me you know who this blinking girl is then james retorted when remus failed to respond james smugly said i thought so not all of the secret passages show up sirius said lying on his back and prodding his shoes with his wand we ve got to add them every time we find one but those dontblink james stressed why does it blink laws of magic hermione suggested only mildly aware and interested in what they were talking about the person could be tampering with the school magic or the ancient fields the founders wove into the castle walls wouldntsurprise me sirius said darkly only a slytherin would do that think hermione right remus asked his friends they shrugged wormtail mmmergdhfed the mousy gryffindor grunted he was propped up against a tree but clearly his mates had just woken him up shall we leave him sirius whispered he been sleeping horribly so let s but hermione what can tamper with the ancient magic in the school walls james asked dark magic remus said time travel hermione added and they all grinned at her possibly transformation animagi potions metamorphosing identity change things like that i would assume so if dumbledore had a map likes ours he would know that your three hermione looked pointedly at james sirius and peter were illegal animagus alright if there arentanymore possibilities we should try and track down this blinking girl and find out what she up to because it really annoying that she blinks so often remus advised we cantjust walk up to a slytherin and go excuse me are you changing your identity sirius said scathingly we ve got to watch you mean stalk the coldness of hermione voice startled sirius w what you d be stalking this poor girl i dont care if she slytherin sirius stalking is illegal hermione warned who is it anyway some slytherin girl james muttered i ve no idea what year she in and i dontrecall darien parkinson having any living relatives he the youngest i thought hermione blinked once twice and then again her mind going strangely blank but her pulse racing what did you say i didntrecall darien parkinson having any living relatives this blinking dot name is pansy parkinson and i cantfigure out for the life of me hermione shriek stopped the words at once disconcerted the potter demanded to know what was wrong trembling hands were pressed up against hermione mouth and she wouldntspeak the only thing that seemed to reveal what was wrong were her eyes round and terrified let me infer remus offered having a gut feeling he knew that hermione reaction was about this has happened several times has it not hermione gasps and then doesntsay anything james and sirius nodded when i mentioned narcissa black james informed him lily told me once that she mentioned damocles belby and hermione did the same thing sirius piped up this means only one thing then remus decided hermione knows this girl you mean from the future sirius asked quietly hermione had lowered her hands to her lap but her bottom lip was still trembling her being here explains so much hermione whispered i need the marauder map or i need to see where parkinson is right now hermione urged when no one moved for the map james opened it and he sirius and remus poured over the map until they found her right here in the slytherin dormitories she not blinking now how long has she been blinking hermione asked quickly her mind racing depending on how long pansy parkinson had been at hogwarts in the marauders year with hermione every foreboding painful thing that happened would ve been instigated by her that cow made my life hell hermione thought viciously to herself i ll get her for this if it the last thing i do we dontreally know we just noticed it a few weeks ago but since you showed up way back in december funny things have been happening with the map sirius said uneasily the blinking is really the least of our problems but it been the most noticeable what other problems hermione asked sometimes large groups of people just well disappeared then they appear somewhere random james said others have rings around them some just look mutated sirius muttered hermione remained silent because she could offer no explanation look if we can just try and find parkinson alone i know what to do hermione said darkly we just need to be watching the map all the time the marauders all exchanged glances we can do that behind them peter muttered loudly in his sleep before shifting and falling on his shoulder he clutched his book bag buried his face in it and resumed sleeping contentedly x x x the only sound that alerted damocles was the sharp snap as the door closed jane lewis stood with a small cauldron and a goblet in her hands surprisingly no one gave me suspicious looks as they saw me carry these jane said gesturing to the objects that accompanied her she set them down on the nearest desk jane approached the cauldron damocles had set up he fidgeted nervously hoping to merlin that he had gotten the potion right the wolfsbane potion seemed to gain her approval after a long moment where she muttered to herself perfect she announced and smiled proudly at damocles you ve done it really well actually i think you would ve produced the very same thing even if i hadntstepped in i wish you would tell me how you knew damocles admitted longingly and jane gave him an apologetic half smile i d rather not i just grateful you ve agreed to this i want you to get all the fame and glory for this potion damocles jane told him seriously but you you must promise never to tell anyone that i ve helped you alright hesitantly damocles nodded how much do you need he asked after a long pause in which they both stared down at the wolfsbane potion a weeks worth the full moon starts tomorrow so it should be fine for another day jane decided damocles brought over her cauldron and the goblet she slowly started scooping potion into the goblet and emptied it into her own cauldron now listen jane started scooping more and more potion when i leave tonight make sure to tell no one but bring this to professor dumbledore tell him about your research and ask him to set you up with ministry officials and healers from saint mungo s alright they ll test it to see if it really works damocles realized and jane nodded you ll be rich before you leave school jane said quietly and damocles heart suddenly inflated with joy your werewolf friend will realize it me that made the potion then damocles said but the gryffindor shrugged i ll tell my friend you and i know each other he not going to mind as long as the potion works is he your boyfriend the question was so random that jane grip on the goblet slipped the wolfsbane potion went spilling and she dropped the cup on the floor sorry she muttered picking it up and no he not just a friend damocles stared at her and jane looked back defiantly dontbelieve me do you have a boyfriend damocles asked very quietly jane seemed to understand the intent of his question and nodded remus lupin she informed him when damocles looked away jane went back to scooping potion from his cauldron to hers in silence jane finished and stood still for a moment before speaking rather awkwardly so erm thanks damocles this really means a lot to me i wonttell anyone about you he mumbled i dontunderstand why you dontwant me to jane laughed i cantexplain if i could then there would be too many problems for me to handle i sorry i can t she added but at least you ll be happy withdrawing her wand jane cast an invisibility charm on the cauldron and using wingardium leviosa jane directed her cauldron towards the door clutching her goblet she turned the handle stepped out and with a last grateful smile at damocles belby left him alone in classroom eleven with his soon to be award winning potion he couldnthelp but feel that he had just let fortune slip out of his hands by letting jane lewis leave x x x mmmergdhfed sirius exclaimed one morning through a mouthful of food pointing down at the marauder map he tapped the parchment excitedly beckoning the other marauders and lily having sat at an emptier part of the gryffindor table the marauders were free from prying eyes as they searched for pansy parkinson the girl hermione was so keen to find james and remus shoved sirius plate away from the map and looked for the dot the dot labeled pansy parkinson was sitting at the slytherin table across from lucius malfoy and narcissa black but that rose sanders lily argued pointing across the hall the four boys looked up and they too saw that rose sanders was sitting across from malfoy and black chatting amiably and jane lewis is hermione granger remus said quietly dontyou understand jane lily shrieked as soon as the gryffindor stepped into the great hall we found it hermione hurried over sliding across the bench next to remus and grabbing the map her finger quickly found pansy parkinson but when hermione searched the slytherin table she frowned abruptly hermione gasped rose sanders that must mean flipping the map and opening a different flap hermione hands sought out the slytherin house wanting desperately to be right to finally verify the sneaking suspicion the marauders and lily looked on apprehensively only reacting when hermione yelled triumphantly the polyjuice potion hermione exclaimed dontyou get it pansy and rose have been switching off the role of rose sanders this makes so much sense but why would they do that remus questioned and despite hermione mouth opening automatically to reply she could come up with nothing it took longer than expected for hermione to procure a reasonable excuse for why pansy was there darien parkinson is her father isnthe obviously her father had something to do with it but what about rose rose sanders played an even larger part than this faceless darien parkinson point out darien parkinson hermione murmured the marauders did so quickly and hermione studied him dark longish brown hair that fell around his ears a short buttoned nose dark quick eyes and a smirk that hermione had always seen on pansy lips and rose tied in a plait today rose lighter brown hair curled slightly by the looks of the end of her braid and her nose was longer face pointed and irises a faint blue or green but the epiphany arrived as she watched rose throw back her head and laugh a derisive shriek that hermione knew that must mean i know what she doing hermione said finally voice low and dark well what that going to do for us sirius wanted to know hermione smiled slowly coming to understand that she could revel in this newly discovered fact pushing herself up hermione walked around the gryffindor table and marched boldly across the hall gaining little attention except from the slytherin table each student she passed quieted and the staff table seemed more alert hermione stood near the only person she could feel remotely comfortable near snape he gave her a disgusted look and pushed his classmates down just so he could get away from her hermione stood in the little clearing and smiled viciously at pansy rose sanders hermione yelled and after a moment the slytherin girl turned and glared at her you ve made me lose my appetite mudblood rose sighed pushing aware her food if you ever thought that i was in trouble for being who i am hermione accused stoutly then think again rose i know you re little secret and all about you and your mum how did she enjoy plucking hairs from her head every few hours rose blanched and she looked shocked that right i ll see you at school hermione watched in satisfaction as rose or better yet pansy parkinson paler than a ghost looked around for some sort of support found none and got up from the bench this is far from over pansy screamed but despite her threat she turned and ran from the safety of the great hall revenge was never sweeter x x x author notes next chapter there will be a bit more on pansy so i hope your shock here just keeps your curiosity going i really enjoyed writing this chapter as its getting closer and closer to the end of the story and less complicated but more intense well it is for me anyway lol oh and also this chapter is totally dedicated to my awesome friend faithful wheezy mmmergdhfed thanks for reading so please review author note hey so really long hiatus huh i hate me too dontworry please just enjoy this as much as you can disclaimer do i own harry potter lord it would be nice but i don t waaah still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty one the beginning of the end rose sanders hermione yelled and after a moment the slytherin girl turned and glared at her you ve made me lose my appetite mudblood rose sighed pushing aware her food if you ever thought that i was in trouble for being who i am hermione accused stoutly then think again rose i know you re little secret and all about you and your mum how did she enjoy plucking hairs from her head every few hours rose blanched and she looked shocked that right i ll see you at school hermione watched in satisfaction as rose or better yet pansy parkinson paler than a ghost looked around for some sort of support found none and got up from the bench this is far from over pansy screamed but despite her threat she turned and ran from the safety of the great hall revenge was never sweeter pansy swift footsteps echoed off the corridor walls reminding her of her own hammering heart there was no one in her path to question her sprint or the terrified look on her face or the way she heaved for breath eternam pansy panted as she finally came to rest in front of the slytherin entryway everything that was comforting about the slytherin common rooms the slimy walls and dank musty air and the sleek couches were ignored as pansy hastily scrambled towards the dormitories she pushed past the regular doors even those to her own bedroom at the top of the staircase was the stone wall beckoning her to smash her own head due to foolishness rather than inviting her through basilicus she murmured lucius private dormitories were revealed and pansy pushed her way through without a second thought why are you back so soon it was not pansy who spoke this but the facsimile of her rather the original for pansy was disguised pansy throat released a growl as she stamped around rose sanders watching her carefully from the bed i dontknow how and i dontknow when but the mudblood knows she just ran up to me in the great hall as if she had nothing to fear nothing to lose pansy stammered this puts everything in jeopardy hush rose said quietly but pansy ignored her pacing the room with bulging fearful eyes now that she knows she ll surely go to that crackpot fool dumbledore and pansy please that will spill over into my own time and this damn mission will never be accomplished stop it rose interrupted her finally standing up approaching pansy with an easy coolness she guided the girl to sit down on the bed and relax for a moment now this is easily taken care of how you simply must stay in the dormitories at all costs i can bring you food and you will stay out of sight they can do nothing against you if you are never seen but what if there are no but ifs this will be handled easily i promise the identical girls looked at each other one fearfully and anxiously while the other collected a calm smirk upon her face it was in that moment that the door handled turned and the rightful owner of the private chambers stepped in what exactly just happened lucius asked in a silky voice but both girls could see the fury in his eyes do you understand the weight of the situation now how can you just be sitting in here like lame ducks while surely that mudblood has already begun her plan to take us down while we are weak if she cantsee pansy there is no plan rose shot back narrowing her eyes against his own fierce look i going to have it arranged so pansy will never have to leave the privacy of the slytherin fool lucius snarled whatever means they used to discover this will be used against to find pansy in here that leaves us with only one option then rose said quietly lucius and rose turned their eyes to pansy who was still trying to quell her own anxiety she looked between the two slytherins shaking her head in denial you cantsend me back and risk everything that we have gained so far lucius roared at her how dare you be so selfish we cannot jeopardize this mission the dark lord will be most displeased if anything else goes wrong rose murmured putting a hand regretfully on pansy s who ripped her hand away angrily this will destroy my future with the dark lord pansy seethed let me stay and somehow prove her wrong no lucius spat you ll be gone by midnight we canthost this sort of danger granger has so many allies now and we know they are not complete imbeciles whether or not the mudblood has the nerve to reveal you the rest of her little gryffindor gang will do so in a heartbeat you must go pansy shoulders hunched in defeat at this although there was still a spiteful glint in her eyes i will get her back for this i dontcare when but i will rose touched her shoulder and in her eyes there was also a spiteful glint i have a plan x x x she probably crying no she probably the new moaning myrtle moaning rose no no that doesntflow how about retching rose wait isnther name pansy puking pansy that it lily and hermione shared a sideways look at each other as james and sirius excitedly discussed the state of being pansy parkinson could possibly be in but why is she puking because because because sirius finished resolutely she doesntneed a reason just leave her alone oh no i want to know why she puking james argued devilishly grinning she just is sirius stated heatedly before letting off a feigned sigh of aggravation that sounded suspiciously feminine the group was back at the gryffindor common rooms although the clear blue skies beckoned them outside the confrontation of pansy had only happened hours ago but the triumph hermione felt made it seem like days she and lily were working on a study list for the upcoming exams which was more out of habit for hermione rather than necessity but the mind of hermione granger kept drifting not pleasantly but not unpleasantly either what will pansy do there no possible way she can stay in the castle although it is impossible for her to leave without being noticed should i tell dumbledore the obvious answer is yes but then by adding more to my revenge surely they ll have a way of getting back their ranks were not completely destroyed by the expulsion but harmed enough i sure what could they do to get back at me knut for your thoughts remus had finally arrived smiling easily at hermione as he sank into the couch next to her just thinking about the next plan of attack she responded touching his hair with a rush of affection why more attack this question was a serious one you ve hit their weak spot there nothing left to do they ll leave you alone for sure i wish that was true remus hermione murmured but pansy was never one to lie back and take a hit even if she doesntdo it herself she ll get back at me i think you re over thinking this remus said gently hermione shrugged isntit better to be over prepared than to be completely oblivious it was almost as if the slytherins were listening and agreeing with hermione claim for in the next instant an owl swooped into the room dropping something onto her lap remus gaped at it while hermione cautiously picked it up lily leaned in from her work to eye it suspiciously as well what is it james and sirius had finally broken out of their boyish mode and appeared genuinely concerned they all watched as hermione slowly opened the parchment reading over her shoulder it simply read you may have protection but you are not the weakest link anymore what does that mean oh the parchment suddenly burst into flames singeing hermione fingers and catching everyone by surprise you are not the weakest link anymore lily repeated if you aren t then who is suddenly it all made sense this is what dumbledore warned me about this is what i ve been waiting to happen for months now why didnti think of protecting him before swallowing the trepidation rising within her hermione whispered where peter x x x after scouring the marauder map for fifteen minutes they located peter pettigrew in the back of the library lily released a sigh of relief studying she assured them however it was james finger that pointed to the others who were in the library emma sirius said grimly wormtail is in trouble we dontknow that for sure i mean emma isnteven near peter she on the other side of the library lily reasoned lily right remus agreed we should still get him out of there though just in case emma decides to pull a fast one james said the five of them started out towards the library concocting stories that might lure peter into staying with his rightful group entering quietly and with caution the five of them snuck behind the bookshelves and looked for peter it was sirius who found him first and who promptly latched himself onto the small boy petey we ve been looking all over for you sirius said cheerfully peter looked uncomfortable at sirius words and tried to hide behind the stacks of books and parchment he had around him i busy right now sirius peter said quietly lily arrived next pushing sirius out of the chair with as much grace as she could and a feigned smile plastered on her face what are you studying peter maybe i could help you lily suggested but peter seemed to shrink under lily gaze and simply said i ve got it under control thanks james was next firewhiskey wormtail peter shook his head while lily smacked her boyfriend at last remus and hermione showed up remus pulled a bar of chocolate out of his pocket and handed it to peter who looked grateful for something to eat almost as if there was no one around hermione sat down next to peter and touched his arm what you have been going through recently has been a terrible thing peter i sorry that we disregarded your feelings while everything was in a hype because your situation is more dire and tender than anyone else s i want to help you she said softly after a tense moment where peter looked distrustfully into hermione gentle welcoming eyes he promptly burst into tears and threw himself into her open arms hermione held him while james and sirius argued in whispered voices that their plans would have been more effective if peter had been in his right state of mind remus and lily just exchanged a worried and exhausted look and joined hermione as she rubbed peter back in an effort to make him feel better in a few minutes peter calmed down he wiped his face on his robes looking red faced and embarrassed that he had cried in front of all of them they assured him it was alright asking if they could do anything to make him feel better peter flushed under the simultaneous attention feeling torn and rushed hermione touched his arm again and offered to take him to the kitchens to get something to eat because he looked pale it was the only thing he heard out of all the noise between his friends he nodded and hermione smiled i think this venture is best left between us she suggested to the group peter shied away from their protests but hermione shook her head that sounds like a lovely plan remus said stepping in line next to hermione why dontyou come back and get the cloak though just in case there are slytherins the girl looked to peter who nodded just in case he agreed quietly when the cloak had finally been acquired the group settled back into their normal activities lily was studying james and sirius were poking fun at each other and remus was reading before hermione and peter left however remus kissed her swiftly on the cheek i hope you dontmind but i ll be watching the map at all times and i will probably be lurking a floor above you just in case he added with a wink hermione grinned at him before leaving the trip down to the kitchens was a rather silent one although the tension was heavy between them hermione wasntsure to go about asking questions and peter was trying to shut himself down before she opened him up again yet the two continued on towards the kitchen huddled together beneath the cloak passing no one the corridors were eerily silent and if hermione mind wasntpreoccupied with what to say to peter she would have been nervous finally upon arrival peter was bombarded by house elves who caught onto his paleness they presented an array of food to help cheer and fill him up and would not allow him to sit without trying at least everything i glad you re eating you looked very pale hermione said at last peter gave her a small smile before grabbing a turkey leg things are just hard you know with the exams and my m mother peter informed her trying to maintain his composure when is her burial hermione asked cautiously i sure dumbledore will let you her body wasntfound this was said with such stiffness hermione thought the poor boy might snap in two they they said that it was an accident and that the wreckage was too great to find her body so many others died with her i just once again hermione touched his arm and this seemed to soothe him he was slowly approaching his breaking point but her touched pulled him back to reality and he was able to hold it together my mother hates muggles so there no reason why she should ve been on the london underground hermione eye widened she remembered the stories from her parents who had lost a friend to the great disaster many years ago a terrorist bombing they had called it but i hadntrealized oh peter i so sorry hermione whispered doe eyed with fear peter stared across the room his jaw taut and quivering they must ve must ve used the imperious curse on her to make her get onto the tube the muggles did their body counts but so many others could not be identified and had been lost that it was impossible to find her hermione mind was racing if there were so many muggles and peter mother was on the london underground so many things could have happened there might have been a chance that she escaped or had been captured or peter began hermione slowly dontyou think there a chance that someone sent me a piece of her wand it had blood on it horrified hermione clapped a hand to her mouth who would and they sent a letter with it too peter uttered now looking glassy eyed where is the letter now just after i managed to read it it began to burn all by itself like in those self destruct muggle movies lily always showed us just like my letter hermione thought what did it say she asked her body tensed before she could ask the question did she really want to know the scarring words that had been haunting peter for the last few weeks peter turned away from her his body hunched and trembling i can t i can t please she urged nothing bad will happen if you tell me i promise i wontsay anything i can t he croaked she touched his shoulder but instead of warming to her like he had been he pulled away from her he stood up back still to her and moved away peter please i want to help you hermione begged going after him peter darted away from her and out of the kitchens his sobs echoing off the lonely corridor walls standing in the empty kitchen hermione looked around and heaved a great sigh wondering if anything would ever be accomplished with peter what use do they have with peter hermione mused cupping her forehead in her hands he knows what they know and they already know what he knows about me there is nothing about him that is of any use not yet anyway but perhaps these things are not being done to have an instant effect just as dumbledore said by pulling the group apart at the weakest link it makes us all weak in the end maybe voldemort is getting a head start but has harry prophecy even been made yet no surely not so how can he know perhaps voldemort recognizes that he must infiltrate the order of the phoenix but cannot do so directly hermione could just imagine the possibilities with that idea however gruesome they were as she remembered her fifth year when harry was so tormented by simply dreams and nightmares it appeared that getting peter to crack would be easy if he was still under pressure and incredibly sensitive one thing was for sure however hermione knew that no matter what peter was going to betray them all she could not stop him from doing it but the very least she could do was make him feel guilty about it x x x it was june the sky was a calming blue stretching out above them like a tired but beautiful canvas the great lake glistened under the constant sun the squid sun bathing in the shallows while the envious students stayed cooped up hiding behind text books and book shelves wand movements and essays and memorized charms ingredients instructions and so much more this is unbearable sirius heaved throwing a hand upon his forehead with a loud huff he turned to look out the window padfoot you ll never get out of hogwarts if you dontstudy peter chided him behind her book hermione smiled their conversation in the kitchen may not have reaped wonderful results but it did bring peter back into the group at least peter is right sirius lily agreed her quill racing across her parchment as she began a new line ink splattered her nose unbeknownst to her sirius giggled we have this one last day to study and then you wonthave to worry about anything else i promise james said lily boyfriend was being quite diligent himself working just as fast as lily was for once his title as head boy really seemed to suit him but i dont wanna sirius whined now now remus said shaking a finger at him you must do your work sirius no sirius pouted crossing his arms and sticking his nose in the air sirius yes no sirius no sirius it was hermione this time yes he answered excitedly she grinned you said yes do your work no the marauder laughed at their friend lack of assiduousness and continued on with their own work sirius huffed some more making more noise was necessary i bored he announced no one seemed to notice his and for his he released a dramatic loud sigh so bored he said again upset at the lack of attention sirius muttered to himself and dug around in his bag to look for something to do there he found the marauder map unfolding it he looked around giving a loud sigh every so often to remind his friends how bored he was and then he saw pansy parkinson blinking on the map hermione sirius said slowly pansy is blinking again this instantly gained the attention of everyone but none more so than hermione who took the map from sirius at once she inspected pansy movements closely and saw the adjacent dots were lucius and rose why does it blink hermione mused perhaps she is time travelling that the only way she can even explain her presence here anyway look the three dots were headed out of their dormitory and down the corridor more and more people began to join them until it seemed that illimni they re having another meeting hermione said at once can we go spy on them sirius suggested i have a better idea let set dumbledore on them or a professor we cantkeep running headfirst into these things she said wisely they all agreed to go to the headmaster when suddenly they were interrupted an owl swooped into the common room and dropped something into hermione hands hermione looked to remus anxiously who squeezed her shoulder slowly she opened the letter i know you re watching me this is your last chance before the inevitable happens just like before moments after hermione had finished reading it the parchment began to curl and hiss into flames peter jaw dropped with an audible gasp what should we do hermione whispered we re all going this time remus said firmly but why would she just invite you down there lily asked suspiciously because but hermione mind could not come up with a solution what could they want with her what could pansy have to tell her that hermione didntalready know what about dumbledore they wouldntinvite you to a killing spree hermione i think we ll be alright this time if all of us are going and it in this empty classroom they re all headed for it okay we re close enough to hull office she ll hear any commotion remus soothed her but if hull is so close why dontwe just have her sneak into the meeting the marauder exchanged looks do you really want her getting involved in this x x x treading the last corner with a great deal of caution the marauder s lily and hermione entered the empty classroom that the illimni seemed to be gathered in it was quiet as the gryffindors stepped in although the air was tense and thick with hatred girls sat and stood glaring at hermione as they filed in there was a noticeable lack of members however which pleased hermione immensely the expulsion had at least done them some good pansy stepped out from the crowd a sneer on her face that had always seemed permanent narcissa rose and emma were just behind her what do you want me here for hermione finally said in a hard clear voice i just want you to know something before i leave here granger pansy said her voice sickeningly sweet she began to walk towards hermione and speak very quietly remus squeezed her shoulder once again although hermione heart began to hammer in her ears all of this will be left behind no one will remember you or me or any of this no one can save you and you cantprove that any of this happened it doesntmatter that you have friends here or things happened that you didntenjoy or even that you have a relationship with your filthy little werewolf pansy hissed eyes narrowed you say that like you have some control over the situation hermione countered who are you to say what my future will be pansy threw back her head and shrieked with laughter you think you can carry on a relationship with a professor do you really think you can go and tell potty and weasel that you befriended his parents pansy laughter turned into a cackle as hermione face began to empty of color you can make all the peace you want and you can get all the revenge on me and on the illimni and on lucius that you want but do you think anyone will believe you the world was spinning beneath her feet and nausea crept up her throat eyes opened or closed it didntmatter everything was spiraling away from hermione as soon as she reached out to grab it everything that she cherished was stolen smashed to pieces without warning i will believe her it wontmatter how old i am sirius shouted and i ll be there said james fiercely and so will i lily added intensely hermione didntdare look over her shoulder to acknowledge these promises her eyes were locked with pansy s who had a triumphant sneer upon her face lily and james would be dead peter with be with the dark lord sirius would have been alive to support her but by the time she got back he would also be dead and remus i wont ever leave you hermione remus promised in a growl holding onto her even tighter pansy grin was sickening then without any words spoken the illimni began to file out of the room one by one until only pansy rose and emma were left it was then that lucius entered the room the marauder instinctively pulled hermione behind them but nothing would tear the dark smug faces out of her mind as the slytherins left pansy was right i will be all alone x x x so that it huh lily asked it was midnight and the two girls were lying in bed but neither one could sleep if they listened quietly they could hear their boyfriends snoring i hope so hermione said quietly it just seems strange it was almost as if they didnteven put up a fight after everything that happened i know hermione agreed absently earlier hermione had watched pansy dot blink until it gradually faded away and she was gone entirely back to 1998 where she belonged hermione didntknow whether to feel jealous or pleased jealous because hermione wanted her actions to be that simple or pleased because pansy was finally out of her hair whichever feeling she felt it didntmatter everything pansy said was right 100 absolutely correct it was a feeling that clawed the inside of hermione chest scratching and chipping away at her core until she felt like she could no longer breathe let alone feel properly she tried to hold on to all of these pleasant memories she had just recently developed but they were being ripped away regardless ripped away from hermione just as she soon would be from the marauder and lily ripped away from this new home and safety i ll be right back hermione murmured she pushed off her covers and walked blindly out of her dormitory i donthave much time left cold feet directed her robotically down the stairs and into the boys dormitory where remus was sleeping i could be taken away back home in any instant her fingers guided her through the blackness and sought out the familiarity of remus sleeping body i will have so many regrets so many things left to say remus hermione whispered shaking him i have to say goodbye as soon as i can just in case so that at least i will have these memories her boyfriend groaned and turned over rubbing his eyes he gave her a weary smile before moving over to one side of bed and offering her what was left for room i cannot let my love go unexpressed any longer because it will be torn away he will be torn away hermione did not climb into bed but instead silently began to unbutton her pajamas hermione what i love you she whispered and the bulk of her clothes hit the floor with a soft thud remus sat up wide eyed staring into her eyes what are you doing he murmured please was all she could say feeling around remus snatched his wand from the bedside table and proceeding to put silencing charms on his bed hangings when he was done he swallowed the nervous lump in his throat and invited hermione to lay beside him pulling the curtains around his bed he was wide awake with the fear of getting caught but also with the adrenaline that was pumping through him why now he asked her quietly because i dontknow when i ll be sent home and things are so complicated in the future you would share this with me then in whatever time we have please can we remus hushed her with a gentle finger to her lips his hand found its way to her cheek his mouth to his lips and his body to hers that night it was if nothing else mattered and no other love existed but their own x x x author note well hopefully i will pump out the last couple chapters this week i really have no life right now so it will be awesomeeeee sorry for like a couple years worth of wait please review author note pumping these out like a champ disclaimer nope i dontown harry potter it would be nice though still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty two understanding why now he asked her quietly because i dontknow when i ll be sent home and things are so complicated in the future you would not share this with me then in whatever time we have please can we remus hushed her with a gentle finger to her lips his hand found its way to her cheek his mouth to his lips and his body to hers that night it was if nothing else mattered and no other love existed but their own while the entirety of the seventh years completed their newt s jane lewis could be seen lounging about the great lake at any given hour reading a book in the shade or staring contemplatively at the sky there were whispered rumors about her still but she seemed to be unaware that others had spent time defaming her character for you see jane lewis seemed to have moved on in life these past months she had caused quite a stir and in the aftermath of the chaos she seemed to be at peace with everything first years travelled by her in cautious clumps whispering about her while others passed by alone unmoved by her reputation whatever they did though jane lewis simply did not care to the quick observer it would seem that she was enjoying this time alone by being outside basking in the warm weather but to the trained eye miss jane lewis was planning her thoughts were racing in her head ideas being strung together like tinsel on a christmas tree she appeared to be calm but that was only because she was sitting still silently doing noticeably nothing to a miss hermione granger she was planning something that she had been preparing for in the next week the moon would be full and she knew that remus would be far away from her body and mind torn away from the comfort that she was however she had a gift for him one that would at least quell the confusion and pain that he succumbed to every month one that would bring remus lupin a little bit closer to him how would she give him this gift should there be others around when should she do it should she tell him what it was there were many questions to be answered and many more questions to come after that her questions were put to rest as the seventh years piled out into the courtyard to finally enjoy the start of summer the marauders were quick to be at hermione side remus found her first and with a soft kiss they smiled at each other so how was it she asked once everyone had spread out on the grass around her uuuugggghhhh was all sirius could manage to utter before rolling over onto his stomach i second that james said wearily throwing an arm around lily i wish i had studied more last night peter said with a yawn i must ve got half of those essays wrong well i thought that ugh sirius moaned again the group looked at him but he still remained face down on the grass what padfoot means to say is please stop talking about the exams james explained with a sage nod mmmergdhfed sirius agreed with a muffled noise what about you remus hermione asked turning to nudge his cheek with her nose he grinned and planted a kiss on her jaw it was difficult yes but that was to be expected i just glad it over he said with a sigh me too peter agreed five days left of school though i so glad we have nothing to do for the next five days we can just relax do nothing swim sleep mmmergdhfed sirius chimed in again however this prompted him turn over onto his back we should sneak into hogsmeade tonight to celebrate yes yes well i can look the other way as you boys sneak out i suppose lily said with grin james suddenly pounced on her pulling her into a hug on the ground oh no you re coming with me james growled playfully the rest of the group turned away as the couple proceeded kiss happily i like it hermione piped up sirius cheered she likes it we re going and so they went that night the marauders and the girls snuck as fast as they could to the grounds later that night peter transforming into his rat state so that they could get past the whomping willow what shall we do when we get there hissed lily as they hurried into the hole beneath the tree my darling we are going to have firewhiskey tonight or butterbeer if you re into that james added quickly at lily stern look when they got to the three broomsticks the marauders were met with several other seventh years who managed to sneak out in their own way james promised his friends alcohol and after swaggering to the bar and persuading that completing their newt deserved at least one drink there was firewhiskey all around and butterbeer as well james poured drinks into shot glasses and everyone picked theirs up james held up his glass and with a great fake sniff said you guys i just cantbelieve ah drink it already potter lily exclaimed to life to life james shouted l chaim hermione and lily sang giggling at their muggle reference the marauders downed their drinks laughing as it burned their throats and pouring more all night it was laughter all around nothing but grins and dares and kissing and fun for once hermione felt completely at ease x x x five days later everyone was packing their things the great hall was an anticipated event filled with food drinks and cheer dumbledore speech would bid them farewell good luck and welcome to the returning students hermione had gotten a letter from dumbledore to come to his office a half hour before the final dinner and hermione hoped it would not be solemn meeting i think he ll just want to know how everything went finally remus suggested as he folded his socks hermione was sitting on his bed watching him back and thinking out loud do you think i should ask him if i should do anything else or if they ll do anything else remus laughed gently and put aside his socks he went to her and cupped her face in his hands you must stop worrying he said with a kiss to her forehead she smiled but rolled her eyes but i told you remus silenced her with a kiss we re leaving tonight you have nothing left to worry about okay except that wherever i manage to stay they ll find me or something hermione said playfully my house has complete defensive charms around it you ll be fine dontworry hermione heart skipped a beat your house remus grinned running a hand through her hair would you want to stay anywhere else hermione laughed and hugged him resting her head beneath his chin you know that comment was kind of pretentious she teased pretentious how this for pretentious remus grabbed her beneath the legs and flipped her onto the bed and the couple shrieked with laughter as they ruined all of remus careful piles of clothing with their laughter and love they had just started kissing when sirius and james walked in and i was all like damn it mooney put a tie on the doorknob or something sirius exclaimed we were just we were doing anything james sang mocking them give me a break james remus chortled and hermione threw a pillow at him for extra measure james ducked just in time but then lily and peter arrived chatting still about their exams the pillow meant for james hit lily directly in the face what he did it james and sirius screamed pointing at each other lily picked up the pillow and looked carefully at it well i outta and without further ado began chasing the boy around the room peter picked up another pillow and began hitting whoever was closest to him at this point remus and hermione decided to join the fun and began hitting with their pillows as well james and sirius were the most vicious with their pillows but lily was not to be underestimated for she was the quickest peter rarely got hit but remus recovered the fastest hermione possessed none of these skills and simply got hit time and time again in one particular moment james decided to just swoop around in a circle and hit whatever was in his way lily saw this and dived for james knees which forced him to fall and topple into hermione who brought remus down with her it was now a faceoff between sirius and peter in the fashion of an old western gun fight sirius and padfoot eyed each other suspiciously hands twitching eyes unblinking before they roared and attacked each other go peter whack him whack him go for the belly no the knees kick him in the nads sirius the strange new voice captured sirius attention instantly and peter hit sirius head with such a force that the black toppled over peter took in a big triumphant breathe i then peter saw who was standing in the doorway win it was emma the fun that had been gained was now replaced with crackling tension what do you want sirius asked in a low voice quiet but angry i i just wanted to say that i sorry emma said quietly she was standing just outside the doorway wringing her hands together anxiously sorry for what sirius growled emma squeezed her eyes and tried to relieve her trembling with a shaky sigh for hurting you emma exclaimed with a barely contained sob his eyes remained cold and hard but all his friends could see were his hands which were clenching and unclenching in indecision as tears began to escape emma eyes sirius asked her very quietly is that all you re sorry for with an astounded offended look she glanced at hermione and back at sirius you you cantexpect me to be sorry about her you are my boyfriend i had to defend you at all costs oh come off it emma lily snapped you shut your dirty little mouth emma hissed hey donttalk to her like that james snarled you know that she kissed sirius right i saw it with my own two eyes she a little lying whore emma spat get out sirius said at last w what emma stammered eyes wide but sirius dontyou get out he bellowed i dontwant to hear another second of your shit you re just like rose and narcissa and bellatrix you re just like them they made me sirius emma screamed you think i wanted to do all of those things hogwash sirius cut across get the hell out of my dorm no she croaked eyes narrowing you re really choosing her over me that good for nothing mudblood i wontsay it again emma sirius snarled she will bring you nothing but trouble at least i can offer you protection emma pleaded torn between fury and desperation out sirius barked no emma shouted suddenly hermione was standing beside sirius eyes set on emma face you heard him get out hermione said with a certain coolness to her voice who the hell do you think smack the force of hermione hit send emma reeling backward and hermione simply slammed the door shut and locked it with a charm she turned around to face the group who was staring at her gaping well now that this is nice and awkward let pack shall we x x x good evening miss granger dumbledore greeted as hermione quietly slid into his office professor hermione returned with a smile would you care for a lemon drop dumbledore offered but the girl shook her head with a laugh quite honestly i ve never really liked them much to each his own one must say the headmaster replied sagely now to be frank you must be wondering why i ve beckoned you this evening i had been curious but i decided that you simply wanted to know how the rest of the year has turned out for me before i finally leave hermione suggested you are quite right dumbledore replied but there is something else something good or bad it depends on your point of view i believe dumbledore murmured which would you like to discuss first miss granger your recent happenings or the information i have for you undeniably the information sir hermione gushed with a sheepish smile hopefully it not bad news but i suppose bad news is better than no news dumbledore cleared his throat before carefully removing a piece of parchment from inside his robes you do recall the letter i had you bring to my past self several weeks ago yes of course professor well apparently miss granger when you return home you are to visit back here briefly to give me another letter would you like to read it dumbledore offered holding it out for hermione to take moving without a moment hesitation hermione carefully examined the letter there were several stains on the parchment almost as if they were dried tears carefully however she began to unfold the letter and read my dear self i am writing from the year 1998 i cannot tell you the details of what is happening but my only details will include a singular person hermione granger she came into your hands approximately december and will leave to her proper time at exactly midnight on july 7 1979 please inform miss granger that she will return in the same fashion that she arrived when she returns to her proper time she is to immediately come to your office in order to deliver this letter to you sincerely me the breath escaped from her lung taking with it hermione ability to remain calm and also her keen sense of logic july seventh she sputtered that s fifteen days yes dumbledore sighed i believe it is enough time for you to get your affairs in order miss granger without thinking without giving permission to her body hermione sank into the nearest chair her mind desperately clutching at some sort of understanding 15 days 15 days she had only just settled her battles had only just begun to fully appreciate her relationship with remus had only just begun to love those around her who protected her no matter what they would do in the future canti stay longer hermione uttered i have no control over the charm that keeps you here miss granger it is not up to me no i suppose not but after that hermione could stay no longer she felt an urgent need to escape and meticulously plan every moment of her remaining time with remus there were thousands of questions that buzzed in her head but she acknowledged only one of them should she tell remus or not x x x the heavy question occupied every brain cell in hermione mind and for once it did not seem that anything could overshadow it troubled hermione rushed down dumbledore spiral staircase and towards the great hall wanting nothing more than to attach herself to remus and lily and james and her friends just so that she might have one more precious moment with them before she was ripped away fifteen days it will take me that long to settle in at remus to get used to another strange home and feel comfortable around more strangers that are sure to leave me soon fifteen days to get my wits together and decide how i will handle the future or my time i suppose what am i supposed to tell harry and ron and she couldntlet pansy reminder cross her mind what about remus what about pansy will she constantly torment me of what i ve lost here a horrified thought crossed her mind what about lucius that made a chill creep up her spine the thought of a forty something year old man making a pass at her was more disgusting than anything she could imagine but then there would surely be no reason for lucius to even acknowledge the things he had done what reason would he have i cantworry myself with that now hermione chided herself there are more pressing issues like losing remus ah granger all alone again said the silky voice that cut through her skittish thoughts hermione whirled around to see lucius and narcissa strolling in the hallway towards the great hall it does not make difference anymore hermione shot back you canteven come near me and she is no match for me i wouldntsay that so quickly narcissa purred you dontknow what i capable of i know you re not capable of anything without the illimni behind you neither one of you are hermione hissed malfoy would be nothing without your pack of girls following his directions and without his directions your pack of girls would get nothing accomplished do you honestly think terrorizing people will win your favor with lord voldemort filthy little mudblood you dare say his name narcissa spat i am not scared to speak the name of a weak tyrant who will soon meet his downfall hermione retorted he is everything i am against why should i succumb to fearing his name if will succumb to nothing else lucius had remained quiet until now watching the heated fight between the two girls it does not matter what you do or do not say granger lucius said quietly there will be no glory for you not now not ever he right a little voice said in the back of her mind angrily hermione shook her head both to quell the voice and to disregard lucius comment you re wrong she spat back remember granger the castle walls are my only restrictions your little friends do not stand a chance when we leave here tonight they mean nothing to you or whatever voldemort desires we both know i had all the information anyone needed and you got what you wanted so what does it matter granger dontpretend to be so innocent they are just as precious to dumbledore as you are you are not the only one with eyes you will never find us malfoy she growled i will not let him scare me hermione thought with this she turned on her heel and began to march away hoping to let off the steam that had so vigorously gathered however he would not let her leave without a bone chilling comment i will be watching you granger lucius called after her now and until the dark lord prevails x x x the festivities for the last feast were incredible as was dumbledore final speech the winning of the house cup and the air was thick with excitement and joy reluctance and sadness but regardless of the final feelings of the students everyone was buzzing with energy free from worry except of course hermione to the rest of the gryffindors it seemed that jane lewis was simply having a bad day her eyes were trained on her plate which was full of untouched food and her face was paler than usual her friends of course realized this but were trying to remain upbeat and happy for this was their last time together with every single one of their friends remus lupin had an arm draped across her back every now and then giving her a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder this attitude of jane lewis remained throughout the entire feast as well as the train ride back to king cross as the marauders played game after game of exploding snap or chatted and swapped stories hermione simply stared at the countryside racing past them lily would throw concerned looks at remus every now and then who looked as if he were at a loss of what to do james would nudge his friend every now and then trying to make the werewolf confront her finally remus could stand it no longer hermione what wrong any playfulness in the compartment instantly vanished you ve been so silent since dinner lily reminded her let us help you as soon as we settle once we re all at home we re going to be attacked hermione said quietly never taking her eyes off the countryside i dontknow this for a fact but it is the summer voldemort will use every force he can to destroy the order the order james asked hermione whipped around they haventbeen inducted yet it you ll soon find out but our efforts will be futile because the illimni can act freely once we are all back home hermione assured them gravely dontyou remember all they would ever tell us is that the castle walls were their only restriction but why would they sirius asked they ve got all the information from you they could possibly want what else can they do i dontmatter anymore hermione hissed i ll be gone very soon and it not me they want anymore gone they all echoed and what could they possibly want from us like every other moment hermione mind met a dead end how could she honestly answer their questions without destroying the delicate future remus seemed to know exactly what she was thinking and reasoned if you told us what happened we could avoid it we could stop them hermione hesitated beginning to tremble with the honesty that was infiltrating their conversation i dontknow what happens in between remus only only the disaster that is the final result she said solemnly why disaster lily asked quietly because voldemort is very powerful and he wants nothing more than to eradicate anything that stands in his way hermione croaked wiping away the tears that had slowly begun to escape her eyes you re saying then that we re all to be snuffed out peter said slowly as if he were on the verge of just figuring out the true implications of his words how do i say no to such a devastating question heavy was her heart but even heavier was her conscience how could she look all these people that she loved in the eye and tell them no they would not die but would prevail against evil forces just just love each other as deeply and honestly as you can hermione whispered her face now shiny with tears that way if the worst happens you know that every precious moment of your lives meant something she could take it no longer she burst out of the compartment overwhelmed with the sadness of the situation and the upcoming tragedy she would be absent from how could she go on living and breathing when everyone she loved would soon be dead only fifteen days left x x x author note so i just want to explain something really quick the letter dumbledore let hermione read is slightly confusing as you may know this is what is happening when hermione goes back to her proper time she goes to dumbledore office at which time he writes the letter then he sends hermione back in time for just a moment to deliver that letter this is only done to inform the past dumbledore of the hermione showing up because the present dumbledore knows how all of this already went down so confusing hopefully only 5 more chapters left also the rest of this story is dedicated to faithful wheezy because she inspired me to pick this story back up please review n ote so this chapter isntwhat i would call boring but it not really action packed it mostly just information hopefully still enjoyable though disclaimer i do not own harry potter just some oc that are hanging around in my story still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty three decisions heavy was her heart but even heavier was her conscience how could she look all these people that she loved in the eye and tell them no they would not die but would prevail against evil forces just just love each other as deeply and honestly as you can hermione whispered her face now shiny with tears that way if the worst happens you know that every precious moment of your lives meant something she could take it no longer she burst out of the compartment overwhelmed with the sadness of the situation and the upcoming tragedy she would be absent from how could she go on living and breathing when everyone she loved would soon be dead only fifteen days left by the end of the train ride remus had managed to calm hermione down though she still remained rather quiet she did not look as mournful and troubled as she did before so mooney padfoot wormtail james began i think some mischief is in order at my house once we re all settled in what sort of mischief lily asked cautiously brow quirked oh nothing too bad bewitching the kitchen when my mother is trying to cook putting impervious charms on all the chairs those sorts of things james informed her and the marauders chuckled they sound like very immature pranks lily started to say but james cut her off with a no no no no no shhh they could be doing much worse hermione reminded her redheaded friend our pranks have always bordered on slightly dangerous sirius admitted with a grin we just want a bit of fun lilykins james cooed snuggling up to her she rolled her eyes and shoved him away but everyone could see her flushed smile fine she said at last at least let me be there for it though lily taking part in mischief remus gasped feigning horror i never thought the day would come well we best have fun while we still can right lily proposed although her words held a hint of solemnity exactly james agreed anyway i decided it would best to do everything next week seeing as the full moon is this weekend and poor old mooney wontbe able to move until at least tuesday that very true remus agreed he turned to hermione i ll be with you for a few days before i transform but you may end up being all alone with my mother for a few days as well oh that alright remus i dontmind hermione said and you could always stay with me too lily said granted my sister isnthome but she always off with her ruddy boyfriend so it shouldntbe too bad that sounds inviting as well hermione mused i ll owl you and let you know james took over the conversation once again and the marauders plotted their upcoming mischief and pranks making the girls laugh and cringe with their ideas on the other side of the train slytherins were doing something very similar although instead of plotting mischief they were plotting something terrible lucius was lounging in the compartment while the most active members of the illimni were talking feverishly swapping ideas on where and when to attack or even to attack at all you must remember they ll be expecting us to come knocking at their front door wands at the ready narcissa reminded her female companions all of our attacks have been much too upfront so subtlety is key if we are not to attack up front then we must have an in and since pettigrew has been so emotional over the loss of his mother i highly doubt they will let him out of their sights emma reasoned they ll expect us to go for him we need another way in pansy left me with enough information to intimidate granger if we must rose suggested enough with that mudblood lucius drawled letting his fingers crawl across narcissa back she too aware of what we ll do and what we re looking for she and pettigrew are the only soft spots how else do you intend to quietly destroy them rose shot back maybe granger isntthe mudblood we want this time emma said quietly all eyes were trained on emma danes now who looked nervous i know where evans lives i know exactly how her house works i know her mother wontknow of our ruined friendship it would be easy to steal her away emma proposed talking very quickly as if she were forcing the words out of her mouth before she could regret saying them emma looked to lucius and following suit the leading ladies of the illimni turned to do so as well lucius frowned for a moment fingers curled in narcissa blond hair while he toyed with the idea poor potter would be devastated without his beloved lucius murmured at last he d be willing to do anything to get her back he d be hysterical narcissa agreed and very very irrational emma chimed in i think we have a plan lucius drawled throwing a pleased look in emma direction rose turned and smiled at her as well you ve redeemed yourself i truly thought you would fail us in the end this might be the plan we need to secure the upper hand the dark lord should be pleased rose congratulated emma smiled sheepishly when shall we attack lucius narcissa asked him we need to have this planned very well everything completely secure and solidified i will have to discuss it with my father who can very easily set up a meeting with the dark lord lucius informed them if all goes well we shall attack in two weeks x x x the marauders stood at the platform surrounded by the train smoke hooting owls and a cacophony of noise as students and families bustled to and fro coming and going laughing and crying and saying goodbye the marauders that were parting embraced each other with as much masculinity as they could muster but gave lily and hermione fierce hugs peter was the first to leave not wanting to stop and chat because his father had arrived and looked particularly solemn i ll write you guys he promised before waving and leaving them i ll owl you in a few days lily hermione promised as they embraced as much as i sure i ll love remus mother remus laughed and gave his girlfriend a playful nudge as soon as remus is recovered from his monthly excursion we re going to have a wild time at my house all summer james exclaimed no one is allowed to go home it will be fantastic but but but sirius started to blubber sirius you live with james lily deadpanned and everyone laughed suddenly the redhead pointed mum here lily rushed over to her waving goodbye to the group and towing her luggage behind her james decided to go after her be right back mate he said to sirius who winked hermione and remus joined hands and grabbed their luggage as they began to say goodbye sirius grabbed them both round the shoulders and looked the part of the concerned father now you two when you finally decide that the moment has come please lock your door sirius hermione hissed turning a bright shade of scarlet a silencing charm works just as well remus reasoned but yes i suppose a lock would do the trick silencing charm sirius scoffed mooney please silencing charms are for third years well it seemed to do the trick the other night remus said suggestively sirius and hermione gaped at the same time remus they both exclaimed hermione out of embarrassment and sirius out of surprise are you two telling me no and yep bombarded sirius ears at the same time he doesntneed to know that hermione moaned flustered with a hand over her eyes sorry remus said sheepishly sirius started chuckling nudging his mate in the ribs oh you lovebirds be safe you two tootles remus sighed and shook his head with a laugh while hermione suppressed the urged to hit remus you are becoming too much like james do you know that childish and arrogant her words were adorned with an admiring however annoyed smile the werewolf puffed out his chest i have every reason to act like james now and why is that mr lupin she asked curiously as they began to pick up their belongings and head towards the platform because i have the most beautiful girl at my side and i have every reason to act insane with joy he told hermione tapping her nose she swiped at his hand but giggled anyway my mother said she d meet us at the leaky cauldron we can apparate to my house from there she told me she very excited to meet you hermione and remus began their short journey to the leaky cauldron while remus talked about his house and where she would be sleeping and other such things when they finally reached the dingy little bar hermione could instantly figure out which witch was remus mother she did not look old but weary weathered almost she and remus shared the same sandy brown hair and the kind gentle face but she had startling blue eyes and a wide smile she had a vigorous handshake but it did not seem that she had the same shyness remus did hello i rhea you must be jane remus has told me all about you rhea gushed her looks deceived her because she was excited and bubbly although she looked like she wanted nothing more than to go to sleep it a pleasure hermione said remus tells me you re muggleborn well i think it is such a delight to bring such diversity into my home it will be so interesting being able to compare magic to muggle uh yes i think it will be very fascinating of course you must be terribly familiar with everything already since you went to hogwarts so it should be an easy stay in the lupin household i i think so yes and i must say hermione was alarmed at how much rhea lupin could talk and talk and talk she and remus exchanged a suppressed laugh as his mother went on and on and on finally remus cut across her constant stream of words mother we should probably apparate now oh oh yes of course dear me i didntmean to come on now mum they made their way to the back of the leaky cauldron to be out of everyone way do you have everything jane remus asked hermione she grinned at him and nodded and they laced hands ready ready she answered squeezing hands she was suddenly sucked into a miniscule tunnel and pulled through the air one molecule at the time it was unbearable the pressure on her head and body and she thought it was never going to end but just as suddenly she landed on wobbling legs in a very quaint kitchen remus helped her into a straight backed chair at his kitchen table and then rhea apparated beside hermione with a small pop anyway as i was saying there is certainly a lot of air traffic around here so many kids nowadays have brooms and just feel like it is their god given right to just fly around my house and above and be as loud as they want normally it just sirius and james remus whispered to hermione who stifled another laugh and even if i go out there and give them a good talking to mum remus interrupted her yes darling rhea said with such kindness it took hermione off guard the muggleborn thought it would have taken remus at least five more attempts to gather his mother attention i going to help jane unpack alright that sounds lovely should we have dinner afterwards rhea questioned that would be delightful hermione answered with a smile in rhea direction hermione followed remus through his house and up the stairs their trunks in stow hermione for some reason was under the impression that the lupin family had quite a bit of money but as she looked around her new surroundings they clearly did not it was not as if they were poor like the weasleys but it appeared the financial state of remus family was just below average perhaps it because of his werewolf condition surely that must cost very much with all the medicine once he transforms back into human again or perhaps it costs a lot to house a werewolf where does he go when he transforms this is my room here remus said opening the door hermione peered in her curiosity aroused all around were pictures and books which reminded hermione strongly of her own room the bed was neatly folded which someone did not fit in with the atmosphere of remus lupin room his walls were adorned from hogwarts things collected over the years and books were stacked in piles on the floor spilling out of the bookcase and some under his bed scarlet and gold hangings hung beside his window splashing onto the bed which was pushed up against the window on his night stand there were two framed pictures hermione could not resist the urge to look at them one was a picture of the marauders in which peter was standing nicely but james and sirius were attempting to give each other noogies while remus chided them the other picture was of remus and an older man and they had their arms around each other the man had remus eyes and shy smile and looked very intelligent that my father remus said quietly he was killed a few years ago by a death eater remus i so sorry hermione whispered eyes wide he shrugged looking at the ground he was trying to avenge me so it comforts me i suppose he was going after the death eater that bit me he was a brave man then hermione said quietly yes he was let move on though i want to show you your room he said taking her hand and guiding her out they only moved a few feet down the hall before remus opened another door the guest bedroom madam please make yourself at home remus drawled with a heavy accent sweeping his arms towards the room hermione laughed and swatted at him she put her trunk aside and dropped down on the flower print of the bed before looking around all the walls were white with two windows that overlooked the woods behind the house remus lied down next to her do you like it it beautiful in here hermione assured him this will be perfect good remus said suddenly he pulled his wand out of his pocket with a devilish grin with a flick of his wrist the door shut and the lock clicked hermione eyed remus suspiciously excuse me do you really think you can just he caught her off guard with a fierce kiss and she was silenced lying back on the bed remus edged his way on top of her their bodies already intertwined fingers on warm flesh lips on skin a parallel racing heartbeat just as remus inched his hand up hermione shirt and her hands were at his belt there was a sharp knock at the window merlin remus shouted getting up to let the owl in i am going to have to kill sirius if this is oh hermione quickly rushing to his side hermione instantly recognized dumbledore handwriting mr lupin and miss lewis there will be a portkey in the shape of a broken crate box advertising bananas in the alleyway on 35 th street in london behind the golden spoon restaurant it will leave at exactly 8 45 tonight your attendance is not only mandatory but incredibly crucial please burn this once you are finished a d what what could this be about is everything alright remus questioned worried hermione gave him a grave look x x x is this it it has bananas drawn all over it hermione announced showing remus he quickly checked his watch before looking around 8 44 we better grab on just as they did the time hit 8 45 and the portkey snatched them away from the alleyway and brought them flying through time and space everything was whirling around hermione like she was on a merry go round but suddenly she was thrown to the ground and the spinning stopped uuugh came a familiar moan of displeasure sirius hermione said finally getting up nursing her now bruised arm hey you and mooney are here in fact all the marauders were there and so was lily instead of immediately coming together they all looked at each other in confusion does anyone know where we are peter asked at last they were in the middle of a large open field and off to their right in the distance was a house sitting on a hill the sun just setting behind it hermione recognized the far building at once they were at the burrow except it was different it was not as tall and did not look as run down in fact it looked welcoming and comfortable almost as if the owners had enough money to care about their house appearance this is the prewett place james said slowly that makes sense mrs weasley maiden name is prewett so this must belong to her brothers that will soon be gone but what this all about lily proposed you ll see soon enough hermione informed them come on hermione led the nervous group to the house walking without hesitation into the twilight that was falling over their path as they approached the door a tall lanky figure stepped out from inside and stared at them at a glance this person would have passed for dumbledore but there was something distinctly different about him perhaps his eyes lacked the twinkle or he did not appear as omniscient in quickly the stranger said brusquely the group hurried inside looking at each other in both suspicious and curious befuddlement the stranger led them up the hallway and into the burrow kitchen where there were many adults waiting some were sitting though most were standing this crowd also seemed to spill over into the sitting room but it appeared the general company was keen on being in the kitchen ah at last welcomed a familiar voice it was dumbledore sitting at the head of the table the marauders clumped together unsure of whether to be relaxed or alarmed dumbledore wasted no time and immediately stole their attention away their wandering curious eyes snapped to his face as you are well aware voldemort is quickly gaining power and is terrorizing both our world and the muggles the loss of our friends and fellow wizards is also increasingly augmenting and this terror and destruction must be put to a stop that is why tonight i have invited you six here tonight dumbledore said slowly all that you see gathered here tonight are constantly putting all of their efforts into bringing the dark lord to his downfall these deaths and heinous deeds have committed to our own brethren and must be put to a halt i have a younger sister who has seen more death than my grandfather when grindelwald was on his most infamous rampage i cannot stand to watch another wizard fall while i am idly standing by seethed a passionate angered looking man whose face was now just as red as his hair fabian prewett dumbledore introduced with a tiny sweep of his hand have you been shielded from the terrors of war fabian asked quietly hogwarts presents itself as an easy and welcoming distraction i doubt you have experienced any sort of tragedy my mother was murdered peter spoke up i have been constantly under attack by the illimni hermione said as well my father was killed trying to avenge me remus offered my ex girlfriend is a death eater sirius growled and so is my excuse of a family the group of adults said nothing but there seemed to be a shiver of acknowledgment between all of them many exchanged meaningful glances to one another but still said nothing and you two fabian addressed lily and james the couple stared at each other not knowing what to say finally james stepped forward boldly i haventexperienced all of these terrible things firsthand but these have been my best mates for years i have stood beside them while they were dragged through hell and i muggleborn i ve been experiencing the harshness of prejudice for years lily offered meekly none of us are exactly what you d call innocent sirius said in a hard voice you know who doesntdeserve another second alive but you re too fearful to say his name hissed another redheaded man gideon prewett dumbledore said quietly forgive me sirius growled i grew up in a family that would punish such audacity lord voldemort will not prevail if we can stop it how do we know you wontcrumble when we need you the most fabian inquired eyes narrowed at them i want to avenge my father death remus said i want to prove my family wrong sirius spat i want to protect my friends and my family james informed them i scared of running i want to fight back hermione said curtly she didntdeserve to die peter whispered a mudblood is just as good as a pureblood lily said fiercely the two brothers looked to one another and then looked to dumbledore who gave them a small smile the headmaster turned to the marauders eyes twinkling welcome to the order of the phoenix x x x after every member had been introduced and the basic rules and regulations of being a member were discussed dumbledore allowed the marauders and the girls to privately discuss whether or not they still wanted to join the order they were stuffed into a side tea room with a closed door and a slightly musty couch it sounds demanding but rewarding lily reasoned you ll always be putting your lives in danger hermione reminded her friends death eaters play dirty and they will not hesitate to kill what in it for us peter asked curiously hermione whipped her head around and scrutinized him being alive maybe and protecting those that mean the most and putting a stop to something that is so monstrously wrong hermione growled i suppose there is no gold prize at the end but that not what matters in war peter easy remus told her quietly touching her shoulder no remus hermione shouted she turned to look each one of her companions in the eye her own brown eyes glowing fiercely i dontthink you understand the gravity of being in the order people are going to die but we wontdie peter tried correcting her how do you know that for sure hermione retorted for all you know we could all be killed tomorrow the death eaters are worse than anything the illimni could pretend to be and much more merciless why does that make joining any more appealing james inquired suspiciously james do you love lily yes james said sternly without a moment hesitation do you want to watch as she is captured and killed while you stand by and do nothing about it i would never just stand by james snarled i d fight for her and it would be just you fighting if the order was behind you lily life could easily be saved if it were just you you wouldntstand a chance and neither would she hermione warned him i will do anything to protect you lily james told his girlfriend directly giving her a fierce kiss i ll join the order i ll join as well lily said if we have a future together i want to protect that i in sirius muttered fuck my family i want to take down the death eater that killed my father and who bit me remus confessed in a low angry voice do you remember his name hermione asked quietly fenrir greyback what about you peter james asked his quivering friend peter stared at the ground but he looked as if he had tears in his eyes i just want my mother back she dead peter hermione said quietly touching his arm the mousy boy turned away from her touch trying to quell the tears that began to slide down his cheeks i ll join he said at last we re not trying to peer pressure you into this peter lily said gently also putting a gentle hand on his arm but if you re all in the order where will that leave me it the only option that makes sense peter reasoned let go tell dumbledore then sirius decided obliging the group followed padfoot back into the kitchen in the pit of her stomach hermione felt the writhing boiling claw of guilt peter pettigrew was to shortly betray everything that he had treasured his whole life but she did nothing to stop it i cannot interfere anymore x x x it was past midnight and all of their surroundings were pitch black however it did not frighten them in the least but somehow gave them comfort that they could hide in the cloak of security on the roof of his house remus and hermione stared into the night sky freckled with stars and an iridescent incomplete orb it deceiving how beautiful the moon can be sometimes remus whispered nudging hermione with his nose she was buried in the crook of his arm hands woven around his torso as they lay together if you want i ll steal the real moon and put a picture up there instead hermione offered with a weak smile it would help with my inconvenient transformations remus decided what would you say if i told you i had some sort of mystery gift that could help ease your transformations each month i d say you were a loony remus answered with a laugh hermione sat up and stared at him but really remus he sat up as well and gave her a hard stare searching her eyes for any sort of mockery i would want to know the details of such a mystery gift hermione grinned well if you use this mystery gift during the days preceding the full moon it would allow you to have a much less painful transformation and would render you safe you would simply just be a sleeping wolf harmless even though it was pitch black hermione could see remus eyes widen are you serious well actually i hermione they both chuckled at this but yes it a very very late birthday present remus i ve been meaning to give it to you for a while now hermione you didnthave to get me anything at all especially not this and how by the way did you get this miracle gift he asked curiously ah that is a secret i will never tell you hermione teased poking remus on the nose he chuckled before lying back down against the roof hermione lied against him and together they stared into the black abyss above them i love you hermione i dontcare how the future turns out you will always be the only one i love remus whispered to her there was a tight knot in her stomach and a dry lump in her throat i love you too remus she managed to utter before wiping away a few tears 14 days left x x x author note technically 14 days left because it after midnight anyway i hope you enjoyed that chapter i am guessing that there will be five chapters left and an epilogue ps the woman who gave birth to remus and romulus was named rhea silvia and their father was actually the god mars just a little bit of fun stuff thank you faithful wheezy you inspire me please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just some oc and the plot still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty four tainted perfection hermione you didnthave to get me anything at all especially not this and how by the way did you get this miracle gift he asked curiously ah that is a secret i will never tell you hermione teased poking remus on the nose he chuckled before lying back down against the roof hermione lied against him and together they stared into the black abyss above them i love you hermione i dontcare how the future turns out you will always be the only one i love remus whispered to her there was a tight knot in her stomach and a dry lump in her throat i love you too remus she managed to utter before wiping away a few tears 14 days left two days had gone by the air was ripe with tension it was the first night of the full moon and as hermione had instructed remus had been drinking the wolfsbane potion for the last few days as dusk approached hermione became rather twitchy and silent although remus and his mother rhea carried on as if nothing else in the world had changed so james mother owled me and said that she would be hosting your little gang for a few days and i said as long as my remus is in a different room than the girls rhea chided shaking a finger at her son not that i donttrust you jane it just that remy here shouldntbe exposed like that imagine the peer pressure remus and hermione shared a meaningful look behind his mother back that sirius black he sure does like to wave a wizard wand i ve never met a boy who encourages chaos like sirius rhea exclaimed nodding vigorously and you can only imagine what he d do to impress a girl why i say he ll do anything to get with that lily girl that james mum remus reminded her oh yes well i still wouldntput it past him rhea muttered anyway remus it nearly dusk you better head downstairs downstairs why hermione questioned at once looking suddenly fearful well i cantreally be set loose in the house now can i remus posed it just a room to help contain whatever damage i cause will you be quite loud hermione asked timidly yes most likely you might want to owl lily and ask if you can stay with her because it can be rather frightening remus advised slowly hermione looked pained at the thought of parting with remus especially at such a crucial point i ll be alright and i ll owl you as soon as i feeling better yes alright hermione finally agreed can i make sure you get downstairs alright i sorry i just nervous you re not even doing the transforming remus teased come see me to my room it will be fine remus led her to the basement door and reassuringly enough the downstairs was very finished and did not remind her of something out of muggle horror movie when they got to the bottom of the staircase just to the right was a heavy metal door remus took a key from a hook beside the door and unlocked it pushing the thick frame forward on its hinges inside hermione saw a very bland room with stone walls and floors while this seemed all right the blood and the deep gashes in the stone unnerved her remus stepped inside i ll uh be handing you my clothes in a moment as well it better if i m uh naked simply because i dontshred all my things he stepped behind the privacy of the door and after a minute shoved a pile of clothing out to hermione who took it wordlessly when he came out she looked frightened and almost sad he gave her a comforting smile before beckoning her closer moving as he obliged he gave her a soft kiss dontworry he whispered oh and you ll have to lock me in my mother comes down every other hour everyday to check on me so dontworry i ll try not to hermione managed to say fear gripping her like the icy hand of death remus smiled at her again and closed the door it took a few minutes to get the key in the lock for her hand was shaking so badly in the kitchen hermione paced and paced not wanting to leave remus house in case something happened but also not keen on sticking around to hear his screams of torment she watched the clock grow later and watched the shadows grow longer before suddenly a cry of anguish ripped through the house silence like a gunshot startled hermione dropped into a chair trembling rhea was elsewhere though hermione knew that his mother was used to the first initial roars of pain again as the werewolf below released a blood curling roar of pain hermione gripped the table and tried to silence her quivering body it goes on like this for hours you ll probably want to owl lily rhea voice said suddenly from above her weakly hermione nodded and managed to make it to her room trying to block the vicious howls echoing from below an hour later hermione was standing on the street corner with some luggage shrunken safely in her pocket she withdrew her wand muttering lumos before stepping onto the knight bus the triple decker bus had not changed or rather would not change at all it was still massive and purple and had collected an odd assortment of riders leven sickles please muttered the boy at the door holding out his hand automatically he was reading the daily prophet and was most interested in that than he was in the new customer where to uh 26 carousel drive in redhill hermione said placing coins in the boy hands she quickly secured a seat grabbing onto whatever she could for she knew bang the bus would be off in no time after some uncomfortable stops the driver finally announced carousel drive redhill quickly exiting the bus hermione could see lily hiding by the nearest streetlight trying not to look so suspicious to her muggle neighbors the bus sped away which left lily and hermione to rush to one another how is he lily asked at once horrible but all right i hope the screaming is really what got to me muttered hermione lily rubbed her shoulder gently and then led her inside the girls had to be very quiet going into the house for it was close to midnight and most of her family was asleep thankfully petunia was gone spending the night at her boyfriend apartment in the city lily had a cot on which hermione could sleep and it was a comfortable makeshift bed however the brunette simply could not sleep i only have twelve days left how can i express to each and every one of them how much i love them how much they have impacted my lives how much i will miss them when i gone when they re gone how can i look them each in the eye after this days passes as i draw nearer to my departure should i tell them that i leaving this decision was a curious and tricky decision to make she could tell the marauders that she was leaving on a certain day and the rest of their remaining time would be haunted by an internal clock each one of them more aware than anything else or she could tell no one and they could simply enjoy the rest of their time together uninhibited by sadness and reluctance to see her leave she could prepare them or surprise them each decision had its advantages and disadvantages hermione lily was still awake as well yes did we all make the right decision by being in the order though lily could not see it hermione body tensed of course hermione answered it just i scared to think about the war i feel as if every moment since we ve joined i ve been being watched i not going to tell you not to worry about it hermione began because honestly constant vigilance is necessary and to be feeling paranoid is better than feeling nothing at all i dontwant to see my friends die lily said in a small voice in an even smaller one she whispered or james lily you cantthink like that if you think about their deaths then you ve already lost faith in them you have to be optimistic and fight your heart just as much as you fight the enemy will i lose any of my friends lily asked what do you mean you know what happens hermione please tell me please let me prepare for the worst she begged visibly sitting up in her bed you lose your husband your best friends everything but you have the most magnificent and wonderful son how can one precious gain outweigh many losses you know i cantanswer that lily hermione said apologetically please lily pleaded again and there was the sound of a badly contained sob i i canttell you about your friends lily but one day you will have a child and he he will grow up to be an incredible person you must think optimistically lily i only telling you about this because you must look towards the future dontyou want to make the world a better place for your children dontyou want your child to grow up without the threat of kidnap of murder she had said too much it was apparent the moment hermione stopped talking now that she had released a small tidbit lily wanted to know everything will i be with james is he our son do we get married goodnight lily hermione please but hermione had already turned over and laid still silently x x x two days later just as remus promised she received an owl from her boyfriend hermione the mystery potion worked marvelously as soon as i had completed my transformation i was in complete control of myself my mother has never heard the house so silent please hurry home i love you remus i love you huh lily repeated reading over hermione shoulder the girl snatched it away from her friend but was blushing furiously hermione packed up her things and together the two girls took the knight bus back over to remus for james had sent out a letter to all his friends which invited them all to stay for a few days as they were packing lily suggested we should bring from muggle treats i made james try a s more once and he adored it and imagine moony he ll go crazy for the chocolate so they packed s mores material as well as popcorn frozen pizza cheese sticks and anything they thought might alarm their wizardly companions eventually they made their way to james house hermione and lily stopping briefly at remus before the three of them apparated to the potter residence james house could be called more of an estate and its grandeur was apparent even from the outside gate the granite slabs that the pathway consisted of led them to the front door which swung open without anyone help mrs potter appeared at once not looking anything like james except for her eyes hello remus lily good to see you two again she greeted warmly she shook hermione hand you must be jane lewis i ve heard a lot about you all good things i hope hermione said with sheepish smile mrs potter led them through the extravagant house and to the backyard where sirius and james were dancing around a large bonfire trying to pressure peter into doing the same the boys reveled in the sight of the ladies and of remus and soon james and sirius had managed to get everyone to dance around with them later on while the marauders were discussing potential pranks they could pull in the house lily and hermione decided to intervene on their mischievous planning instead of proposing their ideas to the marauders the girls simply started taking out s mores materials as soon as the marshmallow began to roast under the flames sirius attention was caught what that he piped up already mesmerized it a muggle treat lily answered promptly taking her mallow out of the fire for it had begun to burn she started to set it up with the graham cracker and chocolate chocolate remus inquired staring lilykins i want one james whined suddenly you can make one yourself potter lily teased holding her s more securely in her hands in no time mischief was forgotten and the boys were set up with roasting sticks and mallows it took a few times for the boys to understand that the point was not to burn the marshmallow but to cook it to a golden brown very carefully mine fell in the fire peter whined lily handed him a perfectly new mallow without a word can i just have the chocolate remus asked hermione who laughed and shook her head that would defeat the purpose of the s mores remus s mores all the boys echoed over the next several days constant trips were made to james house and events such as s mores popping popcorn and doing other muggle things as the days ticked by hermione tried desperately to ignore how frightfully aware she was of each passing second the impending doom that was leading up to july 7 exactly at midnight was crawling closer to her every second she tried to relish these fun filled moments she was having with the marauders and lily she felt that without a deadline to face things would have been wonderful for forever for it seemed that no turmoil could touch this group of wizards no death would ever choose them one night after hermione and remus left james they finally enjoyed an uninterrupted hour of pleasure and love soft gentle hands and cautious movements hushed laughter and low moans afterwards they held each other in remus bed and stared out into the black night silently enjoying one another hermione remus said quietly are you leaving us quite soon instead of the joy being sucked out her of lungs to be replaced by icy dread hermione just released a quiet sigh yes i didntwant to say anything because i just wanted all of us to have fun and enjoy what time we had left i had a feeling remus started quietly that something had changed within you perhaps that was it when you leave how long will it be until i get to see you again hermione struggled with the morality of answering that question should she tell him what damage would it do if she did after all they would see one another again in the future except she would not remember him until the end of her seventh year in about twenty years hermione responded with a humorless laugh except i wonthave any recollection of this until the end of my schooling because it was before christmas of my seventh year that i stumbled upon the time charm i dontthink i want to wait that long remus murmured planting a soft kiss on her forehead how about you stay here and just go through the next twenty years with me instead i wish it were that simple remus hermione confessed with a sigh there were a few minutes of silence as remus and hermione moved around a bit kissing and holding one another she finally stayed still with her head on his bare chest his fingers sending goose bumps up her spine as he stroked her ribs why hasntdumbledore asked us to do anything yet remus questioned i think he wants to give you some sort of training or the likes or wait until he truly needs you to employ any more members why put you in danger as soon as possible and perhaps he is rounding up others as well yes i think lily said something about getting a letter from alice who said she and frank longbottom were also summoned to the prewett house there was a long pregnant pause before remus confessed i just anxious i think your paranoia is starting to take hold of me as well because i dontfeel safe anymore all of a sudden i feel like we re being watched all the time lily told me that as well hermione informed him perhaps we are being watched maybe we should talk to dumbledore i agree hermione said tomorrow we ll owl him indeed they did remus took up the quill and wrote what he wanted while hermione mused as calmly as she could about her remaining five days a wonderful ten days had already gone by and she had managed to get closer and more comfortable with lily and the rest of the marauders james house became a funhouse for all of them while rhea lupin became like a second mother to hermione although quite a talkative one she didntwant to leave all these people with another colorful memory but something very pleasing they could remember her by hermione didntknow whether she wanted to write them all personal detailed and tear stained letters but she felt that doing anything less would just be useless she had five days left to decide but she knew that with each day it would be more difficult to make a decision x x x lucius malfoy paced to and fro in his sitting room waiting anxiously for his father to reenter seated before him were all the girls that comprised of the illimni and many young men that had already joined the death eater force among them was regulus black severus snape the lestrange brothers avery macnair dolohov and others instead of chatting with their attractive female counterparts everyone was watching lucius nervously finally the ornate silver handle clicked as it turned and all heads snapped to abraxas malfoy strolled into the room he and lucius looked incredibly similar although lucius still had not been touched by age and did not look as aged or lined as his father the dark lord approves lucius drawled the eldest malfoy however he advises one thing instead of capturing the mudblood and only targeting the young fools broaden the attack to the entirety of the order these blood traitors will certainly be new to the order and should there be chaos and quandary there it will spread over what a marvelous thought lucius murmured savoring the idea of potter and his friends panicking oh he also mentions this do not wait only a day to take the mudblood away before you strike into their pitiful hearts keep her away from them for several days for each day that passes will make them more likely to act foolishly to ensure her return who does the dark lord suggest capture mudblood evans he shall hand pick the precious few who are allowed to complete this mission no sooner had abraxas said this did the door handle turn once more very few of the newly inducted death eaters had ever laid eyes on lord voldemort for more than a few seconds which made them sit straightly and nervously almost fearfully lucius lucius i have heard many great things about your work so far at school said the dark lord strolling into the room and sending a shiver down the spines of the room occupants thank you my lord it has been a pleasure proving myself lucius replied as modestly as he could indeed tell me who has been most fruitful in their attempts to help you voldemort inquired with sibilant hiss the rudiments of this plan were suggested by emmaline danes my lord who has also proved herself a trustworthy insider of the enemy rose sanders as well able to fool and deceive someone very close to mudblood granger and of course lucius said slowly his silver eyes transfixed on narcissa narcissa black had more than adequately led the illimni when i could not be present remaining calm when all others were frantic is that all lucius no men to assist you at all no my lord these young women have proved themselves more than dependable in the art of combat and forgive me if i sound facetious but this sort of mission requires a more delicate and subtly touch one i fear most of my male companions lack there was a general chortle at this among the new death eaters very good lucius very good you have certainly proved yourself you and your chosen companions will single handedly carry out the deed and upon doing that i shall allow you maintain other responsibilities that only the trusted can handle it would be an honor my lord lucius accepted his voice smug and thick with triumph when shall we attack tomorrow night x x x it was now july 3 hermione was anxious as ever but admittedly happy it was better to be leaving in good graces than to leave in any other way and however sad she might be it would ease her mind knowing that in her last moments they were all happy it seemed that nothing could startle the paradise these last two weeks had been and that the future would remain untouched as well dumbledore says he and some of the order will go around to each of our houses tonight to put powerful defensive and protective charms up remus called to hermione as he read the letter from dumbledore hermione who was in the bathroom brushing her teeth vigorously responded oo dee goon stard wid excuse me remus asked laughing hermione grumbled audibly and after spitting out her toothpaste repeated who is he going to start with probably the potters since both he and sirius are living there and we re always over there from there i not sure he said it would only take a day to do it though quick and easy hermione summarized coming into remus room just the way i like it he said with a grin pulling her into his arms she shrieked playfully and squirmed although she gave into his sweet kisses after a few moments of fighting as soon as their kisses turned into slow passionate movements remus mother called him from the kitchen we have terrible timing remus murmured into her neck before departing with an annoyed sigh hermione finished cleaning her teeth as diligently as she could both to honor her dentist muggle parents and to wait for remus to return when he did hermione asked what his mother wanted just to know when we were leaving for james tonight i guess she overheard our plans about going into london so she just giving me the whole remus you must be careful you cantjust go prancing about but we are anyway it will be ever so fun hermione gushed lily and i looked into plays around the circle theatre it would be wonderful for you boys to see some shakespeare i wouldntmind at all but you know sirius and james are going to have a fit remus was right as soon as they all headed off to london flooing into the leaky cauldron and then heading straight into the muggle world with the guidance of lily and hermione the boys were already fidgeting cantwe go to one of those brilliant clubs i ve heard about sirius pleaded i hear they ve got massive crowds that just dance around and throw their clothes around no because one of us will certainly be drugged or something lily stated flatly no clubs lily sirius whined he turned to james and pointed an accusing finger at the redhead she being mean make her change her mind sirius grow up the play that night was a midsummer night dream and although both hermione and lily had studied it in school neither one of them enjoyed it more than remus who seemed to be captivated by the language james sirius and peter however decided to throw balled up programs at one another causing quite a commotion which was the entire basis of the group being kicked out at a loss for what to do the small throng on teen wandered about they teased the stoic guards posed with bronze statues scared birds and even dared one another to jump into the river thames very bored the heart of the city beckoned them and the girls decided to bring the marauders to the movies some run down cinema was playing zombi 2 for very cheap so they all chipped in and bought tickets look at that machine thing it got pupcorn pop corn james popcorn flying everywhere these drinks over here look revolting sirius muttered looking at the soda pop who would put oranges into a drink it all frothy on top like some boogey it pop hermione informed him giggling soda tonic trust me you ll like it arms full of candy popcorn and soda the six of them set off and settled down in their seats the boys had much to complain about someone is going to have a feelsie on me it so dark in here but quickly got over it the cinema did not astound them for pictures moved in the magical world but it was the sound and the animation that captivated them the fact that there were other people in the theater had completely escaped the marauders for when the more gruesome and terrifying scenes crossed the screen they were uncensored in their fear he fighting a shark he fighting a shark peter shrieked pointing in horror at the screen at another point when one of the female characters was being attacked by a zombie her eye was stabbed viciously and blood spurted her head and all around james screamed and plastered himself to lily shaking in fear while remus and hermione eyes were glued in terror to the events going on somewhere to their right peter could be heard moaning in revulsion but like every other teenager each one of them blasted out of the cinema with raging reviews and quick tales that relived their favorite scenes did you see the shark and her eye just came right out popped those mummies were awfully realistic they were zombies their excited chattering did not cease even when they reached the leaky cauldron it was with regrets and promises to continue the conversation about their muggle experience that allowed the group to finally part james lily and sirius all went to james house remus and hermione to the werewolf s and peter to his own when james lily and sirius arrived at their destination they tiptoed around the house trying desperately not to wake james parents come on let go for a ride on the brooms james whispered james you know i hate flying lily groaned it nice out lils just hold on tight and you ll be fine sirius goaded her after a few minutes she finally gave in the boys snuck to the broom shed and collected two of the best brooms holding james securely from behind lily squeezed her eyes shut as her boyfriend kicked off the ground catapulting them into the sky she thought it would take forever and be a terrible ride but the cool wind berating her face was not that bad and as long as james kept this constant speed and not try and do any stunts she surmised she would not have minded being on this broom as much as she normally did how about that muggle flick eh we should go do that more often that thing was wicked sirius called to his best mate over the wind only if they re all that gruesome it amazing what these muggles do without magic i bet we could make a wicked movie if we used magic those muggles would be going bonkers cause it ll look so good finally they touched down by lily house and the girl could not scramble off the broom fast enough james and sirius had decided they wanted to make a flying movie and james had to show sirius some of the neat broom tricks they could use in their movie t this is why i dont fly potter lily stammered as she wobbled about her yard trying to get her land legs back yes well sirius bug off for about fifteen minutes eh james asked his friend sirius groaned and rolled his eyes yes yes dontmind me i ll just be off sleeping in a tree somewhere as james picked up his girlfriend and soared into her bedroom window much to lily protest sirius yelled after them oi protection you two to himself he muttered merlin i need another girlfriend inside lily room lily was now tucked away in her bed james standing over her he had a devilish smile and suddenly he jumped on the bed beside her pulling aside the covers with vigor now where were we evans oh yes once upon a time there was a little redheaded girl named lily evans and she lived in a cozy little muggle house somewhere off in redhill fifteen minutes later lily could be heard emitting a soft snore and james was whispering the end of his story as he knelt beside her bed and stroked the side of her face and they were the perfect couple and loved each other very much and when he asked her to marry him she said yes and they lived happily ever after james gently placed a soft kiss on her temple i love you lily goodnight finally standing up james stretched and turned around there was a figure in the window blocking what little light was coming through james felt himself flush with embarrassment knowing that sirius was going to make fun of him for his heartfelt bedtime story oi sirius i told you to wait what a touching story potter this was not sirius in fact this wasnteven a boy nonetheless james suddenly felt rooted to the spot his heart was pounding so fiercely so loudly that he was afraid it would wake lily however there were more important things to worry about at the moment in one fluid movement james stepped back to protect lily body and withdrew his wand to stun his enemy however he was not fast enough stupefy the sound of james body hitting the floor woke lily with a start and as she blinked groggily and absorbed her surroundings a terrified scream escaped her mouth before she too was stunned then suddenly lily door was flung open by her family startled at the screaming and angry at being woken up lily father was immediately stunned but her mother managed to flee down the hallway shrieking loud enough to wake the entire neighborhood more death eaters snaked into the dark room one pursuing and stunning lily mother the others taking the unconscious bodies of lily and james is there anyone else the silky voice asked his counter parts as their quarry was emptied out of the room no i dontthink so emma said when she got here it was just the two of them answered a female voice confidently excellent quickly let leave before the muggles become suspicious the male ordered that muggle woman had a set of pipes on her all of redhill should be awake muttered another girl now barked their male companion with haste all of the death eaters left the room confident that their actions would not be traced however a few meters away was sirius black perched in a tree like an owl his face frozen with terror ice slowly drained from each one of his veins his muscles and from his heart and it seemed like an eternity before he could move the second he was free from the frozen chains however he snatched his broom from the ground and rocketed away into the night sky dumbledore the order hermione you know who quickly x x x author note aaaaahhh so close to the end

woman had a set of pipes on her all of redhill should be awake muttered another girl now barked their male companion with haste all of the death eaters left the room confident that their actions would

seemed like an eternity before he could move the second he was free from the frozen chains however he snatched his broom from the ground and rocketed away into the night sky dumbledore the order hermione you know who quickly as sirius raced through the air cutting the atmosphere like a knife on his broom his mind was whirling faster than his broomstick what do i do who do i tell i thought dumbledore put protective charms up will they go after the others are they hunting me down will james and lily be alright sirius touched down on remus roof and not bothering to be quiet threw open remus window and jumped into his room the couple in bed awoke with a start hermione shrieking with indignity and remus growling threats for waking them sirius get the hell out before i you didnteven bother to warn us i not even wearing clothes i feel like an idiot they ve taken lily and james all anger was forgotten instantly in a rush hermione and remus were dressed and the three of them were running through the house remus pounded on his mother door while sirius and hermione quickly discussed who to alert and where to floo as soon as remus and his mother ran down to the fire place she spluttered that they should go to the prewett s as it was currently the unspoken meeting place of the order and the prewetts would be able to notify the entire order quickly the foreign house was dark as they all tumbled through the green fire but rhea lupin made sure the stillness was broken as she set about for the upstairs yelling her head off soon enough fabian prewett was rushed into the kitchen his night robes still on he quickly ran outside summoning a patronus to send to fellow members before throwing floo powder into the fireplace and getting down on his hands and knees it was an hour before everyone was assembled in the kitchen remus and hermione squished together sirius beside them as well as peter who had finally joined them everyone was scrambling for details about what happened conversations flying across the room behind hands theories both possible and alarming quiet dumbledore finally shouted and at once a hush fell upon the room it is essential that we remain calm otherwise the potential to destroy this opportunity is great now sirius please reiterate exactly what happened sirius blanched at this request not wanting to relive the memory w well we had all gone to london that night james lily and i flooed to james house and b because it was so nice out we decided to fly to lily s and also because redhill wasntthat far sirius paused suddenly here looking nervously to the ground go on sirius dumbledore encouraged gently the occupants of the room seemed to hold its breath in anticipation a and james asked me to bugger off for a few because he err wanted some alone time with lily before we left so i went across her yard and sat in a tree some of the order gave him very strange looks for this sirius looked around harassed i couldntvery well sit outside her window and listen to them do continue on with what happened please remus cut across him for a while nothing happened and then i saw four figures appear at the end of the street just outside the lamplight i thought maybe they were muggles coming home as late as we were but as they came closer they were death eaters a concerned murmur travelled the room but sirius pushed on i wanted to jump down and curse them all but i thought maybe it would be foolish of me then one of them was up in lily window and i heard them stun james i wanted to fight them i wanted to protect my friends but i just just froze sometimes fear conquers even the best of us sirius perhaps it is not so bad that you were struck with terror because otherwise we would be bamboozled with this mystery dumbledore comforted but if i had been able to move i could ve saved them sirius cried despairingly or you would have been stunned as well dumbledore countered quietly please go on then i heard lily scream but a second later they had stunned her as well the rest of the death eaters went into her room as well and i heard lily parents come in one of them managed to escape her mother i think but only as far as the downstairs her parents were stunned as well and then the spiraling silence that met his paused urged him to continue and then they all disapparated and they were gone x x x somewhere far away lily was being shaken her head felt as if it was filled with cement her eyes with sand and her heavy body did not appreciate being shaken around like a doll lily someone hissed shaking her even harder she released an irritated groan swatting at her attacker lily wake up no no go away she grumbled her neck was becoming flossy thin like a dandelion her head wobbling around uncontrollably now lily the person hissed again and finally she wrenched her body away from this person who insisted on shaking her what she snarled at last opening her eyes in a matter of seconds though fear and confusion replaced irritation james was sitting before her his eye black and his nose bloodied holding very tightly onto her arms w where are we it was dark very dark there seemed to be a gloomy weight that hung in the darkness and lily felt terrified she reached forward past james and her hands met a cold clammy wall we re in some sort of prison cell and they ve taken our wands who the illimni james interrupted gravely or at least some of them hermione was right oh my god oh my god lily started panicking are they going to kill us how will we get out of here james what are we going to do lily calm down james said in a tight voice if you go bonkers that will not ensure our safety lily started crying and even though james felt terrible and guilty for her tears he turned his eyes to the outside of their cell i ve been hearing people fight for a while now james told her in a low voice as her sniffling ceased apparently i not supposed to be here i ve already given them a tough time as you can see here he pointed to his beaten face but it wontcompare to what hell i ll give them when they come for you just as he said that there was a thunderous noise from upstairs and a furious voice screaming get that mudblood now echoed down the hallway lily began to whimper again james hushed her and began talking rapidly in a whisper listen i going to lie here like i ve passed out and you must keep this death eater busy because when he least expecting it i will attack him and we ll get out of here okay n no i can t please james she stammered beginning to cry again this is our only chance lily james hissed suddenly he flattened himself on the ground quite still she sobbed in protest but to the death eater approaching their cell it seemed she was struck with fearful crying ah shut it ya stupid mudblood growled the death eater with the wand he unlocked the cell and entered approaching lily she shouted in terror backing up as far as she could desperate to keep herself as far away as she could no no leave me alone she screamed kicking at his hands as they moved to grab her ya ruddy bint here stupe but suddenly there was a tight constriction on the death eater windpipe so strong that it sucked all logic and reason from him his face turned purple and he slumped to the ground unable to breathe let alone finish his spell james lifted off the mask and saw it was avery james quickly began stripping the death eater of his cloak mask and wand and putting them on himself what are you doing lily hissed pulling the heavy robes over his head he said if our friend here doesntreturn soon they ll be suspicious i going to be him and i going to bring you to them no lily cried he grabbed her and kissed her fiercely i wontlet anything happen to you alright i promise now please cooperate reluctantly and fearfully lily allowed james now fully dressed as a death eater to bring her out of the dank cellar prison after they had locked avery in the cell coming into the light james held lily in a vice grip and threw her onto the ground in front of the other death eaters who were waiting impatiently very good avery one of them hissed james could tell by the tone of his voice that this death eater was not of their age but much older now leave us james hesitated for a tiny fraction lily stared up at james in terror but to the other death eaters it did not seem unusual now avery snarled the elder death eater turning silently and walking out of the room james panicked as soon as he was out of the room but then he had another problem entirely the sitting room was full of other death eaters many of them had their masks off and from the few he could see they were all his age in fact he knew most of them very few turned their attention to james when he entered for clearly they had been expecting him back the conversation that had been temporarily halted continued again they were discussing the capture of james and lily emma told me he was telling her bedtime story it was revolting dolohov sneered these blood traitors are nothing but trouble agreed another with an air of contempt it was regular black this time and james felt his blood boil suddenly there was a pained scream from the other room everyone head snapped to the sound but then resumed talking i awfully jealous of the girls though said a female one that james could not instantly identify but he knew that she had gone to hogwarts if i had known kissing lucius arse would have gotten me in high praises with the dark lord you and me both said one of the lestrange brothers he wouldnteven let us do anything he wants all the glory for himself clearly sneered a slimy voice which belonged to snape what i would give to be in the other room torturing the mudblood myself i d rather have a go at potter though said dolohov after a pensive moment as i sure you would snape it would be much more fun putting him in his place he d be ten times harder to subdue though interjected the mystery girl again this time james could place her as lorna knox one of the girls who had previously been expelled exactly said snape softly with a hint of a smirk on his face why is he here anyway inquired lorna curiously i thought emma plan was just to take evans james nearly broke his cover for he was boiling with rage emma had set them up yes well they tripped up the dark lord was furious didntyou hear abraxas malfoy screaming at them earlier what are they going to do with potter then lots of people volunteered answers for this question they ll let him rot the dark lord will probably finish him off if they were smart they d torture him instead of evans no if they were smarter they d torture evans in front of potter he bonkers for her haventyou noticed james heart simply stopped at this suggestion and he was glad to be wearing an elusive outfit for otherwise they would have seen him blanch and tremble he slowly sat down in a nearby chair clutching the wooden arms as if he were in a plane diving nose first out of the sky you reckon they ll kill her nah well they cantjust up and give her back now can they if they kill her it wontbe right away apparently she got vital information james could not stand it any longer with a deep heavy breath he pushed himself out of the chair and headed for a door where are you going someone barked at him loo james grunted as best he could before sliding out of the room as inconspicuously as he could as soon as he was alone james slumped against a wall thoughts racing he had to get a wand he had to get lily he had to get the hell out of there but where was he looking around he tried to take in his surroundings as best he could the floor was marble and shiny the walls ornate and grand the ceiling adorned with paintings one might find in the sistine chapel then suddenly it dawned on him impressive interior decorating death eaters and lucius torturing his beloved he was in the malfoy manor but what was he to do with this information he certainly could floo out that would be too noisy and the chances of finding an owl were little to none could he apparate out or did he need his own wand better yet could he apparate into the room where lily was being tortured snag her and apparate out of the building but suddenly there was a long terrible wail from the other room and it seemed that death hand began to constrict james heart then there was a furious voice screaming where is he james potter was in trouble x x x three more days had gone by with no word or sign of where james or lily could be three more days that hermione had to endure without her precious friends one more days until hermione was ripped off the face of the planet just to be thrown carelessly into another time when hermione had confronted dumbledore about the protective charms he agreed that he had cast them over lily house but emma was not recognized by the entire family as an enemy and therefore could break through the charm since she had such a connection to the house that didntmake sense to hermione but then again nothing was making sense to hermione anymore there wasntenough time for anything to make sense something that did make sense was that the order of the phoenix was creating a plan to rescue their friends the adults were going over every known death eater rapidly discussing which house would be most likely to host prisoners many death eaters and lord voldemort all at the same time the only thing wrong with this was that the remaining marauders were being specifically left out for fear that their worry would create a snag in the plan and that their lives would be the first to be targeted whence the order attacked if only the senior members went to rescue them it would be efficient swift and painless regardless of how much sense this made hermione had a knot in the pit of her stomach that remained through all hours of the day and sometimes woke her at night it did not allow her to eat and did not permit her to sleep without the shadows of a nightmare this knot would suddenly seize the entirety of her body squeezing the air from her lungs and tears from her eyes on the early afternoon of july 7 dumbledore announced to the order that the most senior members would be investigating two places the lestrange estate and the malfoy manor both places were large and exquisite very easily having four floors and an extensive cellar and more importantly were the homes of some of the dark lords most trusted death eaters the order was to be starting with the lestrange first because it was more than well known that bellatrix and her husband worshipped the dark lord more enthusiastically than any other almost obsessively one could say no no it doesntmake sense hermione moaned to remus her fingers trembling but it does remus gently and cautiously countered dumbledore highly believes they will be found there but malfoy this isntschool anymore hermione yes malfoy was a dangerous person who probably is bringing harm to our friends but he our age there no way you know who has already trusted him with something this important remus reasoned hermione shook her head and closed her eyes later that day the senior order members collected themselves in the kitchen of the prewett household double checking that their plans were straight and that they had everything they needed just before they left hermione pulled dumbledore aside please professor she begged him i know they arentat the lestrange s they re at the malfoys i just i just know miss lewis all i can say is this no matter where they are they will be safe soon yes in fact they do make it out of here alive i know they do in less than a year james and lily will be married and pregnant with harry the prophecy will have been made and the catalyst will be set aflame but i want them safe now here with me with reluctant eyes and a heart full of fear hermione stared imploringly at the order as they left the prewett house was now quiet the silence full of anxiety and anticipation hermione sat at the kitchen table glaring a hole through a knot in the wood as her racing thoughts were laced with rage and indecision i leaving soon i cantlet them stay there trapped in cages but you know they ll be freed somehow you know they ll be safe i cantbe content standing around wasting my last few precious moments without james and lily they mean everything to me why put myself in excessive unnecessary danger why let them stay in excessive unnecessary danger before hermione knew what she was doing she was halfway up the stairs and digging out her wand from her bag she was not going to let her friends sit in a prison stricken with terror and pain unless she had fought her very hardest to free them and had failed when remus saw her march fiercely from her room he knew something was wrong he caught her by the elbow and they quickly became immersed in hushed angry whispers it was not long before sirius and peter caught on and out of curiosity went to see what was causing the commotion you canthonestly say you re actually considering just going to the malfoys and rescuing them remus scoffed stunned you re telling me you re content with letting your friends waste away in a cell tortured and terrified hermione spat back but dumbledore said sirius started but hermione interjected i know in the pit of my stomach that they are at the malfoy manor growled hermione her eyes glowing with determination i dontcare what you lot do but i going to them i will not sit around and twiddle my thumbs the order has just left for them remus said quietly why not give it time because i donthave any time left remus hermione shouted angrily i leaving within hours i cantsit around and hope that they re all right how can you just throw yourself into a pit of death eaters remus roared back at her suddenly unable to contain his emotions you re not thinking clearly i dontcare if you re leaving soon you have to think about now you cantjust be foolish like that hermione turned a steely eye to her boyfriend and was about to snarl at him but sirius said very quietly i ll go with you remus growled in frustration but hermione stared at him sizing him up wondering if for once sirius could be true to his name and i said peter in a tiny voice hermione beamed at him are you willing to do exactly as i say hermione asked the two boys who had just pledged their allegiance as they nodded she turned to remus well well what he barked back will i give myself over the clutches of the dark lord no i will not and i will not let you do the same hermione if you got hurt or caught or worse i ll be fine trust me hermione snapped she turned her back to him and looked to sirius and peter now listen here what we have to do x x x yes well we re to be expecting an attack any time now so father had us split up between the houses lucius was drawling an arm thrown casually over narcissa shoulder yes i understand that but i want to know why the dark lord isnthere snapped emma i think he should be here to admire how fine of a job we re doing we re just holding these buffoons captive it isntthe hardest wand work narcissa countered lightly we donteven have to do much really just let them rot why would the dark lord waste his time here lucius inquired looking at his nails there are many more important things to be done but even his most inner circle is absent from this mission emma protested looking distraught it as if he doesnteven care anymore well he probably doesn t rose muttered she had been reading a magazine and had finally grown sick of emma whining it good and all that we ve accomplished this much but this mission wasntabout winning anything it was to prove that we could be reliable and instill fear in our enemies then what are we to do if the order actually does come you canthonestly tell yourself they re just going to wait and see what happens emma exclaimed calm yourself woman lucius sneered my father is here waiting in case of attack just as there are some from the inner circle placed nearby accordingly the order will not want to kill anyone they just want their foolish new members back yes well the conversation carried on for a few more minutes like this until suddenly the fireplace towards the back of the room began to roar with angry green flames for a few minutes it blazed empty and roaring before someone finally stepped out the few death eaters in the room jumped with a start but were more shocked than surprised to see peter pettigrew emerge from the flames his face ashen but stoic lucius narcissa rose and emma jumped to their feet wands at the ready for a moment peter said nothing before he said in a trembling voice i ve come to join your forces rose scoffed please pettigrew do not think us to be such simpletons with great difficulty peter spoke again i want to protect my f family or what left of it emma said snidely why choose a time like this to ask for protection to switch sides i i it certainly not because his friends are being held captive lucius drawled sarcastically no no certainly not well yes peter agreed in a squeak i offer myself in order to protect them the four young death eaters regarded peter very carefully scrutinizing his twitchy movements and his fearful eyes peter fidgeted black eyes darting to and fro as the enemies before him cautiously decided his fate unbeknownst to them hermione granger and sirius black were crawling behind them towards the door hidden under the security of james invisibility cloak as lucius began to interrogate peter sirius and hermione slipped out of the room silently closing the drawing room door behind them i cantbelieve that worked sirius hissed to hermione who nodded with wide eyes observing their surroundings carefully hermione looked around for what could lead them to a basement or prison i donteven know where to begin hermione said anxiously most cellars can be accessed from the back of the house especially in large estates like this all of the blacks have their floor plan set up that way because only servants would be in the cellar sirius informed her now if this is the sitting room and the front foyer is there then we have to go this way if i not completely daft still under the invisibility cloak sirius led hermione slowly through the hallway of the manor its walls were exquisite and beautiful capturing not only an artist touch but certainly soul and mind as well from what she could see the rooms were perfectly decorated giving off a hint of sophistication and wealth but not excessive and unnecessary spending soon they reached the place sirius had guessed where the prison might be and hermione was struck with two very strong emotions the first was surprise because sirius was exactly right the second was dread because there was a man guarding the door he had long silvery blond hair and a sharp pointed face with glistening grey eyes at the tip of his nose glasses were perched to help him read the book that was in his hand a look of boredom was clearly displayed on his face almost as if he felt that his position as security guard was too lowly for him sirius and hermione exchanged a worried look searching each other silently for an idea as hermione was about to whisper that they should find an empty room and come up with a plan the heavy clacking of feet began to echo down the hallway soon lucius appeared in the kitchen looking annoyed one of potter imbecile friends is here lucius snapped abraxas malfoy looked up from his book looking equally irritated i wasntsure if i should just stun him and leave him or bring him down there with the others how did he get in exactly asked abraxas in a dangerously soft voice they flooed right into the sitting room we ve got him surrounded lucius said hastily but he hasntattempted to even budge from the spot he been standing in but imagine if dumbledore had just flooed right in lucius abraxas snarled i thought i told you to seal up that fireplace father i left it open for narcissa and the others to i dontgive a damn about your girlfriend lucius abraxas barked and lucius pained face slackened immediately i dontcare how trivial of a mission this is the dark lord commanded we seal everything completely yes father lucius said in a flat voice i going to deal with this little rat myself abraxas muttered pushing himself from the chair and folding his glasses up foolish gryffindors lucius followed his father from the kitchen and the moment their footsteps died hermione and sirius made a break for the prison door with a quick spell hermione unlocked the heavy looking wooden door and the two of them fled down the stairs the cellar was pitch blank and the smell of wet rotting earth was pungent it was also very silent eerily so and hermione feared the worst before she lit up her wand as she and sirius turned in wide hurried circles searching for their friends the bright light finally was cast upon two still bodies in one of the cells lily james hermione and sirius hissed snatching the rusty bars that held the prisoners in hermione wandlight illuminated the couple who looked beaten and wounded but otherwise alright they did not look on the brink of death but rather cold and sallow lily movements were sluggish but she was moving much more than james who had only smiled at them weakly lily touched his shoulder lovingly sighing he wasntsupposed to be captured lily explained and he been putting up a real fight they have a field day he just worn out from well resisting it doesntmatter let get you out of here sirius clipped murmuring spells to undo the cell doors remus james croaked lily caught the heavy look that sirius and hermione shared he protested us coming here the order is coming to save you but they started with the wrong estate hermione explained flatly joining sirius in unlocking the doors which were heavily enchanted why didntyou just wait yourself then lily asked in a small voice i donthave much time left lily hermione responded in a pained voice i can only leave knowing that i did everything i could to keep my friends safe watching the order leave without us was i couldntjust sit around and wait for them to return with you when do you leave lily asked hermione as the prison door finally cracked open what time is it sirius about seven o clock five hours hermione responded brusquely this new information shocked the friends into a new silence which they hastily covered up by hoisting james body from the floor with great effort he heaved in pain but managed to cooperate with their movements rather than continue being dead weight they began in the direction of the stairs but as soon as they were halfway up it a potential problem was discovered how are we supposed to get out of here lily hissed at hermione who looked to sirius is there some kind of servant exit or something she asked desperately we cantjust hoist james up the stairs and walk out the front door it would be suicide suddenly there was a loud roar that echoed down the hallway followed by a tremendous banging noise they could hear from the hallway outside of the kitchen that a fleet of thundering feet was coming from the sitting room towards the kitchen lily sirius and hermione stopped dead their hearts hammering with icy dread that seized control of their movements then remus lupin burst into the kitchen looking determined and terrified he spotted his friends coming up the stairs and his eyes bulged with surprise go somewhere else hermione shouted at him we need to get james out of get that damn werewolf a small throng of cloaked death eaters burst into the kitchen sending remus who had been temporarily halted after the sight of his friends sprawling onto the floor hermione panicking whipped out her wand as fast as she could managing to close the door to the top of the stairs but not protect it a moment later the door was blown to smithereens leaving nothing but the hinges screaming hermione and lily sprang back as a curse flew by their heads falling halfway down the stairs while james body fell clean on top of them sirius managed to jump up fighting the spells that were now being shot at them but it was of no use sirius was only one against at least five and countless others that could be called it was not long before all of them had been stunned and imprisoned again when hermione finally woke it was to the smell of musty earth that filled her nostrils and the constant drip drop of water somewhere although the ground was cold and wet she felt others beside her rising as unsteadily as she had there was a pained groan somewhere off to her right and the shuffle of moving bodies hermione searched her robes for her wand but she knew that it would not be there struggling she sat up and vainly began to rouse those who were closest to her one by one everyone began to wake there was a weak hand that clutched her arm but she knew from the touch that it was remus lily once again was nursing james and sirius by the sounds of it was discovering his own wounds what happened sirius asked at last still groggy i couldntsit around and wait any longer remus admitted quietly so you came just as illogically as we had hermione finished up remus gently squeezed her shoulder i couldntlet you have all the fun peter james croaked off getting help i hope hermione said grimly during all the commotion there was more than enough time for him to escape as a rat dumbledore will be here soon then lily said with more confidence than hermione could have mustered there was a clattering from up above and rough voices followed by footsteps they could hear one death eater call to another shouting that their prisoners had awakened the prisoners held their breath staring up at the clammy floor as if there was a window more footsteps suddenly a terrible thought occurred to hermione what time is it sirius hermione hissed her heart fluttering erm 11 50 by the looks of it he answered after scrutinizing his watch when get that mudblood up here no roared remus suddenly throwing himself on top of hermione we cantlet them take you no no but the door had opened and an unnatural amount of light filled the prison cell that was hosting them all there was no noise no movement no anything anymore time seemed to freeze and the only thing that existed was the terror that had gripped hermione heart with a vice grip she watched paralyzed with her own epiphany that her last moments would not be in the embrace of her lover or with her friends but by being tortured one again by the people she hated most her friends were tossed aside with the flick of the death eaters wand his icy hand enclosing on her motionless body just as easily as all of her friends had been cursed aside as she was dragged the feeble bodies of her friends cried out in protest but they were cries that never reached her ears but they were screams that would forever remain engraved in her memory and as she was finally dragged into the light out of the prison she began to understand that she would never see these beloved people again and she had just allowed herself to be taken away from them without even a hand raised against it no no suddenly hermione wrenched herself from the death eater grasp and threw herself back down the stairs injuring her body as she went though she knew it was worth it she blinked stars back from her vision as she clung to the bars with all of her might her friends were quick to latch themselves onto her as well unwilling to let her go they were screaming in terror but all hermione could say was i love you i love you to each one of her friends soon her words became unintelligible as they were accompanied by sobs and new screams as two death eaters dragged her all the way up the stairs flinging her into the arms of fate remus x x x author note aaaaahhhh i cantbelieve i just did that either dontworry anyway i think i am going to have only

this is it the chapter i have been itching to write for so long please enjoy it as much as i do still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty six hermione return no no suddenly hermione wrenched herself from the death eater grasp and threw herself back down the stairs injuring her body as she went though she knew it was worth it she blinked stars back from her vision as she clung to the bars with all of her might her friends were quick to latch themselves onto her as well unwilling to let her go they were screaming in terror but all hermione could say was i love you i love you to each one of her friends soon her words became unintelligible as they were accompanied by sobs and new screams as two death eaters dragged her all the way up the stairs flinging her into the arms of fate remus tears blurred the vision of death eaters looming above her sobs distorted the cruel words they said against her and the breaking of her heart distracted her from the curses they chose to use on her nothing mattered anymore not voldemort not the malfoys not the order not even the danger she was surely in she had been dragged away from what made her heart whole what delivered life and love into her body what had made her complete in the world the people she had been taken from would never ever be in her life again as wonderfully as they had moments before and the devastating tragedy was too great to allow her to focus on the jeering death eaters above her get up mudblood they growled at her but hermione was deaf to their harsh threats for she was consumed with the loss that was to come in moments the loss that she had been denying for several months in fear of this tragic heartbreak as they seized her by the elbow and dragged her up off the floor hermione body began to take on a weightless sort of feeling through her tears she saw a light growing stronger and brighter with each pulse of her racing heart it did not matter that the death eaters threw her against the nearest wall it did not matter that their feet lashed out at her defenseless body the light blinding and yet terribly beautiful washed everything unpleasant away hermione looked up at the throng of death eaters around her hearing nothing but sensing an odd echoing feeling that must have been their furious snarls at her disobedience as the light began to consume her surroundings and finally hermione itself she had a singular fleeting thought at least i will have remus x x x harry and ron were sprinting as fast as they could to the gryffindor tower both hearts were racing in the chests of the gryffindors although one was from panic and the other a dreadful fear the two boys disregarded curious questions as to their odd behavior and ignored offended looks from students and teachers as they sped through the corridors after what seemed to be an eternity of running harry and ron finally made it to their dormitory snatching the marauder map from his trunk the two boys heaving for breath ripped open the map muttered the correct words and began to search for hermione dot it was a minute or two before either one of them spotted anything look ron exclaimed she leaving lupin classroom and running harry do you think she just left to snitch on us no harry said in a low voice you heard her scream that wasntfrom any old spider or anything where is she going blimey she running fast they watched in a curious silence as hermione dot fled across hogwarts is she going to dumbledore office ron proposed yeah i think so harry murmured watching as hermione dot paused and then began to finish its path to the headmaster office we should go wait for her ron decided i want to know what the bloody hell made her scream all the way down to the headmaster office the two boys argued over what could have stricken their best with such terror ron argued that it probably was a spider because madam pince would not have allowed anyone to attack her so loudly in the library and harry added if someone had attacked hermione she was powerful enough to set them right as they finally reached the stoic stone gargoyle it was slowly opening for the departure of someone else harry relieved to see hermione at last let out of a sigh of relief ron heart simply skipped a beat but any sort of comfort they felt was immediately stolen from them when they saw hermione face the girl was as white as a sheet trembling from head to toe and hermione face was puffy with tears she looked as if she was about to crumple at any given moment she did not see them as she carefully and slowly descended the final steps hermione harry asked tentatively are you alright the head girl looked up and for a second hermione face with the epitome of joy of hope as she searched harry face then just as quickly the euphoria vanished replaced by a forlorn look she stopped at the final step saying nothing but staring into harry face lip quivering hermione asked ron taking a careful step towards her her head snapped at the sound of his voice and without further ado she burst into tears and fled past them her heaving sobs echoing through the corridor w what ron spluttered should we follow her harry asked after a moment ron gave him a distraught look do you want to deal with that because you know we arentgoing to get anywhere with her crying like a banshee that true i suppose but the boys did check the map and after making sure that hermione was safely back in gryffindor tower they slowly made their way back to the tower as well wondering what on earth had hermione troubled so much x x x there was nothing but blackness nothing at first until blackness was accompanied by a painful throbbing in her head then there was the pulsing ache throughout her arm as it was twisted at a strange angle then there came the realization that her body was cramped up bent and stuffed into a small space with a pained groan hermione twisted around pushing and pulling until her hand unlatched something and she went tumbling out of her prison and into daylight rubbing her eyes she blinked and saw that she was half sprawled out on the floor while the other half of her was still in the vanishing cabinet her bag and books were also splayed across the ground and noting how much her body resisted hermione stood and collected her things she tried to focus solely on how she felt physically tried to repeat and reiterate all of the books that she had with her tried to do anything to ignore the severe loss she had just undergone for she hermione granger had just lost the people most dear to her lily with her flaming red hair and her sense of sisterly duty james with his mischievous ways and soft sided demeanor sirius his need for laughter but his tremendous loyalty and even peter wanting nothing more than for everyone to be happy and safe remus lupin was a different story of all of her friends she loved him the most and was incredibly grateful that he could still be in her life of all her lost and now dead friends he would be the anchor the deciding factor that all of these precious memories were tangible and meaningful without thinking her feet brought her in the direction of remus office with each step her heart began to hammer jumping up into her throat her stomach began to twist up uncomfortably almost to the point that she was nauseous but no matter how breathless or terrified she felt she forced her fisted hand to rap quietly on the classroom door of remus lupin there was a noise of shuffling papers footsteps before the door opened and hermione felt herself melt with relief remus stood before her looking pleasantly at her hermione hi she said sheepishly in return may i come in certainly he said standing back to let her through she put her things down on the nearest desk and turned to him trying desperately to contain her overjoyed smile remus sat on the edge of his desk he looked lined with age weathered with grey streaks in his hair what can i do for you well hermione started twisted her fingers anxiously grinning i back i didntactually think i would ever be back here remus gave her a strange look back he repeated yes she said eyes narrowed with confused you know what i talking about remus remus spluttered hermione i do not think we re on a personal enough level for you to call me that i dontmean to sound so rude but please i am professor lupin to you what hermione whispered her eyes suddenly wide professor lupin noticed the way hermione face suddenly drained of color are you alright this cantbe happening this cantbe happening d dontyou remember dontyou remember us hermione i dontunderstand answered lupin cautiously noting how hysteria and panic was creeping onto hermione face y you said you would never leave me you s said it wouldntmatter how old you were hermione stuttered reaching blinding for a chair as lovely memories flashed before her eyes she and remus together in bed holding one another closely remus whispering that he loved her her and remus holding hands and laughing the first time they ever kissed that cold night on christmas professor lupin looked alarmed at her words but nonetheless approached hermione trembling body cautiously hermione i dontknow what you re talking about please take a deep breath and calm down jane lewis hermione screamed at him suddenly flinging herself out of the chair and grabbing fistfuls of hair in desperation a and james and lily and sirius and peter and the illimni and lucius malfoy why dontyou remember anything very slowly as if examining every letter of his words lupin said all of those people were in my life at some point i remember them i dontunderstand what you re trying to say i was jane lewis hermione shouted eyes brimming with tears of frustration standing up professor lupin looked taken aback that is impossible hermione how can you be someone who lived decades ago because you sent me back into the past why are you doing this remus she bawled as he shook his head her body now succumbing to the tears of confusion she had been holding back she dug around furiously in her bag and once she found what she was looking for she threw the book of mischief at remus who caught it looking startled you put a time charm on the thirteenth page as she said this professor lupin was slowly flipping through the pages imbibing all the information that he could reliving the memories he and his friends had recorded then he stopped at the thirteenth page and looked it over cautiously this charm was invented to throw someone 19 minutes into the past miss granger lupin said quietly and it was james idea to add a delirium charm onto it so that the victim caught by this charm would end up hallucinating all the blood in her veins froze her heart which had been hammering with fear and confusion simply stopped in her chest no was all she could utter although it was barely audible i m i sorry the professor said looking pained but sincerely apologetic it was real hermione insisted i was there from december to july of your seventh year i was best friends with lily and and please calm down the professor urged sensing that hermione was on the brink of hysteria she glared at him for suggesting such a thing he beckoned to the chair next to her sit i will go fetch you some calming draught i fortunately have some in my office after making sure hermione did indeed sit the professor hastily went to his office for the next several minutes hermione could do nothing but inhale jagged breaths and impatiently wipe away tears from her face as she desperately sought an answer that would prove this mystery there was absolutely no way that remus could be telling the truth the last several months of her life had been so vivid so scarring and so emotional that being the result of a hallucination was preposterous she stared out the window thinking desperately for a solution noting subconsciously the beautiful sunset and the silhouette of an owl that flew across it then the answer occurred to her remus came out of his office looking hurried and anxious but holding a large goblet in his hands he presented it to hermione who gave him a scathing look and refused the drink by now she had calmed herself down and was ready to fight him with cool logic i know it was real i know you re lying to me she growled in a low voice it because of what pansy said right before she left you heard her as well as i did but you promised to stand by me no matter your age hermione i will always be here for you just not in the way you believe the professor exclaimed looking as if he wanted to reach out and comforting the wounded student in front of him i can be your mentor and your friend but i can only be those things you promised hermione repeated in a fierce whisper and so did sirius and lily and james and even peter i sure if they were alive they would not pretend to be so blind my friends are dead and gone remus said softly if they were alive i sure they would have thought highly of their son best friend how can you do this to me hermione croaked her lip beginning to tremble you said i did not say anything remus interjected quietly whatever happened in your hallucination it was not you told me you loved me you told me you would never leave me i sorry for whatever you think happened hermione remus murmured again but they were just dreams and nothing else at this hermione threw herself out of the chair knocking over the desk and spilling the calming draught dumbledore will reveal you remus he will not stand by and let you break my heart like this dumbledore will acknowledge what happened with that she fled from lupin classroom tears streaming down her face left alone in the spiraling silence remus simply buried his face in his hands she had never moved faster in all of her life but every single one of hermione muscles screamed for proof that would allow her to be with remus again the stone gargoyle was bombarded with passwords and when he finally began to move he could not move fast enough for hermione urgent fleeting footsteps she pounded on dumbledore door and was not sure which was louder her furious knocking or her hammering heart finally dumbledore soft voice allowed her entrance and she flung herself into his office professor she said breathlessly she fell into a seat and panted watching him fold away a letter than he had just been reading how are you miss granger it seems you are out of breath dumbledore pointed out rather redundantly but she could not help but smile slightly yes well i ve just run across the castle to get here so you can imagine hermione said before being introduced to a coughing fit as she recovered she said i ve just arrived back from 1979 and i ve come to deliver the letter excuse me dumbledore asked politely i must have misheard you hermione stared at the headmaster stunned into a shocked silence no you heard me right i said i was back from 1979 dumbledore regarded her for a moment and she felt as if she was being x rayed by his blue eyes i do not quite understand miss granger gaping for a moment hermione rushed to ask does the name jane lewis mean anything to you many years ago i had a student named jane lewis she was a gryffindor alongside professor lupin in fact dumbledore answered looking slightly confused but supplying her with the information nonetheless that was me hermione stated me the marauders sent me back in time and and you gave me that name professor and you told me to come deliver a letter to your past self as soon as i returned to my present time miss granger did you by any chance read a small book called the book of mischief it sent me back in time hermione cried seizing her hair in frustration once more as her world began to crumble around her 19 years with remus and james and lily and sirius and peter miss granger are you aware that the book held a time charm that was interwoven quite badly may i add with a delirium charm no hermione bellowed that is not true this cantbe happening this cantbe happening professor lupin friends were quite mischievous in their day the book of mischief was created to amuse them dumbledore continued gently almost reluctantly through hermione mutterings of denial it was not however created to harm anyone well it too late for that hermione sniffed angrily whatever it was that was in that book destroyed my heart professor i had a life with them i loved each and every one of them and they all promised to care for me even if they were tremendously older and the only one who can stick to that promise is remus lupin and he denies me he denies the past that happened he denies ever loving me i am deeply sorry hermione dumbledore said in a quiet voice hermione clamped her eyes shut and chanted to herself that this was the true delirium dumbledore shuffling papers around on his desk murmured it pains me to see that they have wounded you in some way but it pains me more to see your heart broken hermione looked up at the headmaster and saw that tears were trickling down his face and hitting the parchment he was holding in his hands then he sighed shaking his head whatever loveliness you dreamt was just a dream i am very sorry before she control herself she was overwhelmed by tears of the devastating realization that the greatest moments of her life that the most precious and incredible people she had ever met sprang from a wonderful and terrible hallucination her love for remus lupin was null and void although the mere thought of him brought forth a blossoming of happiness within her chest now it was stained with the reality of the situation as she left hermione trembled with the knowledge that she would have to build her life anew move on from the tragedy and loss that was lily james sirius peter and remus she blanched with the thought of having to see her beloved every day having to look into his eyes without seeing the mirrored love that was so often present the gargoyle that blocked the exit slowly spun to let her free she stared at her feet wanting nothing more than to disappear into oblivion so she could face her humiliation and pain alone but then hermione that voice so familiar so welcoming so kind and loving hermione heart leapt up in joy as she raised her eyes to stare at james potter face as always he looked concerned for hermione state of being wanting nothing more than to help her feel better she searched his face for some sort of answer and her smile vanished as she noticed james vividly green eyes are you alright asked james again those eyes were the blocks of cement that dragged her heart to the very bottom of the ocean she continued to stare into james face hoping praying that he could blink and his eyes would be hazel once again and hermione could breathe a sigh of relief hermione asked another voice her head whipped around and looked into the face of ron weasley whatever loveliness you dreamt was just a dream hermione granger was in fact back in 1998 she burst into tears and fled past them knowing that she could never begin to explain how the book of mischief had destroyed her life x x x does anyone know what going on with hermione ginny asked harry and ron one day at breakfast hermione had not joined them but then again it was not a surprise when ginny had woken hermione that morning the head girl simply stared at her friend as if searching for something but then burst into tears she been acting strange since yesterday ron said through a mouthful of food the three of us were in the library and we split up and then we heard her scream and then we couldntfind her we looked on the map harry took over and she was running from lupin office to dumbledore s and then when we met up with her she just started crying and ran away i hate it when she does that ginny muttered selecting some bacon for her plate but this dreaded behavior did not just continue for days it continued for weeks during meals hermione would keep rather silent staring only at her plate during classes she would work feverishly throwing herself into the lesson unless it was defense against the dark arts in which she would always keep her head bowed during any free time the four friends had hermione would whisk herself off the library engrossing herself in work there was a day during defense against the dark arts in which hermione stayed alone after class when the students had finally filed out hermione ushered harry and ron to go on without her professor lupin did his best to hide his discomfort of being alone with hermione and the girl sensed it i just wanted to apologize for my behavior a few weeks ago hermione said quietly staring at the floor i wasntmy right self that delirium charm really had me convinced yes i can understand that it seemed you had just emerged from it often times those who are affected by the delirium charm do not have their wits about them for quite some time for it is quite powerful if correctly applied professor lupin said i can certainly agree with that hermione said with a small smile trying desperately not to look into the professor face and i have noticed that you ve been not yourself for the past few weeks the professor pointed out you have to use every ounce of your being to go back to your normal life hermione yes but it just it was so lovely where i was in 1979 hermione whispered almost pleadingly as if she wanted him to understand how desperately she missed it i have never been so close to anyone in my life than i was with the people from back my delirium i suppose you must move on hermione lupin urged her harry and ron are certainly equivalents to these people you thought you had befriended and ginny weasley certainly equates to how i imagine lily must have been she was hermione said with a nostalgic smile and harry and ron are just as wonderful as james and sirius it just i had a life with them and you and lily and i am still rooted to them in the past everywhere i look it a constant reminder of losing them hermione paused and looked up to the professor almost reluctantly and you carefully professor lupin put a gentle hand on her shoulder you must use the resources around you to achieve happiness take them into your life as completely and wholly as you can so that your mind latches itself onto this reality do everything you can and hold nothing back it was gentle words like these that touched hermione heart and caused memories to rush into her mind the kind professor standing before her a sympathetic look adorning his face was just the remus lupin she had fallen in love with she looked up meeting his eyes and for the very first time since she had arrived back she felt the startling but undeniable connection between them the blazing passion that had accompanied them on many nights together but had always been present between them in the past remus with her hand on her shoulder was very close hermione could feel the space begging to be closed like two magnets pulled apart her breath was caught in her chest and all control was lost in his eyes her heart racing hammering in her throat she did not think as she leaned in towards her professor eyes locked on his their lips met for a fraction of a second but it was that moment that set her body aflame with desire and desperate want to find a time turner behind her closed eyes she relived the first night that they became one intertwined by love and passion it was also a fraction of a second later that lupin gently pushed hermione away i sorry he croaked still inches from her face she could feel his breath on her lips and again wanted nothing more than to close the gap between them you have to leave he stared down at hermione for a second seemingly torn between his words and what had just happened with just the same intensity he pulled away from hermione hurrying away into his office hermione stood stock still her body still on fire with the vivid dreams and memories that swirled within her as she stood there in the terrible silence eyes closed against the reality of professor lupin empty classroom she basked in the clearest and poignant memory of all i love you hermione i dontcare how the future turns out you will always be the only one i love remus whispered to her but as dumbledore had said even the loveliest of her dreams were just dreams x x x author note well my heart was racing as i wrote this anyway i ve already got a huge chunk of the next chapter done and i would say three chapters left or around there anyway thank you forever and always to faithful wheezy without whom hermione future would forever be undecided please review disclaimer dontown it just use it note next chapter is either second to last or last this is so exciting still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty seven the epiphany he stared down at hermione for a second seemingly torn between his words and what had just happened with just the same intensity he pulled away from hermione hurrying away into his office hermione stood stock still her body still on fire with the vivid dreams and memories that swirled within her as she stood there in the terrible silence eyes closed against the reality of professor lupin empty classroom she basked in the clearest and poignant memory of all i love you hermione i dontcare how the future turns out you will always be the only one i love remus whispered to her but as dumbledore had said even the loveliest of her dreams were just dreams her hopes crushed and her heart truly broken the head girl left the classroom of the one man she knew she would love forever trying to fight back tears the moment she stepped out of the room she discovered and startled an eavesdropping ginny weasley ginny hermione cried shutting the door quickly behind her feeling panicked of what her friend could have just learned i cant believe you so this is what been making you bonkers lately ginny inquired looking genuinely interested hermione shot her a pained and annoyed look before brushing past her and hurrying up the hall now wanting nothing more than to fling herself onto her bed and cry ginny kept up striding next to her you know i wontstop pestering you until i get an answer leave me alone hermione snapped no i will not leave you alone is this problem legitimate did you really go back in time ginny questioned setting closer to her friend hermione stopped in her tracks and glared at her redheaded friend stop it ginny leave it alone leave it alone or i will break down again and you had a thing with lupin didntyou stop it hermione bellowed her face now finally crinkling beneath the weight of her sadness you have no right to just to just try and help a friend who desperately in need of help ginny finished quietly dontthink i haventnoticed dontthink that ron and harry haventeither you haventbeen yourself for the last few weeks and you run off all the time to go cry you dontunderstand hermione hiccupped before turning and fleeing past ginny determinedly try me ginny shouted angrily why wontyou ever let anyone help you because i have to do this on my own hermione cried whipping around to face her you re just like harry with the whole superiority complex we re all human hermione we all have emotions just tell me and suddenly instead of the infuriated retort that was ready to be spat everything came pouring out of hermione mouth like a dam that had been slowly leaking augmenting cracks before the whole thing finally crumbled under the pressure hermione rant began angrily and with power but as she relived every moment of those seven months she began to collapse now no one believes me i didntexist the whole thing was just a just a stupid delirium charm hermione sobbed having already slumped against the wall and i went and kissed lupin and now he thinks he thinks ginny rubbed her back in small comforting circles and allowed the silence to embrace them only dotted by hermione soft cries then ginny asked was he good in bed this prompted hermione to start laughing quietly at first her sobs accompanied by chortles before she fell victim to a fit of mirth encouraged by ginny genuine question you have no sympathy ginny hermione said after a few minutes though she was laughing that might be true but i do have one thing ginny informed her friend answers what do you mean hermione asked her i have the answer to solve your heartbreak you need to snog my brother hermione expected herself to scream in indignation at this piece of advice but she considered it i not even over remus yet how can i go and lead ron on like that hermione pointed out wiping away a few stray tears just snog him and stay with him and let him snog you and let him act like the buffoon he is and then my friend you will be alright ginny assured her i dontthink shhhh ginny interjected trust me and so she trusted hermione trusted everything that ginny told her for she felt that in order to fall back into the rhythm of this reality she had to go blindly where she knew she could and ginny allowed her to walk blindfolded into a new life without judgment and fear sometimes ginny and hermione would talk about hermione delirium at first their discussions always ended in tears but then slowly they were filled with laughter and peace ginny could not believe half of the terrible things hermione iterated about lucius malfoy or the powerful illimni that stood beside him ginny favorite stories were predictably those about lily and james you still fancy harry dontyou hermione whispered to her redheaded friend one day at the library ginny flushed swatting an impatient hand at her friend ron first then harry one relationship at a time then christmas was upon them just as fast as the first snow had come ron and ginny were staying for the holidays which gave ginny an extraordinary idea seeing as hermione was also staying on christmas eve there were sprigs of mistletoe hung everywhere many couples took advantage of this much to the disgust of the younger students hermione felt flustered and pressured by all of the romantic plans but when she confessed this to ginny the youngest weasley told her it was all part of the plan blimey harry why are all these girls throwing themselves at you lately ron asked harry through a mouthful of plum pudding that night at the feast harry shot an embarrassed furtive look at ginny before shrugging all this damn mistletoe i guess dinner went by reasonably well for it had been within the last week after ginny interference that hermione was beginning to return to her normal self again she helped harry with his homework nagged ron for his rude jokes and began to give in to ginny gossip after dinner when music filled the gryffindor common room and those who were staying began to have more fun than mcgonagall would have permitted ginny pulled harry aside away from the crowd and to a secluded corner ginny beckoned for him to come closer and they bent their necks to talk i need your help with someone ginny whispered i trying to get hermione to snog ron but i dontthink she going to go through with it about bloody time harry whispered back scanning the room for his two friends ron was talking with seamus and dean fervently about something perhaps quidditch while hermione was being lectured by pavarti patil about not styling her hair there mistletoe everywhere but they ve both been avoiding it ginny informed him her face still close to his so we ll have to push them together of course ginny said giving him a smug look that sounds erm not exactly promising harry began doubtfully but ginny cut across him do you have a better plan no i suppose not then you get ron and i ll get hermione i ll signal to you so you know when ginny decided smiling deviously but just as harry had predicted getting ron and hermione to cooperative without exactly asking them to cooperate was a bit difficult ginny had cut into pavarti lecturing and had tried to guide hermione over into a corner where mistletoe essentially dominated the ceiling and harry had tried to do the same all was going well until hermione chose to yawn and look up ginny no hermione cried suddenly stepping out from under the mistletoe i cantjust just go and do it like that but you ll never go through with it then ginny moaned stamping her foot angrily please wontyou just no hermione snapped and turned on her heel unlike hermione ron just didntknow what was going on harry had subtly tried leading him over to the mistletoe but ron didntget the hint that he was supposed to follow harry as he inched away the quick row between hermione and ginny caught his attention as ron watched hermione storm from the common room he turned to harry what do you reckon set her off this time no idea harry muttered then he had an idea you should go see if she okay though no way ron exclaimed and get my head bitten off just do it ron harry said turning ron around and giving him a great shove in the direction of hermione departure trust me x x x it was little things like this that set hermione off ginny trying to set her up with ron reminded her inexplicably of lily trying to play matchmaker when remus wanted to be involved and even when he didn t hermione paced back and forth across the entrance to the common room trying to calm herself down and trying to ignore the loud music from inside ginny trick without meaning to sent her over the edge and hermione was trying to do everything she could to quell her tears but how could she how could she betray the last seven months of her life that she had dedicated solely to remus lupin how could she just go and kiss ron and forget all about remus remus who would forever remain in her memory would forever haunt each beat of her heart shadow every action and every thought could not just be pushed aside like that she was brushing aside tears when the portrait opened and ron weasley stepped out looking nervous but genuinely concerned hermione shot him a small smile before turning her back to him and sniffling you okay ron asked from behind her she imagined him slouching with his hands in his pockets looking uncomfortable the image tugged a smile onto her lips yeah she answered but her voice cracked revealing her his concerned hand on her shoulder made her turn around why are you crying he asked her tentatively silently mouthing words for a moment she finally said i upset then ron launched into an explanation of the many reasons why she should not be upset but in fact very happy they were reasons that included the spectacular christmas feast the party that was blossoming in the common room and all the parcels she would receive christmas morning in the middle of his rant a very curious expression began to appear on hermione face and although ron wanted to stop and ask her what was wrong he continued on and the chudley cannons are surely going to win this year so that something to be pleased about oh and my mum will send you another sweater and treacle tart which should be lovely and dontforget but ron was suddenly interrupted as hermione flung her arms around ron neck and kissed him full on the mouth quick taken aback ron stood rooted to the spot dumbfounded as hermione kissed him when she pulled back they simply stared at one another without another word hermione blinked and after a few more moments when ron shocked expression did not fade she sighed and walked away lot of ruddy help that was hermione thought to herself addressing the portrait she started to say godric gryff but was interjected by ron seizing her elbow and pulling hermione flush up against him it was she this time that stood rooted to the spot with shock ron had a tight arm behind her back one tangled up in her wild hair kissing her just as passionately as remus had kissed her on that certain christmas it was this thought that made hermione heart stop for a moment but was also the impetus for her to close her eyes and snake her arms around the tall gingery boy trying to use this opportunity for all it was worth x x x did you see them are they holding hands i heard they were snogging all christmas eve you re joking finally the gossip about hermione granger and ron weasley made the head girl blush a deep shade of scarlet her actions very unlike her had caused quite a stir among her friends ginny had been giving her snide looks all week and harry could frequently be seen clapping his friend on the back in congratulations although hermione felt quite guilty about it she let ron kiss her whenever he liked and she allowed herself to hold hands with him she did not stop him when he wove an arm around her waist or frown upon his hand on her knee all of these things were permitted because remus lupin had once advised her to take these people into her life as completely and wholly as she could so that her mind would latch itself onto the true reality and that was exactly what she had been doing a few weeks had gone by and hermione had sort of settled into a rhythm with her life and with ron however as much as hermione tried to disguise it her actions deviated from a rhythm and not from a natural order it was not long into february that ginny who had been scrutinizing hermione actions spoke up how ron ginny asked innocently during a study session in the library fine hermione said absently her mind focused on her quill and parchment how other stuff fine your parents fine and your school work fine ginny how about lupin unlike many of the other words this particular word struck hermione right in the heart there was a pregnant pause before hermione whispered fine but all was not fine because you know i was thinking about something you said pansy parkinson showed up in that time right ginny asked causing some painful memories to surface in hermione brain don t hermione snapped trying to turn her attention fully to her assignment well i was thinking we could have a girl night with her ginny began slowly and then grinned at hermione disgusted look us three and some veritaserum ginny no hermione hissed looking around to make sure no one had heard ginny terrible idea why not why not why not only because we can get into loads of trouble veritaserum has to mature for an entire full lunar cycle and i do think that snape will be suspicious if something were to go missing in his cabinet and because we d be doing it all for nothing it was just a dream hermione growled emphasizing each word as if the severity would convince ginny to believe her and to back off however it did neither ginny inspected her nails and said offhandedly you still love lupin gaping like a fish for a moment hermione turned scarlet before she began to sputter retorts but ginny would have none of it i see it every morning during breakfast ron comes and gives you a kiss and you look at lupin as though you expected him to get up and start a row and after every defense against the dark arts class you walk out of that room looking flustered and upset and i wait outside everyday to walk with harry so donttry to fool me ginny threatened shaking a finger at her friend it could never happen ginny hermione cried even if i do even if it wasnta dream it doesntmatter how could i be with him it doesntmatter how couldnt you be with him you love him enough that it tearing you apart i beginning to think that harry senses something is wrong as well you have to understand hermione ginny started crossing her arms with a huff you ve fancied my brother for years now and since you ve started dating you should be head over heels but you re not your heart isntwith ron i can see it you can see it and others are beginning to see it ginny if you dontfind out now hermione you will regret it for the rest of your life hermione looked as though her insides were being twisted up at the fleeting thought of remus kissing her murmuring his undying love for her tears welled up in her eyes and she shook her head to ginny request for she had already done things that she would regret for the rest of her life x x x it was now march and when it was not grey and drizzling outside of the castle fierce winds took it upon themselves to plague every student that stepped onto the grounds and even on the occasional day the sun was allowed a few moments to extend its ray beyond the utmost layer of the atmosphere this sort of weather perfectly reflected the life of hermione granger when she was not bombarded by essays books rows with ron or other such things the days of her life simply just flew by without letting her have any sort of handle on them there were some days when she managed not to think about remus lupin but those days were still few there were even fewer days that passed in which she did not think about her time in 1979 but those were rare but every now and then a stroke of luck would possess hermione granger and she would be freed from the burden on her memories quidditch practice today ron was informing his friends at the table hermione reading the daily prophet with a frown upon her face muttered that nice we re missing a chaser today harry said to ron over his goblet of pumpkin juice katie recovering from a jinx i heard i can fill in for her harry ginny offered with a bright smile you know i just as good as katie harry smiled warmly back at her and was about to accept her offer but we can do without one chaser for today ron grunted observing the exchange between harry and his sister ron please ginny reproached with an obvious scowl harry captain let him decide i think it wouldnt hurt harry pointed out but looked uneasy with the glare ron was giving him hermione please reason with him what the girl looked up from her newspaper and quickly glanced at her three friends harry looked torn ginny looked upset and ron looked furious looking back down at her paper hermione said flatly ron let ginny do what she wants she a big girl yeah but maybe i dontwant her messing around with messing up the quidditch team ron snapped i can make my own decisions ginny cried looking furious i said no ron shouted back guys come on but harry was lost in the new shouting match between brother and sister hermione half listening to their conversation was engrossed in the outrage that rita skeeter had managed to get out into the wizarding world through the daily prophet it was terrible that the woman had people fooled and entranced enough to read her filthy editorials but it was atrocious that she managed to have them printed in such a significant newspaper and you cantcontrol me just like you cantcontrol her right hermione yes lily hermione agreed absently flipping over the page just so she could continue to shake her head at rita article what did you just call her it was not the words that captured hermione attention but the tone of voice harry sounded delusional but yet furious confused and yet inexplicably mad their faces displayed shock and confusion but none were as confused as hermione what did i say but hermione stopped dead and her words hit her like a train yes lily hermione clapped a hand into her mouth almost as if to take back the words she had said then as swiftly as her terrible epiphany she fled from the great hall it had been several months since hermione had returned from her delirium but each day the belief that these memories were real became stronger and unavoidable an example of this had been displayed in the great hall as had a number of near slip ups she spent many hours longing for time with her past friends and would quite often begin to call harry by his father name james many a time hermione would be caught in a fond memory and would turn around expecting to see her friends by her side but none of it was real none of it could ever be real but i checked out a book on the delirium charm hermione argued with herself fiercely as if trying to prove her insanity to be true the total effects of the delirium charm should wear off in a week at the longest it been months something isntright here it was harder and harder everyday to pretend that she was in love with ron that lupin was just another teacher and that the people she longed for were not dead and gone but right beside her everyday hermione allowed herself to be the victim of deception of pure insidiousness as these memories carved their marks on the cavern of her mind they were beautiful and powerful memories ones that could never be dreamt up or forgotten tears streaming down her face hermione heading for moaning myrtle lavatory where she knew a moment rest would be waiting for her regardless of her memories or sanity she had her safe house choosing a stall and ignoring myrtle contemptuous remarks hermione whipped her stray tears away and began to search for her diary in her bag touching the corners of books scrolls and quills hermione turbulent mind went blank for a moment as the sensitive tips of her fingers brushed up against something foreign it was silky and cool beneath her fingertips and although hermione peered into the darkness of her bag a few tears dripping in she could not see this object seconds later the entire contents of her school bag lay on the floor absorbing water and rolling into puddles none of this mattered however because the one truly valuable object was sitting atop this quandary of school supplies it was a necklace the silvery chain flowed like water beneath her fingers as she picked it up with trembling fingers on the chain was a pendant that showcased a diamond engraved teardrop with a small ruby in the middle the chain was normal a chain you could find around any girl neck but it was strong as the chain neared the pendent it turned into a little vine with ivy leaves tiny words embedded that she could not read quickly grabbing a jar of frog eyes from her bag that she used in potions she used the capped flask as a magnifying glass nearly dropping it due to her quivering hand as she squinted and muttered words that were clouded by frog eyes she made out a single sentence that had forever been on the necklace no matter the pain we go through i will always be still so close to you and then hermione remembered with a tentative look at her he reached inside his pocket and withdrew a small box covered in black velvet it was long and rectangular and he held it out to her happy christmas jane he whispered looking her in the eyes surprised hermione reached out to take it and their fingers brushed his gazed was steady and intense but he felt a certain nervousness creep over him her mouth dry and her words lost in the knot that were her vocal cords she tentatively opened the velvet box and gazed open mouthed and amazed at the gift it held hermione cautiously reached out to touch the silver it stung fiercely in the cold winter night sliding over her skin like water it felt innocent and extravagant she lifted the pendent from the bottom of the box and held it in her hand it felt like a dew drop on a misty summer morning absent of the cicadas lullaby when hermione eyes flickered open she was not surprised to feel the rivulets of tears streaming down her face beautiful and monstrous memories such as this made her heart skip in ecstasy but simultaneously ripped holes in the very fiber of her being because she knew dwelling on this uncertain past was not only foolish but mentally dangerous she savored the memory of their first kiss that night as she ran the sleek silver necklace between her fingers hiccupping she reached around and fastened the jewelry around her own neck wanting nothing more for her hands to belong to someone else someone else who would after in indecisive moment kiss her just as he did that cold christmas night the bathroom echoed with quiet sobs as hermione collected her things and began to leave this necklace represented thousands of beautiful and wonderful things but also represented one terrible and condemning fate her relationship with remus was completely and undeniably real but it was a relationship that could never go on could never prosper and would inevitably die within her it was within this epiphany that hermione knew her future would be free from remus lupin even if she desperately ached to be with him accusing him of lying would do her no good because having him admit to her allegations would prove to be useless they could not and would not be together ever again quelling a fresh bout of tears that threatened to overcome her hermione pressed a hand over her heart and told herself to calm down and to move on her fingers brushed over the necklace remus had given her and she smiled humorlessly at its engraved irony no matter the pain we go through i will always be still so close to you x x x author note yeah i did that sorry hope you enjoyed it my regards once again go to faithful wheezy and to all those readers who keep coming back thank you please review disclaimer i do not own this wonderful series sad note i am painfully aware of everything that has happened in deathly hallows and this chapter does and does not comply with it ps note this isntthe last chapter i lied still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty eight moving on three years later harry you cantjust plunge headfirst into the middle of knocturn alley hermione hissed as she swiftly stuffed items into her shoulder bag which had been enlarged to carry anything weightlessly you need to sit and think this through first if dumbledore gets a whiff of this he gave me this idea harry snapped digging through his own trunk searching desperately for his invisibility cloak where my i have it hermione answered i packed a number of your things already in fact you should just everything to me you as well ron haventgot much to give you hermione ron responded i ve got my wand harry got all the cool stuff it doesntmatter about the cool stuff hermione cried whipping around to face them we need anything that will help us tonks got slashed last week we have to avoid something like that by every means possible relax hermione ron said calmly no i will not relax hermione snarled puncturing the air with her words if we re really going to do this then the last thing i going to do is relax listen harry urged sensing how anxious hermione was we ll be alright we re starting small for a reason well we still cantrelax because then each and every step will be lacking the precision we need ronald she reminded harry but spitting her last words at ron her boyfriend grumbled something under his breath shooting hermione a dirty look but did not rise to fight her dontworry i wontlet something like that happen harry promised gently hermione heaved a great sigh doubtfully searching harry face before turning back to her bag mrs weasley is already furious with us hermione informed harry her back turned to him as she stuffed things in her bag she cantseem to accept us being able to fight yeah well she not going to like it when we leave either ron inserted absently now looking through a quidditch magazine if all goes right she ll be happy to have us back though harry reminded his friend i dontsee any reason why we should be gone longer than a few days we ve got knocturn alley the i getting the vibe that you think these death eaters are imbeciles hermione interrupted her voice creeping with a contemptuous tone the most bottom circle yes but where we re going not at all they re waiting for us with these words hermione turned around and glared at harry it not going to be just a few days there will be many more obstacles to overcome dontbe such a downer hermione ron sighed flipping another page we re just planting ears it not terrible wandwork will you listen to yourself hermione shrieked if you get caught and tortured maybe that will knock some sense into you hermione right harry agreed quietly this isntgoing to be easy if we use the cloak oh yes the cloak solves everything doesntit hermione cut across ron coldly i just trying to point out the facts ron shouted at her now angry with her brittle words so am i hermione yelled back the cloak cantdo anything for us if they know we re coming but they won t we ll be invisible ron sneered hermione emitted a low growl her eyes alight with rage before she turned on her heel and stormed out of the room ron took up his magazine again breathing deeply and trying to ignore the heat that had risen in his face and ears women he grunted harry shook his head and continued hermione work of packing her bag trying not to acknowledge the doubt in his mind x x x everything alright ginny asked hermione quietly as hermione went about the kitchen making herself tea slamming the pots and cups with an unnecessary roughness ronald is an idiot is all hermione huffed finally sitting down and holding the steaming cup in her hands not drinking it she was glaring at the table pouring over the more recent of arguments in her mind nothing new then ginny sighed sitting down next to her friend he seems to think our side mission is going to be a piece of cake hermione snapped now gripping the cup so tightly her knuckles turned white he going to get himself killed by acting so reassured so go without him this voice was not ginny s but someone else s a shiver went down her spine as she and ginny turned to smile at lupin as he came into the kitchen i dontmean to eavesdrop but your uh concern for ron safety caught my attention lupin said sitting down hermione knew that it had nothing to do with her concern but rather the level at which she was screaming at her boyfriend harry would never go without him hermione pointed out plus knowing ron he ll pull through when we really need him to i just i just wish he could for once be completely aware of the risks he never thinks things like this through ron in a nutshell ginny muttered are we having a party in here asked a bright voice it was tonks this time and her hair was bright blue her cheerful round face a sharp contrast to the spikes she had in her hair she pulled a chair up next to lupin who immediately touched her arm in welcome ron just being foolish again hermione sighed finally taking a sip of her tea i tired of dealing with this every mission we ve ever gone on he so calm about it lazy one could dare say i cantstand it if he had been with me last week he wouldntbe so sure of everything tonks said with a grim tone lifting up her shirt a little there was a deep scar that had clearly been a terrible wound but healed over maybe he needs to experience a little bloodshed hermione gasped but ginny nodded her head looking to hermione for a nod of agreement when hermione looked shocked ginny promised hastily not too much just enough to scare him i i dontwant to throw him into danger way though hermione cried sounding scandalized and frightened it the only way he ll learn hermione lupin said quietly hermione eyes met his for a brief but tense moment but then hermione tore her eyes away staring at the kitchen table as if it held all of her answers she groaned and cupped her face in her hands agitated and worried nothing was going right anymore but just as hermione predicted their movements were now done with a certain alertness that was both nerve wracking and welcoming the trek into knocturn alley simply to plant dependable ears a spinoff of fred and george invention that worked like a tiny muggle transmitter planted on an unknowing victim on not only death eaters but many of the shops required not only skill but tremendous luck ron was all in favor of ensuring their success with a dose of felix felicis but attaining the potion in such a small period of time would be impossible brewing it would be just as impossible for making it would raise suspicions and making it correctly was just as difficult so the three of them were relying heavily on the invisibility cloak and a silenced pocket sneakoscope that would allow them to get away from any hiding death eaters the eerie streets of knocturn alley were vacant of human presence according to the sneakoscope but the three of them felt whispers beckoning to them in the air and felt the shiver of fear crawl up their spine even if technically was nothing there managing to plant many dependable ears discreetly under awnings above door thresholds and even on some obvious but nondescript bricks they decided not to push their luck any farther and began to venture into welcome territory that was diagon alley silence had been upon them since they had first entered knocturn alley so the shrill alarm that blasted through the night was terrifying but seemed almost unreal after clutching their freshly terrified hearts they looked at each other in confusion as the shrill alarm ricocheted to every inch of diagon alley this isntgood let get out of here harry hissed but before his two comrades could nod in agreement there was a massive black cloud that rose up from the ground around them thicker than the blackness they had just escaped and as impenetrable as a brick wall terrified hermione screamed as numerous death eaters materialized rapidly around them trapping them into a deadly ring furnunculus hermione screamed without hesitation taking down a few of the death eaters and creating an escape by now their cover was blown but that didntmatter anymore hermione fled from the danger into the blackness of diagon alley ron and harry close on her heels harry was shouting at her to run faster they neared a corner a building that was boarding up and abandoned and they scrambled to get past it but suddenly confringo the building erupted into flames in a colossal explosion sending ron harry and hermione into the air as fire began to evade the open space terrified they struggled to get off the ground fast enough to escape both the fire and the death eaters but crucio ron fell to the ground in a howl of pain his body convulsing ron hermione screamed jumping towards him expulso the ground beside hermione and ron suddenly exploded with great force slamming hermione against the nearest wall and sending debris into the air mixing with the fire harry managed to dodge the explosion but was quick to reenter the fight and defend his friends no impedimentia hermione shouted binding the death eater who had been torturing ron the death eaters had caught up fully with them a small throng of them that was just as condemning as it was frightening as soon as ron was up he was met with another two death eaters managing to block and dodge several curses but quickly fell to a slash of purple flames harry threw curse after curse at whatever death eaters were near seizing ron and dragging him as far away as he could hermione was dueling fiercely her silhouette impressive against the smoke and flames but harry heart was gripped by a cold hand as she was struck and sent flying to the ground hermione harry bellowed fearful for her life as many closed in on her incendio he shouted hoping the new flames that were attacking the death eaters would distract them petrificus totalus locomotor mortis these swift jinxes temporarily took out some of the nearest death eaters but only just harry sudden actions seemed to attract them and the deathly swarm soon closed in on him no progoto he shouted to avoid the nearest hex but soon he was being tortured harry screams ripped through the night distinguishable over the caterwauling charm that had given he and his friends away all was lost it seemed and as the world began to fade away from his vision as he slipped into unconsciousness he knew that this simple mission had gone horribly wrong when he woke it was to rushed voices and panicked tones he had the feeling that people were running around in a very small cramped area he also had the distinct feeling that somebody was touching him harry come to someone screamed very close to him and he felt hands upon his wrist checking his pulse oh good lord thank heavens is he breathing alright better than ron anyway it cause he got two lungs shut up fred give him some space mum let me see him suddenly very soft hands were touching harry face as he blinked groggily trying to take in his surroundings ginny kind brown eyes stared into his relieved how are you feeling she whispered stroking his cheek he meant to say fine thanks but all that escaped his mouth was a low groan ginny helped him sit up and observe what was going on the first thing was that his body had been splayed across the kitchen table which had been enlarged significantly to fit two other people his hands were bloodied and his vision was dotted with neon lights as he sat up to his left the unmoving bodies of ron and hermione lay next to him being rapidly tended by mrs weasley tonks lupin and others hermione face was bruised all over and her shoulder was bare and torn open by a curse but ron looked the worst his arm was twisted at a funny angle and there was blood seeping out onto the table from a deep gash that was across his chest unlike hermione who looked alright even if she was unconscious ron was completely still and very very pale he lost a lot of blood ginny said quietly as she observed harry staring wide eyed at his best mate he been hit with some dark magic dad said he off getting healers from saint mungo s this is all my fault harry uttered horrified as he watched people gingerly and carefully apply medicine and bandages to whatever they could they chose to walk into this with you harry ginny murmured touching his hand we all are we know the risks if you had asked me i would ve gone with you tonight absolutely not harry said at once i could never if you but he could not finish the heavy sentence that lay on the tip of his tongue finally he asked how did we get back here who saved us i dontknow ginny answered hesitantly but truthfully i was asleep when you three left which i am not pleased about by the way at the very least i wanted to see you off but i was also asleep when your bodies were brought back we were all asleep mum screaming woke me up a horrible sense of dread had overcome harry at these words what if hermione and ron had returned with him not unconscious but dead surely with all the blood and their motionless bodies it had been the only that would have occurred to mrs weasley she waking tonks shouted and suddenly there was commotion around hermione stirring body groaning she winced and rolled over slightly her hand immediately going to her forehead which was covered in lots of small cuts blood and bruises fingers went through her hair and presumably felt the debris that was in it but nothing was quite alarming as the feeling of ron unmoving chest beneath her hand ron ron x x x he very unstable but the healers say he should be alright in a few days mr weasley said with a heavy sigh he been hit with some dark magic that is nearly irreparable but he ll be alright hermione said it was not so much a question as it was a challenging statement yes i hope mr weasley answered quietly staring at the floor tonks and mad eye both have extensive medical training because the auror program requires it so they ll be watching him day and night is he awake yet harry asked quietly taking over hermione inquiry as she began to silently cry nearly he mumbling and coming to but not quite coherent yet but he didntneed to be coherent for hermione who immediately flew to the next room where ron was being cared for after a tense look from mr weasley harry followed her normally the sitting room of grimmauld place was adorned with fading elegant wallpaper that peeled in some places but begged to be overlooked by guests there were several couches and footrests a table and some chairs all gathered around the fireplace instead of this furniture was a large table that had once held ron and his two friends but now just had the weasley boy around him were little bags and boxes in which harry assumed to be medically oriented hermione sat at his head face in her hands holding a quiet vigil this all could have been avoided harry murmured a kind quiet voice harry did not have to turn around to acknowledge a worried look in dumbledore eyes let us walk harry the tall old man led them to a room that had rarely been used and would never truly be used again sirius old bedroom harry felt a shiver crawl down his spine as they entered and as dumbledore silenced the room so no one could intrude then he beckoned to harry to sit down on the bed i admire your actions harry dumbledore started quietly i recognize that you were acting for the order itself trying to allow us to get a few feet ahead however it is vital that you place your trust in more than just mr weasley and ms granger for terrible things can happen when your resources are limited i i didntmean for this to happen it went so well it seemed so easy but hermione said that it would be more dangerous than you anticipated dumbledore finished quietly yes i imagine she was right but i am not here to inform you of your mistakes harry because that would be quite unnecessary thanks harry muttered raking a hand through his hair professor how did we get back here miss granger had informed several people of what was going on in the hopes that they would keep quiet about it one of them unbeknownst to all of you followed you into diagon alley just to be safe who remus lupin dumbledore said after a brief pause he followed you and when the caterwauling charm went off he alerted several of us by the time we had arrived and fought off the remainder of the death eaters all three of you were unconscious why did that charm go off harry asked nothing happened when we entered diagon alley or knocturn alley i believe that it is set to go off if someone without the dark mark leaves knocturn alley that way all of their dark forces can be concentrated at the exit to trap the victims back in i i didntknow harry mumbled feeling miserable for leading his friends into such danger you know now harry and you know that in the future you must relay any and every bit of information to the rest of the order mrs weasley perhaps may be upset with you but you are part of the order of the phoenix the old wizard said with a knowing grin to harry astonished look so you re not we re in really harry breathed i i mean we did this just to help not just as but harry could not speak coherent words for a wonderful feeling had taken over his body and he felt as if he could fly yes harry you are in the order of the phoenix the moment you were done at the castle you have been in yes but i mean mrs weasley never no one ever still harry was still elated to form comprehensible words i understand harry dumbledore said with a low chuckle now i think it is prudent that you join miss granger for the moment she ll certainly need your support in this dire hour yes sir smiling at dumbledore one last time harry carefully made his way to the sitting room nearly bursting with happiness as he came into the room he stopped short ron was still lying motionless on the table but hermione had fallen asleep at his head a hand laced with his and her cheek on his shoulder this made sense to harry for they had been together for a number of years and despite all of their arguments he knew ron and hermione loved each other almost desperately one could say what did not make sense however was remus lupin standing over them he was also at ron head and upon first glance it would seem that he was staring down at ron face however harry had the distinct feeling he was staring down at hermione coughing a little to announce his presence lupin gave harry a startled look before quickly rearranging his features into an easy smile ron getting his color back he ll be alright in a few days yeah i think so too harry agreed the two of them looked at each other almost awkwardly before lupin murmured something about getting to bed and moving hastily past harry the boy who lived watched his previous professor leave wondering what it was that made lupin turn around and glance at his sleeping friends shrugging off the lingering question harry pulled up a chair beside hermione took her other hand with a squeeze and tried to expel the worry that had entered his mind once more x x x three weeks later ron and hermione were back to their old health and attitude while all three of them sported scars and horrific memories to remind them of their past actions however true to dumbledore word they were not only allowed to sit in on the meetings but participate in the room was harry ron and hermione along with ginny and fred and george who had been silenced by their mother to keep quiet much to their indignation mr and mrs weasley sat together next to lupin and tonks snape sat to the left of dumbledore of course there were many others that should have been there but had been unable to attend for some reason we have a considerable amount of new information dumbledore was saying to occupants of the kitchen thanks to our newest and more reckless members as of today these dependable ears have still gone undetected and have relayed some vital information as far as whereabouts of death eaters safe houses and perhaps some reliable information on voldemort as well there was an excited murmur about this but stopped as soon as dumbledore hand rose into the air calling for silence currently azkaban is under questionable authority as is the ministry if we make any moves to detain death eaters i am not sure where we can place them this is why i do not think we should move in for the attack but investigate further still what do you think he going to do ron whispered to harry who shrugged just as confused as his friend something good knowing him harry whispered back like the two boys many people were exchanging ideas to one another unable to wait for dumbledore plan of action again dumbledore silenced the room i want to procure more detailed and reliable information so we do not have to go through the ranks of the death eaters what we need is for voldemort most trusted inner circle to be infiltrated so his closest allies are threatened and therefore voldemort himself you want us to infiltrate their safe houses hermione said quietly a little smile appeared on dumbledore face which caused for immediately talk that was not in anyway contained to whispers are you crazy we ll be destroyed how do we even know where the safe houses are how are we supposed to get in these safe houses and undetected might i add this is so impossible no it not hermione protested it might call for a little danger but in these times everything does exactly miss granger dumbledore said with a proud nod where do you suggest we start mr weasley said do we even know for sure where the safe houses are it is more than just an assumption that his inner circle would host many of them however that being said it proposes a singular and difficult problem security lord voldemort is intelligent and he knows that the order is willing to try anything to destroy him so how do we get in then tonks asked i believe only those bearing the dark mark can enter with an alarm being raised that being said it is up to me snape finished in a silky voice anyone accompanying a death eater can enter without raising an alarm as well however apparating in has been banned and not quite unlike us a number of security questions must be answered when using the main entrances why cantsnape go and plant the ears himself ron whispered to hermione are you going to suggest that to him hermione hissed back giving him a sharp look because really i d love to see his reaction aside from those i do believe that another entry way is impossible dumbledore said what about flooing in sir hermione proposed quietly i know we can be very easily traced doing so and it is quite tricky but i was thinking since you said we werentsure if the ministry had been taken over yet ah yes i see where you re going with this dumbledore murmured i could investigate further as well mr weasley suggested catching onto hermione idea i sure if timed appropriately the many eyes watching the floo network could be occupied if we created a distraction i hate to burst this bubble snape sneered sounding as if he wanted to do just that but i must inform you that nearly all the fireplaces at these safe houses are sealed nearly all lupin questioned sharply there is one that is always left open but it is always heavily guarded and whoever decides to floo in must have a fitting explanation snape explained and to floo in you must know exactly which fireplace to enter through why couldntwe just try them all mr weasley suggested the owners of these safe houses are not imbeciles snape drawled looking contemptuously at arthur weasley the moment an intruder tries the wrong fireplace they are alerted then we ll have to study the layouts of these safe houses and try to determine which would be most likely be an open fireplace tonks said we can probably use decoys to go through each fireplace that will at least shake them up that is the last thing we want to do snape said in a soft dangerous voice the moment they ascertain we are trying to break through their fireplaces the security will be tripled it is a hit or miss and if we miss we cannot go back albus do we know any of the safe houses yet mrs weasley asked the lestrange estate the malfoy manor and the nott mansion as well dumbledore responded i sure there are others but so far these are the ones that we are certain of the malfoys have a million and one fireplaces tonks groaned which could possibly be the open one the drawing room hermione and lupin answered simultaneously there was a tense pause as hermione and lupin stared at each other for a moment confused before hermione suddenly narrowed her eyes almost angrily and a pained look crossed lupin face before he tore his eyes away how harry began to ask i heard several of draco malfoy friends talking about it through the dependable ear hermione lied easily that how i know it anyway she added roughly now glaring at the back of lupin head what about you professor ignoring hermione jab lupin turned directly to dumbledore and said what about the lestrange estate also a million and one fireplaces tonks said but with much more caution than enthusiasm looking to lupin as if waiting for a reaction we ll err have to get layouts then mr weasley said looking between hermione and lupin as if observing them might eradicate the tension in the air or we could go into the malfoy manor plants ears and figure out the other safe houses from there tonks suggested to dumbledore who nodded we have a plan x x x later on that night hermione and ginny lied still in their beds and listened to the screaming match that was happening downstairs between lupin and tonks their words were indistinguishable but were harsh nonetheless they ve been at it for an hour now ginny said quietly into the darkness hermione grunted what do you reckon their fighting about oh ginny dontplay innocent it doesntsuit you well hermione snapped you know perfectly well what they re fighting about i just wish they d do it somewhere else and not at two in the morning the whole place must be awake by now do you think he got any more excuses for her this time ginny asked no of course not hermione answered scathingly and now he got this new problem to deal with too and knowing tonks it hasntslipped past her she probably upset about that anyway which is what he hiding something and she knows it for sure now i mean you ve seen the way he been acting in the last few weeks ginny hermione said and on top of that we all know what happened today during the meeting do you think he ll own up to it no hermione muttered angrily that more than i could ever hope for i just angry that he acted like nothing happened today if he acknowledges one memory he has to acknowledge them all ginny reminded her quietly and he cantdo that and maintain his engagement with tonks we re both over it by now it shouldntmatter hermione sniffed ignoring the particularly wonderful and painful memory that always surfaced in her mind the least he could do is stop pretending do you even know what it like to be in the same room as you two ginny asked incredulously he cantacknowledge anything or else he d be all over you ginny please hermione scoffed he never takes his eyes off of tonks and how would you know this because i never take my eyes off of him hermione thought to herself feeling sadness creep over her he happy with her that all that matters i have ron he got her we re all fine and good hermione said flatly that still doesntexplain why they re fighting ginny pointed out and it also will not explain what happens when the truth finally comes out the truth isntgoing to come out ginny hermione cried remus and i happened years ago and he ll never acknowledge it and it will never happen again and we ve both gotten over it he not over it ginny said quietly harry told me that the night you lot came back from diagon alley and you were sleeping by ron lupin was just standing there and watching you sleep he must have been watching ron to make sure he was alright hermione suggested at once but felt an undeniably sense of longing rise within her and today in the meeting he wouldntlook at you face it hermione his charade is falling to pieces and tonks is caught in the middle of it no hermione objected and was surprised to find tears welling up in her eyes because if that happens everything is ruined i have a life with ron he and tonks are going to be married soon i cantjust just let him rip apart our lives ginny sighed recognizing that she was losing this battle with hermione she turned over on her side and murmured one last piece of advice just be prepared hermione x x x author note well in all honesty i was going to make this the last chapter but it nearly 15 pages long already and i have so much more to throw at you guys so hopefully the next chapter will be the end not counting an epilogue hopefully faithful wheezy is my man but she not a man but she still my man thank you readers for coming back to this please review disclaimer i do not own this wonderful franchise but i do own dependable ears note i realize now that back in the day hermione and co flooed into the sitting room and not the drawing room but throughout the chapter the final stand i was inconsistent about it so that was my fault there are so many continuity errors throughout this story hah also neville and luna and dean and so many other kids arentin the order because quite frankly i forgot about them until just now sorrys still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter twenty nine d j vu and today in the meeting he wouldntlook at you face it hermione his charade is falling to pieces and tonks is caught in the middle of it no hermione objected and was surprised to find tears welling up in her eyes because if that happens everything is ruined i have a life with ron he and tonks are going to be married soon i cantjust just let him rip apart our lives ginny sighed recognizing that she was losing this battle with hermione she turned over on her side and murmured one last piece of advice just be prepared hermione in the coming weeks those of the order who worked at the ministry which was mr weasley mad eye and tonks procured as much information as they could without raising suspicion doing this was rather difficult in itself for there was never anyone who could be truly trusted as voldemort had unofficially infiltrated the ministry as dumbledore discussed specific details during meetings of how they would go about the new mission it reminded hermione vividly of her last weeks with the marauders and there were times when she would lose herself in those last beautiful memories those last moments with lily who was kindhearted and gentle and sirius who had never been so loyal before in his life james determined and fearless fighting only for the people he loved and of course remus but these thoughts were always met with tears and hermione always forced herself to become occupied for fear that she would once again be consumed with the memories she knew were real now we must go about this with as much precision as we can dumbledore said to the room of taciturn order members our goal in doing this is to simply plant dependable ears so that we might be able to procure more information this being said it is a mission that requires very careful attention but only of one person if we can do this successfully once we will do it many times again the information we are looking for upon the first successful planting of an ear is not limited to anything but we are looking for relevant information that might help us we must start small in order to grow he said sagely after careful planning and the borrowing of harry invisibility cloak mad eye moody was chosen to go through the fire after snape who burst into the malfoy manor drawing room with an urgent message to lucius malfoy to distract whoever might be keeping guard in the drawing room the order held its breath as moody stepped through invisible do you think he ll be alright croaked tonks who looked up the moody greatly but no sooner than the last word had escaped her mouth the flames turned green and moody materialized out of thin air moody gruesome eye whizzed about in his head looking at the tense occupants of the room the twin of the dependable ear in his hand which relayed the audio i could ve gone in there blindfolded and done it just as easily moody grunted all the security they ve got is the youngest malfoy and by the looks of him he resented having that job draco malfoy hermione asked skeptically he was in our class the lad who was turned into a ferret yeah i know him moody growled with a crooked smile i could hate the bloke who used me for the polyjuice but i have to admit that ferret thing was clever with the dependable ear now in place hermione volunteered to listen first knowing she was highly trusted by dumbledore to catch any useful information within the first few hours filled mostly with nondescript sounds and some irrelevant chat draco malfoy proved himself quite useful it was about seven o clock at night and hermione was sipping a bowl of tomato bisque and eyeing a book that was perched on the nearest bookshelf when there was a scuffle that was within earshot of the dependable ear choking a bit on her soup hermione abandoned her meal and pulled the twin ear close this isnthow i should be spending my summer mother said i could go and fly with the montrose magpies she said she had it all planned as a surprise i dontcare what your mother says draco you must stay here i ve been shut up in this room all week it so terribly boring canti at least have theodore to sit here and wither away with me as company with all of the books i ve been reading you d think i was mudblood granger draco what happens if you have your friends over and somehow dumbledore just walks through the grate do you honestly think you re talented enough to even stun him there was a foreboding pause before you dontknow what i can do father prove it sit here and watch that fire with every muscle of your being and somehow prove to me that you re not worthless impress me go ahead then there were footsteps that moved away from the ear followed by the slamming of a door a sliver of silence was followed by a loud sharp noise and a crash of pottery clearly draco had smashed something in his rage his anger footsteps were mixed with his incomprehensible mutterings before he neared the ear past it and the nott mansion a roar from the fire was the only sound aside from the falling of draco body and hermione envisioned him getting down on his hands and knees and sticking his head through the fireplace a few minutes later draco stood up again grunting and then there was another massive roar draco you ve got soot on your face this voice was new but hermione recognized it to be theodore nott ugh i thought your father said my father can fly off i ll do what i like i not in hogwarts anymore i d be moved out by now if it wasntfor this war we d all be moved out i sick of living in this place is he going to through us in the basement again if he catches us dontbe daft theo we re not staying here let go hermione wasntif she was hearing their footsteps leaving the room or her heart hammering in her ears excitement and worry and hope and fear crashed upon her all at once hands flipping about with indecision hermione moaned in panic and tried quickly to do something productive she could scream for harry or ron or scream for dumbledore or jump through the fireplace or do anything but what she was doing someone hermione finally yelled someone come quick now the groan of furniture in the next room and frantic footsteps indicated that someone was coming in fact several people burst into the room being harry ron and ginny but also tonks and mrs weasley dumbledore she squeaked still flapping her hands about the room empty malfoys gone someone go through the new occupants looked at each other with wide eyes before all talking in a rush molly weasley was against any action but harry and ron were all for improvising and even sprinted upstairs to fetch harry invisibility cloak ginny and tonks reasoned with molly to use this opportunity for all it was worth when harry and ron arrived back their chests heaving they had the invisibility cloak with them i have a better idea tonks announced grabbing the invisibility cloak quick now get me your seventh year picture w what hermione stammered as ron and harry fled the room again what that wontthat it pointless i can impersonate draco malfoy if i know what he looks like tonks pointed out i ll go with the invisibility cloak after i ve morphed plant as many ears as i can and if i get caught i ll look like i belong in that manor even mrs weasley could offer no solid reason as to why tonks should not do this trust me molly i can handle this but dear you re awfully clumsy what if you break something mrs weasley pointed out weakly trying to delay tonks as much as she could however the moment ron and harry returned again fred and george in tow panting there was no turning back tonks began to transform at once both copying the picture of all the seventh years and obliging the little details fred and george offered about their enemy no no his shoulders are a little wider maybe balding a bit in the back yeah no just really blond like white hair old lady white too skinny no wait too fat wait wait that perfect his nose is pointier you re thinking of his chin fred oh is there a difference for heaven sakes hermione snapped but even she could not disagree that was the wonder before her draco malfoy seemed to be standing in the room but an excited charming smile was dazzling his normally smug look well how it look draco or rather tonks asked at once she gave a little twirl to show off the entire model you cantbe shouting in a girl voice ron reminded her as george began to sing an aria in an impressive falsetto tonks nodded coughed a few times and said in a very low voice how this higher fred said this now lower george instructed this higher they both agreed stop hermione cried tonks it fine honestly but if you re going to do this you ve got to move fast and remember plant them in the more populated areas of the house if you can okay tonks exclaimed grinning she stepped into the fireplace drawing the invisibility cloak about her and said the drawing room malfoy manor and with a roar of green flames she was gone hermione ron harry ginny the twins and mrs weasley quickly gathered around the twin ear that was still relaying information to grimmauld place they heard the roar of the flames the thump of tonks body and her quick footsteps a door creaked open and then a second later snapped shut and now we wait but what should have taken about 15 minutes took much longer than that as the hours ticked by and the occupants of the room replaced their excitement with worry and fear it became undeniably apparent that something was wrong soon members of the order were present and the watch or listen was moved into the room in which meetings were held dumbledore was absent as well as snape who was still holding up his fa ade with the death eaters hermione and ron clutched hands as all the members gathered worried sick for their friends but secretly praying they had not volunteered to do such a deed every second that ticks by is a second against tonks mr weasley said to the nervous occupants of the room who would have been eased just with dumbledore attendance we cantlet her sit as their prisoner we have to get her back but whatever managed to get her could just as easily get any one of us ron argued she got harry invisibility cloak so it not like we can sneak in anymore plus if a whole regiment of us go barreling into the malfoy manor from one fireplace we re done we have no other option ron mr weasley said gravely we can throw in a decoy detonator into the fireplace as well as some peruvian darkness which will allow us to sneak through the drawing room and into the main part of the house george said looking impressed with himself for this suggestion as long as we use the disillusioning charm we ll be fine george agreed now pretending to fawn over his brother momentary brilliance that not a bad idea mr weasley admitted however only a few of us are going we cantrisk everyone lives so that being said i will go along with alastor molly if she wishes remus and i ll see if bill wants to fly in hey hey what about us george piped up a thumb pointing to his brother as well this was our idea you re too inexperienced we ve been of age for what six years fred interjected merlin beard you d think we were still sixteen arthur right you cantgo mrs weasley joined nodding to her husband and what about us too ron said loudly trying to gain attention me harry and hermione can certainly fend for ourselves and me too ginny added fiercely no mr weasley cried too many people would mean chaos we re all order members hermione said quietly catching the lull of the fight perhaps we should resort to something rudimentary like what harry asked this is very muggle like of me but we can draw straws hermione offered looking around first i think we should agree on a fair number that would not be too many but not too few a number that we can all agree on well mr weasley looked nervous five i mean because we can have one jump in and create the distraction two go and search for tonks while the other two or three hold off the death eaters there was a general murmur of agreement alright then hermione took out her wand muttering a few words before there were ten straws drawn up in thin air with a quick spell five of them were cut in half and hermione arranged them all behind her hand so everything was nondescript and quite the same she went about to each person in the room letting them have their pick when she came to remus lupin she kept her eyes determinedly on the floor although she couldnthelp but notice how pale he was and couldnthelp remembering how his voice was entirely absent in the discussion about tonks recovery at the end hermione looked about the room making sure she had not forgotten anyone and looked at her own straw it was long suppressing a disappointed feeling she asked the room who pulled short straws ron moody ginny mr weasley and george raised their hands mr weasley looked pained to be surrounded by younger fighters while moody looked annoyed that his former students were watching his back ron and george high fived while ginny shot down her mother demands that she should stay behind great hermione thought sarcastically to herself mrs weasley began to fret over her children and her husband while fred argued with his twin harry begging ginny to switch straws with him remus lupin simply stared at the table his face pale and solemn when should we go ginny asked her father well we should get everything together first shouldntyou wait for dumbledore hermione asked that would be ideal mr weasley agreed checking his watch he said if dumbledore isnthere by midnight we re leaving without him that gives him two entire hours in those two hours we have to prepare turning to those who had the short straws he motioned for them to follow him out of the room and the new troop exited the room i should ve stolen ginny s fred said the moment his sister was out of the room and i should ve stolen ron s harry agreed stop it hermione told them sharply no one should be asking to dive headfirst into this it a dangerous job the hours ticked by and as midnight came close moody took over and was instructing them on what was necessary to keep them alive as he summoned things and put them in a pile he glared at the three youngsters a relative term and threatened their lives if his should ever be in jeopardy death eaters ll do whatever they can to take you down even the stupid ones moody barked so remember constant vigilance even if you think it just us in the room i ve been impersonated once before dontlet anybody fool you now here everyone takes these moody instructed thrusting a dependable ear to ron ginny george and mr weasley put them somewhere in your cloak and if you get caught the person listening on the other line will be able to alert someone we re also going to throw one of these decoy detonators into the fire before we jump through to give us just a second to spare arthur and i will jump through and attack while we can and when we tell you it in the clear you three jump through and we search the house understood sir yes sir george shouted back a stiff hand at his forehead ginny cupped her face in her palms with a groan dumbledore had not arrived in the last few hours and did not arrive as the clock began to chime at midnight looking grim and worried arthur looked to moody as if questioning whether or not they should be doing this without the wise old man before words could be passed moody gruffly stepped forward and grabbed some floo powder wait hermione cried clutching the ear whose twin was in the drawing room of the malfoy manor all i can hear is snoring with a decoy detonator you ll just wake them up and cause unnecessary noise a good point moody admitted well i ll jump in if i dontwake him then i ll stun him or bind him it now or never with these words moody cast one final sharp look over his shoulder as if to warn the group following him that it was his only shot he patted the dependable ear hidden over his heart murmured a disillusioning charm over himself tossed a handful of floo powder and shouted the drawing room malfoy manor and then dived right through the group at grimmauld place gathered around the twin ear listening closely moody voice murmured something and the snoring ceased immediately followed by a great thump then moody clearly said alright you lot come through ron and george exchanged an eager look while harry seized ginny and planted a kiss directly on her mouth ignoring the noises from the weasleys be safe ginny i ll be listening harry promised quietly kissing her nose this time ron if you even get stunned i coming in after you hermione said fretfully clutching his arms and looking tearfully into his eyes relax hermione ron eased grinning he gave her a soft kiss as well murmuring that he loved her and that he would be back soon freddikins come give me a kissy george cried making a grab for his twin you can kiss merlin arse if you like instead enough mrs weasley shouted go on now before i change my mind that was impetus enough after they had all casted disillusioning charms over themselves making them nearly invisible the selected group dashed through the fireplace the flames eating them up with a harmless roar before their bodies were gone entirely standing nervously in the kitchen all those that were left behind anxiously grabbed a twin ear and listened i ve got mr weasley hermione announced i ve got ginny s fred said ron s harry murmured george s mrs weasley gasped moody lupin said quietly everyone began to switch ears and listen to the person closest to their heart not daring to breathe in case some precious moment was missed in case the dying words of these soldiers were too faint to distinguish to hermione ron movements were tainted by her hammering heart and she clutched at her chest to soothe her fear and calm her heaving lungs listening closely the remaining occupants of the room pressed their ears to the twin ears desperately trying to gain whatever information they could relevant or not alright this room clear moody voice grunted now we ve got to split up arthur and i will take the upstairs seeing as it the farthest from the fireplace and you kids need to be able to get back here more than us you three split up the main floor and remember constant vigilance ron ginny and george chimed together good now go there was the slow creaking of the door footsteps and a horrible spiraling silence that was begging to be broken by some terrible noise like a curse or a hex okay you two whispered george voice which did not come through in moody or arthur twin ears i cantimagine the malfoys having sleepovers so there probably wontbe many people here if any here he took on a tone of heavy seriousness stay low to the ground and if someone sees you dontmove try everything you can not to reveal yourself we ve all got peruvian instant darkness powder with us so make sure you use it right answered ron nervously now ginny i want you to go with ron george decided no ginny hissed i can take care of myself all we re doing is looking for tonks i just as capable as you no ginny you re going with ron just because i a girl this is not the time to argue ron snapped in a whisper i ll follow ginny but we wontbe together alright we ll both go the left and you can take the right okay fine ginny and george said together remember move slowly george reminded them and if you find tonks dontgo shouting about it whisper into your dependable ear and the others will do something about it just try not to get caught and they wontkill us right away even if we are pointed out ron there was an audible smack at this comment a squeal of pain and ron muttering angrily let go ginny more footsteps that echoed in the silence it was at least five minutes before there was another voice and this time it came through on only ron and ginny twin ear which meant george was now out of range with his siblings ginny you go that way if you should need me i ll be fine ginny whispered flatly back at grimmauld place everyone was pressed up against a twin ear looking agitated everything had gone utterly silent except for footsteps breathing and the occasional creaking of a door suddenly harry gasped pushing ginny twin ear against his own listen harry cried as everyone scrambled to get closer faintly from ginny ear there was a terrible wailing that sounded far away as if from another room or floor the wailing stopped short and then after a terrible silence it was a blood curdling scream tonks remus croaked unexpectedly catching everyone off guard ginny was definitely following this screaming for it was getting louder and more distinguishable in fact it was apparent that this prisoner tonks was saying something or trying to at least her words were mixed with sobs and painful gasps torture me all you like i dont care tonks spat sounding out of breath it seems no one from the order ever really cares about being tortured before long you ll be just like the longbottoms they ll be nice company in saint mungo s hmm crucio the piercing scream made not only ginny gasp but made those at grimmauld place gasp as well hermione clutched harry arm in horror her eyes wide as mrs weasley buried her face in fred shoulder sobbing lupin stared down open mouthed at the twin ear that was transmitting tonks defiance as soon as the screams subsided tonks was gasping for air but she was also croaking a horrible jagged humorless laugh i dontcare what you do i ll never tell you i sure another day without food and water would reverse your little threat you piece of scum draco throw her back downstairs i going to get someone else to take care of this footsteps a gasp of surprise the swing of a door the cry of pain what in the world no stupefy lucius malfoy roared ginny scream ripped through the twin ear followed by a confused angry sputter of lucius malfoy and fleeing footsteps lumos lumos no lucius snarled voconex back at grimmauld place hermione cried he summoning the other death eaters sure enough mixed with the heavy panting and hurried footsteps that transmitted through ginny twin ears there was a great commotion nearby the noise was now coming out of ron ear as well and george s the two boys began sputtering to themselves in alarmed confusion before there was a great blasting noise and a terrible scream stupefy x x x wand decoy detonators instant darkness powder essence of dittany a healing draught salves bandages fred and george jinx shields the cloak if it was here but tonks has it with her somewhere what if they re hurt what if they re dead what if ron dead what if ginny dead what about everyone else what could they possibly want from tonks what was so important this is just like last time where is dumbledore will i live through this disregarding the turbulent flurry of thoughts in her mind hermione stuffed things as quickly as she could into her shoulder bag and her cloak trying to wrack her brains for anything else that may have been just as important as what she had selected mumbling to herself and sweeping her eyes about the room hermione nodded to herself with an anxious breath and swiftly left the room placing a dependable ear inside her cloak and trying to decide where to leave its twin while rushing down the stairs what are you doing it was if hermione had been flung over the railing of a boat plunging into icy waters with a shock that stole her breath away every corpse muscle in her body froze muscles that had been screaming for her to move faster towards the fireplace to the prison to her friends now she stood rooted to the spot an icy hand clutching her ankles and seizing the rest of her body rendering her immobile i going to the malfoy manor hermione answered calmly though she was anything but that you canthonestly say you re actually considering rescuing them remus lupin scoffed though it was quiet he was behind her a landing above her and his presence was unnerving like a mouse well aware of the hawk circling nearby you re telling me you re content with letting them waste away in a cell tortured and terrified hermione retorted though it was almost weak and painful she realized she was on the verge of tears how can you just throw yourself into a pit of death eaters remus whispered accusingly and hermione suddenly turned around to face him she had not looked him in the face for a while now he was gaunt and pale his skin waxy and his face worn his body was quivering though from what she couldnttell and quite frankly remus lupin looked terrified to be under the scrutiny of hermione granger she blinked and remembered for a vivid moment how handsome he used to be and how far she had truly fallen for him she blinked again and this time they were at the prewett place remus facing her angrily while peter and sirius stayed at her side hermione was trying to make remus choose between his safety and their safety because lily and james were trapped kidnapped tortured and only hermione knew she could save him in 1979 it was in those moments that hermione and remus diverged the separation just as fiery as their carnal unions through her tears hermione now saw the terrified worn out old man that stood before her on the threshold of making the same terrible mistake looking back hermione knew she had offered remus no incentive for risking his neck but had assumed that like everything else they were one in the same unceasingly and eternally one but she had been wrong because i love my friends remus hermione croaked knowing she would soon crack under the weight of her own memories i will die for them in an instant it very dangerous lupin cried suddenly looking surprised at how loud his voice was everything is dangerous hermione persisted taking a step closer to him wishing she could take him back to that time twenty years ago when everything was on the line to show him how important this choice was you dontknow what in there lupin countered though feebly i ve done this before i can do it again hermione promised gently looking pleadingly into his face dontdo it lupin whispered very quietly staring at the floor remus finally looked at her and it suddenly struck her that he looked ashamed please dontgo i cantsit behind like you did hermione sobbed and lupin tore his eyes away again offering nothing to defend himself how can you ask me to stay behind and listen to them die just like james and lily it wasntmy fault remus mumbled weakly trying to take his eyes from hermione but failing to do so unable to escape the guilt she was forcing him to acknowledge then come with me this time hermione pleaded holding her hand towards him come with me and save them and save tonks and make up for your past mistakes please remus to both of them this moment was a bridge that had been avoided for the last twenty years had been the elephant in the room had been the single means of heartbreak and the excuse for too many tears this moment was more significant and life changing than either one of them knew but it was in that instant that remus lupin took hermione hand and nothing else mattered without a moment to waste they sprinted down the stairs and towards the fireplace they raced into flames that could not equate to the paramount of heat that was their eyes their fluttering hearts or their laced hands together at last and together for the last time x x x author note so voconex means summon death in latin which i always a big fan of i needed lucius to be able to call out to his biddies just like the order can with their awesome patronuses anywayyyy next chapter will be the last followed by an epilogue i cantbelieve this story is really here right at the end man it like sending my kid off to college if i had a kid and wasntgoing to college for myself sorrys anyway my faithful wheezy is to thank for inspiring me to finish this story but also thank you to those readers that keep coming back please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter but apparently i do own emmaline sorry that i forgot to put that up last chapter all who read this remus will be getting more and more like his buddies really really quick i imagined that when he met lily he was a bit taken with her too but with hermione it a lot more but he ll be cool with her soon still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter three the first sign oh look jane you got an o how d you do that lily asked in awe as professor hull passed back their essays hermione smiled to herself and shrugged dunno like i said i just natural at this stuff hermione answered it was currently friday and they were all in potions next they had dinner and then all the night and weekend to do their homework hermione was already looking forward to the weekend because she wanted to catch up with herself since she had been so busy with homework she had to keep herself in check and make sure to say remus when he talked to her once or twice over the week she had nearly called him professor then again he looked so much different now then he would in nineteen years she found it easily adaptable she also wanted to keep record of ay of the important things she let slip so far it wasntreally anything except for her little mutter that lucius malfoy hated mudbloods she had to watch herself or they d become suspicious besides her homework which was just transfiguration explain the conveniences of animagi she had nothing else to do but sleep in and think about everything around her after their mortifying encounter the first night remus tended to avoid her and hang out with the marauders but at dinner he always sat across from her always he even accidentally knocked peter off the bench so he could sit across from her he even talked to her once and made her laugh he wasntafraid to look her in the eye though he tried to keep to his friends hermione noticed how lively and outgoing remus was once he got over his shyness and acted like himself hermione loved watching him from across the room as he fooled around with his friends on thursday night she had talked about remus with emmaline and lily for hours they were talking to james and sirius again so they had connections james and sirius said that remus quickly changed the subject when jane came up they took that as a good sign hermione didntknow what would happen if she fancied remus or not she knew it would affect her future greatly so she wanted to act carefully but she knew she was a bit carefree when it came to boys she had always let ron make her raging mad and unable to think straight hermione just wanted to be able to be on good terms with remus to be his friend and only that because she knew it would damage her future immensely but she couldntdeny that little squirm in her stomach that she had when she and remus made eye contact or when they walked by each other she felt just the tiniest thing for remus but just a small bit nothing else it couldntharm the future if she had the tiniest of crush s could it ooh look what for dinner emmaline said as she hermione and lily walked in together there was emmaline favorite dinner chipolatas and mince along with several side dishes the girls walked to the table sat down and started talking and easting and laughing the marauders hadntarrived yet and hermione felt the smallest of squirms in her stomach when she saw the great hall doors open peter walked in laughing looking over his shoulder and then came remus with an irritated look on is face he was wearing a blue hat trimmed with black with a huge gold feather sticking up from the side sirius and james came in roaring with laughter at remus hat they sat down nearly in tears they were laughing so hard just take the sticking charm off of this damned thing will you remus asked angrily oh moony it looks so good on you sirius bellowed pounding the table james had his glasses hanging off of his nose pressing his palms to his eyes hermione could see a tear squeeze through his fingers he was shaking with silent laughter and hermione had never seen such a funny scene since the amazing bouncing ferret no it doesn t i look like a prat take it off remus snapped at them peter sniggered into his plate oh remus it makes you look cute leave it on it lovely hermione said with a small grin she wasntlying either it made him look old fashion as if he were the herald of the king or something they all looked at her silent and then burst into laughter a small grin spread on remus face and she saw him turning red and muttering to his plate his smile getting bigger hermione caught lily eye and winked and lily howled with laughter shaking against james as he cried even harder dinner in one word that the whole group could agree on was simply fun lily made remus feather turn different colors and when james reluctantly took the sticking charm off it they passed it around and laughed as it sat awkwardly on everyone head hermione shoved it on her head and it slipped down over her eyes hermione was collapsing against the table in hysterical laughter remus was double up in silent giggles his hands over his face with an amused smile on his lips lily and james were still laughing into each others shoulders and sirius had his arm over emmaline laughing into her neck as she cried onto his shoulder peter snickered into his drink as hermione passed it back to remus her hand brushed against his for a bare moment and their eyes met she felt an invisible shock of electricity and she immediately looked away her smile slipping off she kept laughing though nervously until she saw how silly sirius looked in the hat that she snorted into her pumpkin juice having fun along with the rest of them they traveled back up to the common room quickly still giggling and passing the hat back and forth james and lily were fighting over it and she whined and stuck out her lip which james didntgive into it but when he flashed her a grin and she laughed and kissed him so suddenly that he let go of the hat she grabbed it she stuffed it on her head and put her hands behind her head giving james a momentary sexy look before bursting into laughter it took a long time for all seven of them to get up to the gryffindor tower but when they did most of them were in tears from the laughter there was a large group of people bunched up in one crowd making a loud commotion and yelling across the room to their friends who quickly made their way over hermione exchanged glances with lily and emmaline who all looked confused the marauder left and pushing their way through the mob went to see what the excitement was all about when they came back peter was nudging remus and sirius and james were giving him sly looks what is it lily asked james hogsmeade this weekend lils wanna come with james asked she laughed and rolled her eyes no i think i ll go with sirius instead of course i coming with you lily said james flashed her a grin and they walked off sirius winked at remus and then put his arm around emmaline and they made their way over to the couch peter coughed and left abruptly and hermione suddenly became aware of remus standing in front of her she looked at him blankly for a moment and he looked almost embarrassed he took a breath and she automatically knew what was going to happen so so err jane y you haventever been to hogsmeade h have you he stuttered softly looking nervous hermione smiled shyly at him it wouldnthurt would it no never w well erm wanna come with me so i c could show you around a bit he asked looking scared yet hopeful she beamed at him i d love to remus he let out a breath and a relieved look spread over his face she grinned good cause if you dontgo then you re missing the best time there honeydukes this massive awesome sweetshop that you have to go to and then he started explaining rapidly an excited glint in his eyes as he told everything in detail although hermione had been to hogsmeade many times she listened to him intently she now knew what he was like with his friends because he was talking to her with ease and eagerness he was using his hands enthusiastically waving them in the air as he now described the shrieking shack with a streak of sudden fear on his face that was gone in almost an instant then he told her about zonko s james and sirius heaven and she started laughing yeah they would love that place she said remus gave her a curious look and her throat closed up another piece of information that she had let slip well erm cause you know they seem like the type to pull stuff on everyone know what i mean she asked in an unusually high voice remus gave her a slightly doubtful look before shrugging with a smile you pick things up quick first with malfoy and now this too bad you werenthere before you could ve been a prefect the girl in seventh year isntexactly friendly with me it d be fun if it were you he said grinning she laughed i am she said but then realized what she had said i mean i was in my old school that is she lied quickly remus smiled wouldnt put it past you not to be jane he teased she laughed wouldnt put it past you either she joked back what did you get on your essay an o you he said same thing you cheater she said playfully hitting him softly on the arm he pushed her back laughingly in less than a minute they were both on the floor laughing having knocked each other over sirius emmaline james and lily all looked over the head of the couch hermione blushed and sat up and remus groaned and put his hands over his face lily grinned at hermione god he totally fancies you emmaline said as the girls got ready for bed hermione grinned and slipped under the covers the entire time we did our homework he was watching you i watched him watch you lily said hermione laughed no he doesn t maybe i dunno maybe i had the feather still stuck in my hair we never did find that feather you know hermione said no they said together he was checking you out lily exclaimed yeah he was emmaline agreed ooh you have too much time hermione said with a blush x x x the next morning lily tried to wake hermione up failing that lily woke emmaline and together they started pounding hermione with their pillows until she emerged from under the covers i up damn it hermione snapped at them they giggled get up jane it nine you need to get ready for hogsmeade everyone leaves at eleven emmaline said hermione eyes snapped open she suddenly remembered that remus had asked her oh dammit my hair will be a rat nest if i dontwash it hermione said hurriedly as she ran around the room gathering clothes she chose a crimson shirt with a black french cuff on the sleeves and dark blue bell bottoms that was the only choice in jeans because it was after all the seventies even though she had two hours until hogsmeade left hermione appreciated lily and emmaline waking her up as early as it was because she wanted extra time anyways hermione jumped in the shower which was still in the same place as it would be in nineteen or so years when she got out and changed into her clothes it was 9 30 she brushed her teeth and hair pulling it back into a loose ponytail lily said hermione looked beautiful after a huge scene when lily tried to put the hat that remus had the night before on her she shrieked and ran out of the dormitory and ran down the stairs she ran straight into someone and they both went flying backwards and hit the ground with an oomph hermione saw she had landed right on top of sirius and he looked surprise however a grin spread over his face hey i though you fancied remus not me jane sirius teased hermione moved off of him quickly brushing herself off she scowled quiet you she said he flashed her a mischievous grin and headed back up to him dormitory which she had knocked him away from when she flew into him hermione sat down on the couch grabbing her cloak off the side of one of the armchairs her bag was hidden underneath the couch but her homework was upstairs she dug her bag out from underneath it she took her money bag out and put it inside her cloak pocket and then headed out of the common room she was alone for at least ten minutes as she ate a breakfast of kippers and porridge lily and emmaline came in talking quietly and they sat down across the table emmaline gave her an annoyed look and ate her breakfast without a single word what took you guys so long hermione asked i wanted to pour water on james to wake him up and we had to convince sirius to let us in the boys dormitory we immobilized him in the end and threw water on james he in the shower now lily said almost as if dousing james potter with water was a common thing oh when did that happen hermione asked right before you fell on top of my boyfriend emmaline said coldly glaring at her hermione looked oddly at her for a minute before she knew what emmaline meant oh emma lily was chasing me down the stairs with that ruddy hat and i knocked into sirius is all hermione said emmaline looked at lily who nodded and gave her an i told you so look emmaline looked back at hermione sorry jane emma muttered hermione laughed it alright at ten o clock when the marauders finally came to breakfast the three girls had already gotten up from the table to leave breakfast had ended and the four boys looked ravenous just missed breakfast hun lily said as james looked at the empty table in disappointment damn well i going down to the kitchens then padfoot moony wormtail he asked they all muttered in agreement later remus said as the marauder turned and went out of the great hall hermione saw them go down quickly into the dungeons laughing and pushing each other around before she started up the staircase for the gryffindor tower hermione wondered about if the kitchens were the same but she quickly dismissed the thought from ten to quarter of eleven lily and emmaline talked and gossiped and hermione read a book she went upstairs shoving aside all the clothes that professor dumbledore had supplied she was shoving jeans out of the way when she hit her books she smiled searching vigorously through them she was looking for one of the books lily had lent her and since lily was muggle born hermione had all the same interests as lily did in books a flash of gold caught her eye and she stopped carefully lifting a pair of jeans it revealed a small scarlet book about the size of her hands put together with gold stitching coming out fall apart the book of mischief she picked it up and laid it on her bed staring at it she snatched it up after a second when she carefully opened the cover she found it was blank but why lily greeted hermione with a warm smile as she came into the room it was nearly 11 o clock now and hermione wondered where the boys were just as the thought crossed her mind the door opened the four boys spilled in holding butter beers and truffles laughing and walking like they were drunk james stumbled over to lily hello beautiful he said as he plopped down on the couch next to her sirius walked over to emmaline tapped her on the right shoulder and jumped to her left emmaline looked over her right and when sirius tapped her on her left he jumped to the right emmaline snatched his hands and laughed as he sat down next to emma and they talked quietly hermione eyed remus nervously as he sat down on the other couch by himself taking a quick breath and having a good subject to talk about she went over and sat down next to him so how are we getting to hogsmeade walking hermione asked delicately remus shook his head nah too long a walk we take the train for fifteen minutes and then walked down a dirt road for a half a mile then we come to hogsmeade he said with a bright smile hermione grinned the train ride itself was very familiar with hermione but she acted like she had no idea what was going on these compartments are wicked hermione exclaimed loving how she could freely act excited lily rolled her eyes and everyone else laughed they arentthat cool jane peter said hermione shrugged rubbish i think they re absolutely fantastic she said firmly they all laughed again it was a half hour ride to hogsmeade and halfway through james pulled out a bottle of something maybe it was pumpkin juice or something else but hermione couldnttell james also pulled out some candy and after the rest of the group went after them fighting over them hermione figured that james wouldnthex everyone like the weasley twins so she timidly took some candy it was good but extremely salty hermione was so thirsty but she didntwant to ask james for a sip of whatever he had just in case it was cursed or something without an explanation hermione got up and went for the door where re you going emmaline asked quickly hermione gaped at them for a second remembering that she had to have an explanation erm the loo there is one on this train right hermione asked lily nodded yeah go all the way down lily said hermione nodded and left the compartment hermione walked slowly thinking things over carefully how was this hogsmeade thing with remus going to work out hermione was surprised with herself that she had been able to remember to call him remus and not professor lupin though it was easier because he looked like someone else because he was so young she sighed she would just have to get used to this time warp thing as fast ass he could without causing damage hermione quickly found the bathroom cupped as much water as she could in her hands and gulped it down she wasntthirsty anymore she left and walked down the isle wondering and thinking who else was in hogwarts in this time period hermione began to look into each compartment as she found her way down to her original one the first one she looked in had a bunch of girls all wearing slytherin robes they were laughing hysterically and making hand movements and squished faces and burst into laughter again hermione rolled her eyes and continued on but she noticed something ten compartments in a row were all filled with slytherins but why were they all in some group her heart started to race when she looked into a full one it was occupied by lucius malfoy snape some kid with wavy brown hair and four other boys it wasntas if hermione had actually stopped to gaze into their compartment but she was walking slowly unfortunately one of the boys had looked right through the glass at her said something to lucius and they all looked at her it wasnt a surprise that when hermione passed the glass she sprinted down the hallway she found the marauder compartment wrenched it open and threw herself in she collapsed next to lily and they all looked at her funny she was panting and her face was a bit pale jane what wrong remus asked hermione shook her head n nothing i just well i tripped and almost fell into someone compartment it was not exactly my most memorable experience ever hermione lied in a high voice they all shrugged and went back to talking but remus was looking at her funny hermione quickly avoided his gaze when the train stopped everyone filed out quickly bounding and laughing and running to get into hogsmeade the marauders were out last but quickly they started to run remus and hermione were the last people off the train and they walked slowly and started talking so whose compartment did you fall into remus asked her with a grin hermione laughed well to tell you the truth it was empty but i dunno still embarrassing isntit hermione said nervously remus grinned yeah i guess but still why did you look all scared when you came back he asked hermione bit her lip why shouldntshe tell remus err well i came back running is all i wasntscared she said and remus gave her a critical look fine it was malfoy and his stupid friends i dunno he been giving me weird looks all week and i not exactly the most cautious person am i hermione said with a laugh alright i see what you mean but malfoy is just a stupid git you dont have to be afraid of him remus said he too stupid to do anything i know but i dontexactly know what he capable of hermione said remus gave her a half smile nothing much besides being a git remus said they laughed and besides he wouldntbe able to do anything because i ll be there with you he said holding out his arm arrogantly and putting a swagger to his stride for a moment hermione laughed and looked at him oh my knight in shining armor hermione said and he laughed he gave her a strange look the laughter dying out from his voice and he stared at her hermione heart was racing and her brain comprehended that remus was leaning down towards her face you may want to watch what you do to an innocent lupin she might actually trust the beast within said a cold voice easily identified as snape s remus pulled quickly away from hermione as if he was never going to kiss her the two of them whipped around shut your mouth snape remus snarled hermione brain began working again it was all the boys hermione had seen in the compartment malfoy snape the wavy haired boy hermione now recognized to be macnair macnair was the man who had been assigned to kill buckbeak hermione also recognized most of them she knew most of their children and it was a wonder how they looked exactly like their parents there was avery the lestrange brothers and only one more she recognized not for his child no because he didnthave any children but for his face he was regulus black sirius brother lucius moved forward you must be the new girl a transfer i lucius malfoy this is snape avery the lestrange brothers macnair and black and you are he asked smoothly hermione could feel remus tense slightly as he glared at him hermione instinctively moved closer to remus i jane lewis hermione said coldly and if you dont mind malfoy remus and i were having a perfectly good conversation until you came along so please leave hermione heard remus suppress a snicker no actually i dontthink we ll be leaving i quite intent on showing you around hogsmeade and some of the finer places surely you dontwant to go with that half blood lucius asked with a sneer actually i prefer remus over you any day and besides would you want to be seen hanging around with a muggle born dear malfoy she asked with a smirk just for the affect she laced her arm around remus and leaned against him she knew remus must ve been very surprised but at the moment she didntcare ugh a mudblood let leave these two monsters to themselves lucius said scathingly they walked off muttering to each other sometimes jeering back at hermione and remus hermione waited until she could no longer hear them before saying something git she grunted and then laughed hermione noticed that her arm was still laced with remus and she blushed and let go sorry for that she squeaked remus let out a small laugh no it alright i dontmind remus said hermione blushed and looked sideways at him and he grinned at her x x x author notes okay so now i done with that i told you guys that remus would be getting better a huge shout out to laine for beta ing this for me you rock my socks please review thank you to everyone who has so far disclaimer i do not own harry potter just this plot still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter thirty the end of it all then come with me this time hermione pleaded holding her hand towards him come with me and save them and save tonks and make up for your past mistakes please remus to both of them this moment was a bridge that had been avoided for the last twenty years had been the elephant in the room had been the single means of heartbreak and the excuse for too many tears this moment was more significant and life changing than either one of them knew but it was in that instant that remus lupin took hermione hand and nothing else mattered without a moment to waste they sprinted down the stairs and towards the fireplace they raced into flames that could not equate to the paramount of heat that was their eyes their fluttering hearts or their laced hands together at last and together for the last time the moment their feet touched solid ground it became apparent that the peace and quiet that had been intimated from the dependable ears was drastically incorrect all of the furniture was upturned most of it ripped apart and broken and there were deep gashes all over from spells and curses that adorned the floors and walls parts of the wall had been blown to smithereens and there simply wasnta door anymore a chandelier was dangling threateningly by just a few simple rungs and the lights were flickering from the disturbance that was coming from above them several crashes echoed from overhead along with a great boom that shook the floor beneath their feet a scream followed by the heavy stampede of feet from the room was just barely a warning sign as smoke began to sink through the cracks of the ceiling and into the drawing room hermione and remus fled just in time to escape the collapse of the expensive ceiling which fell in massive flaming pieces that not only radiated a blistering heat but rushed at the open door as if desperate to escape the room itself the hammering of their feet into the hallway was accompanied by many other sounds screams of resistance pain anger fear and perhaps terrible tragedy the ebb and flow of roared curses along with the shriek to avoid them the sickening crunch of a broken bone the crash of a body to the floor or the whimper or gasp of someone terrified the hall normally still and empty to accentuate its prestigious and exquisite characteristics was filled with the frantic chaotic and unceasing movement of countless people along with smoke and the quick flash of spells curses and hexes when there was a lull in the terrible unending screech of battle it was heightened by the sharp deafening smack of a spell hitting its target quickly accompanied by a new cacophony of terrible noises frozen in shock by this horrifying scene hermione and remus merely stared at the war before their eyes in the chaos of the battle there were splashes of red hair and fierce snarls that could only be that of a weasley down the hall ginny covered in blood and clearly limping was desperately trying to escape a death eater with jinx after hex but her newfound cripple was preventing her escape hermione heart stopped as ginny finally fell unable to block the new jinx that her attacker had just sent without thinking without breathing without seeing hermione abandoned remus and was beside her friend the snarl of a curse on her lips that overtook the death eater in a second hermione ginny cried surprised grabbing at her arms as the muggleborn hoisted her up you have to get out hermione shouted ducking as a hex soared over her head and smashed the wall behind her we all have to get out of here throwing an arm around hermione shoulder ginny was half dragged through the battle as their comrades fought around them george was laughing humorlessly at a death eater as he avoided a dark purple streak of light and mr weasley was currently restraining another death eater that had fallen to the floor throughout the hall there were many order members still fighting just as fiercely as ginny had but were also losing steam narrowly avoiding injury hermione and ginny went as fast as they could to the drawing room and were horrified to find it completely engulfed in flames they could barely hear each other over the roar of the fight and barely made the backtracking to the front foyer as a new regiment of death eaters began to flood from the grand staircase bursting into the cold night air hermione and ginny sigh of relief was instantly erased as the fountain up ahead of them suddenly exploded and a brigade of fighters blocked the pathway to the main gates the inky darkness of the night was illuminated in irregular streaks of light and hermione and ginny stood helplessly as they searched their blank minds for ideas it that filthy mudblood somebody shrieked and the cloaked figures that had been so concentrated on their opponents turned their attention to her hermione run ginny screamed not without you she shouted grabbing ginny arm and dragging her with an uncanny speed back to the house however even with the adrenaline that seemed to replace every molecule in her body urged her forward she could not avoid the aftermath of the explosion right in front of her a blinding curse destroyed the front door sending hermione and ginny reeling backwards down the front steps and onto the feet of the death eaters their towering grim figures loomed above them and ginny and hermione screaming tried to scramble away as their leader raised a wand avada stupefy then without warning there were hands lifting hermione and ginny from the ground heavenly hands that pushed them away from the terror and protected them against these new death eaters immediately taking this opportunity to flee the two girls dashed inside and returned to the chaos george and mr weasley had now paired up tonks was sprinting down the hallway past them a death eater fast on her tail while ron suddenly leapt from a room and jumped behind a bench just to have it explode moments afterwards there was a deep rumbling a noise that reverberated in the hall over all the noise and in hermione chest and then the scene in front of them melted away into a dream a nightmare a fantasy a great tidal wave had burst from the drawing room crashing against the opposite wall and swallowing up anything nearby death eaters and order members alike screamed in terror running for their lives and the great wave raced down the hall taking everything with it run hermione shrieked and the girls hastily turned and jumped back outside throwing themselves over the balcony railing and into the bushes crawling as far as they could to the right away from the door the great rumbling became a deafening roar and the manor groaned as the pressure of the water surging through the front door demanded a bigger passageway the house cracked and the frame of the door suddenly snapped and there was a colossal burst of water as the front fa ade finally gave way all of the fighters outside on the path shouted in surprise as the rough wave overcame them gobbling them up in its depths the frigid waters met its match as it finally died down spreading out over the great land and sinking in the ground puddles and rivulets left behind are you sure that was just aguamenti asked a familiar voice and hermione and ginny sat up in surprise in the newly destroyed doorway of the malfoy manor stood neville and luna looking slightly concerned but moreover interested in what was going on the girl with large dreamy eyes was examining her wand absentmindedly daddy always said more is better than not enough luna replied in a singsong voice luna ginny cried standing up that was your charm hermione spluttered indicating the now soaked ground that surrounded them well there was a fire luna replied nodding earnestly what ginny and hermione asked together in the room where we flooed in neville supplied nearly got burned too somebody had to put it out luna said with a curt nod and then turned her round eyes to the scene around her do you think they re alright it doesntmatter hermione cried we ve all got to get out of here but we ve just arrived answered a new voice fred and dean thomas were now standing in the doorway looking indignant dontsend us home already people are getting hurt hermione yelled and how dean how did you get here harry got us all together dean answered pulling a fat coin out of his pocket most of the da is here already thanks to luna charm harry here ginny asked at once not yet fred answered he said he was going to make sure that everyone arrived here before he came oh this is terrible hermione moaned we could all be killed here we all need to leave i hate to say this but coming here was your idea ginny pointed out cautiously i was under the impression that tonks was putting ears in the manor so we could collect information hermione cried looking torn between defending herself and admitting her mistake i didntorganize this rescue mission regardless we cantjust stand here and argue fred said quickly as ginny opened her mouth to retort i saw ron he really hurt but alive and dad isntyoung anymore if we dontneed to fight we should get out of here then why is everyone here hermione shouted angrily ask harry not me fred answered ask me what ginny squealed and ran to harry who held her tightly in his arms we needed more people hermione i mean look at all these death eaters this wasnta five person mission then let get everyone rounded up now while everyone is still paralyzed from luna water charm hermione said exasperatedly everyone now find an order member and get them to the drawing room to floo them out and stun any death eaters that are waking up for a moment everyone looked uncertainly at each other as if merely rescuing the order members was not the original plan but an impulsive one but when hermione jumped up and approached everyone who was unconscious by the fountain dean luna neville harry fred and ginny began to move quickly as well everyone except for harry and ginny went inside and hermione turned a blind eye to their affections knowing that harry was enormously relieved to find ginny unhurt yet despite hermione good intentions and promising idea the moment she stunned the first waking death eater they all began to wake at once rising groggily around her tense body harry hermione called over to him beginning to tremble when he didntrespond and when there were now several upright death eaters hermione screamed harry the scream startled not only harry and ginny but all of the death eaters around her as well as some of the waking order members scrambling to get to her feet and away from the danger she shot spell after spell before someone finally fought back the blue curse narrowly missed her head but did hit a shrubbery which burst into flames harry and ginny joined her and were shouting spells now engaged in their own duels as the death eaters were fully awake that potter a female death eater screamed jumping forward to curse him progoto hermione snarled and then said run not needing to be reminded the three of them turned and fled back into the hall where the same situation met their eyes dumbledore army was panicking because now everyone had come to and realizing that the fight was still to be fought however hermione urged harry and ginny on past the fighters we need to get out of here hermione cried there are too many death eaters we canthandle this but surely all the floo powder has been destroyed ginny reminded hermione in a shout which was necessary with all the commotion around them if we get off of the property we can apparate out harry suggested ducking to avoid a spell we cantjust abandon everyone hermione said looking scandalized look out the three of them dove to the floor as a set of vicious curses soared overhead clambering to get away from the death eaters who had cast them crawling quickly through a large hole in the wall which was still smoldering slightly they happened to climb onto ron who was lying unconscious on the floor with a surprised cry hermione dove to his still body pressing a few fingers to his neck the fear that had snatched her senses away began to fade as relief took over her body for ron was just unconscious we have to get him out of here harry hermione said looking forlorn and terrified what would ve happened if we hadntfound him you re right harry agreed quickly glancing out into the cavernous hallway which was still flooded with battle how we ll get him out of here is the question look ginny said pointing behind them we can break through that front window levitate him out and then get off the manor grounds and apparate it worth a shot harry said but even so sent hermione a grim look as harry checked once again that no death eaters were about to prance into the room hermione hurriedly vanished the glass of the window which arched gracefully over a torn and charred window seat she and ginny leapt out falling into the bushes but urged harry along in whispers as ron body floated into their hands got him harry asked as he watched ron body sag to the ground under the supervision of hermione she nodded breathlessly checking ron pulse again and with a sigh of relief began to hoist himself out of the window just as his foot was establishing stable contact with the ground the wall that they had crawled through suddenly erupted in flames and with a loud crash was decimated giving the room a violent shake harry yelped as he fell head first into the bushes and as he rolled over on the ground a triumphant voice screamed there they are go harry bellowed and suddenly harry hermione and ginny were supporting ron body while simultaneously sprinting across the grounds pursuing them was another regiment of death eaters vaulting themselves out of the window with victorious roars the gates the gates ginny shouted as they galloped past the demolished fountain destroyed walkway and towards the gated entrance but without warning a sharp crack rippled through the air and now directly in their path was a death eater shouting incoherently the group swerved to the left only to be blocked by another death eater which prompted them to jump jerkily in the other direction this time when they were met with the same obstacle the group which had been so well comprised suddenly fell apart hermione stayed at ron head but harry leapt backwards falling onto ron and also accidentally shoving ginny to the side which jerked ron unmoving body to one side by the time they had managed to create any sort of order they were completely surrounded the three of them only had a moment to be utterly terrified before there was a vociferous roar from the malfoy manor and all those that had been fighting the dark army were now charging at full speed towards the ring of death eaters harry hermione and ginny could only stare as the dark night was suddenly illuminated with spells and bright lights flashing and whirring disrupting any sort of silent fear at this new distraction the death eaters turned to fight their returning enemy and hermione seized ron underneath the armpits and began to drag him as quickly as she could across the grounds not so fast mudblood sneered a voice and ron body was snatched from her no hermione cried diving to recover him yet as her body fell on top of ron s there was a swift kick to her side sending her reeling to the ground in pain and invasive hands that stole the wand straight from her hands deal with it cackled the voice again how does it feel asked a cold quiet voice that was hauntingly familiar to be back on the ground where you belong i not as much as an animal as you are hermione snarled making a grab for ron body again i might be muggleborn but i will always be ten times the wizard you ll ever be hermione shouted a panicked voice and as she turned her head sharply to search for her caller the death eater spat out crucio no roared the order member flinging himself into a fully fledged attack on the death eater as hermione agonizing screams finally faded panting and cradling her head which was now throbbing in pain she turned over to clutch ron body and to catch of glimpse of remus lupin who was fiercely battling the death eater struck with horror hermione watched transfixed as remus dueled the weary lines of his face heightened as the flashing wand light soared by his body for a moment remus caught her eye and saw that all she was doing was staring at him in horror run hermione he commanded ducking to avoid a purple jet of light i can t she cried feeling tears well up in her eyes but her resistance caused remus to look at her for a split second as if to reprimand her and that split second cost him the duel with a surprised cry remus was struck squarely in the chest and sent him sprawling onto the ground behind him you filthy half breed snarled the death eater as remus began to struggle off the ground cruc but was interrupted as hermione launched herself straight into the knees of the death eater they toppled onto the ground and as hermione scrambled to get away from him the hood obscuring his face fell back it was lucius malfoy a horrified disgusted feeling rose up immediately within hermione and she crawled away as fast as her body would allow her to watching with frozen eyes as he stood from the ground and glared at her with a radiating fury must you ruin everything for me mudblood he asked softly grey eyes narrowed to dangerous slits run hermione remus croaked as he began to hoist himself from the ground he was bleeding from his mouth and from his temple and his right arm seemed to be hanging from a funny angle lucius cast him an annoyed look before turning back to hermione with purpose i should ve taken care of you years ago avada kedavra it seemed that without warning a great hush fell over the earth and everyone around them became muted and slow their movements sluggish and uneven those around hermione who were still battling still fighting still living could not move as accurately as the jet of light racing towards her which had erupted from a terrible wand with a brilliant explosion of light all around her the earth stood still as her destiny sped towards her wiping all but one terrified thought from her mind remus and then an unexpected silhouette was sharp against the great blast of light hurdling faster and more precisely than this deathly curse creating a shield in which to protect her mortal body surely this was an angel a heavenly messenger sent to prolong her life but a moment later the raging battle exploded around her and the movement which had been so sluggish those sounds which had been so muted burst back into a loud terrible life as they fought on the heels of lucius malfoy that had previously stood before her chuckled humorlessly before turning to walk away leaving her completely and utterly alone for dead on the ground in front of her was remus lupin hermione felt very numb as if all of her senses had been suddenly surged with energy and then just as unexpectedly were fried until they were useless she felt as if she had been dropped into an ice bath forced to stay under to suck in the icy water so that she would be entirely immobile for the rest of her life there was a distinct noise in her ears it was loud and piercing an agonized cry a tragic mournful sound and hands shaking her body very violently something enormous within her reared up its ugly head demanding to be freed from her body pressing on anything to be released her cheeks were wet now shining in the night as the world continued to turn around her while the battle went on the wet tangible misery that poured down her face in unacknowledged rivulets slowly soothed the best within her that was dying to be freed and when it seemed she could cry no more she felt as if she was nothing had nothing could be nothing and could do nothing remus lupin was dead there was nothing for her left to be hermione said girl did not register as harry potter came rushing over to her grabbing her and shaking her to wake her from her terrible reverie she knelt before remus lupin unmoving body still as stone rigid and surely now as lifeless as the werewolf hermione get up we have to he was interrupted by a horrible cackling that was growing louder looking sharply up harry spotted the death eater that was approaching them finally got what he deserved didnthe mudblood sneered a voice with a derisive shriek of laughter hermione did not move from her stony vigil or even blink at the death eater words pity i didntget to do it myself get out of here harry growled standing up with his wand brandished threateningly the death eater screeched with laughter again please potty what are you going to do to me the death eater turned their wand to hermione who had not moved from her shocked position i ll kill you harry roared stepping in front of hermione protectively kill me asked the death eater in a sickeningly sweet tone i dontthink you want to do that and why not you re a filthy excuse for a human let me tell you a story about a filthy excuse for a human the death eater said sharply before laughing coldly again once upon a time this mudblood that you re protecting went back in time and became best mates with your foolish parents what harry ejaculated scoffing no hermione croaked suddenly looking up at the death eater slowly as if to taunt hermione the death eater reached up and drew back the hood of their cloak revealing the contour and angles to the face of pansy parkinson harry gasped but hermione already pale blanched oh yes granger pansy said with a grim smile now beginning to walk around harry and hermione as if circling her prey yes potter for seven months your beloved mudblood was stuck with your parents and all of their idiotic friends this this is the stupidest thing i ve ever heard harry said at last gaping as he looked between pansy and hermione the uneasy feeling in his stomach heightened as he realized how terrified hermione suddenly looked and the triumphant expression on pansy face hermione she lying isntshe i mean come on she could ve saved your parents potter pansy interjected best friends with evans and pettigrew and everyone else all she had to say was watch out and you would ve had a normal life shut up parkinson harry snapped jabbing his wand aggressively in the air what did i hit a nerve pansy mocked dontyou wish you could ve led a normal life one where your parents were here fighting instead of you shut up harry growled again dontyou ever wonder what it would ve been like potter why dontyou ask your little mudblood friend after all she was with that filthy werewolf and having a go with your parents she would know best shut up harry bellowed at last and without warning slashed at the air pansy ducked as she had been expecting this any moment and shot back a stream of grey light harry tucked and rolled just in time but as he leapt off the ground to face her he found that pansy wand was right in his face pansy had dropped the gruesome smile and laugh and now looked positively dangerous yes potter believe this unbelievable story because it very very true seventh months without even a word of warning and seventh months spent betraying your parents and their friends and you and your idiotic friends and even the order of the phoenix you re a liar harry snarled in a low voice am i pansy asked quietly and silently withdrew a picture from within her robes at first harry would not take his eyes from pansy s knowing that the wand in his face would attack without warning but the moment his peripheral vision saw the contents of the picture it was all he could do from snatching it away from pansy hand because there in the torn and old photo was hermione granger kissing lucius malfoy what is this harry cried eyes widened in disgust disregarding the wand in his face he turned to look back at hermione what what is this but all hermione did was look up at harry with large fearful eyes turning back to pansy he could say nothing for he was dumbstruck at the appearance of this photograph pansy grinned devilishly not only did she fraternize with the enemy potter but she gave us all the information we needed to destroy you and all of your simpleton friends your little mudblood is a traitor liar harry accused again though the venom that had laced his voice was now absent and he seemed very shaken she could ve saved them all potter pansy spat and the little whore betrayed weasel too didntyou know she was sleeping with this excuse for a human being she asked jerking her head to the body of remus lupin which hermione was now clutching tightly this is all a lie harry whispered taking a step back from pansy none of this is true this isn t yes it is pansy snarled jabbing her wand back in harry face it all true and it all because of me i revealed her for what she truly is the dark lord trusted me to do this and no one else and now you see how stupid you are for trusting her get away from me harry hissed jerking his own wand into harry face i am the only one the dark lord could trust to bring her down to bring you down get away harry snarled slashing the air suddenly pansy taking off guard fell to the ground with a cry of pain but on the ground she leered up at him and cackled pulling back her sleeve to reveal the deadly tattoo on her forearm i will be worshipped for aiding in your death the moment pansy fingers touched the dark mark harry head exploded in pain his knees collapsed beneath him and his body fell hard onto a cold lumpy mass that happened to be ron still unconscious somewhere in front of him pansy was shrieking in laughter hermione was sobbing quietly and inside his head he heard the faint voice cold and high and furious and then there was screaming both terrified and furious but harry could not even begin to open his eyes let alone see the chaos around him for his head was surely splitting in two there were people grabbing at him buffeting him yelling at him or perhaps this was all insider his head then as if everything else had been a dream and this was the one real thing he knew he could count on there was a vice grip on his arm and the compression of his body into a single molecule before he was finally set free into unconsciousness x x x harry mate you alive with a groan harry opened his eyes with great difficulty and blinked groggily up at the ceiling directly in his line of vision was ron weasley who was now grinning into his face looking enormously relieved what happened harry asked sitting up and looking around to his left hermione still body was on the couch and harry realized with a start that they were back in grimmauld place dumbledore showed up same time as you know who ron said throwing a glance at hermione body as well she just asleep now ron added as harry stared at her apparently dumbledore had been chasing voldemort around the country or something with kingsley trying to stake out all of his safe houses and find patterns or something how did he know to go to the malfoy manor harry asked well he knew tonks was there apparently and knew that no one would dare call you know who unless they really had you that true harry agreed quietly is everyone alright is everyone back at these questions ron became very still and his face paled underneath his freckles dean thomas was killed and so was lupin tonks is a mess ron added in a whisper as i expect her to be but still what about hermione harry asked quietly she fine ron said after a moment hesitation when she came to she wouldnttalk to me at all dumbledore said they found her right next to lupin so she must ve seen him die i imagine she still in shock yeah harry said absently his mind instantly reliving the scene that had scarred his mind where is everyone they took the bodies to saint mungo s ron said quietly still looking over at hermione with a concerned look to determine the exact cause of death and to clean up their bodies after this the two boys could say nothing more and awkwardly avoided each other gazes to keep from revealing their inner emotions ron sat down next to hermione and pulled her halfway onto his lap stroking her hair absentmindedly while he savored what memories he could of lupin and dean but harry could not do this unable to sit still with ron harry trudged up to his room trying desperately to block pansy words from his head but failing miserably the moment hermione was awake harry demanded to talk to her alone receiving very suspicious looks from ron harry shut and locked the door behind him as hermione silently filed into harry room sitting down on the bed with a stony look on her face harry stared at her for a moment before blurting is it true the only indication hermione gave that she had heard him was that she closed her eyes slowly and her body seemed to sag with a heavy weight however she remained taciturn well harry asked again more forcefully this time was parkinson lying or not no hermione said very quietly an odd feeling crept up harry throat as if he were about to vomit are you telling me harry began slowly that you did go back in time and meet my parents yes she answered colorlessly staring at the floor for seven months harry stated now glaring at her as she nodded and you didntsay anything to them when you knew they were going to die the laws of magic state that i could ve had a family harry roared suddenly i could ve had a normal life if you had just opened your mouth dumbledore said i couldntreveal myself you couldnteven say watch out for peter he going to enable your deaths no hermione uttered closing her eyes once again and you were sleeping with lupin the whole time harry snared his chest heaving from his previous rage we fell in love hermione replied in a hollow voice and you never told ron harry said in an outraged voice no hermione said again hermione could feel the daggers that harry was glaring at her but the heat that punctured her mind from his infuriated rage did not penetrate the surface of her skin or her heart or even her conscience in fact there was no where that he could touch that would ve made a difference to hermione because there was nothing left inside of her to destroy everything had been taken away from her and everything was gone there was a sharp snap as the door suddenly slammed and the spiraling silence that enveloped hermione was an almost welcome loneliness taking in a slow deep breath hermione stood and made her way back to her own room knowing that without the comfort of remus lupin living presence there was simply nothing left for her to life for x x x author note sorry that took so long to get out i got stuck in some places anyway one more chapter and then the epilogue i really promise this time ps i realize harry confrontation was rather skimmed over as was the learning of hermione time traveling mishaps but i promise those will be addressed as well once again thank you faithful wheezy and all those who continue to enjoy my story as much as i do please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just this plotline and some original characters still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter thirty one impossible hermione could feel the daggers that harry was glaring at her but the heat that punctured her mind from his infuriated rage did not penetrate the surface of her skin or her heart or even her conscience in fact there was no where that he could touch that would ve made a difference to hermione because there was nothing left inside of her to destroy everything had been taken away from her and everything was gone there was a sharp snap as the door suddenly slammed and the spiraling silence that enveloped hermione was an almost welcome loneliness taking in a slow deep breath hermione stood and made her way back to her own room knowing that without the comfort of remus lupin living presence there was simply nothing left for her to life for that night grimmauld place was full of people but the normal cheer that accompanied guests was blatantly absent there was an unspeakable but tangible sadness that hung over everyone that clouded all of their thoughts and haunted their conversations each one of them was questioning the blood in their veins the liquid of life that bestowed upon them the ability to breathe to love to be and which had been so cruelly taken away from remus lupin and dean thomas as guests filed into grimmauld place for the meeting that night the normal chatter was replaced with an eerie silence only accentuated by the empty chair at the table normally reserved for remus lupin those members of dumbledore army that had survived stood around the edges of the room while the others sat without a word finally dumbledore broke the tense silence for the past several years this heartless war has taken a great toll on us many of us have experienced unimaginable hardships while others have had to endure the sting of loss for time and time again recently we have lost two people very dear to us at these words there was a very strange thing that happened that no one could really quite explain hermione granger slumped in her chair her eyes closing in fluttering motion while harry potter turned and glared at her while dumbledore continued to grieve and give penance to those that had been killed harry sat back in his seat and kept his narrowed eyes on hermione who had turned an ashen shade of grey later that evening when supper had been laid out and the members of the order of the phoenix sat down for dinner ginny seized harry by the elbow and pulled him into the sitting room what is wrong with you ginny hissed and what the hell did hermione do to you cantyou leave her alone leave it alone ginny harry snapped back you dontknow what she did yeah retorted ginny fiercely try me you wouldntbelieve me and you d go prancing about to hermione to snitch you have no idea what going on with her how can you she ruined my life harry shouted across ginny defensive words leaving them with a ringing silence she could ve saved my parents ginny glared at harry causing him to scoff and walk away see i told you that you wouldntbelieve me harry she couldntjust go and tell them dumbledore told her not to and if she had she would ve been eaten alive dontyou get it ginny words did not make sense at first but then he realized that she was going along with his story that she was playing into this idea that she knew harry wheeled around to face her eyes bulging you you know of course i know ginny huffed with an annoyed roll of her eyes hermione my best friend you dontthink she told me but but you canthold this against her harry ginny warned pressing on she didntvolunteer to go back in time and meet your parents but she could ve stayed away from them harry protested suddenly roused again there was no reason for her to be friends with them except that she was in gryffindor and in the same dorm as lily and just as smart as lupin so there was no way they werentgoing to notice her i suppose you know about how she was sleeping with lupin harry blurted changing gears for he was feeling slightly attacked she didnthave to go and do that it was cruel and foolish it wasntlike she whored herself to him ginny cried it wasntlike she just jumped on him hermione could ve stayed away from him though what going on asked a suspicious voice ginny and harry who had snarling nose to nose whipped around to see ron in the doorway looking confused nothing just fighting about stuff harry being a right jerk you see ginny not telling the truth what were you saying about hermione ron asked quietly harry and ginny exchanged a quick look something that did not escape ron who was she with harry gave ginny a pointed look while the youngest weasley was visibly torn with what to do ron ginny started weakly it not what you think it a very long complicated story i have time ron said simply and sat down in the nearest chair looking wearily to his best friend and his sister ron who was normally jealous beyond all control hot headed and irrational looked tired and worn out and ready to accept whatever curve ball they were going to throw at him i dontthink ginny began uncertainly but then harry sat down next to his friend looking determined i want to hear the full story as well harry announced crossing his arms over his chest ginny looked between them gaping her mouth full of words she could not express and her head full of concern she could not expel she found the book of mischief ginny offered at last that day during your seventh year when this happened in seventh year harry interrupted looking both astonished and unsettled in your seventh year yes she was thrown back to 1978 which was the seventh year of your parents harry and also for lupin sirius and pettigrew dumbledore assigned lily to hermione so she could get accustomed faster she made friends with the marauders well enough and everything was alright for a while here ginny broke off chewing her lip and trying to glance furtively at ron she erm sort of had a thing with lupin for a while right off the bat but that went wrong after a bit ron sank back in his chair and closed his eyes but said nothing his face did not flush scarlet nor did he start to crack his knuckles menacingly like he did whenever the mention of hermione other romances arose ginny who thought that this calm behavior was all the more unnerving did not want to continue but persisted after harry glared then she erm started to have some trouble what do you mean harry asked quickly well err there was this boy that erm you know pansy parkinson showed me a picture of hermione snogging someone harry interjected suddenly his face stormy with anger does this boy have anything to do with that picture yes ginny answered tentatively but i knew it harry snarled she was with malfoy too what ron gasped as ginny cried no parkinson showed me a picture of hermione and lucius malfoy he forced her ginny interrupted in a panicked cry before ron could take in the false information she hated him but he made her that such hogwash ginny harry snapped but she gave him a sharp look how would you know harry ginny snarled harry fell silent sinking back into his original spot next to ron looking thoroughly disgruntled as i was saying she was forced to be around malfoy for extended periods of time because they were partners in potions at one point or another lupin started dating this slytherin girl and hermione still fancied him and malfoy was trying to bed her things got terribly out of hand ginny concluded wringing her hands nervously and that it harry said flatly that is not it ginny said hotly she tried making lupin jealous by dating malfoy but then when he started stalking her what harry and ron exclaimed he knew that she was hermione ginny said quietly her pseudonym was jane lewis but somehow malfoy knew her real identity and situation and was using it against her and when hermione wouldntcomply with malfoy they started cutting off everything that was making her sane malfoy manipulated her and the marauders as did the girls from the illimni as the story became very complex and intricate harry and ron interrupted less and less listening to ginny with rapt attention and often exchanging looks of horror or confusion or a sudden epiphany that was soon confirmed moments later by the time ginny had reached the end of hermione journey harry and ron were no longer angry or pale but rather thunderstruck and he told her it was just a delirium charm and that she had to move on with life because what had happened was just a dream but it wasntjust a dream because she had the necklace he had given her for christmas she been trying to move past that day ever since seventh year ginny finished in a low voice giving her brother a significant look when you three graduated it would ve been alright to be with him but she stayed with you ron ron who appeared to be swallowing a great lump in his throat whispered hoarsely really and you ginny said rounding on harry you have to apologize to her yeah i i will harry promised weakly to ginny steely eyed look good because i know she devastated even though she moved on from him regardless of their relationship watching someone die cannot be taken lightly she turned and looked at each of them as if daring to be contradicted and when she was not she said she ll certainly be scarred for life several floors up above them as if existing solely to prove ginny point the taciturn and utterly still body of hermione granger was perched on the edge of her mattress staring blankly across the dark room as if she must do nothing else her eyes were glassy and empty lifeless even and her skin seemed to sag and whither at the edges of her eyes and mouth as if hinting at decades that had just recently gone by in her direct line of vision in her peripherals in her mind there was only one image that she could see that she could comprehend and that she could hold onto remus lupin was dead in a matter of weeks she had fallen irreversibly in love with him had spent years getting over his denial and would forever face a lifetime living the reality of his death before him she was just hermione but after him she was everything she was meant to be perfect fulfilled limitless but without him she was nothing minutes blurred into hours which blurred into days and soon everything was the same grey dull and pointless life that hermione was forced to lead there was always an empty chair that had been saved for remus always a spot that suggested his presence always something to trigger a memory that would spring suddenly before her eyes forcing her to relive those moments that remus could not hermione whenever someone called her name there was a twinge of hope that perhaps remus had tricked her and was finally revealing himself but always she was sorely disappointed today it was ron that had deceived her it was alarmingly obvious to the rest of grimmauld place that hermione had fallen into a serious depression often staying cooped up in her room without so much as a word giving no indication that she wanted to eat or socialize the girl would not even read which tipped off ron that something grave was happening wasting away before him she would barely even respond to him unless consistently talked to hermione i want you to try and eat this alright ron said tenderly sitting down beside her on the edge of her mattress she sat staring at the opposite wall her eyes glazed over and quite hollow offering her a soup ron pushed it into her hands and said a little louder it got lots of good things in it to help you feel better please eat some hermione gave no indication that ron was even in the room much less that he was talking to her hermione you have to eat like a child that had been given an ultimatum hermione finally lowered her eyes to the soup that ron had before her one of mrs weasley special concoctions it would strengthen the weak and cheer up even the gloomiest of people ron slowly and carefully began to lift the spoon to her mouth relieved that she was eating it even if she was doing so wordlessly feeding her until every last drop was gone ron finally put down the dish and sunk back into the bed gazing at hermione back i very worried about you you know ron murmured in a quiet voice you haventcome out of here in a week i haventheard your voice in forever you wonteat and you wontsleep and you wonteven read hermione an aggravated sigh escaped his lips before he began to wrap his fingers through the thick tendrils of her hair he sat up beside her and gazed at her sadly but lovingly i ll do anything i can to make you better hermione anything i dontthink you realize how much i love you not as much as i loved remus but i will do anything for you i need you to get better i dontknow how to get on without you hermione you re everything i have everything i know before lupin died it seemed that way for you too didntit i was always his but ginny told me what happened between you two and it was years ago and you ve been with me for so long much longer than you were with him and that got to count for something doesntit hermione remus and i were two parts of the same soul and i thought i wanted to prove that to you then and i want to prove that to you now hermione that you are everything i have and please let this be enough to pull you out of this depression i love you more than anything hermione ron was nervously reaching into his cloak and hermione still body twitched a little as he withdrew a little black box her glossy eyes were suddenly following his movements and her mouth which had not moved in so long became a very thin line pale even beneath his freckles ron opened the box to reveal a diamond ring looking to her uncertainly no anything but this remus i cantmarry him remus i had planned to do this much sooner ron muttered sheepishly putting the box down gently beside her but i could never find a time to do it and i never accounted for any of this happening but i cantgo back and change it i cantchange how i feel about you and that without you i would be wasting away like you are so he was getting off the bed slowly getting down on one knee and opening the box to her will you marry me hermione granger this is ridiculous how can he expect me to do this i am only meant for remus i need you hermione ron pleaded looking up into her eyes he took her left hand suddenly and she followed his fingers as he fixed the ring on her finger without waiting for her approval please i am nothing without you he whispered pressing his forehead against her hand i am nothing without remus he is nothing without me no matter the pain we go through i will always be still so close to you ron hermione croaked her voice cracking from misuse ron head snapped back as if shocked by the noise as if it wasnther voice but a trick of some sort but hermione was looking straight into his eyes her cracked lips parted and quivering with indecision please he begged gripping both her hands now you dontunderstand hermione you ve been up here all along and i ve been going crazy not knowing what to do or how to help you or even how to help myself i cantfunction without you but remus i cantbetray him ron helped me move on for so many years but remus remus is dead ron saved me from withering away before remus now the tables have turned yes hermione rasped looking down at the winking jewel on her left ring finger with a cry of delight ron flung himself on top of her in unrestrained joy holding her tightly and whispering into her neck tears squeezing from beneath his eyelids but all hermione could look at was the ring on her finger and the torment of what she had just impulsively promised over the next several days ron seemed to be functioning on pure happiness and glee as he went about the house encouraging hermione to be livelier even managing to coax her to the dinner table his hand was on her knee and every other moment he was gazing into her face smiling into her eyes as she hollowly stared out at those people she once called friends it was not that harry and ginny were not her friends but the light of hermione soul had faded and those which had given her life had lost their meaning she had nothing left to go by nothing left to fall back on and these people which she ached to love again meant truly nothing because everything that she was had been killed one night mr weasley came late to dinner and although this was often quite normal when coming from the ministry something was different molly weasley was at the stove bewitching the soup to stir itself and for the potatoes to smoothly mash everyone was around the table except for tonks who had retreated back to her mother household unable to bear the loss of her fianc the occupants of the table including hermione chatted merrily as they waited for the dinner to finally be served mrs weasley had just planted the last dish on the table when the front door opened and quiet footsteps approached the kitchen just in time arthur mrs weasley said happily as she gestured to his seat everything still hot what wrong she asked quickly noticing how troubled he looked well remus will processed through today arthur weasley answered quietly clearly trying to keep this news quiet however the loving hand on hermione knee was suddenly a vice grip everyone looked around at each other uncertainly and the silence seemed to scream at them and ginny blurted finally what was in it it not something i want to discuss here arthur muttered rubbing his forehead the contents are private matters though the dinner easy chatter was now speckled with suspicion and curiosity it continued on wordlessly though everyone seemed to be staring at mr weasley as if his expression would give away the secret when it did not and when mrs weasley snarled at the twins for quietly egging on their father to let the cat out of the bag the matter of remus lupin will was left alone a while later when the belts on everyone trousers were loosened to accommodate for all the food they all began to file into the sitting room mr weasley approached hermione and ron slowly ron who had had an arm around hermione the whole night tensed when his father neared them and murmured hermione name the girl who had been staring blankly across the room all the way through dinner slowly looked at him as if remembering that they were alive that they existed and could talk hermione i would like to talk to you for a moment if i could mr weasley said in a low voice casting an anxious glance towards the sitting room alone why ron demanded instantly tightening a grip around hermione it has nothing to do with you ron mr weasley said calmly hermione may i he added gesturing towards staircase with a clear indication that he did not want to be overheard ron left though reluctantly and not without grumbling a few angry words hermione followed mr weasley silently up the stairs her body suddenly coming to life with a nervous hammering drumbeat as they entered the room of the late remus lupin the room was not very dusty or dingy but it was definitely stale as if no one had bothered to air it out in a while the bed was relatively neat robes spilling out from the closet and some stray shoes sticking out from under the bed the armoire stood in the corner tall and domineering demanding attention hermione gazed at it swallowing the lump in her throat while mr weasley approached that which was beginning to frightening her opening the doors of the armoire mr weasley said remus had only one thing to give away only one thing written in his will it was given to you hermione he backed away and from the dark ominous figure of the armoire trickled an ethereal light that seemed to breathe life into hermione dead eyes a pensieve she asked quietly closing her eyes and basking in the silver light yes why wasntit at the ministry she whispered stepping closer and opening her eyes to inspect it because it was not in his vault at the time of death nor was it regarded as suspicious dangerous or necessary to have at the ministry it was also a personal belonging rather than a treasure mr weasley continued to explain other reasons but hermione was entranced by the swirling silver liquid within the basin half hidden by the armoire protective door she stepped forward clutching the door and swinging it open peering down into the bowl mysterious contents blinking a few times it was a moment before she realized she was looking down at her own face and that this pensieve contained memories of her for the first time in a few weeks hermione returned to her normal self and said briskly thank you mr weasley i think i can handle this on my own with her back to mr weasley she could not see the sudden change in his expression or the gradual realization that hermione had snapped out of her delirium a tiny smile crept onto his face and then he turned and left without another word the moment the door clicked shut hermione dove headfirst into the mystic basin flinging all thoughts and worries aside for it was within this precious pensieve that she could once more relive that which had given her meaning within this basis she could live again she could breathe she could see she could feel and hold and touch and she would see him again and this terrible devastating thing which was her reality would no longer matter because she would have him x x x author notes oh hey college thanks for pushing the end of this story off for two months anyway sorry guys i know this took forever and it still not over but guess what originally this chapter was 21 pages and i cut it down to ten so i could at least give you guys something so here the first half of the end please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just this plotline and some random ocs note this has taken many years too long to finish so here is the end of still so close to you and i hope you enjoyed every moment of it as i did still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter thirty two atonement she was engulfed in icy blackness gasping at the sudden cold before everything was normal before she was back where she belonged opening her eyes she found herself in the hogwarts library surrounded by books and a pleasant silence just as she began to suspect she was entirely alone she heard giggling on the other side of the shelf it was not feminine at all but it held the sort of immaturity that hermione always associated with pavarti and lavender there was another giggle and then a snort and she realized instantly who was laughing james and sirius hermione rushed to her old friends in a matter of seconds sitting before her at the table were james and sirius sniggering over a dirty joke book while peter sat looking down at a piece of paper trying to sneak a glance at the book every now and then hermione who had been beaming fondly down at them realized with a start that remus was nowhere to be seen as her heart began to sank the werewolf emerged from behind another book shelf his nose in the spine of a charms book come on mooney have a look with us sirius said as remus sat down i just want to finish this first remus muttered pulling out a piece of paper and starting to scribble on a piece of parchment he sat down with his friends pulling out his wand and muttering a few spells whatcha got there mooney james asked innocently in a singsong voice remus knowing better than to trust james snatched up the paper before the potter could get his hands on it prongs look look at this sirius said suddenly guffawing and james was promptly distracted hermione inched closer to remus her heart hammering as she drew close to her former lover and curious about what he was working on just as his scrawl came into their view there was a loud crash very close to them followed by a shriek and all four of the boys became instantly still as if a wary deer had heard a predator sirius was the first to move while remus james and peter looked curiously down the aisle hermione rushed after sirius and saw her former self bleeding and delusion pass out in sirius arms now in her twenties hermione gazed down on the young innocent face that had not experienced the best and worst of life sirius called for his friends over his shoulder and hermione moved just in time to avoid the fleet of boys that came running down the aisle they all stared down at the unconscious girl silently unsure of what to do w who is that remus at finally and hermione stared up into his face her heart swelling at the sound of his voice full of concern and suppressed curiosity his friends glanced at him noticing the intensity of his eyes and remus blushed and looked away dunno we d better bring her to the infirmary though madam pomfrey ll have our heads if we don t james said and they all murmured in agreement when nobody moved remus bent down and picked up the unconscious girl and hermione observing watched as remus desperately tried to keep his eyes off of this strange girl face but could not help himself then the world was swirling black again icy cold and rushing around her as if she were in a wind tunnel when everything came to a stop seconds later hermione found herself standing in the gryffindor common room which was filled with students she muggleborn saw lily and emma being aided by a bushy haired girl while they wrote their essays and as hermione spun around she saw remus sitting at a table staring openly at the girl who was helping lily and emma just then as hermione began to piece together the memory james sirius and peter came flooding from upstairs looking giddy and as if they were about to burst with laughter moony james whispered as they approached their friend what remus asked cautiously he recognized the mischievous grins on their faces and knew whatever suggestion was to come would not be a smart one we just got the greatest idea sirius gushed bouncing with excitement let pull something on jane she the new girl let give her a scare no remus said at once instantly regretting his words hermione watched as the werewolf flushed ooh i see how it is moony james teased he cleared his throat loudly and remus knew that he had to get out of the common room he had managed to shove everything into his bag as james began to sing remus and jane sittin in a tree while james continued on remus escaped just in time the bushy haired girl hermione from long ago noticed what james was singing and also made a dash for the staircase to avoid the situation hermione followed the memory of herself as she ran up the stairs and she and remus lupin bumped into each other both clearly mortified then just as suddenly as the last the world began to dissolve around her and hermione fell into inky nothingness with a noiseless gasp then the black melted to give way to a blinding light which hermione realized was now a snowy world thankful that she could not feel the environment in the memory hermione smiled fondly as she watched the backs of remus lupin and herself walk down the road to hogsmeade together their bodies closer than they probably realized the memory changed again hermione was thrown into a classroom one very dark and dank and full of cauldrons students peered around as professor hull screamed at them and hermione searching quickly found remus glaring at lucius malfoy for the pureblood hand had inched onto the leg of hermione granger a change it was as if they had stayed in the same memory but hermione was instantly confronted with the form of rose sanders she was walking across the room with her head held high before she sat down next to remus the werewolf flushed and began to chat amiably with her casting hopeful glances back across the room as if he wanted someone to see him it changed again observing hermione saw herself and remus lupin walking slowly down a corridor talking quietly then hermione bade him a goodbye and entered the potions room and remus after watching her leave released an aggravated sigh and cupped his face in his hands again remus was talking to rose sanders trying to act casual and calm as she asked him out on a date to hogsmeade after he accepted and threw the slytherin a small grin he went back to the gryffindor table hoping that his happy fa ade would catch the attention of a certain girl again remus was walking down the snowy lane hand in hand with the slytherin he told himself he had no feelings for but had taken comfort in the welcome distraction this slytherin was drastically different than a certain gryffindor girl bushy haired and stubborn and nothing about rose sanders reminded him of hermione granger the change of scenery was much different this time and hermione who had been overwhelmed with the quick pace and change of memories was suddenly very alert it was very dark this time and the air was still but moving forward she realized that she was at the astronomy tower just as she crept towards the starlight the quiet night exploded with fireworks and as she started with shock she read the words happy christmas blaze through the night sky suddenly hermione knew what was going on and her body began to flood with a joyous giddy feeling that warmed her heart and her body bringing back all the life that had been taken from her coming around the corner hermione smiled as she watched herself and remus exchange small words knowing what was about to come when remus withdrew the small box from within his jacket both hermione and her memory gasped at the simple beauty of his gift and then and then then they were one suddenly without warning pressed up against each other in a union that they had both desperately wanted but had never confessed to hermione this was worth every moment of suffering every moment of torment and longer because it was here that revealed how perfect they were for each other how much they could truly love much to hermione disappointment the memory changed again this time she found herself in the boys dormitory where remus was poring over the marauder map muttering his fingers moving rapidly over the old parchment hermione noticed how pale remus was and how hard his hands were shaking as he searched for someone in particular then remus became stiff his eyes racing back and forth no remus shouted suddenly taking hermione off guard mischief managed remus was flying out of the room and hermione was alone for a few moments before she understood that she had to follow him sprinting as fast as she could she nearly collapsed from the stitch in her side remus was shoving people out of the way running faster than she could ve imagined before remus you maniac the memory of hermione shouted as remus snatched her up over his shoulder and began to run down the hallway quiet he hissed he screeched to a stop and dropped her she squeaked as she hit the floor but started yelling again as he grabbed her hand and dragged her down the hallway you have to move he shouted at her his voice tight and frightened then they were sprinting again and hermione struggled to keep up with them as they fled to the room of requirement inside hermione cringed at their fight and their painful epiphanies as they realized the damage remus had caused by making a time charm and then and then you just couldntlove me back remus and i accepted that hermione i was just scared to love you back but i not not anymore he leaned forward and kissed her and the fight that had been loud and rancorous just moments ago did not matter for it dissolved with the sweet tender kiss he had given her watching all of this hermione clutched at her heart and felt the swell of sadness and nostalgia rise up in her throat it changed again this time hermione found herself standing in a dusty old house that seemed to be abandoned she was confused for a moment before she heard a very guttural and familiar sound whirling around she saw the couple was heatedly kissing with their shirts undone and hair askew they were engrossed in each other interlocked in each other hands and embrace there was not a moment where either of them lay still arching caressing gliding hands the heat between them was fierce pressed up against him shuddering with pleasure each time he shifted she did each time he ran a hand down her back or inched her fingers up her shirt her movements were the same causing them to appear as one their bodies moved in an undeniable rhythm shifting up and to the side down and forwards until the movement was so perfect it seemed to be a movie on repeat he cradled her in his arms kissing her neck as she pulled him closer fingers automatically running through his hair grasping his neck to encourage the heat he was creating and gliding her hands over his shoulders and chest she angled her body to match his like placing a puzzle piece with its partner although she had partaken in this memory even though she was watching herself hermione felt as if she was intruding on something very private for this was a scene from something perfect and pure never before this memory had hermione recognized something so natural and passionate but she felt that everything outside of the memory the pensieve destroyed this her engagement to ron slashed this memory diseasing it and ruining its potential for happiness the observer backed away shutting her eyes to the perfection she once had trying to hold back the tears that welled up in her eyes the scene changed the marauders were standing protectively around two girls lily and hermione as a regiment of slytherins stared coldly at them pansy parkinson was drawling something to hermione who looked terrified and guilty remus lupin stood behind her clutching her protectively glaring daggers at the slytherin who was predicting the terrible future of their relationship this message encased the words that destroyed the very essence of hermione heart for it was an irrevocable and undeniable truth it had shaped the foundations of her life and of her mind touching the boundaries of her heart and testing her tolerance for tragedy misery and fate that she could never truly be with remus lupin a change remus and hermione were on his bed clothes undone and bodies alight with fire and passion desire and romance as they touched and loved one another hermione watching cried out in protest as they made love for the first time before this very moment hermione thought there could be nothing worse than the death of remus lupin but she was very wrong their untainted and enthusiastic beautiful and faithful love was betrayed by her actions in reality hermione years ago gave everything she had to remus everything that completed her everything that she loved and worshipped became part of him just as he became her they were meant for each other perfectly and wholly but she had ruined that she had corrupted that by being with ron for settling for another human being for pledging her love elsewhere both in words and action it changed the memory was one hermione expected but had secretly hoped remus had forgotten the young couple was lying together on a roof in the dead of the night admiring an iridescent incomplete moon small talk and affections were exchanged something that pained hermione to watch even still and then he said it those words which haunted her sleep i love you hermione remus whispered in her ear i dontcare how the future turns out you will always be the only one i love how could remus be reliving these things each and every day these memories that tortured hermione surely must have ripped the very fiber of remus apart making him utterly immobile and stony and yet he had lived on after these memories after she left after she moved on he had even found another partner but no matter how much she wanted to pretend hermione knew that tonks was just a fa ade to hide behind an excuse for remus to deny the past to deny everything they had simply because their idyllic relationship stretched decades apart it was uncommon it was strange and it was unconventional yes but could two people love so much as they did then but she did not deserve these thoughts she did not deserve these feelings remus was dead he had died for her and here she was betraying everything that had made her whole a change hermione stood blinded in the middle of a pitch black room there was an eerie silence accompanied by a dank smell must perhaps and the feeling that eyes were watching her soon she became aware of a constant drip drop of water somewhere which heightened her anxiety all the more she struggled to remember what was going on struggled to soothe her racing heart because this perpetual darkness frightened her just as she was about to moan in worry she heard it a groan somewhere off to her left there were people stirring slowly and with difficulty by the sounds of it then she heard sirius voice and her heart jumped as remus replied quietly james croaked something back and lily tender hush to his audible pains hermione heard her own voice and they all quieted as the ominous shouted echoed from up above and then hermione realized what was going on these were her very last moments with her friends with the people she loved more than her own life a gasped escaped her lips before the inevitable commotion started the angry shouts spilled down into the malfoy dungeon and the marauder began screaming in protest as hermione was dragged from their clutches at first she went motionless but then the fierce woman that hermione used to be fought back against the clutches of the death eater flinging herself unceremoniously down the stairs just to have a moment longer with them to tell them each that she loved them dearly that nothing would be the same watching this was the only thing hermione could do as she was gripped with an icy horror that did not cease even as she cried tears streamed down her face but they were no match against remus violent terrified protests at losing his lover his soul mate his everything and then remus was the last sound to reverberate within them followed by the slam of the door darkness flooded the room once again and the only sound that could be heard was the shallow erratic breathing of remus lupin which quickly fell into a panicked moan his voice cracked and a gasp escaped him and all in the same terrible moment remus was sobbing screaming in fury in misery as his friends hurried to hold him to whisper words of comfort but she was gone there was no peace left to be had there was nothing left for him anymore it changed hermione had clamped her eyes shut and boxed her ears trying desperately not to relive the next heartbreak remus had in store for her but no she didntdeserve to escape the pain she didntdeserve relief from her betrayal opening her tear stained eyes she was surprised to see that her younger self was not in this memory instead she was in a room that she recognized as remus bedroom at first it seemed as if the room was empty but then she noticed that someone was standing in front of the open closet and was very very still hermione inched closer feeling very nervous before a voice caused her to jump remus the person standing in front of the closet slowly looked over his shoulder and hermione was met with the worn miserable sight of remus lupin who was clutching something in his hands looking closer hermione realized it was one her robes just then the door opened and lily entered looking worried remus we re going to be late this was hers remus croaked holding out the robe in his fisted hand his knuckles were white and his whole body had begun to shake lily face twisted into that of a concerned mother and she went to him at once as soon as lily had embraced him remus began to openly weep and hermione felt the blood drained from her face her body her heart something within her shattered and she stumbled backwards until she fell onto the bed footsteps pounded up the hallway and james and sirius crept cautiously through the door remus james asked quietly tenderly as he and sirius came in the werewolf did not acknowledge them but clung tighter to lily who was trying her best to console him it not for forever remus sirius said quietly she said twenty years didntshe that not the point choked remus breaking away from lily and angrily wiping his face i i have to go years and years seeing her without her remembering me and she ll be eighteen and i ll be what forty dontyou understand the age doesntmatter because you love james started shut up remus hissed people cantstand werewolves what going to make them accept a relationship like ours if there ever is one remus lily said softly she not likely to forget you how do you know remus croaked tearing up again this was all just a bad dream we all knew she had to leave how could i get myself into this when i knew this was how it was going to end you cantthink like that sirius said firmly dontregret i cantbe with her again i know that remus muttered bitterly imagine just imagine for a moment what it would be like for me for her for us but you love her lily said quietly yes remus agreed which is why i cantbe with her i won t i cantput her through this mess again that not fair james cried you re not letting her decide you re not giving her a chance she ll be there one day in love and overjoyed to see you and you re just going to turn her away i ll just ruin everything remus snapped i ll be old and done and i a werewolf i certainly cantgo into the workforce with that on my record she ll be miserable with me our life would be ruined and imagine if we had children stop it lily snarled how dare you just just go and destroy this relationship without giving her a chance we already had our chance remus growled his face screwed up against the wave of new tears we canthappen again the scene which had held hermione prisoner to its intensity suddenly dissolved around her now she found herself back at hogwarts remus lupin was sitting in dumbledore office looking pleased while dumbledore ruffled through some papers now remus i am more than overjoyed on your decision to join the staff this year dumbledore said with a smile professor lockhart well you know how that goes and thank you for having me remus returned graciously there is something you should know however dumbledore said his voice colored with dark tones remus was no longer at ease but appeared quite stiff now there is a certain girl here she is just thirteen but certainly one of the best pupils in the school she is very bright very eager to learn and still very na ve i sure you have recognized yes remus interrupted i realize she doesntknow i realize she is just thirteen i realize there can be nothing between us as student and teacher i would never compromise the integrity of any student or this school albus you know this is my home as well i do not wish to tarnish its reputation i have complete faith in your words dumbledore agreed but there is something else she is quite close to james son in fact she and harry and arthur weasley son are inseparable remus said nothing but there was a distinct tautness in his jaw i suspect the order of the phoenix will soon rise again as voldemort power becomes stronger once again and harry will grow up to be as determined as james remus finished quietly meaning he ll be very active very involved even where he shouldntbe which means hermione will be as well dumbledore said quietly the old man was staring at lupin his face gazing sympathetically and worriedly at the werewolf who was staring at his lap i suspect for many years to come you will be around her i would understand if you wanted to step down from teaching just so you no remus cut across quickly i ve gone more than ten years without her she just a child now nothing can sprout with that image in mind i ll be alright and in the future when she is no longer a child dumbledore inquired quietly she will have created a life by then one that does not include me i ve gotten on without her these last few years i can survive the rest are you sure this question seemed to be the only real thing dumbledore has asked that night for suddenly remus looked torn and confused upset and red faced with the suppression of his emotions yes he uttered before closing his eyes and releasing a jagged sigh another change remus or rather professor lupin was striding about his classroom arranging things that did not need to be fixed hermione was under the impression that he was very anxious about something a moment later the door opened and she knew why he was fidgeting so much ron harry and hermione all thirteen were among the flood of students that entered the classroom professor lupin beamed at them all trying hard to calm his beating heart trying hard not to look at the adolescent and innocent form of hermione granger just thirteen but as wonderful as he remembered but there was no avoiding it every question he presented to the class hermione hand shot in the air and not only was he forced to look at her he was drawn to her her intelligence and her sincere desire to learn when the class finally left professor lupin dropped into his chair and cupped his face in his hands with a groan it changed this time professor lupin happened to be walking through the flood of students in the main corridor when harry ron and hermione went by ron and hermione were snapping at each other but the pain on hermione face was clear something within remus ached for her wanting nothing more than to take her into his arms to calm her it changed it was christmastime at the burrow and all members of the order were celebrating christmas eve there was food and drink all around harry was talking to mrs weasley while fred and george bothered ginny and mr weasley was discussing the werewolf laws with lupin looking around the room hermione recognized herself and ron sitting on the sofa talking she remembered this instantly for it had happened the christmas of her sixth year not bothering to go over because she remembered ron was openly defaming viktor krum she made her way to remus who was quite distracted in his conversation with mr weasley although the topic was very interesting the werewolf was clearly watching the young couple and remus face tensed as ron and hermione exchanged a long significant look before turning away from each other blushing everything changed again back at hogwarts remus lupin was clearly the professor again and hermione heart jolted with fear as the memory invaded her mind lupin was grading papers silently every now and then dipping his quill in ink there was a knock on his door and he stood and opened it hermione a student still in her seventh year stood there looking pale but jittery clearly bothered by something hermione lupin said pleasantly warmed at the sight of her having been around her for so many years now it had become easier and easier for him to pretend to separate his life into two parts a life in which hermione was his lover and a life in which she was nothing just a student and insignificant to his life the girl entered and started to speak rapidly her eyes alight with warmth and relief but the words fell on deaf ears because remus suddenly realized what season of year it was what month and just how many years had passed since he had last kissed her lies started spouting out of his mouth complex lies well rehearsed lies lies that would help her move on later in life lies that would ease the pain lies that would make it easier for the both of them lies that would make all these years worth it lies that he wanted to take back and forget about because all these years all these years being hardened against the memory of her simply shattered at the sight of her devastated by his words but alight with passion nonetheless he wanted nothing more than to stop talking to seize her in his arms and kiss her but he couldn t as hermione proceeded to fall into an irreversible hysteria the desire to hold her became stronger and stronger and remus was beginning to lose control of himself he needed some way any way to get away from her or else he would grab her sit i will go fetch you some calming draught i fortunately have some in my office words that had fallen off his lips meant nothing had no meaning and only propelled him to fly into his office with shaking hands and a hammering heart he pulled out parchment and a quill scribbling albus hermione memory has come back to her under no circumstances should she be sent back to redeliver your letter please if she catches the slightest hint of a lie everything we ve worked for i ve worked for will be demolished remus the message was hastily hooked onto the claws of an owl perched in his office before the bird took off into the sunset knowing that he couldnthide out in his office forever remus attempted to collect himself before going back out to her the moment she was in his vision his heart skipped a beat and he had to bite his tongue to stop from crying out to her lies and misgivings etched his voice and he prayed for her to scrutinize him to see how badly he needed her now that she remembered him but half of him prayed that she didn t if she bought this if she took his cruel lies for truth then this would be the worst experience of his life but it would be one that he had endured it would make him stronger what he did not expect however was the well crafted argument that was thrown against his weakened heart and it took every fiber of his being to resist holding her comforting her loving her again he was sure that if he took her into his arms this horrible mess would be forgotten instantaneously and they could be happy together i can be your mentor and your friend but i can only be those things but she fought back again and again she fought back against him and with each of her vicious accurate words he was diminished into nothing empty space with no conviction a heartless shell because everything within him was dissipating with the lies he weakly supplied to her and then she ran away from him and his lies leaving remus to all but collapse in misery it changed students were now filing out of the classroom that had just been occupied by a distressed professor remus lupin had his back to the door of the classroom and was organizing something before he turned around at the sound of a cough hermione was standing there and remus felt the blood drain from his face it had taken him a week to fully get over the incident with hermione return to her proper time and he feared that another blow to his poorly protected heart might ruin everything this time hermione was not furious but appeared very to be forcedly calm and cool of course he had watched her over the last few weeks of course he had seen the way she became drastically introverted often not speaking for large spaces of time of course he knew what he was doing to her the collected muggle born offered him an apology that should have put him at ease but made him all the more nervous and on edge their words were well rehearsed and controlled and with a few moments time she began to relax a little releasing her obviously contained emotions she talked of sirius of james and lily of their friendship and love and how terribly she missed it her recollecting made remus ache for the past not just for his lover but for his friends as well and then then he was close to her somehow impossibly he was touching her it was an action he promised himself he would never do under any circumstances but here he was with a hand on her shoulder reveling in the warmth of her body the small gap between them and her sweet smell that encased him completely then then she kissed him it was glorious it was wonderful it was invigorating the dam within him of quelled memories suddenly burst demolished and happily destroyed as everything rushed into him all at once and he forgot the thing he had been repeating for years we cannot be together just as suddenly his well rehearsed line seemed to pierce him and his body rejected everything without warning even the gentle and perfect lips that were on his and he spoke the words he wished would disappear from reality from the dictionary from every nook and cranny of his twisted mind he wanted to get rid of you have to leave and when she was gone and when he was safe alone remus lupin simply cried a change the flickering firelight threw the faces of ron harry and remus into sharp relief they were in the kitchen of grimmauld place and it was clearly very very late ron was pacing around the room while harry sat at the table remus adjacent to him it just that i can never find a good time ron was saying anxiously running a hand through his hair there are always people and there always something going on and she always so busy that hermione harry said with a shrug look you just have to do it you cantkeep that ring in your pocket forever i know but it doesnthave to be perfect ron you know hermione not that kind of girl harry reminded his friend ron looked concerned at this thought now because hermione was apparently not that kind of girl what kind of girl is she how do i propose to a kind of girl ron spluttered now tangled in the worry and nervousness of this idea stop worrying so much harry said as he stifled a laugh she going to say yes regardless how do you know ron asked sharply appearing very angry for a moment before withering back to pure anxiety i can think of a million reasons why she d say no there will be a million more if you keep putting it off remus offered quietly the words from the venerable werewolf stopped ron in his tracks and he looked at remus both hopefully and fretfully but do you love her ron remus asked his eyes locked on the blue ones of ron inside the werewolf was chanting no no no no but he knew ron answer was yes it had always been yes and does she love you yes harry answered for ron as the weasley gaped unable to grasp anything they have for years ron just ask the damn girl to marry you you dontknow what this pressure is like harry ron exclaimed wildly bulging considering ginny and i oh shut up ron snapped flatly you have nothing to lose ron remus reminded the red haired boy ron seemed to deflate in relief at this but remus seemed to wither away right in his seat finally releasing the words he had kept hidden for years they were words that would ruin his hidden desires words that had been haunting him forever words that would make hermione happy again but no matter how wounded he was by each of his own syllables he pressed on you have been in love for years she has loved you even longer than that just ask her ron grudgingly nodded and a weak smile crawled onto his face before he released another nervous sigh ugh but when bloody hell a change hermione spun around and tried to pinpoint exactly where she was but she was unfamiliar with her surroundings she was in a sitting room certainly but she happened to notice it was very clean or rather there was not much in it at all all the furniture was pushed right up against the wall and anything that would have adorned the floor was absent looking around she also noticed that everything was mismatched and full of color although they were not well coordinated the couch was yellow but the wallpaper green and the stool purple while the table was red just as she was beginning to piece together the clues she heard shouting from the next room it was an angry voice sharp and accusing and hermione recognized it instantly to be tonks there was only a moment hesitation before hermione dashed over the door and stepped through stopping shortly as she caught sight of remus lupin sitting dejectedly in a chair and tonks glaring at him i ve been around long enough it becoming more and more obvious that you have there nothing going on between us remus said quietly colorlessly as he stared at the table i know when you re lying tonks cried her face twisting up in pain she looked as if she were on the verge of tears baring keeping her composure and and i know you re lying my mother told me about when you were in school remus looked sharply and suddenly at tonks his face etched with alarm tonks took this as an indication that she had discovered him i didntgo to school with your mother remus murmured slowly looking back down at the table she was much younger than you and she remembers all the escapades you had she said she remembered some girl messing around with lucius malfoy and somehow you were involved tonks said her voice trembling slightly remus simply closed his eyes and released a weary sigh and hermione had the impression that these fights often happened and he had been used to giving in this fight was no different this is so foolish remus said quietly again none of that happened yes it did tonks shot back at once although weakly no it didn t remus reiterated a little more forcefully yes tonks cried her body giving into the emotions she was struggling overcome stop this remus growled clenching his jaw and glaring at her you dontknow what you re what is this then tonks shouted finally allowing the tears to escape her as she thrust something into remus hands the werewolf which had been progressively getting angrier became quite still his face grew white as he stared down at the thing in his hand hermione went hastily to him and stopped short at the sight of the picture it was something she knew well it was a memory she hated reliving but it was proof that she and remus had been real had been together and had been perfect there in his hands was the picture of lucius malfoy and hermione granger kissing heatedly to both remus and hermione this picture was loathsome and terrible for they knew the true circumstances of the photo tonks did not but it was still proof that hermione granger had existed well tonks asked forcefully wincing at the sharp demand in her voice remus said nothing but put the picture on the table face down without a word he stood slowly looking thin and raggedly and began to leave the room just admit you still love her tonks cried her lip trembling remus hesitated before whispering i sorry he stood for a moment a heavy statue representing everything that he had become or rather everything that he had lost and then he left tonks stared at the door as it closed her eyes glassy her chest heaving there was a certain emptiness about the room a certain heavy silence that pressed down on the memory although remus had just left tonks seemed utterly alone and it was a feeling that seemed to crawl under hermione skin and hiss a warning to her that this was her future loneliness hermione barely had time to worry before the world changed around her suddenly and almost thankfully it was if this grief this sadness that wrenched through tonks heart was because of hermione mere existence but it was a thought pondered no longer because suddenly there was a collage of terror invading her senses fire swarmed through her vision forcing her to stumble backwards a loud shrieking sound echoed through the night drawing her attention away from the screams that were rising up through the flames shielding herself and soothing herself with the knowledge that the fire couldnthurt her she dashed through the hellish flames towards the sound of the screaming as she stepped into the night she tripped through the massive hole that had been gouged into the earth she cried out in fear as she saw herself ron and harry scrambling to get off the ground and flee from the regiment of death eaters that began to surround them in turn the three of them desperately fought off the death eaters that were attacking them each falling to the wielding of a curse falling into the flames harry somehow outlasted his two friends but his consciousness was futile as his attempts to defend himself and his friends not only attracted more attention from the death eaters but crushed any hopes to escape as soon as harry fell victim to the final curse of the death eaters there was a sudden bright light that erupted from the back of the alleyway where the fire had not evaded the night hermione ripped her eyes from the horrifying scene before her to stare dumbly at the ethereal light before it soared over the death eaters after a moment the silver thing that was flying over them seemed to form into a definite shape and hermione realized that it was a patronus and that it could only belong to one person because no one else that knew would care so much would risk their lives just to make sure to be safe remus lupin was here somewhere this sudden light caused a sudden uproar among the death eaters it was quickly known that the order of the phoenix was approaching the scene that there was hardly enough time to confiscate the bodies that the dark lord desired before now there was a sudden burst of sound of light and the powerful and ominous throng that was the death eaters was broken the members of the order had arrived and soon powerful jets of light followed by bellows of rage soared through the night watching all of this hermione was only dumbfounded at their immediate arrival on the scene perhaps remus was not the only one that had been waiting had been watching but she knew deep down in the bottom of her soul that remus had followed them there to protect her almost as if hearing her thoughts remus lupin appeared as a sharp silhouette a solid mass against the ever changing flames taking advantage of the commotion he went to the unconscious body of hermione granger splayed across the ground with blood and dirt on her face tenderly he pulled her into his arms and staring at this hermione noticed he was trembling with fear and that his face was wet with tears brushing the hair from the blood on her cheek he touched her face with the gentlest of movements a lover true touch his face was thrown in sharp relief as the ground exploded next to them fire surging around them in the night but nothing could take him away from her now nothing would tear his hands from her for the past twenty years he had gone without holding her and now this was his only chance for the past twenty years he had been incomplete half of what he could be alone and broken and now in the midst of war he knew holding her would make sense he knew he could die holding her as long as he was with her because there was nothing else but her to live for slowly meaningfully he kissed her forehead before he pulled back and gazed longingly sadly into her unconscious face if there were not curses and spells flying around them if they were not surrounded by flames and the shrapnel of war hermione could spend forever in this moment for it proved all of her tears worthy all of those years living an uncertain reality was made definite was made true just by the touch of his hand the brief touch of his lips on her skin there was a constricting feeling in her chest that wouldntallow her to focus on anything else she was aware only of this heavy feeling that pressed down on her that enclosed her from all sides that strangled her breathing tears slipped from her eyes as she gasped trying to catch her breath trying to understand what was happening to her but she did not have to think she knew she knew that everything she had seen in his pensieve everything she had experienced that was not hers to experience was the same thing that brought tears to her eyes that brought a smile to her face these memories these events these things that remus tortured himself with everyday was what made him tick was what made him alive because if he could not have her in real life he could not survive at all then this was how he must survive even though he had had years to strengthen himself even though he had years to mend his broken heart it was these memories that mattered most to him these memories were something he could sink into watching longingly even if he could never reach out and touch the girl that he truly loved just to be near her to revel in something that was real and true was enough was enough for him to breathe was enough for him to wake up in the morning to simply stay alive but hermione had betrayed this they were the same they were one they were everything and she betrayed him betrayed his love and his loyalty his faith even in the denial of their relationship it did not matter that he denied her before had lied about their previous love because she understood now that he had no other option who would believe their bizarre story who would allow them to be together unhindered and unbothered how could they lead a life peaceful and wonderful but was wasting away better than loving one another against the masses was it worth it to deny their love for convenience when being apart was slowly killing them no matter how hard he tried he could not go on without her with the knowledge that they could be together but they were not remus lupin simply withered away he wanted the best for hermione he wanted her to be happy to be successful to have everything she wanted but under what circumstance could he possibly accept that he was the answer to all of her needs she didntpush him she didntdemand it out of him only a moment worth of tears before she had given up had pushed everything aside and had moved on with her life she had let their strained relationship exist with the suppressed knowledge that what they had was real what they had was still there aching to emerge once more but had denied the chance because ron was a distraction a lovely and easy distraction and because remus lived and breathed and moved while she was still with ron she felt that there was no need to push if he had cared enough he would have begged her pleaded and only after a moment she would have given in to him would have thrown herself into his arms but he had not begged her or pleaded her instead he hid behind the fa ade of tonks trying to resurrect those feelings for hermione in another woman but just as foolish as it was apparent his plan failed and he was trapped within the mistakes that he had made while he watched hermione flourish on trapped while he watched her convinced that her life was filled with utter happiness without him and was it the world dissolved around hermione giving way to the bleak reality that she was truly living in but she did not notice for she was weeping weakly weeping for that which she had given up for that which she had denied if only she had tried harder had pushed remus into giving into her then perhaps he would be alive right now holding her as she wept but he was not and it was her fault after a moment a day or an eternity hermione became aware that she was sobbing weakly on the floor in remus room in here he had caged himself in here had had tortured himself in here he had lived a hell in which he could not escape she did the only thing that made sense feebly sniffing hermione crawled into remus bed basking in the smell of him trying to pretend that he was there beside her holding her telling her it was alright it didntmatter everything was beautiful and perfect again but she could not pretend any longer forcing herself to stay awake to be acutely aware of her pain and her loss hermione poured over the memories she had just relived trying to make sense of the only thing that inhabited her mind all night she lied awake in his bed hoping and praying that the moment would come where he would crawl into bed next to her there was not a single moment that her mind remained free of remus memories every second of the night was filled with thoughts of remus of the memories that haunted her both consciousness and troubled sleep and she felt that she was becoming the empty shell that he had become because she had experienced this terrible loss this crash course in tragedy and remus was without her at the end she had nothing left to live for hermione could no longer think she could no longer eat no longer sleep no longer survive there was a single thought that possessed her mind at any given point a thought that she struggled with and mourned over he died for me and i have done nothing for him there was nothing she could do that was worthy atonement of course her wedding could not happen of course ron would have to be disregarded but what then still hermione was consumed by the thought of what she could to make up for her grave sin her fatal mistake she noticed nothing else but the thought of redemption not even the way her skin sagged at her eyes or the chilling sight of her wrists that had been reduced to skin clinging to bone all night she thought pondered dissected and scrutinize and all night there was only one thing that could occupy her mind a thought that heightened the most wonderful moments of her life a thought that bombarded her with the most terrible of past events and it was remus lupin remus lupin remus lupin remus remus remus remusremusremus curled as tightly as possibly as if to deny her existence as if to render herself null and void hermione cradled herself squeezing her limbs together to expel any extra room that would invite misery in that would beckon this grief and tragedy that was eating away at her moment by moment i would give anything to have you back hermione thought to herself acutely aware of her weak whimpering i would give anything to fix my mistakes then come with me said a voice was she dreaming was this a hallucination a lovely delirium or was it a nightmare some manifestation come back to torment her slowly hermione uncurled herself from her infantile position and sat up in bed her muscles screaming in protest but she could pay them no attention for there in the room the impossible was happening beautiful perfect terrible impossible wonderful but how come with me remus repeated to hermione beaming into her face it seemed as if god himself had graced her with his presence hermione whose mere existence was heavy and dull bleak and worthless paled even more in comparison his presence lit up the room a beacon that broke the endlessness that was her life his face was not lined with age or weariness but was clean and smooth fresh glowing his skin was the only light she could see his eyes the only light that could penetrate the darkness she had sunken into remus hermione whispered eyes round with brimming tears this isntreal he back not back real i love you come on remus urged again smiling he held out his hand his movement slow but fluid and something unlike anything she had ever seen the room that encaged them that had been dreary and small and a mournful reminder of what was dead and gone seemed to dissolve away before her eyes as she stared at him captivated there were no more walls there was no ceiling no door no bed nothing the only thing that was real that was alive was remus hermione simply stared at him he was beautiful remus lupin was no longer marked by gray hair and healed scars nor shabby clothes or dark circles beneath his eyes his skin gleamed rich and warm and inviting and his eyes were like the first ray of dawn banishing all the darkness on the earth he stood before her full of life beaming with all the emotion she once had with everything she had lost with everything she had been praying to recover he was here a lighthouse in a terrible storm tall and thin simple and plain and lovely and all that she could ask for hermione carefully reached out and warily took his hand there was such a rush such a flood of emotion that she began to cry harder out of joy and disbelief the sheer capacity that was overwhelming her was tremendous but like liquid gold a feeling to be had of utter perfection the quintessential substance i love you hermione murmured trembling as she stood her legs shook beneath her both from neglect and shock and she struggled to remain on her feet but touching him holding the lively and perfect thing that was remus lupin hand kept her up kept her strong and determined and powerful she clutched onto his fingers tighter gasping at the energy that flowed into her reveling in this newfound life that was suddenly granted upon her remus handsome and young and perfect gazed down into her brown eyes grinning and i love you i ve told you once before hermione remus reminded her smiling i dontcare how the future turns out you will always be the only one i love say it again hermione urged him fiercely suddenly without warning holding onto his lovely hands as if they were a lifesaver for she had been shipwrecked and had finally been saved i love you remus reiterated quietly but passionately staring into her eyes hermione gazed hungrily into his endless eyes losing everything she had ever believed in except for him for weeks on end there was nothing but bleak desolation hopelessness emptiness there was a constant stinging hole that she was acutely aware of that she welcomed as it ate away at the very fiber of her being at first it was terrifying but as time went on and she could no longer pretend remus was alright she invited the deathly and terrible pain as a means of distraction but remus was here now protecting her healing her loving her and that horrible perpetual hole was gone the void was filled overflowing in only moments comprised of loveliness and perfection and her desperate and lonely past did not matter nothing mattered anymore now come on remus said again tugging on her hands they re waiting for us who hermione asked curiously lacing her fingers with his and stepping closer basking in the wonderful heat of his body the wonderful smell a jagged breath escaped her lips as his godly presence soothed her crawled into the gaping wound that was her broken heart james and lily and sirius remus laughed looking at her as if she had lost her mind they ve been waiting all along but they re dead hermione said the loveliness coming to an abrupt stop a terrible sickening feeling rising up in her stomach a churning bile that could not be ignored what are you talking about remus asked his smile fading slightly in confusion and you re dead hermione said with a horrible conviction she clamped her eyes shut and began muttering to herself trying to shut up the perfection that was remus lupin open your eyes remus instructed amusement clearly present in his voice however much she wanted to anchor herself in the reality she did as she was told feeling that disobeying him was a crime she could never make around her were cavernous walls students bustling to and fro as food began to disappear from the house tables the pleasant echo of voices drew her attention to the throng of gryffindors that were exiting the great hall to the quidditch pitch the bewitched ceiling revealed a perpetual blue sky freckled with clouds and the banners hung from the ceiling that indicated that ravenclaw had won the house cup this year and there in the midst of it all stood she and remus holding hands and looking quite foolish as the great hall emptied hermione gaped as she blinked first dumbly and then furiously as if attempting to wake herself this this isnt real hermione uttered releasing his hands and taking in remus and his school clothes and her gryffindor tie and cloak this what is this hermione remus repeated this time with a more serious tone are you alright was she alright was she alright around her were not thin miserable walls that encased an equally miserable girl but the stone walls of hogwarts that had held her just as closely as remus himself around her were not the memories of mistakes of lost love of broken hearts or the irrevocable death of remus lupin but an endless world of possibilities that did not judge or limit her but was it real was this a hallucination another dream as wonderful as the seven months she had spent with remus before did she care she had remus she had lily and james and sirius she had hogwarts and her studies and a youth that could be spent with the person she truly loved she had everything she had been asking for had been praying for it did not matter that this was a matter of life and death for everything had been reversed every moment she drew a breath she wished she had not for it was a breath that remus lupin could never have in his death but now standing before the man she would have died for if he had simply asked her she drew a breath that he could share for they were finally together again they were finally one her mistakes had been forgiven her past had been erased and her future was spotless and promising full of nothing but love and perfection of happiness and satisfaction i sorry hermione whispered an amazed smile breaking onto her face i must ve dozed or something it alright remus chortled leaning in to kiss her forehead she breathed deeply and felt energized young infallible now come on taking her hand remus pulled her towards the exit of the great hall there before her was a light so powerful and warm that she could do nothing but move towards it it was colossal and seemed to pull her in from her very core as if it were a portkey or a black hole a portal that led to paradise the only thing that was keeping her grounded that was keeping her from sprinting into this perfection was the piece of happiness that she was holding onto and it was something she would never let go of for the rest of eternity together with laced hands and untouchable smiles remus lupin and hermione granger exited the great hall disappearing into the light that beckoned them they were complete they were happy and they were in love and she couldnthave asked for anything more x fin x author note um so yeah if you re unclear about what happened hermione died in her sleep of a broken heart but this is what i tried to do to make up for killing remus in the end they got to be together kind of and i intentionally am leaving the other character out of her death and will not elaborate on their reactions because i think they re sort of predictable and it not something i think i need to explain anyway a huge thank you for all those readers that have stuck around to the end of this story i ve only finished on other story before and it is no longer posted because someone filed a complaint or some shit and it was taken down but this is a huge source of pride so thank you thank you everyone it was nice writing for you sincerely minnie disclaimer i do not own harry potter but i do own emmaline ok i sorry for the really really long wait on this chapter but i was so caught up in october hollow and i couldntleave it alone but now i going to make a good smack at this here is it jane and btw jane isntjust hermione lol still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter four you cantalways tell as remus and hermione made their way into hogsmeade hermione thought i think this shall be quite an interesting affair i just glad it not awkward that d be a nightmare i mean i guess i could show you the shrieking shack but they say it haunted remus said quickly glancing around to avoid her eyes hermione knew why remus was a werewolf and would definitely like to avoid that place pretending to be scared hermione said haunted no let leave that for another day i not too fond of ghosts she laughed and remus joined her though rather nervously shall we head to the three broomsticks then he asked she nodded then could we check out the bookstore afterwards she said he looked sideways at her i mean assuming there is one she added quickly when was she going to learn yeah of course jane he said smiling at her the three broomsticks was no different from what hermione was accustomed to there were christmas trees up early hermione realized with a pang that she forgot it was december and there were many hogwarts students gathering having a good time with their friends remus pointed out madam rosmerta with a slight blush as the waitress waved at him as he and hermione entered hermione raised an eyebrow at him and grinned he pulled out a chair politely for hermione and when he sat down he started talking about the bookshop after he ordered some butterbeers for them it was very nice sitting there with him clutching a warm bottle hermione thought vaguely as she listened to him with rapt attention but it was very different she could not help but wonder what the future would be like when she got back oy wouldja look there it moony and his date said a loud boisterous voice remus stopped talking abruptly and together he and hermione looked over at james a scowling lily sirius and emmaline and peter tagging along as they made through the people sirius and james pulled some empty tables and chairs and pushed them against the one remus and hermione were sitting at and sat down rather rudely sirius and james who were sitting next to each other put their elbows on the table put their head on their knuckles and looked at the ceiling leaning against each other oh that remus he so dreamy sirius said in a high voice james let out a fake smitten sigh oh i know it too bad he fancies lily smacked james in the middle of his girly speech and glared at him james just grinned at her i mean enjoys that wonderful girl jane he finished like a thirteen year old girl oh dontlet us interrupt your date moony go on pretend we arenthere we ll be good little boys we promise sirius teased remus scowled sorry remus but james here was being a lousy git and wouldntget out of the damn quidditch store so i brought him here lily apologized we can leave if he starts acting like his little sister again hey james said in mock offense i ll have you know my little sister is quite a tomboy so i wouldntbe acting girly oh right james i forgot that with nail polish pink is the new black emmaline said scathingly touch bitch james replied and they all laughed hermione sat quietly sipping her butterbeer while she watched the whole little quarrel they didnttake notice of her but she loved watching them fight back and forth the only bitch here is you james emmaline said lily gave her a high five i sorry were you talking i heard this nagging little voice in my head that i could ve sworn belonged to the wench down the street ow james shrieked as emmaline punched him hard on the arm god you scream like a girl lily said suppressing a laugh and he looks like one too emmaline said lily rolled her eyes ladies ladies enough flirting with james i right here you know sirius said leaning forward to on the table and flashing them a handsome smile it isntflirting my dear snuffles emmaline said lightly sirius turned red and grimaced snuffles james remus and peter all cried at the same time they roared in laughter hermione couldnthelp but giggle as sirius muttered shut up you guys oh emma what a lovely nickname you ve given him hermione said with a laugh emmaline smiled brightly at hermione okay emmy dearest let leave please sirius said with gritted teeth getting up emmaline laughed and got up alright see you guys later she called as they walked to the door predictably everyone at the table called together in a horrible singsong voice even hermione by y y e snuffles it was no surprise when sirius threw his empty butterbeer bottle at them they all roared with laughter as it smashed hermione wiped the tears out of her eyes as they all settled down okay now that dear snuffles and emma are gone lily said laughing slightly where have you guys been so far i know you haventbeen here before jane so where do you want to go with remus it was with way she said go with remus and the smirk she had on her face as she said it that made hermione glare at lily hermione couldntbelieve that she already felt a crush for the man who would be her professor someday but it had happened so quickly it was nearly like when she fancied ron he was mean to her obviously because he was jealous and hermione simply loved it but when she started liking him she only told ginny and although ginny assured that ron liked her too hermione just didntbelieve it until that summer when ron let it slip to the twins but as hermione looked at remus it was different he was cute and amazingly so that hermione couldntbelieve how much older he would look in nearly twenty years he was clever and fun and smart hermione simply loved that about him but she didntknow was how much she liked him err i dontknow maybe the bookshop down the street hermione said after a thoughtful moment lily nodded they ve quite a big selection there dontget lost lily joked i won t dontworry hermione assured a half hour later hermione and remus were in the bookshop down the lane hermione was engrossed in the titles and many subjects and she kept pulling books out flipping to the beginning reading the flap of certain books and the summaries of others by the time remus had found the one book he was looking for hermione had a whole stack remus gaped as she slammed them down on the counter and pulled out her money and paid for them she smiled at remus inquiring face i like to read she admitted with a blush then remus took her all over town offering frequently to carry her bag with all the books in it though she declined every time she didntmind carrying her own things zonko was wonderful although hermione had been in there a few times with ron and harry but only because ron shoved her in there she found it amusing hermione stood laughing at a pair of fighting fireworks while remus wondered around in their third year the marauder decided they needed a safety device for their constant pranks their habit of breaking the rules their tendency to get into trouble and they set remus upon the problem within a few months remus had produced something wonderful the marauder map the map had every passageway every staircase every room and every person that was inside hogwarts and best of all they were all labeled too the boys from then on were able to maneuver their way about the castle without running into filch or mrs norris or any other patrollers but even so there were kinks that needed to be worked out problems that needed fixing certain people didntshow up on the map and sometimes names were switched remus had yet to find a way to fix the horrible problem and so far he had been looking and thinking hard for a solution yet as remus rounded a corner his eyes set down on jane and her mirth and his troubles lifted off his shoulders he forgot all about the map and went to join her in the fun when jane and remus got back to the castle they met up with the marauders lily and emmaline for dinner the great hall was filled with chatter the delicious smell of food wafting its way throughout students as they ate talked and gossiped jane was unusually quiet for dinner keeping her eyes on the plate as she ate the whole time she was thinking deeply her eyebrows creased as she pushed food around on her plate only remus seemed to notice but he said nothing he wasntexactly sure what was wrong with her they had come into the great hall and he had mentioned the fun they had together at hogsmeade and she was very quiet from then on she seemed to be in a deep thought he wasntsure if he ought to interrupt her or not when everyone was in bed that night homework done and covers pulled up to their chins hermione lay thinking staring at the ceiling the day in hogsmeade had been absolutely wonderful it had indeed but there was only one thing wrong she only heard it in passing as a couple walked by her but someone had said something along the lines of that really going to affect my future that is of course it had been a sarcastic statement but she was thinking about it if she and remus did end up liking each other kissing or having any kind of non platonic relationship or something close to it even a boyfriend and girlfriend thing what would that do to her real days at hogwarts being in the same room with lupin while at the same time to her it was remus would be so hard to handle and she had seen just a bit of red hair that day which made her think of ron her relationship with ron would be over she knew that she didntwant to face the facts because she had a strong feeling for remus but she knew that if anything happened between them it would be star crossed she needed to do something about it quickly x x x as hermione lay in her bed thinking of her troubles remus was doing just the same except he was sitting on the edge of the bed watching james sirius and peter fool around and throw quills at each other and charm books to hit one another none of the three of them noticed his quietness until a while after what up moony james asked ducking as sirius threw a quill at him just thinking remus said apprehensively did he dare tell his three best friends his biggest fear i so glad you explained yourself peter said sarcastically remus threw him a dirty look snatched a quill from the pile on his bed and threw it at peter it hit him directly on the nose and peter sat down rubbing it throwing remus a glower from the corner of his eyes about ja ane sirius asked in a mocking singsong voice remus opened his mouth for a second and then shut it yes and no he answered james and sirius looked at each other their eyes wide with mock concern oh no not two answers do you know what this means siry we ll have to paint our nails and have an in depth discussion james said in a high girlish voice sirius nodded and put his arm around james sighing sadly in a feminine way we ll just have to help remus with his girl problems or else he may break out in a rash sirius said in an equally high voice how would two answers make me break out remus asked utterly thrown off because padfoot and prongs put bulbadox power in your pajamas peter snickered remus sighed and pulled at his collar momentarily and looked down at his chest not in these ones anyway he sighed well anyway james said in his normal voice we re so afraid of you having problems with your girlfriend he said in his girly voice once more she not my girlfriend remus shouted at once suddenly angry james and sirius exchanged glances dontget so worked up about it mate sirius said seriously we were only having a go at you yeah well don t remus said angrily he jumped back and ripped the hangings around his bed so all he could look at was the thick scarlet curtain moony did something happen james asked sounding concerned no then what the hell is wrong sirius asked we know you fancy her so why are you getting mad about this for once sirius sounded like his namesake he wasntbeing a goof or a jerk like usual but he sounded confused and a bit worried remus sighed he knew his friends just wanted to help he gently tugged the hangings away and looked at all three of their bemused expressions the thing is remus started i dontthink i fancy her when she came i mean i liked her then and all but i mean i really got to know her today and i dunno something clicked and it wasn t it wasntwhat i expected remus said uneasily he felt very self conscious lying to his friends you dont fancy her peter asked incredulously remus shook his head the three marauders exchanged astonished glances well why not they demanded remus shrugged i don t i dontreally know he drifted off okay well i not exactly sure maybe i do maybe i don t i would prefer if we talked about something else if not i going to sleep he said abruptly he leaned back pulled the hangings around and collapsed against his pillow jane was going to take this very hard and he would have to lie to her sometime x x x author notes ok so i really sorry about not having this one out earlier but i ve been having a really stressful month so far with a whole buncha trivial crap so i wontbother explaining myself i just wanted to apologize for the long wait and i know this is a short chapter but please forgive me i ve been having bad writers block and i haventwritten anything except homework and reports for the last two to three weeks thank you all who reviewed i trying my hardest to write but sometimes i kinda can t anyways please keep reading and reviewing disclaimer i do not own harry potter but i do own jane lewis and emmaline so please sit back and read like the wind and review like the wind too still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter five the week from hell hermione week could not have gone worse after she decided that a relationship with remus was bad and therefore she had to stop it before it happened it was a complicated idea though very simple in itself but hermione couldntfind the point to her own concept she fancied him so therefore she should let it happen but meddling with time was against the law anything against the law hermione refused to look twice at besides that incident in third year she knew not to partake in such nonsense but this wasnteven nonsense because she felt something terrible stab her chest whenever she thought about it choosing the right idea always made things better didnt it guys i need to tell you something hermione said a little urgently to emmaline and lily on monday night the two girls were gossiping about some boy in ravenclaw and they looked over at jane abruptly hermione had thought about it for a fortnight becoming more than friends with remus would cause awkward moments and embarrassing moments in the future and hermione couldnthave that even if it meant giving up the one thing that made hermione heart flutter what wrong lily asked concernedly she and emma slipped off their own beds which were side by side and climbed onto hers and sat cross legged looking worried hermione knew no way to say it unobtrusively so she plain out spoke i dontlike remus anymore and her reaction was almost as if she had gone forward in time you don t emma asked taken aback but you guys click so well together lily complained hermione shrugged it was this weekend i had a brilliant time with remus i really did but i dunno something clicked in me and it wasntthe here your future boyfriend more like here your future best boy friend i dontthink i like him anymore than a friend hermione said in a depressed voice she really didntlike speaking it aloud when she knew it wasnttrue lily and emma exchanged looks are you sure lily asked suspiciously hermione nodded a definitely and emma gave her a judgmental look hermione raised an offended eyebrow at her i positive i dontlike him hermione said in her hardest voice lily nodded frowning but emma continued to look oddly at her but nodded after a moment the two girls went to bed shortly after each giving hermione a distrustful look in turn before rolling under the soft feather down quilts on their beds and drifting off into an untroubled slumber something hermione wished to have desperately her sleep was horrible she kept dreaming about her real life and how being in the front of defense against the dark arts would be with professor lupin he would suddenly cry out in protest about how she had broken her heart and ron and harry would disown her and ginny would be disgusted with her and she wouldnthave anything left when she woke tuesday she had a strong feeling that something awful would happen whether it was to her or not sighing she got out of bed and got ready for the day in the past picking up her homework quills and ink and setting them carefully in her schoolbag before heading down to breakfast there were few gryffindors at the table except for peter and remus hermione sat down across from them giving them an awkward smile and eating her breakfast silently neither of them spoke to each other in time lily and james came down their arms laced together and laughing quietly and emma was chased by sirius shrieking in mock fear forcing several other early risers to look in annoyance at the energetic couple soon enough the entire hall was filled complete will clattering of knifes and forks filled with hearty laughter and conversation hermione was quiet the whole time remus after giving hermione a regretful look slid down the bench a few people next to james and lily leaving hermione sitting across from peter whose mousy brown hair stuck up oddly that morning peter gave her a sad half smile before sliding down too next to the marauders hermione felt devastated all of her classes went by extremely slow and piles of vicious homework were stacked up due to the newt at the end of the year hermione felt exhausted but kept going nevertheless the only real annoyance to her that day and the rest of the week too was that remus was avoiding her as best as he could he wouldnt sit across from her he went out of his way to skirt the opposite side of the corridor whenever she was near him he did not make eye contact hermione was irritated greatly but said nothing wednesday went by in a blur hermione had so much homework and she was working on it constantly so she was driven to sleepless nights with many of the other gryffindors as she completed the assignments as thursday came along hermione felt like she was at the end of her slack she had no patience left she was extremely tired from finishing her homework and remus was full out avoiding her although on the way back to gryffindor tower her book bag had split causing her to come to an abrupt halt in the hallway as she gathered her books in utter annoyance he stopped and without looking directly at her picked up a few books and handed them to her hermione could remember watching his retreating back in sorrow hermione slept through breakfast lily woke her up and with emma help dragged her to their first class care of magical creatures since the teacher was very unconcerned with his class just like professor binns was hermione was able to nod off on lily shoulder the whole time and then lunch came she was extremely ravenous having not eaten breakfast or last nights dinner because of homework and yet the food made her even sleepier lily just managed to drag her to the class after lunch potions the class assembled outside of the wooden door in the dank dungeons and hermione suddenly sensing that the potions hallway was not a good place to be caught off guard because of her tiredness tried her best to keep her eyes open she slumped against the wall and lily was next to her chatting unconcernedly with another gryffindor there was the group of slytherins that hermione hated across the hall lucius malfoy snape mcnair the lestranges and the others she d rather not mention to herself they were whispering with a sort of maliciousness glancing with a dark glee at hermione every few seconds she made it a task to glare at them threateningly severus snape smirked at her a sly look looming on his face hermione twisted her face into a snarl at him and then turned to lily and started talking wanting to focus her attention elsewhere because she had a scared feeling in the pit of her stomach the door opened and the class started filing in dont go to your regular seats professor hull barked they all grumbled knowing well what was coming and assembled themselves in an orderly fashion against the wall hull pulled out a sheet of paper from her desk and stood in front of the class now the headmaster has made it clear that you two houses are the worst at getting along and he wants companionship he suggested for my upcoming project that partners will be house opposites there was a loud protest of fury i not working with a stupid gryffindor a slytherin over my dead body i aintsitting with some stupid gryffin git they ll pour the ruddy potion on me if i partnered with one of them enough hull bellowed the class was instantly quiet you will be partnered with a house opposite any objections and you get an instant detention nobody moved good now let see let have potter and avery james scoffed and moved his stuff and sat down glaring daggers at the slytherin who was doing the same evans and mcnair lily gave a badly suppressed whine and mcnair snickered as malfoy and snape nudged him whispering lupin and snape hermione smiled sympathetically at remus for he looked extremely angry and forlorn however it was hermione turn next lewis and hmm hermione heart started racing a slytherin she was going to be paired with a slytherin there were plenty of them left what were the chances she would be paired with malfoy hull voice rang out apparently the chances were not in her favor that day hermione dragged her stuff and shoved them down on the table and put her head in her hands as malfoy sat down next to her a pleased smirk on his face as the rest of her friends were paired off with the snakes why him of all people hermione thought angrily he a stupid git and he going to treat me the way his son does however as the rest of the class was grudgingly paired and the professor explained the potion and the ingredients and everything that had to be done lucius had not said a single word to her the entire time it was when they were both silently measuring ingredients that he spoke to her so lewis he said out of the corner of his smirking mouth hermione threw him a dirty look how are you and the beast getting along apparently he had been watching her and remus avoid each other all week as many others had fine she snapped not that it any of your business he turned looking carefully at her really now for it seems he left you high and dry he drawled smirking maliciously her eyes flashed dangerously i dontknow what you re talking about malfoy she spat his gleeful smirk widened oh i think you do lewis poor you left all alone no longer with him with no one to comfort you as he said it she felt his hand grip her knee and slid up her leg under her skirt her eyes widened take your filthy hands off of me she snarled in an undertone he smirked saying nothing his hand inching closer to an uncomfortable area the next moment she had the blunt knife she was cutting roots with at his throat his hands stopped her skirt was pushed up towards her waist her top inner thigh now warm because of his hand take your hand off of me this instant or i swear to god she pushed the knife against his skin i will slit your throat her voice was in a slow dangerous whisper slowly his hand retreated he kept smirking as if he knew some secret about her she did not feisty lewis that a real turn on in girls if you ask me he whispered coming closer to her she shoved him away you disgust me she snarled the rest of class was silent he had the knowing smirk playing at the corner of his mouth giving her sly looks she forcibly ignored him it was extremely hard to get by in class her anger slowly rising ready to burst at any type of comment lucius would give her she wanted to punch him so badly but she knew she would get a detention as the class ended hermione was in a very bad mood extremely snappy and she did not want to talk to anyone she gritted her teeth breathing very hard through her nose to keep from screaming at someone preferably lucius and it was causing her more concentration which made her temper even worse hermione walked out next to lily and emma glad to get out of the dungeons her sleepiness completely dissolved from potions what a ruddy kind of pick me up hermione thought angrily as they were halfway down the hall the marauders in front of them someone grabbed hermione above the elbow and spun her around pulling her close she found her face inches from that of lucius malfoy lily and emma turned and stood rooted to the spot in shock remember lewis i always here to comfort you if you ever need it he breathed looking into her eyes lustfully inching closer to her lips however with a sudden burst of anger hermione pushed away from him angrily her lip curling you stupid perverted prat stay away from me she screamed at him everyone in the hallway including the marauders turned to look at her in seconds hermione hand curled into a fist drew back and connected with lucius malfoy nose with incredible strength and he let out a cry of surprise she wanted to show him just how serious she was plus it hadnthelped that she had a hellish day in a wave of fury that was her own creative way of venting her frustration hermione was on top of him and hitting him so angry and so impulsive she didntcare miss lewis professor hull came running out in the hallway shocked at the current actions lily and emma hastily pulled hermione off of malfoy who sat looking stunned on the ground he had a bloody nose and an utterly shocked face however the next moment he flew in a rage at hermione knocking her out of lily and emma arms and to the ground and gave her the same lashing hermione had given him she started screaming and tried to kick him off the potions master was fumbling for her wand and couldntfind it her yells were echoing off the walls james and lily both looked at each other scrambling for their wands hermione was surprised briefly she had always thought james to be quick and prompt when it came to everything especially dueling impedimenta remus voice rang out suddenly lucius for the second time in minutes shouted in surprise as he went flying off into the opposite wall in a burst of light hermione sat stunned and shaking on the floor all the marauders came rushing up to her remus put her arm around her shoulders looking scared brushing the hair out of her face and stopping her nosebleed with a simple spell lily and emma looked over their boyfriend shoulders at hermione jane are you alright remus inquired in a shaky tone she nodded quickly her cheek just below her right eye was throbbing y yeah i f fine my cheek though w what happened to it she asked remus put his arm around her waist and gently pulled her into a standing position and she trembled she had not expected lucius to fight her back since she was a girl apparently to him it didnt matter lucius was now standing hastily wiping the blood gushing out of his nose professor hull was yelling furiously at him james sirius and peter were all smirking at malfoy though james and sirius were being hastily restrained by their girlfriends from attacking lucius attacking a girl malfoy that is so incredibly low and cowardly of you had she not hit you first you would ve been expelled she was flat out screaming at him lucius gave hermione a very dangerous look plainly saying that she was going to pay for what had happened detention fifty points from slytherin she cried fifty lucius yelled in angry astonishment one hundred professor hull barked at him he shut his mouth and glared at the teacher suddenly she turned around and came marching up to hermione hermione cringed against remus turned her head closing her eyes you how dare you attack a fellow classmate for no reason he did absolutely nothing to you it was uncalled for an extremely unladylike a hundred points from gryffindor she screamed at hermione spit flying onto her face hermione suddenly looked angry who cares if it was unladylike i have the right to defend myself hermione screamed back remus tightened the grip on her shoulders muttering in her ear shut up shut up shut up over and over under his breath a week of detention professor hull barked hermione gaped at the professor ready to yell in protest but remus words of caution in her ear made her stop she fell silently back into place against remus while hull glared at her good the mudblood got what she deserved lucius malfoy said loudly to his friends hull turned around a week for you too malfoy now get to your next class x x x hermione by far was having the week from hell she was getting the cold shoulder from a lot of the gryffindors for the loss of a hundred points remus was back to normal by ignoring her though he sometimes smiled sympathetically at her which she was grateful for and she was stuck in detention for a whole entire week with him lucius malfoy thursday went by in a drag whence friday came and slowly passed by lucius merely growled a threat at her in potions and did not talk to her at all from then on lily escorted hermione down to the dungeons knowing that lucius would hurt jane if he caught her off guard and alone that bastard lily growled i cantbelieve him yeah but at least you donthave to serve a week of detention with him hermione said angrily to the redhead lily smiled apologetically true but once i had to serve two nights with snape it was awful lily mused hermione laughed a little and lily grinned lily left hermione once she saw to it that she entered the potions classroom safely when hermione entered she saw that lucius was already there a sour murderous look on his face hermione smirked triumphantly and sat across the room and waited silently for the professor you re going to pay for this lewis came malfoy soft angry voice i ll see to it myself that you do oh now i so scared hermione said sarcastically back to him he smirked good mudblood you have no idea what i ve got waiting for you he hissed his light grey eyes bright with revenge hermione felt a tug of fear pull at her stomach but thought nothing of it good luck to you then you prat hermione hissed lucius did not reply but merely stared at her a hungry vengeful look in his eyes the rest of the five minutes waiting for hull was spent in a tense angry silence as malfoy stared at her and she glared back hermione did not want to imagine the things she would endure from lucius in the future but somewhere in the back of her mind she had a suspicious and nagging knowledge of what he would do something she didntwant to imagine the potions master came in threw them both a dirty look and disappeared into her office for a moment she came back out with what looked like two scrapers that looked like the ones muggles used to get snow off of their car windshields and two heavy duty sponges you will be cleaning out the cauldrons by hand you will not leave until you are done malfoy you do the left three rows and lewis do the right three rows hull instructed in a stern voice if i come in here and catch you fighting again i ll see to it that you both have a months worth of detention and suspension from the headmaster now clean she barked she turned and went into her office leaving malfoy and hermione alone she gave him a warning look before turning and choosing a cauldron to start with feeling his gaze on her momentarily she heard him do likewise and start the tedious task a few hours later hermione was done lucius had finished nearly ten minutes before her and left without a word yet he threw her a malicious look before he disappeared into the night and darkened hallway hermione was glad for it his presence was unnerving scrubbing furiously she managed to get her last cauldron done right after the stroke of midnight her hands were dirty from the rust and she washed her hands in the ice cold water by the sink sighing she gathered up her stuff quiet and content and thinking longingly of her warm bed that she could collapse into when she got back she left the classroom her eyes half closed and yet watching out for corners and stairs so she wouldnttrip she was almost out of the dungeons when she heard footsteps besides her own she stop dead her ears pricked her eyes as wide as possible to see anything in the dark she had been traveling without the light of her wand because she was too tired to retrieve it from her pocket and her eyes were already used to the dark light and the wand would only burn neon shapes in the back of her eye sockets hello hermione called out in a scared voice her woozy body suddenly very sober and alert she fumbled for her wand lumos the bright beam of light cast shadows over the walls as she spun around listening to the soft footsteps coming ever closer her heart was hammering blood pounding in her ears she felt rooted to the spot her sparse hair standing on end all over her body there was no use denying she was scared because she was hermione mind was oddly blank as she looked around in fright suddenly the footsteps stopped curiously enough they stopped right out of the range of light and then something trickled into her brain malfoy he was the one who promised her revenge the one who was going to scare her how could she not remember that malfoy i should ve known hermione spat in disgust her heart leapt in fear as lucius lit up his own wand yards from her he pointed the bright beam of light at her and she was forced to shield her eyes you sounded so scared lewis malfoy said softly taking carefully steps to her subconsciously she edged backwards for every one of his steps you sounded frightened and of what his question was dripping with soft dangerous sarcasm hermione swallowed her fear go away she yelled at him she realized how stupid it sounded lucius kept moving closer and closer to her coming quickly she took a step back and her back hit the wall lucius took it to his advantage to pounce on her he suddenly jumped at her and shoved her against the wall holding her throat tightly in his hand his face inches from hers she gasped for breath her eyes wide and his lip curled certainly not lewis you were afraid of me he snarled he lifted his free hand to her cheek and started stroking it gently something that scared hermione more than his anonymous footsteps he looked deeply into her eyes his cold grey eyes narrowed a smirk playing at his lips hermione fought desperately to break from his grip she couldntbreath pity you re a mudblood lewis he said in mock sorrow releasing her throat a little she gulped in welcoming air all that beauty gone to waste on a disgusting creature hermione suddenly realized what he was talking about and what he was going to do slowly his lips left a ghost of a kiss on hers as he murmured quietly but you ll never tell will you because you know what i would do to you lewis she was terrified frozen in shock even if she had been able to move she couldnthave gotten away from him she was pinned in such a way that she could not move her arms or legs for his body prevented it and then holding her tightly against the wall he pressed his mouth to her with such sudden ferocity that she gasped he took the opportunity to thrust his tongue into her mouth she let out a cry of fear that rose up into her throat as she thrashed around trying to get away from him his free hand raked through her hair and gripped her scalp so cruelly that she knew there would be marks hermione let out another cry trying with all her might to get away from him she was running out of breath and she hoped he was too then she would be able to scream for help in one quick motion lucius pulled back taking a deep breath as he prepared to plunge back again when she screamed help her frantic cry echoed the hallway and his mouth clamped on hers cut her off suddenly and then for the second time that day lucius malfoy went flying off of hermione and into the opposite wall impedimenta she recognized it immediately as the voice of remus lupin malfoy tumbled into the opposite wall and hermione was suddenly pulled away from the wall and under a silvery cloak remus put a hand over her mouth as she screamed from his sudden hands and shaking as much as she was took it off hermione was shaking very badly she buried her face into his shoulder and without giving malfoy a second thought remus gently guided her up the hallway towards the gryffindor tower they were halfway up the stairs when hermione finally stopped crying that was by far the scariest encounter she had ever lived through and she felt humiliated remus had a comforting arm around her she sniffed wiping her eyes and nose w why were you down there hermione asked him finally she sniffed again running her hands over her cheeks and wiping them clear of tears well i was going to the kitchens and i remembered you had the detention and i thought you would want someone to walk back with the castle is rather creepy at night remus answered without a moment hesitation hermione noted faintly how he was shoving the invisibility cloak into his own cloak you re too kind hermione laughed feeling a little light hearted and nearly free of the burden of a memory that included lucius he gave her a small grin god i ve had the worst bloody week hermione said suddenly malfoy is a git and now he my bloody partner for potions i have a weeks worth of detentions and no one is talking to me because i lost gryffindor a hundred points and all this stupid homework and newt arentuntil june hermione cried remus patted her back sympathetically and to make everything worse she started in a quiet voice she felt his body stiffen he knew what she was going to say you ve been avoiding me all week he was quiet for a few moments jane i was just just confused i guess when we went to hogsmeade i just i dunno whatever clicked between us wasntwhat i was expecting and i didntknow what to make out of it and none of the remarks from prongs and padfoot or wormtail made it any better he kept silent for a few minutes when you came here at the beginning of december i really really liked you more than just a friend hogsmeade sure i guess was my intention of a date but the feeling i got wasntthat it was more like you re my best boy friend instead of my boyfriend hermione interjected quietly exactly remus agreed that what i told lily and emma hermione said looking at remus that i didntlike you anymore than a friend after hogsmeade his eyes widened i told my mates that too of course they gave you skeptical looks and didnt believe you she said smiling slightly he grinned read my mind he laughed she smiled however much it was breaking her heart to tell him this it was for the better good remus i want us to be friends really good friends because knowing you would be a waste if we weren t hermione said he smiled at her i think the same that night when hermione got to bed after remus departed and went into the boy dormitory she collapsed onto her bed just as she planned to hermione mind was teeming with thoughts she had done the right thing and stopped the relationship with remus before it even happened and started a new friendship with him it was for the better but hermione felt very sad because of it she was giving up a romantic comfort for her she suddenly wished she were back with ron and harry she would put all logic aside and tell ron her feelings straight up whether it meant or gaining a boyfriend or losing a friend x x x author note alright i hope you guys liked that chapter i know it been an extremely long time and i sincerely sorry i really mean it i ever so sorry heh i a suck up can you tell thank you laine for beta ing this for me thanks you guys please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter just a few characters in this plot if you read harry potter books you know who i talking about then ok on with the story still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter six words from an enemy hermione granger after her little incident with malfoy and remus saving her found out that after that night things were steadily getting worse she had put a plug in her and remus relationship so that it wouldnt blossom into something non platonic so it was just merely good friendship and that caused a devastating blow to her heart she knew she was doing the wrong thing her heart said as much but at the same time she was doing the right thing her brain assured her that she was hermione was so torn between head and heart that she didntknow which way to turn lily and emma noticed her anxiousness and worry soon as soon as saturday morning at breakfast but hermione assured them that she simply didntget a wink of sleep and after a while when she stuck firmly to her story they left her alone breakfast was horrible remus although he sat diagonally from her next to peter and chatting with frank longbottom did not speak to her directly although they did make eye contact once or twice disgusted by her own misery she smiled at him whenever she got the chance and acted as happily as she could around her friends the day passed without incident really and hermione found herself slowly dozing off on the gryffindor common room couch after lunch and before it too while lily james sirius and emma played exploding snap and remus flipped hurriedly almost frantically through a charms book muttering to himself almost everyone was off at hogsmeade having to go christmas shopping and hermione thought rather grumpily that back in 1978 the hogwarts school got way more hogsmeade trips hermione lied on her stomach and gazed into the fire momentarily thinking about what to get for all of her friends that she made because james was so much like harry she would get him something quidditch related sirius she thought carefully he like fred and george so maybe something from zonko s hermione smiled knowing she would find the perfect choice in that particular store for peter she guessed she would have to get him something although the two really hadntspoken two words to each other maybe maybe something for his studies she knew exactly what to get a reverse fact parchment in order to use it you wrote the subject of the course on the paper and had someone else write down numerous facts on the paper then because of its charm it would make questions sometimes rather tricky ones and have the person study them answer hermione had found it quite useful in her sixth year for emma and lily she would have to get something girlish but not too much so maybe for lily she would the something she has spotted in a trinket shop called matilda trinkets she could get a sort of necklace or bracelet for her maybe a mood one that even spoke though hermione secretly knew herself that lily would silence the ring in a moment for emma she would get something that was in and the newest thing edible notes they came in a variety of assorted colors and the paper tasted like whatever color the paper was you could write notes on them and make them into paper airplanes and send them to whoever she wanted too because hermione has noticed emma was a bit like parvati and lavender a gossiper maybe just because the notes didntseem enough she would throw in an eagle quill to write the notes with the only person left was remus hermione felt her throat suddenly close up and her mouth go dry what could she possibly get remus that he would really enjoy from her hermione found herself in a desperate state one that she would rather not ask for help from anyone figuring gloomily that she wouldntget anywhere she plastered a cheery smile on her face stood from the couch and stretched luxuriously pulling her calf muscles for her leg had fallen asleep she said well i guess i going to go into hogsmeade to do some christmas shopping i ll see you guys later i ll be back by dinner hermione promised they all absentmindedly nodded quickly she darted upstairs and retrieved her cloak and her book bag stowing her money and her wand in an easy accessible pocket before she descend back down the winding staircase she waved a goodbye and silently head out for hogsmeade a sad reminiscent look on her face as she suddenly remembered harry and ron and remus x x x now what should i get for him hermione asked herself as she pushed her way through the crowded cold winded streets of hogsmeade pressing her nose against glass and looking for the ultimate present for remus lupin the cold bitter wind bit at her face and made her shiver however warm her cloak was her cheeks were high and rosy her usually bright auburn eyes particularly dead at the moment as she remembered remus and what she could never have never enjoy she drew her cloak around her tighter despite the fact that it couldntwarm her now cold lifeless heart hermione clutched the bags to her side possessively as she walked down the snowy streets it seemed that a permanent scowl had occupied her face for the day and she found herself quite obviously in a miserable mood it began to snow rather heavily and people pushed and scrambled to get into the warm atmosphere of the three broomsticks or honeydukes and other welcoming cozy atmosphere hermione knew she didnt deserve that because it would put everyone else in a rotten mood when the trickle of people reduced to a minimum she selected a building to lean on and slowly sat down on the ground hugging her knees to her chest and looking up at the snowy sky with a lost forlorn look on her face would she ever get a chance at love slowly she stood back up and decided nothing would be gained by sitting and moping on a street corner she dejectedly started her walk back to the castle unaware that she had been watched closely the entire time x x x jane do you want an escort down to detention hermione found herself stopped as she made her way out of the portrait hole lily evans was smiling at her and walking towards her and hermione thought why not and politely thanked lily and the two girls walked down to the slytherin dungeons hermione listened with a deaf ear as lily talked casually about everything she had done that day letting hermione add into the conversation with a simple nod or a smile while lily went on about homework james christmas break presents james her past holiday vacations and some ways she d like to spend the upcoming ones and did she mention james lily smiled in a sisterly fashion forcing hermione to smile happily back as she pushed open the dungeon door hermione closed it silently and a sad frown once again dominated her features like the night before she and lucius had to scrub away at the cauldrons by hand which had been re used by the fourth years and stay until they were clean the pale eyed slytherin was already there scrubbing furiously and muttering something about work only fit for house elves and mudbloods hermione frowned at his comment and picked up a sponge and started working he threw her a glance smirked and muttered she right in her place hermione hated with a passion working alongside lucius malfoy even if they did not interact but she still despised him so very much she noticed that the sly smirk never left his face and whenever they were facing each other he flat out stared at her giving her a dominant look as if as if he knew something that she did not and it turns out that he did remus was there to escort her back thanks to lily and emma he mentioned and she smiled graciously and walked beside him back up to the gryffindor tower lucius threw remus a dirty look and muttered filthy beast remus glared at the back of his head and after a moment he and hermione walked back up to the tower chatting like old friends and both of them ignoring the tension between them x x x each day hermione but on a brilliant fa ade of absolute beaming cheeriness that no one seemed to be able to look through hermione was strangely proud of herself she had fooled everyone or so she thought the weekend flew by and so did the week christmas vacation was drawing near and the upcoming friday would signify the start of vacation and also and most importantly to her her last detention with lucius she found that whenever in the same room with him whether they were a mere desk away or a full classroom apart he always had his eyes on her watching her like she was prey that he was just itching to attack although hermione found this just slightly creepy actually a hell of a lot more than slightly she ignored him glared at him scoffed at him and turned her attention elsewhere he wasntworth it she guessed that the only encounter really noticeable that she had with him was wednesday during potions class they were working silently and his gaze slid onto her whenever he had a singular free moment even if it was just for that long remus and snape were working on lucius right side and not for the first time that week they started arguing and got into a fist fight both lucius and hermione watched on with a sort of apprehension both their reasons clearly different the rest of the class held its breath as professor hull rounded on them both another fight she screeched at them remus winced and hermione suddenly had the urge to hug and comfort him i dontknow what this will take to stop enough of this nonsense i switching your partners she bellowed at them both remus and snape tried desperately to contain their joy fuming mad and sending them clearly seething looks she picked up her clipboard and her eyes ran down the list she would have to break up another pair if she wanted cooperation between them she would either have to get a girl girl team if she wanted real torture for each of them but in the end she settled with breaking a regular team snape work with longbottom there was an audible groan from frank team and lupin work with sanders no more fighting or i ll see to it myself that you re both expelled remus and snape hastened to get with their new partners snape walked angrily across the room and sat down next to frank and an extremely attractive girl got up and walked smiling over to remus like many of the other boys he gaped at her this girl rose sanders hermione heard the first name whispered around was absolutely beautiful she had long ebony locks that fell to her elbows golden streaks through her hair she had a slender figure and a creamy complexion and dark dark eyes that glittered she had a perfect beaming smile as she shyly grinned at him and sat down next to him offering her name and a handshake she was beautiful perfect a slytherin hermione also noticed and fairly quickly too that remus got along pretty well with this girl and was talking nonstop to her in a flirtatious way she noted furiously and they seemed awfully attracted to each other hermione gazed at the couple silently fuming over lucius shoulder who was gazing at her jealous livid expression with a knowing look on his face when she finally tore her away from remus and that cow lucius caught her gaze his smirk was very taunting his silver eyes dancing with malicious delight his gaze on her hungry and suggestive she knew what he was thinking get payback on him with me lewis she knew what he wanted and she found herself disgusted because she gave it a split second thought on actually doing it she glared at lucius and went back to her potion x x x detention that night was anything but pretty hermione watched with thoroughly jealous eyes as rose casually pulled remus out of the great hall before dinner from his friends to talk to him for a moment rose eyes landed on hermione for a moment and hermione could ve sworn she saw triumph remus came back into the hall with a bit of a blush creeping up on his cheeks as she smiled at him and walked back to her table because hermione was sitting so that she was facing the slytherin table she saw rose sit down next to lucius say something and throw her head back in a dervish laugh as his mouth curled into a smirk and suddenly he looked up and hermione eyes locked with his she found herself totally rigid in her seat unable to move or breathe as he gazed into her eyes with one final glance he flicked his eyebrows up at her in an almost intimidating gesture seething now she glared at her plate and moodily stabbed her potatoes as the time for her detention came along again remus who was in an awfully good mood offered to walk her to her detention finding that she couldntrefuse the time with him no matter how loudly her head scream no no no no no she accepted with a gracious smile and walked down the corridor with him talking lightly even though she knew the answer would break her heart she asked him a question burning at the back of her mind what put you in such a good mood today hermione asked feigning curiosity she longed to spit out the question in disgust but she would never do such a thing remus smiled blushing you know that slytherin girl rose sanders hermione made a confirming grunt well she kind of err asked me out to hogsmeade oh her head was spinning and her heart was thumping so loudly that she thought remus could hear it too that bitch asked him out instantly hermione was internally livid and screaming at remus but she merely replied happily that lovely remus grinned at her and then looked at the floor he swallowed and cleared his throat uncomfortably and breathed deeply for a moment before looking at her again he had a very serious look on his face and for a moment her breath stopped i never answered her jane he said it quietly looking her straight in the eye as they descended the staircase to the dungeon i i i guess i wanted to talk to you about it first hermione most embarrassing mortifying and uncomfortable moment had been back in sixth year when she was caught by malfoy the stupid ferret sneaking into the restricted section getting a detention for it and then screaming at ron because he heard a different rumor about it i did not snog a book causing everyone to look at her in sniggers and bewilderment and she had positively fled the hall crying from shame and humiliation however now would probably be the second to worst because it was the most horrifying situation she had found herself in for a while remus was asking her if he could go on a date with another girl how could she say no to him hermione felt like crying and beating the living hell out of both remus and herself for causing this situation if she hadntasked she wouldnthave a second most mortifying moment despite the fact that she wanted to do anything but hermione knew what she was going to say even before she did remus say yes to her she a nice girl pretty even though she a slytherin and she really seems to like you bring her to the three broomsticks or something and get to know her i think you may regret it if you don t really remus seemed absolutely ecstatic his eyes flashed in eagerness and on the spur of the moment he grabbed hermione into a hug she was completely in bliss his cologne was intoxicating sweeping her mind away from her body and snatching her senses from her soul her knees threatened to give way beneath her and when she felt remus let go of her she was in hell i i just wanted to ask you if it was alright because because well you know remus said awkwardly hermione gave a faint smile that did not reach her now cold eyes go with her remus have fun her voice sounded enthusiastic and cheerful but inside she was crying remus smiled gratefully i just wanted to make sure she smiled wider and turned slightly so she could gaze at the floor she noticed the potion classroom door oh there the classroom thanks for walking me down here she called over her shoulder as she walked in anytime hermione pressed her ear to the door thanking merlin a million times that lucius wasntthere yet and listened sharply until remus footsteps died away when they finally did hermione slumped against the door her throat closing up and refusing to let her breathe her eyes swimming in tears before she randomly picked a desk and started sobbing in her arms hermione was furious with herself she could have easily said that rose was a slut and she wasnta very good match for remus but no oo she had to say all those nice fluffy things about the little bint she wanted so bad to run and grab remus and kiss him and tell him that that rose girl was nothing and she hermione loved remus so badly love no hermione chided herself not love just just a strong fancy is all hermione knew little of love and only thought she had only approached it when she realized how much she really liked ron and that was a lot hermione also knew that she had like many other girls second classed the word and it didntmean a thing love love was a word tossed carelessly around like some helium less balloon that kept on coming back to frizz someone hair up with static electricity it was a mere word that girls insisted on giggling about at night something hermione found extremely annoying and never ever used it in a logical sense so why had she done something like that just moments ago this caused her to just sob harder tears streaming down her face as her shoulders shuddered along with the rest of her body it hadnt been exactly the easiest thing to do when she convinced everyone that she was happy and cheerful and completely independent at least almost everyone it was enormous stress on hermione and she hated doing it but she wouldntlet anyone take the pain away from her because she deserved it she couldnt mess up the future or it would be absolutely horrid the fact that she had already messed up the future caused her to cry even harder she hated everything about herself right then but worst of all even to herself she wanted to hurt remus really hurt him she wanted him to make him feel the torment she was feeling when she watched him talking joking laughing smiling doing anything with another girl especially rose he really had no idea she sort of almost kinda resented fancying him because of it her crying slowly softened to a sniffle when she felt a gentle hand stroking the top of her hand she didnthave to look up to know who it was a curly lock of her hair was coiled lazily around his finger for a moment before he stopped and laid a hand on her shoulder what are you crying over lewis his voice was uncharacteristically gentle and soothing although she hated lucius malfoy she found his voice at the moment calming and very oddly welcoming very reluctantly for she knew she would regret it she raised her head from her damp sleeved arms she tried to remind herself before she got lost in his entrancing silver eyes that this was the bloke that pinned her against the wall and shoved his tongue down her throat but when she looked up at him sitting on the desk and smirking down at her his hand lightly squeezing her shoulder she couldnt remember anything horrible about him at all lucius irresistibly reminded her of draco his pale pointed face and although she wouldntadmit it under wand point beautiful and captivating silver eyes both of them had the same white blonde hair slicked back and falling down to the cheekbone and for some odd reason lucius left his hair fall naturally something draco tried once and she still loved the memory got laughed at from the majority of the school for but and as much as she hated to admit it right now she had thought then draco did look kind of cute with his hair falling in face like that just as lucius did lucius smirked down at her and slowly wiped the tears from her stained cheeks with the back of his hand he put his hand under her chin and lifted her head until she met his eyes forget about that animal lewis he nothing lucius assured her his smirk suggestive and taunting at the same time her eyes welled up in tears again but this time out of pure anger she stood up angrily and shoved his hand away his words breaking the spell of trust she had in him moments ago you re such an arrogant prat you know that she spat he smirked his eyes glittering as she starting getting worked up you think you re so smart and you can get every bloody girl in this damned school guess again malfoy i hate your guts and i dont know why you insist on pursuing and muggle born you disgust me and i hate you her eyes were flashing dangerously and her face was flushed it was a miracle that hull didnthear them fighting lucius slid off the desk and took a casual step towards her his hands in his pockets he quirked an eyebrow at her and hermione nostrils flared in anger he took his hand out of his pocket and unhurriedly dragged a finger lightly over her jaw line she slapped his hand away you re awfully sexy when you re mad lewis he said taking another step towards her his eyes dark with lust his voice was a deep purr as if he was trying to seduce her when hermione realized this she burst out laughing he looked highly affronted as her laughter bellowed through the room wiping away a tear from the corner of her eye she said wow malfoy you re awfully cheesy she smirked at him as he looked suddenly furious she walked over to her row of cauldrons thoroughly pleased with herself she picked up the sponge and picked a cauldron to start on she knew lucius was standing there fuming as he thought of something to throw back at her a few minutes of silence and she secretly thought yeah i won he hadntresponded yet and for the first time in a while she happily scrubbed away at the dirtied cauldron so have you finally gotten over the beast all happiness vanished from her suddenly she couldntbreathe and her body was cold and miserable once again i dontknow what you re talking about she replied coldly without looking at him he scoffed please lewis i ve seen the way you ve been watching him her heart hammered against her chest and i ve seen the way you act when everyone watching you you re a filthy miserable mess you re just putting on a show he sneered rounding on him she whipped around what it matter to you she hissed her eyes reduced to slits he laughed sardonically and put down his sponge and walked around the isles until he was standing in front of her she glared at him he smirked triumphantly at her oh it matters plenty to me something obviously going to happen to you if dear old remus actually finds happiness and you re left in the dust seeing her anger and fear in her eyes he grinned maliciously i dontknow why you do it lewis he continued on putting up such an act for everyone it doesntfool anyone he laughed again and looked deeply into her eyes tilting his head forward slightly or at least not me his voice was suddenly deep again much more menacing then before hermione was entranced and unnerved at the same time she watched with helpless wide eyes as he strode forward and gripped both her arms tightly his face hovering in front of her you cantfool me lewis you ll never be able too his eyes were narrowed and his voice deep and rather menacing again i can see right through you you re jealous of rose and you hate yourself for letting him go on a date with her how did you find out about that she demanded harshly he laughed softly his pale eyes glittering rose told me all about it i told her flat out i think it disgusting she in love with the gryffindor but she wontbe persuaded i have better thing to do than make her ditch him the slytherin girls will force her into it he said offhandedly before gripping her arms rather tightly again hermione eyes were wide with fear love she in love with him she squeaked he grinned wickedly sad isntit hermione gaped at him no no no her mind screamed if if remus fell in love with this girl then than she d be alone her heart hammered as she thought desperately of any way to delay or destroy their relationship because chances were remus would be hurt by this girl or worse he might fall in love with her too sensing her fear and envy lucius smirked jealous are we he purred she suddenly remembered she was being clutched by him and she ripped away from him no she spat glaring he laughed softly again smirking knowingly at her i find he said rather thoughtfully that revenge is a very good way to get what i want he smirked at her again and she knew that his statement was hinting at something what exactly are you implying malfoy she hissed he chuckled strolling towards her in a casual fashion leaning down towards her face he smirked you know exactly what i implying he reached up to touch her face again and she went to slap him but he caught her wrist she inhaled sharply let go of me her statement trembled slightly and he brought his face closer to hers and she pulled back fear etched over her face you think about it lewis he said softly the smirk off his face and she saw he was dead serious he ll be dating a slytherin there only one way to counter that with equal force do the same thing and be with someone he hates more than you hate rose hermione knew that all lucius wanted from her was a good shag and she was disgusted bullocks she spat i d never date a slytherin least the likes of you lucius laughed quietly and slid his hand to the nape of her neck and she struggled away from him but he still had a powerful grip on her arms he pulled her closer tilting his head so close to her that if she inhale sharply their lips would ve touched i know you ll rethink that jane this left a thoroughly confused and fuming hermione to deal with her cauldrons as lucius smirking smugly walked away x x x hermione was absolutely furious with herself that whole detention not only did she manage to waste a lot of her time that she could ve cleaned out two cauldrons but the conversation she had with lucius kept ringing through her head like a broken record he ll be dating a slytherin there only one way to counter that with equal force forget that hermione thought inwardly i would never do such a thing it like dating malfoy to be with ron which is exactly something you ve thought about isntit asked a cynical snide voice in the back of her mind no she snapped back immediately i wouldntever do something like that that an ultimate and a disgusting way to betray my own house my own friends my morals and everything about me but said the voice as it argued hermione gritted her teeth and scrubbed the cauldron she was working on harder that was when you were in fourth or fifth year you re a big girl now other people are doing it parvati and lavender both slept with malfoy you know that and what about remus he is going to be dating a slytherin that ultimate betrayal in your eyes not his so why is everything you re thinking out of date people do it all the time yes but i not one of those people now am i hermione snapped inwardly i believe in staying true to myself and my house and my friends even when your friends and your house dontstay true to you it asked slyly what the bloody hell are you talking about hermione asked herself bewildered you know remus and rose peter and becoming a death eater all those things you saw them you know them sirius has a brother in slytherin lily has slytherin friends but of course they re the loner ones but it still a house betrayal hermione found herself lost for words oh bugger off half the things they canteven help hermione retorted finally and you canteven help yourself and for once hermione found that her conscience was not a very good thing to consent to in the time of trouble soon enough hermione was done with her cauldrons and washing her hands off in the ice cold jet at the sink in the front of the classroom like most times lucius had finished earlier and had already left sending her a smirk before he strutted out of the classroom hermione stared at the closed door for a second thinking and then thought better of it she didntwant to start arguing with herself again she pushed open the door and slowly started walking towards the staircase her mind buzzing with thoughts she knew lucius was an ass that only wanted her in bed but why was her real question she was a muggle born a mudblood surely he didnt want to associate with her a gryffindor it didntstop draco did it asked the voice again hermione smacked her forehead rather forcefully i going to end up in saint mungo s she muttered talking to myself like this hermione slowed to a stop at the end of the hallway pulling out her wand and sighing she planned to meet remus here again another thing she particularly didntwant to deal with but she knew she had too and she sighed and slumped against the wall lumos she jumped startled out of her wits as another wand lit up a good ten feet away from her and slowly walked towards her although fear crept up in her throat in a horrible bile her heart hammering hermione wasntall that surprised what do you want hermione spat at him clenching her fists and groping for her wand in her pocket lucius merely smirked at her and took a few cautious steps forward so that because of his longer arms he could reach out and touch her but she would merely swing at air he lifted his hand up and put it underneath her chin raising her eye level her eyes reduced to slits as he moved forward again not a fear that she might physically hurt him all i want you to do is think about what i said lewis he purred smirking still her lips curled in a snarl ready to retort a second later he leaned down and put his lips to her briefly although long enough for it to be clarified as a real kiss he stepped backwards and marveled with a smug look at the utterly stunned look on her face goodnight jane and he walked away x x x what what happened lily demanded as hermione finally stepped into the dormitory and sat down in her bed her face pale and thunderstruck hermione looked up at lily and then at emma who were both by her side and urging frantically for her to speak she opened her mouth emitting a low shuddering sound before swallowing and finding her voice in a mere whisper lucius malfoy just kissed me goodnight x x x author notes ok so did you all like that i terribly sorry for the really long wait but i had lots of things to do and i think this chapter opens a whole new window to possibilities i can say i love writing for lucius character it so fun so do any of you know why he so interested in this muggle born other than sex i still trying to decide what it is but i have a pretty good idea like always please review disclaimer i do not own any of the harry potter characters i do own a few fictional characters but that alright okay so let start still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter seven christmas surprises hermione did not get a wink of sleep that night she was consumed by the thought of what had happened with lucius malfoy horrified to know that it had actually happened how could he press his lips against her how could a man so prejudice against her kind willingly kiss a muggleborn how could he contaminate himself wasnthe the father of an equally as biased son at this thought hermione sat upright in her bed what if she had something to do with draco prejudice forehead beaded in sweat she lied back down and swallowed the fear in her throat not only did she have to tread carefully for her own future but she had to tread carefully on others as well if she had any influence in draco malfoy whatsoever hermione rolled over in her bed just wanting to go home she had been in 1979 for about three weeks and it was already overwhelming and upsetting there was nothing recognizable here nothing that she could fall back on or call familiar though she was intelligent and driven even hermione granger could be pulled under by the stress turning over in her bed she stared at lily peaceful sleeping figure tearing up at the knowledge that the redhead would be murdered in due time but regardless of her situation lily was always peaceful at heart hermione wished she could be just as calm but the unknown of this future was insidious ruining everything she had built to protect her the very walls hermione had built against ron childish emotions were breaking down at the very thought of remus there was no denying that she fancied him but there was no feasible way they could be together without creating disaster it was wrong she was wrong and remus was wrong and lucius was wrong but that did not stop her heart no matter what hermione wanted nothing more than to keep logical and intelligent in each situation but moment by moment she was becoming just the opposite lucius idea of revenge was working its way into her head and despite the fact that he made her skin crawl it might equate to being with remus and that was the only thing she truly wanted x x x the next day hermione entered the great hall with a mountain of books piled in her arm happy that they were able to distract her she knew that trying to figure out this situation in one sitting would never happen so she took on more work to help occupy her fretful mind though she promised herself many times that she would not dwell on remus and that she would not give consideration to lucius offer she found that any free moment was spent thinking about them it was horrible to have such thoughts on her mind but hermione did not know how to go one otherwise later that night hermione asked remus to escort her down to detention hoping that she could talk to him about rose and appear as happy as possible happiness was always important she reasoned even if it was not meant for her rumor has it you ve got a new girlfriend hermione informed him after they had their bit of small talk remus flushed but nodded unofficially i suppose where are you bringing her for the next hogsmeade weekend hermione asked trying to sound as enthusiastic as she could probably puddifoot s but i not sure either way i sure she ll appreciate it hermione said supportively she sighed aloud wondering how this would ever work out err jane if you dontmind me asking who told you she was my girlfriend i remember telling you that we were going to hogsmeade but he trailed off looking uncomfortable malfoy hermione said at last with a grimace couldnthelp repeating the fact that all the slytherin girls want her to break it off immediately even though she said she really rates you hermione was surprised at his frown expecting him to be happy with her words malfoy told you yes hermione confirmed confused they re friends remus friends talk rose said one of her friends kept telling her to ask me out if malfoy wontstop talking about it it just makes me think that he the one but it just doesntmake any sense he finished neither does his twisted attraction to me hermione deadpanned disgusted by this fact it is rather strange remus agreed i just thought that perhaps malfoy was using her to i dontknow get to me hermione chuckled uncomfortably at how very true hi words were before she caught his eyes just in that singular moment hermione felt everything inside her shatter to pieces how could she be standing here lying to his face about her true feelings about rose and about lucius when all she wanted to do was kiss him i have to go now hermione blurted turning quickly away from him oh well alright remus answered from behind her dashing off without another word hermione left him standing alone in the corridor her heart plagued by guilt and confusion flinging the door open she glowered at lucius malfoy he was balancing himself in a chair and sporting a smug grin as if he were the king of hogwarts you vile monster hermione hissed rose is just using him remus has nothing to do with this you mean with my twisted attraction to you lucius purred hermione flushed scarlet but glared at him still no you re right he had nothing to do with this rose has an actual attraction to him but it just so happens to work out in my favor that we are doing each other a favor oh hermione asked scathingly and what might that be destroying an innocent person heart malfoy leaned forward in his chair and with a sudden smack the chair hit the ground startled hermione froze as malfoy approached her silver eyes gleaming with triumph once more all i want is information my dear mudblood he purred stepping closer to her rigid body and i want to get to know you and your past present and future x x x the next detention went smoothly and silently though paranoia had started to invade all of her senses each swish of a cloak each snap of a book hermione jumped fearful that lucius might be there though she wanted it to be so malfoy wording in the last detention was no coincidence where he acquired the information hermione was uncertain but she knew for sure that somehow lucius malfoy knew but even when she turned to glare at him to bark a retort he said nothing and did nothing but watch her the way his silver eyes were glued to her body taking in each miniscule movement remembering each flicker of fingers and each turn of her head put her on edge he was a wolf a vicious monster meticulously stalking down his prey then to her enormous relief christmas vacation was upon them and lucius malfoy went home she was alone for two weeks of freedom from his invasive eyes and instead had to deal with remus and the thought of his new girlfriend there were only a few more days until christmas and today was a hogsmeade weekend remus and rose had left very early while hermione had kept vigil in the library trying desperately to write an essay without stopping if she did stop she knew there would only be thoughts of remus and rose on her mind finally she could not stand it checking the hour first she knew that soon all of her friends would be returning from hogsmeade perhaps if she saw the couple together she could determine if rose was really worth the trouble both for remus and herself making her way down to the entrance hall hermione waited patiently as her friends arrived one by one lily and james were first holding hands james bent to tie his shoe while lily shoved a snowball down the back of his shirt shrieking with laughter sirius came next with a proud look on his face carrying a squirming emmaline over his shoulder and lastly came to the two people that had occupied her mind all day one for the better and one for the worse remus looked extremely handsome his sharp eyes were shining in laughter his cheeks flushed his normally neat sandy hair was falling gracefully over his eyes his thick winter cloak was unfastened at the neck so his dark blue jumper stood out and made his neck look more prominent than before his broad shoulders here hugged by the thick material as well has his arms with hands hidden deep inside his pockets everything about him was defined sharp and wonderful she had never seen him so beautiful rose pretty as ever was a perfect complement to remus in that very moment she was slim where he was strong soft where he was sharp and light where he was dark hermione hated it but she watched on hidden by the pillar she was leaning against then as she realized their hands were intertwined inside his pockets an uncomfortable lump rose in her throat she stared as a snowflake landed on the perfect cheek of the perfect girl and in a moment so excruciating to watch saw how remus brushed it away ever so gently before leaning in to kiss her hermione turned and ran from the scene hot blinding tears were threatening to burst from her eyes as she as fast as she could to wherever she could finally when she knew she was alone hermione sank down to the floor and cried what had she done to deserve this she could not truly control her emotions nor could she control the future but it seemed as if the entire world were against her all she wanted was to be happy to be with remus and she had shunned that away though she had wanted him more than anything else she had tried her best in being nice to him in defending him and in being consistent with him regardless of situation she tried to be the best she could for him but nothing would work this was too much she realized this stress of staying neutral staying observant and not proactive staying platonic and not emotion was too much to bear she could not have remus as a friend just as she could not have lucius any less than an enemy she could not save lily and james nor could she warn sirius nor could she stop peter there was nothing she could do although she wanted to do everything to fix everything all she wanted now more than ever was simplicity she wanted ron his awkward yet undeniable feelings and his crude sense of humor she wanted harry who was loyal and predictable and trouble and she wanted ginny reliable and motherly and fierce as her brothers she wanted home but she feared that she would never get it x x x christmas vacation was flying by in both a whirlwind of colors and heavy snowflakes trying her best to either remain busy or feign cheeriness hermione continued her faulty regime of keeping her mind of remus or any people that would remind her of the werewolf on christmas eve lily and emma wouldntlet her stay in the library despite her best attempts to fight them off there was a party in the common room that would rage on the whole night they promised and the muggleborn simply had to come while the gryffindors enjoyed their night in a rambunctious manner hermione found herself staying at the fringe of the giant party quite happy to watch james and sirius make fools of themselves while lily and emma laughed along her brown eyes roamed the room spotting people exchanging christmas presents and against her better judgment she thought of remus again what could she get for him now there was no object that could sum up how she felt for him nor was there anything that could do justice to how highly she held their friendship it had to be something unique and perfect just as he was then in a flash an idea crossed her mind hermione dashed up to the dormitory and snatched up something precious from her trunk that she had forgotten about until this very moment pleased with herself and wishing to get this moment out of the way hermione returned to the common room to seek out remus hoping to simply shove the present in his hands just as she stepped into the party remus appeared at her side as if she had bellowed his name remus hermione blurted surprised i i was just looking for you ah good timing then he said they stood there silently for a moment the noise of the party surrounding them finally remus said i hate parties do you want to go for a walk or something erm sure hermione agreed wishing that they could stay inside the common room at least the noise could fill the tension between them together they slipped out of the portrait hole and behind them music laughter and noise was concealed behind the fat lady where to hermione asked once they were alone i fond of stars want to go to the astronomy tower the girl could hardly believe her ears the astronomy tower was famous for many promiscuous things in the night then again perhaps that tradition hadntstarted yet they walked in silence and hermione contemplated the meaning of his words wondering if he was aware that couples frequently visited the spot to kiss almost too soon for her liking they reached their destination it was pitch black as they stepped up the winding staircase before the marble archways gave way to a large circular floor opened up with the night sky though she had had astronomy before hermione was almost mesmerized by the night sky it was endless filled with millions of little winking lights the dark sky was showered by stars as the milky way stretched across its unending length spilling into the darkness forever glancing beside her she saw that remus was doing the same and found that she wanted to reach for his hand to connect them in this perfect moment pushing forward hermione went to the edge of the tower gripping the railing and looking over the edge feeling dizzy below her the ground dissolved into fathomless black a swallowing darkness the great lake was far away dazzling with the moonlight from a three quarter moon remus appeared at her side and gazed at the stunning scene below them silently hermione breathed deeply trying to rid herself of the nervous feeling that was creeping up on her she felt guilty for spending christmas eve with someone else boyfriend but was pleased that she managed somehow to have this moment with him but there was also another feeling that she couldntquite place could it be anticipation gazing out at the sky hermione shouted aloud as a massive explosion took place in the air a monstrous bang shook the very castle before bright lights burst into the dark sky creating patterns and colors the formation of the fireworks began to fall like rain and hail and eventually formed the words happy christmas before fading to a dim glow remus was grinning at her when hermione squealed with joy this was why you wanted to bring me out here it was he admitted laughing as she clapped happily at the fireworks the four of us did it earlier today i figured lily and emma would ve loved it too but i bet they re too busy snogging to have seen it looking over him she smiled well it worked maybe not for them but for me i absolutely loved it with a tentative smile he reached inside his pocket and withdrew a small box covered in black velvet it was long and rectangular and he held it out to her happy christmas jane he whispered looking her in the eyes surprised hermione reached out to take it and their fingers brushed his gazed was steady and intense but she felt her heart flutter her mouth dry her words lost in the knot that were her vocal cords hermione carefully opened the velvet box and gazed open mouthed and amazed at the gift it held cautiously touching the silver hermione felt each bend and curve of the necklace it stung fiercely in the cold winter night sliding over her skin like water it felt innocent and extravagant she lifted the pendent from the bottom of the box and held it in her hand it felt like a dew drop on a misty summer morning absent of the cicadas lullaby she looked up searching his face remus looked nervous but determined that she like it remus she whispered looking into his eyes hermione face was etched in disbelief no one had ever gotten her something this nice this i i this is so so beautiful she murmured gazing at him he let out a sigh of relief and then stopped as if he had committed a terrible crime do you like it he asked cautiously a joyful smile broke out on her face remus it wonderful i love it she threw his arms around him and enveloped him in a tight embrace without thinking and not a moment later he held her just as tightly in return she realized how easily and how perfectly their bodies fit together even with the bulk of their winter cloaks drawing back from him she smiled i cantaccept this though i so sorry remus this is just too nice i i mean no jane i really want you to have it he assured her folding his hands around hers so that she was forced to hold the jewelry do you want help putting it on he asked though her heart stopped she said yes taking the necklace gently out of the box she handed it to him smiling when fingers brushed stepping closer to her he reached up behind her neck they were so close she could feel his breath on her face the next thing she knew he retrieved his hands from behind her head and it feel gently against her skin touching the cold silver she tilted back to look into his eyes to thank him somehow but found that nothing in her body could quite work their faces only inches apart their misty breath a cloud in the night hermione could see the mesmerized look in his eyes gazing at her as if she was the most beautiful thing in the world and without knowing how it happened together they closed the small distance between them their lips locking together and their breath becoming one and had anyone passed by they would ve left as they saw that new girl jane lewis and remus lupin kissing heatedly against the wall of the astronomy tower it looked as if they had been parted for hundreds of years and the two lovers had finally found each other once again x x x author notes i hoped you liked it i so sorry for the extremely long wait but i think this chapter made up for it i know that i threw lucius malfoy in here without a second glance but i always liked his character please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter but i down some little characters that help move the plot along nicely still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter eight no choice at all everything that had been on her mind was instantly erased nothing else mattered to her in the entire world except for the fact that remus john lupin was kissing her it was better than she imagined his arms which had gotten used to holding rose were now clutching onto her possessively his lips perfect and warm only made her hungrier for more of him somehow their hands had found their way together grabbing and pulling frantically desperately as if this were their only moment together in all of lover history before it was all destroyed again fingers pulled at her hair getting tangled in her untamable curls her back was pressed up against the wall her body against his and each inch of her previously frozen skin was on fire at their heated kiss cold hands slipped beneath cloaks gasps surfaced from between passionate lips and each chest rose and fell vehemently with each kiss it was perfect it was everything she had wanted from the moment she had met him it was a loud bang interrupted them and instantly the moment was broken they were thrown apart whether from their own hands or their fear hermione couldnttell one moment remus had been there perfect kissing her and now he was feet away from her staring into her eyes in disbelief but then hermione realized just how wrong this perfect moment was remus had a girlfriend and hermione was forbidden to complicate the past he was gaping at her confusion and panic alight in his eyes which were flicking in between her own searching for a logical answer but there was none to give that shouldnthave happened he croaked suddenly trying to flatten his messed up hair remus please let me explain hermione begged stepping forward to grab at his hands how could she apologize for something like this how could she apologize when her heart was breaking in two no jane stay away from me he uttered taking a few wild steps backwards i have a girlfriend you donteven fancy me how could this happen he cried to no one in particular hermione felt her chest seize up in grief in a terrible weight that could not be lifted what they had shared however brief and limited it was a perfect moment that she would not have traded for everything to know that he regretted it was worse than watching him kiss rose staring at the floor trying to keep tears from her eyes hermione reached down and picked up the loud object that had broken them apart it was the little scarlet book with gold bindings that had travelled with her into the past she knew that it was somehow meant for him merry christmas she whispered bitterly she shoved the book into his hands and fled from the tower leaving him alone there to the fiercely cold night x x x the rest of her christmas vacation was miserable hermione spent as much time as she could in the library surrounded by skyscrapers of books and towers of tomes but no essay no homework assignment no pleasure reading could take her mind off of what had happened on christmas eve if remus had occupied most of her time before now he occupied every waking moment what hermione hated most of all was the fact that she felt so weak she had dealt with these sorts of feelings for years with ron and recovered quite nicely though she did recall feeling quite heartbroken when he dated lavender brown remus lupin should be no different and neither should i hermione thought indignantly as she wrote out an essay there no reason why i cantreturn to my old self i ll heal and besides the best revenge is living well isntit but of course with her insecurity came self doubt in other forms the thought of revenge made her mind drift to lucius malfoy and his malicious devious ways was there a way to win remus back by using malfoy hermione skin crawled at the thought of the slytherin but at the same time hermione could not bear to watch remus and rose kiss without wanting to break down all together sometime after break had ended and classes began once more hermione found herself cornered by a certain james potter i ve got a bone to pick with you jane james said at once drawing hermione out of the current of the corridor james i ve got class to attend i canttalk right now hermione said trying to push past him james would have none of it and dragging her by the elbow brought her to an unoccupied hallway what do you want hermione seethed i will not be late for transfiguration what happened between you and moony james demanded flatly giving her a sharp look you two are avoiding each other he wonttalk to me at all and you look downright miserable tell me what happened nothing hermione lied turning scarlet yeah okay and lily isntmy girlfriend james deadpanned well she wasntbefore this year wasntshe hermione shot back realizing a moment too late that her words were restricted information james narrowed his eyes at her how did you know that never mind hermione said turning on her heel and starting off to class james rushed up to her and stood straight in her path tell me how you know leave me alone harry hermione snarled harry james asked curiously blocking her once more who harry no one just my friend please let me go to class hermione insisted wanting nothing more than to remove herself from this terrible situation just tell me what happened no yes jane no yes we kissed alright hermione shouted turning to shout in his face we kissed on christmas eve in the astronomy tower right after your bloody fireworks went off and he told me it shouldnthave happened and he left she didntrealize she was panting until after she finished yelling tearing up hermione turned away from him again but found that james potter had pulled her into a fierce embrace an embrace that she gave into immediately sobbing the last few weeks had been horrible miserable and had eroded all emotional defenses there was nothing left for her to lose but with each day she found herself in more agony donttell hermione moaned her head buried in his now soaked cloak remus will kill me and his stupid girlfriend will as well they cantdo anything to you jane james said softly holding her even tighter but but lucius malfoy he he knows things and i can t i can t she broke off into a sob once more you re worried about lucius james asked quietly i can take care of him if you like what do you mean hermione sniffed pulling away to look at him well james said with a grin his eyes full of mischief if malfoy does anything that makes you so incredibly mad that you want him to leave you alone for all eternity you come to me and i will do something about it and then he will never speak to you again it will be perfect that doesntexplain what you re going to do to him hermione said slowly let put it this way janie girl james cackled i would severely shrink his pride hermione nodded though she was uncertain of how this would work and what exactly it would do to malfoy temper you just tell me when and i will pull the prank on him he ll be gone forever james promised yes i suppose that good hermione said tentatively smiling james put an arm around her shoulders now come on mcgonagall must be raving mad at how late we are x x x the start of classes was both heavenly and disastrous heavenly because it offered many more distractions and excuses to avoid remus and rose but disastrous because lucius malfoy was now consistently in her path potions was a particularly painful class a look in the wrong direction could equate to seeing the happy couple together and it was not something hermione was ready for yet not to mention that malfoy seemed to sense her gloom automatically the moment they sat down quite the happy couple arentthey malfoy said out of the corner of his mouth as they took down notes from the blackboard yes they are hermione said through gritted teeth and i happy for them what hogwash malfoy scoffed turning to face her now i ve seen the way you stare at them you can barely stand being in the same room as them shut up malfoy hermione shot back professor hull was now circling the room looking at the potions in the cauldrons once she neared the cauldron belonging to hermione and malfoy hull turned her nose up but said nothing hermione smirked jane hissed a voice hermione turned around sharply to see lily holding out a small note which she grabbed from the redhead immediately carefully turning away from the prying eyes of lucius hermione opened it and read why didntyou tell me you snogged him aha what this professor hull marched over and ripped the note from hermione hands before she could utter a word of protest the class fell into silence all eyes glued to the horror happening right before hermione eyes passing notes in my class hmm hull beady eyes scanned the note with the smirk since you opening share your love life why dontyou tell the class just exactly who you snogged snickers filled the air but nothing was as terrible as the cold dread that settled over hermione suffocating her she looked about helplessly and caught remus eyes for the first time since they had kissed the boy was glaring daggers at her forbidding hermione to utter his name no hermione croaked to hull quivering in her seat no i won t no eh hull mocked you can have a whole month worth of detention then a month worth of detention for a childish little note hermione was beside herself with panic not knowing what to say or who to blame or what to do eyes flickering around desperately she stopped as lucius malfoy hand brushed her leg malfoy hermione bleated before scrambling to get her things and dash out of the classroom tears of humiliation on her face x x x jane hermione looked up her eyes blurry with tears she spotted red hair and without even thinking ran to the girl and threw her arms around her sobbing in her shoulder lily held her and tried to soothe the girl best she could before hermione pulled back wiping her eyes i made such a fool of myself hermione whispered that alright lily said smiling sympathetically i ve been just as foolish before i understand why you had to do it it just it just remus looked so angry i couldntsay his name he looked as if he was going to kill me hermione moaned it was an accident she confessed in a whisper the kiss i didntmean to i just you donthave to explain lily interjected rubbing her shoulder i sorry i passed you the note if it werentfor me this never would have happened i not blaming you lily i just wish things werentthis complicated hermione said miserably if you dontmind me asking did you have a change of heart about remus because you dontstrike me as the kind of girl who likes to kiss boys just for the fun of it lily said seriously for whatever reason hermione began to laugh wiping away tears simultaneously i suppose it true i suppose i do fancy him but he got a girlfriend and i shouldntbe dating anyone right now nonsense lily cooed we should break it off with that wretched slytherin girl anyway i just want remus to be happy hermione sighed if i was in the picture that would be lovely too but i cantget too hopeful that very mature of you lily said why dontyou focus on maintaining your friendship with him i mean all this time you claimed you didnt fancy him but then you kissed him and now you do fancy him he must be very confused i know hermione groaned you re right i ll apologize and then perhaps he ll go out with you then lily said with a grin fat chance hermione replied a small smile creeping onto her face so for the next month hermione decided she would focus on becoming remus friend again gaining what little trust she had had in the first place was the only chance she had at becoming close to him again however she found that approaching him was quite difficult she was still nursing hurt feelings and remus did not seem too keen on being near her in fact remus continued to find excuses to leave once hermione entered the room the only time they were really together was during classes but hermione simply could not get up and walk over to him in the middle of a lecture she could only hope that by some miracle they could be partners and in potions of course it was all together impossible as remus and rose were partners the werewolf never took his eyes off his girlfriend lucius malfoy of course had noticed her attempts at rekindling her relationship with remus his approach on winning hermione over had changed and hermione wasntsure how she liked this new tactic lucius was sly and underhanded very sarcastic and pointed out the painfully obvious things she had been ignoring inside herself perhaps she preferred him as a malicious prat who was violent and evil you know rose never stops talking about that dreadful boyfriend of hers i was beginning to think it was all a lie but they look quite happy dontthey lucius asked hermione with a feigned curiosity clamping her jaw together was the only thing she could do agreeing with malfoy would mean the worse and denying it would undermine her completely but malfoy was right remus and rose did look happy the last few weeks they had been spotted between classes seen holding hands in the corridors and caught sneaking out after hours when remus wasntavoiding hermione he was with his beautiful slytherin girlfriend sporting a lovesick smile such a shame that you cantbe with him now lucius sighed from what i hear he simply head over heels good hermione said her voice much harsher than she had intended it to be i want remus to be happy now now lucius chided donttake me for a fool i know very well that you re trying desperately to get over him doing everything you can to make yourself feel better but it not working lewis hermione tried to swallow the lump in her throat but could not i dontneed him to be happy ah yes but you want him because then you would be happy he pointed out because let me guess rose is a foolish shallow girl and lupin is intelligent and perfect not to mention a better suited match for you his decisions are out of my control hermione said through gritted teeth her blood boiling but what if it was in your control what if you could control his actions shut up malfoy hermione spat i not playing your games at this lucius touched her leg which made her jump you ve been playing my games all along darling he purred and you need me to win him back i dontneed you hermione hissed pushing his hand away at once i donteven need remus i a big girl i ll get over it sometimes unrequited love is for the best malfoy not everyone can just go and buy what they want but you can malfoy pressed a twisted grin on his face you have me and that all you need to get him i dontwant remus hermione snarled and i dontwant you lucius sat back in his seat a satisfied smile on his face as if he had not heard her last words you dontreally have a choice x x x it was nearing the end of january the castle was very cold and very drafty and hermione found herself bundled up more than usual the plan to patch up her friendship with remus was still going horribly but hermione began to build up her walls again she was determined to fix things and she would not walk away as wounded again she was stronger as the spring term began the workload increased heavily for the seventh years hermione was seeing more and more of her classmates in the library remus lupin being one of them after a week of observing his studying habits from afar she decided it would be best to corner him while it was very busy in the library that way he would be forced to leave the library entirely if he wanted to get away from her the day had come remus had carefully arranged his many textbooks across the tabletop and was referencing them consistently as he wrote an essay hermione glancing in between the shelves moved forward silently and came up behind him knowing that she would catch him completely off guard she stood there for a long moment her heart pounding in her throat before she forced herself to pull out the chair next to him and sit down hello remus hermione said trying to ignore her fluttering heartbeat it was the first time in weeks since they had looked each other in the eye and hermione was still awestruck at how he looked remus on the other hand looked completely flabbergasted that jane lewis the girl he had been avoiding at all costs was sitting down a foot away from him as hermione predicted he turned and began to pack up his things at once hermione grabbed his arm and halted him immediately please just hear me out hermione begged his arm froze his eyes glaring at a knot in the table look i know that things have been strange since christmas i just wanted to apologize for what happened i was misleading it was an accident and i just want to be friends again after a very tense moment remus spoke his words very carefully selected being friends again will create more problems rather than solutions crestfallen hermione asked what do you mean rose feels that it would be better if you and i stayed away from each other remus replied curtly sticking his chin out defiantly rose feels hermione repeated seizing his arm as he tried to pack up his things again i dontgive a damn what she thinks i want to know what you think she probably right remus said turning to look at hermione full in the face it was a mixture of extreme discomfort and bravado i dontwant you jumping on me again hermione was not defeated nor miserable nor was she sad instead she was furious that i jumped on you she hissed what did you tell her remus a selective fraction of the story that not what happened it was all she needed to know remus said as he ripped his arm from hermione hand in order to collect his things i bet she doesntknow about your precious necklace does she hermione spluttered turning red or the fact that you suggested the astronomy tower look i dontknow what you re getting angry at me remus snapped turning red about the face as hermione caught him in his lie go complain to your slytherin boyfriend lucius malfoy what hermione ejaculated malfoy is not my boyfriend you donthave to try and hide it jane everyone knows remus muttered stuffing things into his bag this is unbelievable hermione breathed i just wanted to fix my wrongdoing and here you are accusing me of dating some slimy wanker when you re dating rose sanders what unbelievable is that you could stoop down to someone like him remus shot back after everything everything that happened nothing has happened between malfoy and me i am not dating him she repeated glaring at remus now how could be this blind how could he be this insufferably thick yeah alright remus said sarcastically i ve heard about all the stories you always say you re in the library but you ve snuck down to the dungeons that not true hermione cried wanting nothing more than to strangle the boy now remus how can you believe that how can you believe rose you know me i not that girl i dontknow who you are remus said coldly you re strange you know too much things no one else knows like that stuff about hogsmeade have you gone raving mad hermione interrupted you re rejecting me because i know too much about hogsmeade and lily and james and when we took that walk to hogsmeade remus listen to yourself hermione pleaded this is insane all i want is for us to be friends no remus said sharply rose wonthave it great pick you ve got there hermione said sarcastically your girlfriend threatened by someone you wonteven talk to my my this is much too loud for a library isntit drawled a horribly familiar voice hermione did not have to turn around to know that lucius malfoy had arrived the look of loathing on remus face was overwhelming as he glared at the slytherin without another word remus successfully shoved all of his things into his bag as hermione watched agape as he promptly hurried out she turned to punish malfoy whether with a hex a curse or her fist or perhaps all three but was seething mad to see him swagger away with just one little rumor lucius malfoy had singlehandedly destroyed the possibility of friendship and had boxed hermione into a very uncomfortable corner she could either walk away entirely leaving remus behind for good or she could fight to reveal the truth to him that rose and malfoy were lying to him all along she should have been sad or perhaps in tears by now but hermione granger was instead frustrated and for a loss of what to do uncertainty defined her now because whatever she was dealing with changed within moments this was no longer a matter of apologizing to remus but a matter of finding the source of the rumor and guiding him towards the truth but what would it take for him to accept it x x x another week had gone and january was now over february had closed in upon them as suddenly as winter snow taking everyone off guard valentine day was soon approaching as well and people around the school were becoming overly affectionate making hermione want to vomit the last week had also been just tormenting for her as well now remus was glaring at her whenever he got the chance and lucius was constantly sporting a smug triumphant look more than once she had attempted to catch malfoy off guard so that she would reprimand him for ruining her friendship but found that he was always just out of reach either in classes or with friends malfoy would not let her near so naturally hermione retreated to the library more often than not hating how some people might think she was in the dungeons at that very moment still she pushed on and continued working on homework and essays instead of worrying about the awful rumor that was already out of control on one of these days something very surprising happened hermione had her books laid out systematically across the library table as she wrote a transfiguration essay she was very focused on copying down a fact when a hesitant cough caught her attention looking up at once she was taken aback to see remus lupin standing in front of her hi he said awkwardly hovering across the table hello hermione replied warily lying her quill down she asked what do you need remus clearing his throat again remus pulled out the chair and sat down across from her i i just wanted to apologize for the last time we talk i was quite rude and you re right we should be friends still hermione blinked astonished at these words was this the same boy who had been avoiding her adamantly all month had accused her of terrible things last week but was now apologizing and accepting her once again but then hermione realized what had happened what did rose say hermione asked quietly she had a horrible feeling that somehow this apology could be traced back to malfoy i explained to her that she shouldntbe threatened by you remus said because now you re dating malfoy and you have no reason to go for me merlin beard hermione sighed i am not going out with malfoy how many times do i have to tell you that remus it alright jane i talked to rose about that too remus said i should be more accepting of whom you choose to date and you were right as well i cantreally criticize you when i dating a slytherin as well i am not dating malfoy hermione said through gritted teeth you ve got to stop saying that it isntvery funny drawled a voice from behind her and before hermione could react malfoy swooped in and kissed her on the cheek lupin malfoy greeted pleasantly as he sat down next to hermione malfoy remus returned his voice a great deal colder hermione was beside herself with rage how could remus believe this rubbish and how could malfoy keep doing this is this little reunion about hogsmeade next weekend malfoy asked draping his arm on hermione chair she shoved it off at once glaring at him it is remus confirmed through a very taut jaw i not going to hogsmeade with you hermione growled at malfoy drawing out her wand nonsense malfoy said seizing her wand arm under the table and holding it down out of view rose would very much enjoy a little double date she would remus confirmed again though hermione realized he looked fuming mad for some reason anyway i ll be off see you later jane and then as quick as that remus had snatched his things up and dashed out hermione turned to snarl a curse at malfoy but he had seized her by the shoulder and pressed his lips against her ear notice one small thing before you curse me lewis your little boyfriend looks furious that we should be together malfoy purred he jealous isntthat what you wanted i told you i didntwant him hermione hissed ripping her shoulder out of his grasp and i dontwant you i told you before you dontreally have a choice he said eyes flashing dangerously i do have a choice and it isntyou it very unfortunate that you should say that malfoy drawled a devilish smile curling onto his lips after all you wouldntwant me to start another rumor would you rumors as just words they cantdo anything hermione spat they can if they re true malfoy reminded her dontforget what i know about you where you came from liverpool witches academy everyone knows that hermione interjected and when you came malfoy finished a terrible gleam to his eye hermione froze in her seat and dontforget that i know what time you left to come here how how could he know this how could anyone know this malfoy leaned forward again brushing his lips against her ear this time hermione did not stop him you re coming with me to hogsmeade next weekend donttry and fight me off because every time you deny me the worse it will be for you and your little boyfriend whatever i tell rose she will whisper in his ear and he will believe it the more you fight me the more he ll hates you so if you want him back you ll cooperate he drew back and hermione stared at him terrified and rigid still he touched her cheek i call the shots here mudblood this is my castle and this is my time not yours i dontcare what place and time you come from but i am in control and you will do as i say unless you d rather suffer the consequences with that malfoy stood and walked away leaving hermione alone with her paranoid thoughts if malfoy knew that she was a time traveler who else knew could it be that someone here had traveled with her or was it that somehow malfoy was communicating with someone from the future this presented itself as an entirely new problem making little mistakes around the marauders was nothing compared to the mess she was in now with malfoy he had direct control over her and with just one whispered secret he could have her whole life in shambles what could she do there was no way to keep him quiet because he was definitely getting his information from a more reliable source but no hermione reasoned he had never said anything specific about who she was or where she came from he could have some knowledge that she was a time traveler but not who she was or who she was close to but then what if malfoy did know specifics what if he knew of harry potter of the prophecy and of voldemort rising powers what then shivering in fear hermione gathered her things and left praying to the gods above that malfoy was in the dark and knew not an inkling of her true identity x x x author note so i rewrote this entire chapter and this should actually clear a lot of stuff up in the end thankfully please review disclaimer i do not own harry potter whoopee so just hope you love this chapter there will be some mystery in this and more lucius hermione lusty action which apparently some people like i just write it because it works so yeah enjoy still so close to you by darkwing731 chapter nine not happening well what now lily asked as they ascended the staircase apparently it involves hogsmeade with malfoy this weekend hermione sounded dark and very irritated blimey what was that jane lily asked sounding awe struck all of the sudden i have no idea but i should ve done that a while ago hermione chewed on her quill anxiously as she stared down at her parchment she was just finishing up some homework but her mind was agog with thoughts and worries but then again her paper wasntgoing to finish itself ten minutes later hermione was rolling up her essay sealing it and stuffing it in her bag she sighed irritably slung it over her shoulder and got up she decided that the library was boring her and a nice cozy armchair by the fire in the common room would do her much better the door slammed loudly and several people scowled at the rudeness but she dismissed them and walked briskly away from the towering bookshelves and the people currently behind them more specifically the one boy remus lupin behind them he had been lurking behind the bookshelves peering through the wood and the bindings at jane back wondering why oh why he felt such anger when he looked at her figure there was more than one emotion but all he could coherently sort out was the rage and annoyance he felt every time he thought of jane which happened to be quite a lot since monday he thought of her and lucius malfoy ugh the thought still disgusted him to no end how she could kiss a freak like that was beyond him why kiss that stupid blonde when she could have someone who would treat her better not earn her a bad reputation or pressure her for sex someone like remus himself oh shit he thought suddenly x x x it was friday night and hermione had one last class before dinner and then her night before the horrible date with malfoy yuck hermione thought she still shuddered whenever she thought about monday night that was a horrible day and she still couldnt believe she had done something so stupid for revenge on remus and it involved malfoy no less stupid hermione granger she muttered to herself walking down the hallways of the quiet castle she whacked her forehead rather forcefully this will teach you to ever mess with a stupid pureblood like him again messing with his ferret of a son was bad enough but this is just hell she was rather upset with herself and still couldntexplain what crossed her mind to make her commit such an act she felt like she had degraded herself which she had basically and like she had done a petty crime that was somehow punishable by death when she walked back into the common room she checked her watch she had a twenty minute break until her next class potions joy she thought sarcastically and then dinner if she could manage to swallow without vomiting she opened her bag and pulled out the book she had been carrying around with her and the blank journal lily had given her it was emerald green and had jl carved on the bottom right hand corner hermione sighed as she opened the textbook to the next page and the journal to a blank one she needed to use all the study time she could get if she was going to be serious one night as she had been searching the library she had come across a rather old and dusty book that caught her attention she grabbed the spine pulled it out and blew the dust off the cover the grey rubbish revealed the precious title properties of time travel spells charms and general magic her immediate thought had been no bloody way before she grabbed it and started taking notes immediately there was little time between classes and homework and avoiding remus rose and lucius at all costs and she crammed all she could into her head so her plan could formulate hermione was chewing the end of her quill again when the portrait door opened and automatically she turned to see who it was remus her head whipped back around again and she focused herself back on her book and taking down notes however she could feel his ginger eyes burning in the back of her neck and hesitantly she lifted her eyes slightly and looked at the table she could see him out of the corner of her eyes watching her she didntwant to look at him she really didn t but he was taking the concentration out of her work she turned and looked at him slowly her eyes locking on his for a second ice in her gaze he was sitting at one of the smaller tables by the far grandfather clock his homework was sprawled across the tabletop his bag slung over the chair and his collar loose she could see the edges of his chest peeking out and she chided herself mentally for even noticing but his expression was flawless quick and hastily removed once he saw her looking he had been relaxed staring at her with an undeniable yearning oblivious to himself his head tilted slightly towards her looking as if he was suppressing a groan of some sort but then his whole mask changed when she blinked he was upright modest and blushing as he looked back at her his mouth hanging open for a moment his eyes awkward and looking for something to say on the spur of the moment what re you reading it came out of his mouth fluidly almost sounding casual she looked at him for a moment her eyebrows raised she lowered her eyes to the book thinking before looking at him again something for muggle studies she answered him slowly shutting her things and storing them in her bag she felt no guilt at the obvious lie as she walked past him heading towards the portrait hole he said you donttake muggle studies though she turned and looked at him he looked confused and she wondered slightly how he knew she shrugged and turned and continued on i know she answered him over her shoulder but it doesntstop me x x x potions class was quiet already hull was strutting around looking like she owned the place while she looked at everyone potion it was an individual assignment again today hermione and lucius potion was kept with everyone else while it sat for three classes this was the last day she was stirring her potion to a light grey while a purplish mist stood in a haze over it for a while the only thing wrong with this picture was that lily was doing better and somehow snape was almost done git she thought to herself irritably at least lucius was doing a lot worse than her his potion was a dull green still and there was no mist he was grumbling to himself as it slowly turned the appropriate color hermione gave hers one final stir before sitting down it needed to sit for ten minutes and she wanted to pull out that helpful little charms book but then as she went to pull it out she stopped lucius might look at it and gather some puzzle pieces for later on and she couldnthave that she was afraid that he knew too much already and it was going to just hand him a map straight to hermione granger she cursed softly as she sat down instead looking at her knees and wondering how much information would this book provide for her to make her own floor plan to get back home she didnteven know if the information was correct despite that it was in a textbook because the method could be later tested and improved in the future there could be horrible side effects or unknown easier ways the list was endless she just had no idea what she was dealing with but then there were a lot of other influences that she was dealing with too remus lucius the marauders everyone else how could she make it all the way until she left without trying to kill peter for the damage he would cause in the future how could she stand another day befriending lily like she did ginny without saying something to prevent her death and worst how long could she last before she made a terrible life inflicting mistake with remus he was the last marauder hell he was her defense against the dark arts professor she would see him nearly three times a week it would be uncomfortable and it would screw up a lot of her relationships between her friends and ron and what about the red head would her flame for him rekindle or would she be stuck dreaming of her professor instead her anxious reverie was broken as she realized that lucius was talking to her he something i have to watch out for in the future too she reminded herself he was draco father and she had seen him occasionally before this whole time hurling problem so where are we going first tomorrow on our lovely little date she noticed that his silky drawl was accompanied by his arm draped lazily over the back of her chair she could ve slapped him i dontcare she snapped at him at the moment i having second thoughts about it anyways and she was she truly regretted kissing him in front of merlin knows how many people and demanding this revenge you made your bed now you ve got to sleep in it her conscience chided it was right she would have to go through with this to fix it up she sighed as the thought came to her head it was truly unpleasant but then what was she expecting it to be lucius laughed softly i dontthink so love he smirked at her and she narrowed her eyes i not letting you back out of this if it cost me my life after all with everything i know about you you wouldntwant me to tell a few select people would you the superior glint in his silver eyes gleamed and she gritted her teeth that bastard knows too much he too much like his son she thought angrily but then wasntit like father like son somehow she thought i think all the malfoys were like this she looked back at him determined not to drop her gaze she wasnt intimidated just annoyed he was trying to rule her beat her in this game and she wasntgoing to let him but his eyes were too intense and gradually her stomach started to churn as she thought of all the things he truly could do to her in revenge whether they were personal or committed by his lackeys she looked away finally the feeling of him pressed up against her washing away despite the enormous space between them the pressure was off for a little while but she still had to be careful and grudgingly she did nothing about his hand on her knee through the rest of the class when potions ended the professor called hermione up to her desk just as she passed over the threshold cursing softly she turned around and caught the furtive look from remus before walking over to the desk hull waited until everything was quiet before speaking she was shuffling papers around on her desk and hermione tentatively sat down wondering what this was all about she hadntdone anything wrong so what could hull possibly want her for now miss lewis the professor said sucking hermione out of her thoughts in an instant yes professor she asked timidly i ve noticed that however rebellious you have been in the past and some of the trouble you have caused hermione suppressed a very indignant noise you re a particularly good student in potions one of the students in your class has been dropping dramatically in his work and i request that you tutor him for a month or so i have asked my other two top students lily evans and severus snape but both refused i counting on you to help him through this class or else he will fail it wondering who on earth could fail such an easy class well it was easy to her she thought about it for a second well professor i would love too it isntextremely hard to keep up in the class but i can understand where one can get lost excellent hull said i would like you to meet him down here on monday night around half past seven for an hour or so for his first tutoring lesson all right hermione agreed promptly you may leave now packing up her bag she walked to the door and remembered something vital oh professor she said stopping hull just as she was leaving into her office yes lewis who am i tutoring and suddenly her heart was pounding in her chest with hope or with dread she could not tell turning to walk back into her office she answered remus lupin x x x she was positive remus was staring at her all through dinner she knew he was but every time she turned her head to look at him he was somehow deeply engrossed in a conversation with lily she frowned at him and went back to her meal occasional sending him looks she wanted to catch him in the act there was a tap on her back and she turned it was james with his arm stretched behind sirius whom she was sitting next to and he passed her a note she snatched it and opened it on her thighs and read it under the table 1 all through breakfast lunch and dinner 2 passing you in the hallways 3 all the classes you take together 4 especially potions the moral of this sad story he jealous of the git and so rates to you hermione looked over at james bemused at this note he shrugged and pointed at lily who was still talking to remus james made a jerking movement under the table and the red head winced in pain and then looked over at hermione hermione held up the note and lily put her hand to her cheek motioned to remus put two fingers at her eyes and pointed back at hermione and she suddenly understood after a moment of utter confusion lily had listed all the times remus had been staring at her lily you have absolutely no time whatsoever hermione said with a tiny sigh shoving the note in her pocket lily grinned i know you re grateful and you love me she said back ever so much hermione replied and they laughed it was one of the only times hermione had felt a little something called happiness over the past few days dinner past very slowly and she barely ate anything her stomach was still churning from earlier after potions how was she going to get through a month with remus for potions tutoring she realized how she hadnttold lily and realized with a jolt that these future lessons would either bring them closer or push them farther apart but either way hermione resolved we ll be working together for a long time sexual tension anyone and she knew something big was going to happen whether it should be good or bad and she could only hope for the best x x x hermione nervously tugged on her scarf as she descended the last staircase she made her way through the last hallway struggling with herself whether she should turn back and run all the way to her dormitory or put up with it and just go through with this awful day but as she walked into the slicing cold she knew this day would be awful but she would handle it as best she could the courtyard was slowly emptying and she paused for only a moment wondering if he was going to turn up or not when arms snaked around her waist from behind she turned her head to the side only to have it come very close to lucius hello there lucius whispered moving his lips closer to hers and giving her a ghost of a kiss she resisted the urge to vomit she gave him a sullen look and he smirked letting go of her but wrapped an arm around her neck and started walking she was forced to walk under the weight of his arm stupid idiot hermione thought to herself she hated how she had known she was going to regret this saturday with lucius malfoy but had done it anyway just to get back at remus for kissing his girlfriend she put her hand to her forehead for a moment hoping to lessen the stress and frustration but it was in vain this day was going to royally suck they walked silently to hogsmeade the one thing she was glad for she was left in the silence to her thoughts on how she was going to attack this situation and make some good of it they came around the last corner and students were bunched up at the entrance slowly filing in hermione spotted the red hair that belonged to lily and shot away from lucius to the other muggle born lily you little chit how could you hermione cried attacking her from behind what did she do now james asked he suddenly glared at something over hermione shoulder and she understood lucius had followed her why on earth did you turn down hull request hermione said almost hysterically because i thought it would do you some good lily said looking exasperated and helpless at the same time some good hermione shrieked this is going to be hell for the next month she grabbed the redhead and shook her soundly why lily why in the next moment lucius grabbed her by the arm and started tugging her away let move it lewis i donthave all day he growled at her james jumped forward angrily to shove malfoy but lily stopped him i sorry jane she apologized sincerely hermione made an overly dramatic sobbing noise as she allowed lucius to drag her away the couple made it through the gates before lucius commented on her previous behavior you know i told snape to say yes to that offer but hull took it back before he could she thought they would be a violent pair he said casually please remus and snape would be at each other throats in a moment it escapes me why she even offered in the first place hermione said waving her hands around frustrated i agree he said he sighed suddenly it a pity i couldntget to mudblood evans in time there would ve been many ways to have her say yes dont talk about lily like that hermione snarled instantly vicious just because i used to it doesntmean you can insult her like that or even mention the word in front of me for that matter you re used to it who calls you that so often he asked interested your stupid but she stopped abruptly and sealed her mouth the look in his eyes made her shiver he knew what she had been about to say shit she cursed softly he put his lips to her ear my stupid son she stopped walking her body frozen he laughed softly in her ear and put his lips to her neck dragging the tip of his tongue down to her collarbone and pulling back to stare her in the eyes he wasnt smirking but he ought to be she thought as she looked at his face dark with pleasured triumph she couldntbreathe her body had filled with ice and her brain and completely stopped she couldntfeel the expression on her face but somehow she knew the completely scared and vulnerable look made lucius malfoy very happy indeed and it was in the shocked silence that he gently guided her down the street bustling with students who were stunned to see them together with his arm around her waist i i have to go to the loo excuse me hermione murmured as soon as they stepped into a building she nearly bolted to the ladies door as soon as she escaped lucius arm around her she felt like she was going to vomit she clutched the side of the sink her head bowed and her eyes shut tight her breathing was heavy and the only thought going through her head was that this isnt happening this is not happening lucius knew she had had her suspicions before but now it was verified and now he could finish her bloody sentences if he wanted too she was in so much trouble now he might as well start calling her granger for all she cared he probably knew her name anyways when she finally had enough control of her thoughts and her racing heart she slowly left the lavatory lucius was at the counter talking to the waitress and she found a booth and sat down she looked around and realized they were in the three broomsticks at least it not puddifoot she said to herself and was somewhat relieved when he came back he slid into the seat next to her why arentyou sitting across from me she asked rather coldly he smirked at her and touched her cheek we ll be having some company love he said the door opened with a chime and he turned and looked over and here they are now he said rather pleasantly he turned and smiled smugly at the horrified look on her face there they were the only two people that could ve made her day ever worse why she moaned into her hands why is everyone against me lucius gave her a pat on the back because the beautiful never have it easy he said lightly she looked up at him and she went to slap him he caught it before it had passed the surface of the table still smiling smugly rose and remus slid into the bench across from them and hermione stared at the table feeling her heart pound and her veins rise with anger cold isntit lucius asked rose pleasantly hermione looked up almost reluctantly to see the girl diagonal from her nodding eagerly well then why donti get the three of us some butter beer and he slid from the bench and walked over to the counter again hermione blood boiled as he easily excluded remus he was still a person even if they were both ignoring him rose was touching her lips with her bare fingers and frowning oh i must ve forgotten my lippy be right back and she scurried away leaving hermione and remus alone together at a booth with a jolt hermione also realized it was the booth she and remus had sat at together when he had brought her that first time a sad pang in her heart made her feel angry all of a sudden she looked at remus her eyes cold he slowly lifted his eyes and looked at her and the icy interior around her heart melted at the miserable look on his face how could she stay mad at him dunno but find a way her mind scolded her have you talked to hull yet hermione asked suddenly the thought gracing her mind yes remus answered quietly he rolled his eyes suddenly and i am not failing that class either i messed up one potion and dear merlin the world is ending he said heatedly hermione smiled faintly feeling the urge to chuckle hull just doesntlike you hermione said easy for you to say jane he snapped you lils and snape are the three top students you donthave to be tutored by some random fool for months hermione realized that he didntknow who his tutor was remus she said you do know who tutoring you dontyou no remus snarled the bloody wench wouldnttell me well that because she made her decision today how would you know he demanded still angry hermione was silent for a moment because she making me tutor you his only response was a blank stare before his head fell into his hands and he groaned into the table wearily why he mumbled into his hands why is everyone against me and she realized she had asked the very same questions only twenty minutes ago here we are three butter beers lucius slipped in letting three bottles nearly tip over on the surface make that two hermione said coldly i dontwant one lucius turned and looked at her his eyes dangerous calm he held one out to her i think you do granger he mouthed to her finishing his sentence she took the bottle slowly and made sure remus said the angry miserable look on her face lucius gave her a cold look before sitting down and handing one to rose she couldntbe sure if lucius had actually mouthed her surrname but it was obvious he had because he knew of his own son he just knew remus fortunately caught the look hermione had of sheer misery and desperateness something was up and without knowing how he resolved to find out though subtly hermione sunk low in her seat putting the warm tempting butter beer on the table she felt the tears prickle her eyes but refused to let them come any further she put herself in this mess and she had to deal with it until it was over please god let it end she thought desperately as she bowed her head even lower listening to lucius and rose exchanged words like old friends x x x why would you invite them hermione demanded angrily as lucius finally let go of her waist they had come to the shrieking shack and she was only going to yell and shout at him till her face was blue when they were completely alone he whistled strategically and then shrugged stopping the high pitched sound and smiling at her she let out a loud frustrated sigh and walked away from him and kicked the breaking fence stupid malfoy she thought irritably he came up behind her and put his arms around her waist again his fingers moving as if subtly tickling her before running over her hips and cupping her backside for a moment she let out an indignant noise and shoved him away pervert she yelled at him she turned back as he put his hands in his pockets and looked at her his eyes dark with the hunger that she kept seeing to answer your question i wanted to see what you would do granger it was rather amusing he said he was behind her a few feet but coming closer she could hear his footsteps crunching on the snow suddenly she whipped around what did you call me her voice was high and breathless as if he had pulled all the breath out of her body he slowly took another step forwards his face serious and dark much more intimidating than she had seen it before her hand subconsciously felt around for her wand but it was gone granger he repeated softly pulling out her wand and twirling it in her fingers he suddenly whistled again and stopped her heart was beating hard against her ribcage but she nearly died on the spot as someone whistled back from the woods and another whistle and another and another she was breathing jaggedly as she stared around in terror as people descended from the tree covered hills surrounded the shrieking shack her eyes were wide with terror as lucius smirked moving forward towards her again the faces were those of the slytherins nott lestrange avery macnair snape and regulus black all of which were to become death eaters if they hadntalready been initiated as they made a tightly knit circle closing in on her lucius folded his arms over his chest and watched her back up against the fence looking scared and helpless i believe you met my friends granger he said smoothly help me she screamed suddenly her heart was racing and she knew something very bad was going to happen they were closing the last gap and caging her and she knew she had to make an attempt to run they were boxing her in like an innocent animal being caged and sent to the room where the door never opened again she scrambled as lestrange and macnair got closer to stop her and the two boys grabbed her and held on as she started screaming and making vain struggling attempts to escape her heart was pounding in her head and the only thing she could see hear or think about was how terrified she was the fear was spreading through her veins and she was petrified let go she screamed terrified as they laughed maliciously at her help help they picked her up and followed lucius holding the kicking and utterly scared girl over their shoulders anyone that had heard her screaming wouldnthave helped her anyways and she realized this with a fearful pang as they dragged her into the gloomy woods where her screams would not penetrate the silence
