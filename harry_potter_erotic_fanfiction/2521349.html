of planning and writing this one and i am very busy this time of year also i going to cross country camp this week so i will not be able to update until i get back please read enjoy and review thanks chapter one coming home i ll be sure to write everyday and i sure my parents would love for you to come and stay for a couple of days or something james told lily as they waited for their parents to pick them up from the station yes i sure jamesie parents would love that sirius interrupted as he came back with a trolley lily laughed at sirius alright i ll make sure to ask my parents they ll probably want to invite you to dinner sometime who me sirius asked loudly and obnoxiously lily grinned no but you never know they might want to meet you sirius grinned at her well i would think so james smiled at his best friend and girlfriend or as he was getting used to saying his fianc e they hadnttold anyone yet they had agreed to tell their friends all together and lily insisted that they couldnttell her parents till her eighteenth birthday in august so lily was wearing the ring on her right hand with the irish wedding ring james had given her on her left and you ll have to come over for my birthday james added lily smirked do i now james pouted and folded his arms well if you dontyou wontget a goody bag really lily smiled as james wrapped his arms around her then i ll just have to come now wonti james smiled at her and kissed her fiercely this was going to be the last time they saw each other for a week as james birthday was the twenty first lily was taken a back as james kisses in public at least were usually soft quick and tender she had responded by deepening the kiss however and was thus caught in a fairly embarrassing situation when they broke away due to sirius coughing they turned around to see both sets of parents waiting for them looking just as embarrassed and then turning their attention to each other and starting a conversation lily face was red and james neck was pink well we best be going i think james father started he looked older than when lily had last seen him just a few months ago his hair was grayer and the wrinkles around his eyes were more severe we ll be sure to send you an owl patrick and beverly come on james sirius and no sirius you still cantdrive sirius made a sigh of disappointment as he pushed the trolley beside james who was walking a few steps behind his parents he turned around to wave once more at lily who grinned and then faced her parents well her mother started as her father was now putting all of lily things quite forcibly into her trolley and not looking at her lily gave a slight smile mostly from nervousness and then hugged her mother it good to be back her father smiled at her let go lily bev the mother and daughter broke away before following patrick out to the parking lot so you had a good last term beverly evans asked her daughter at dinner that night lily swallowed her milk and nodded yes everything went well and the graduation ball was so magical lily described as her eyes fluttered and she took another sip beverly smiled at her daughter remembering what it was like to be young and in love so what jobs are you applying for her father asked searching his way into the conversation for a safe topic one that didntinvolve romance and magical dances lily looked up at her father well i think i d like to work with diplomatic relations or maybe in the court as a lawyer i d start out as an intern of course professor flitwick the charms professor gave me some applications and i sent them in they re waiting on my n e w t scores before they really decide on anything patrick evans nodded and went back to eating and james is going to be an orator or something lily smiled james applied for the auror academy they have to look at his test scores too before officially accepting them which they will they will how do you know her father challenged somewhat passively aggressive lily grinned because james is brilliant and amazing and can do anything he sets his mind to sounds just like you her father replied with a small chuckle james is welcome to dinner anytime beverly interjected lily nodded he knows actually his birthday is coming up soon a week actually and i was wondering if i could go to his house for the day beverly looked at patrick who thought for a moment and then spoke he may but he needs to come and pick you up lily these are dangerous times freaky terrorist attacks and you ve said the magical world is in some sort of disarray so i think it would be best if he came and got you it a six hour car ride lily stated diplomatically desperate to be allowed to go why canti just apparate there and have him drive me back then he can come to dinner because we were talking to sam and margaret james parents and they ve warned us of the dangers with apparation from muggle villages to magical ones i think it best if james comes and picks you up first he can stay in the guest bedroom overnight if he likes patrick explained darting his eyes to beverly for support every few seconds lily sighed and asked to be excused before she wrote a letter to james dear james precious how was your ride home i hope well did you get settled alright i just finished having dinner and no we didnthave pork chops i asked my parents about going to your house for your birthday and my father would like for you to drive and pick me up because he concerned about safety you are welcome to come the day before and stay the night so you donthave to drive so much if you re too busy i understand and i can wait to give you your present when i visit you during the summer tell sirius hello for me all my love your fianc e shnuckums lily smiled as she looked at the letter when she realized she didnthave an owl she slapped her forehead in frustration all these years and she had neglected to buy an owl just then a tapping was heard at her window she looked up from her desk and walked over and opened the window a large brown owl sprang through the windows the bird dropped the letter in lily hands and then went to sit on lily chair which she treated like a perch lily tore open the letter anxious to read james letter my dearest lily how are you getting settled i just finished unpacking myself sirius is staying for dinner and then we re going over to his flat for the night hope you donthave to see too much of your wretched sister have you asked your parents about my birthday yet i ll be ever so disappointed if you cantcome well sirius is calling i love you love precious lily smiled as she finished the letter james seemed to always have such perfect timing in everything that he did she took the letter she had just written thanking merlin that she hadntsealed it in an envelope yet and responded to james letter she then sealed the letter and gave it back to rosemary after giving her some water from a dish give this to james she asked as she let the owl out of the window she watched it fly off into the sunset and sighed before closing the window and heading back downstairs petunia and vernon were coming for dessert sirius your flat is a mess james commented as they walked through the kitchen where dishes were rotting and a ghastly smell was emitting throughout the entire house sirius shrugged as he did a bubblehead charm well i never got the chance to clean up over the holidays james looked at sirius with a shocked and disgusted expression christmas holidays james asked eyebrows raised sirius thought for a moment and then nodded yes i believe that was the last time i was here james shook his head padfoot you ve got to learn cleaning charms mate do you want a house elf we have a few extra sirius made a face through the upside down fish bowl i hate house elves sneaky creatures cantbe trusted james smiled just because kreacher is so awful doesntmean ours are excellent promise sirius shook his head no he was quiet for a moment more actually i was wondering if we could be flatmates he asked looking at james with pleading eyes james thought for a moment he looked at the mess of the kitchen as he held his breath and he dreaded looking at the other parts of the house but as he gazed back at sirius he realized he couldntdesert his best friend even if he was a pig sure but could we get a bigger place james asked with my money and your money we could do it you know and i think you only have one bedroom sirius pulled james into a hug and broke away quickly yes i was hoping to leave this dump uncle alfred left me enough so yes i think that ll do sirius smiled triumphantly and gathered his trunk ready padfoot you just cantleave this place like this and besides you have to look for a new flat first james replied reasonably sirius was about to reply when james owl zoomed through the window carrying lily letter he scanned over the lines of lily neat loopy writing and smiled before looking up at sirius you got a piece of parchment he asked grinning sirius nodded and he opened his trunk and then handed james some spare rather crumpled parchment a half empty bottle of ink and an old quill james wrote a few words signed it elaborately and then gave the letter to his owl who looked absolutely revolted about carrying yet another letter across the country james patted her head and gave her some water with a few words of persuasion and she was off however contempt what was that about sirius asked as he started to clean up the kitchen with the help of his wand james smiled lily wants me to come and pick her up before my birthday so i ll be spending the night at her place friday and then i ll be back saturday morning if we drive fast it quite a drive i hope she ll be able to spend the night saturday night i dontfeel like driving that much sirius raised his eyebrows suggestively spending the night are we he grinned wickedly just how close are you and miss evans getting these days james chuckled sod off sirius no comment then sirius asked james ignored sirius and began to help him clean do you want to spend the night at my house tonight tomorrow we can start searching for a flat james continued sirius grinned again alright but i dontwant to be as close as you and shnuckums james glared at him quickly before getting back to the dishes vernon has just been made the assistant director of grunnings dad petunia boasted as she took a sip of brandy patrick evans nodded and smiled politely at vernon is that so well congratulations vernon beamed and puffed out his chest in a proud way well it was about time if i do say so myself i ve been working for the company for ten years and assistant to the vice president wasntjust my cup of tea i can handle big things patrick he continued lily took a large gulp of tea to suppress the laughter forming in the back of her throat and the instinct to make a snide remark at vernon last comment his whole family was practically a herd of elephants as it was petunia held up her nose and ignored her sister and lily could tell she was just dying for the day lily would move far away from surrey and never bother her again lily wasntexactly trying to delay her inevitable move either ever since the dursleys had moved down the road lily had been keen on moving out i going to be getting a job soon myself lily added conversationally attempting to rescue her father who was nodding politely from vernon typical droll conversation vernon turned his head and looked absolutely revolted that his monologue had been interrupted by lily of all people petunia glared at her sister but didntsay a word lily smiled inwardly and continued yeah i applied for several at the ministry and as soon as i get one i ll get my own flat lily expected petunia and vernon to just stare at her like she was an insect but her parents then vernon laughed they wontlet your kind work at our ministry vernon replied as if it was the most preposterous thing in the world before lily had time to reply to his ignorant comment however lily mother spoke lily petunia lived at home till she was married and your father and i we were sort of expecting you to do the same beverly evans stated with calm yet motherly demanding voice lily shook her head no mum i can t i have to be i have to be with magic it just not reasonable for me to stay here and risk your safety and the safety of our neighbors i can t dontyou think it just as risky as living by yourself you ll have no one to protect you or watch out for you or just to keep you company patrick added lily green eyes flashed with anger as she sat back in her seat vernon and petunia looked just as perturbed as the conversation passed through tense air as if they werenteven in the room dad mum i have to be able to live with magic she protested i just have to i know how to take care of myself beverly and patrick exchanged a look and patrick sighed as he laid his fork on his plate and looked at his youngest daughter we ll write to the potters and see what they think what is allison doing we could write the prewitts too allison probably living at home but it doesntmatter for her because she already lives in the magical world lily explained dreading every moment of the confession beverly nodded we ll write the potters then next time james owl comes let me know lily nodded before asking to be excused she cleared her place as well as her father s as he was done eating as well and then walked slowly up to her room rosemary was waiting at her window for her quite patiently for an owl lily opened the window and then went to go tell her mother to write whatever she needed to the potters a n here you guys go so it looks like the favorite loony toon muppet characters are bugs bunny and miss piggy my favorite from the muppets was always kermit and i liked elmer fudd next poll what your favorite name jkr has used so read and review and have a good weekend everyone chapter ten a disagreement among friends monday morning lily found herself in her new office or rather a tiny cubicle on the outskirts of amelia bones office on her desk a number of stuffed gigantic folders were waiting for her lily sighed and put her bag down before pulling off her cloak she hadntbeen seated five minutes when a knock came to her cubicle wall she turned from the notes she was making on the carrow case to see owen scruggs smiling down at her so you re the junior intern he stated politely lily gave him a small smile yes owen nodded and looked at the stack of papers on lily desk i remember those days seems like only yesterday he smiled again i the senior intern for bones now lily nodded she told me if owen was disappointed by not being able to boast on his own success he didntshow it i imagine she would a few silent moments passed and lily looked back down at her work willing him to leave owen let out a sigh and rapped on the cubicle wall with his knuckles i guess i ll be off i was just checking up on you if you need anything i just a few cubicles away lily nodded i ll keep that in mind he grinned at her once more before leaving lily sighed and got back to work she was feeling more irritable then she usually would on a monday morning allison hadntyet replied to her letter she hadntsaid anything more than an invitation an invitation for allison and herself to have dinner together or something just to visit or to see ellie before she left for hogwarts she felt that allison had been almost hiding from her the last week or so but then again both allison and herself had been so busy lately what with new jobs and boyfriends and all a few hours passed before lily decided she needed a coffee break meanwhile james was sitting in a large room with the other nine elites mad eye moody was standing in the front of the room looking as severe as ever today he started we will be pairing you off the person you are paired with will be your partner for the rest of the program if your partner is to fall in battle and to die then you shall fight on and we will pair off the living when we can james had to bite his tongue from asking if that was at all likely they were just in a classroom after all but he knew that just how moody was overly cautious overly dramatic he took the time to look around the room at his possible partners one he thought he recognized from the order meeting the other night she was of average height muscular and had bobbed brown hair james found her features severe but slightly charming as she did have dimpled cheeks and a kind face moody began listing off partners and james only looked up when his name was called potter and meadowes the girl james had noticed smiled wistfully at moody before trotting over to where james stood she extended her hand and looked up at james her fierce brown eyes staring him dead in the eye james shook her hand and then smiled his winning ear to ear grin hullo i dorcas meadowes her eyes suddenly became more kindly and she smiled showing off her dimples james potter pleasure to meet you finally we have been training for a few days after all james replied you look familiar surely you didntjust get out of hogwarts james hoped she hadn t he should have known her if that was the case dorcas shook her head no i graduated five years ago i ve been doing odd end jobs for dumbledore for a few years and i decided to apply for the auror program and i got this james nodded you still look familiar before james could enquire any further moody spoke up again become acquainted with your partner often they will be the only thing that stands between your life and death but dontbecome too personally attached for they can fall as fast as they can stand james couldnthelp but chuckle as dorcas rolled her eyes moody is a brilliant man but slightly off his rocker dumbledore holds him in the utmost respect she said so does my father dorcas eyes brightened i knew it you are sam potter son he a brilliant auror himself but i daresay they work him too hard you know my father james asked energetically dorcas nodded yes i ve done some small tasks for him as well as plenty of other aurors on dumbledore orders mostly again before james could reply moody interrupted them now today we will be practicing how to defend yourself and your partner if need be from the three unforgivable curses james sighed he was sure to get an excruciating workout it wasntuntil lily returned from her lunch break that she received a response from allison lily excitedly tore it open and began to read lily it nice to hear from you yes i d love to meet up with you sometime how about tuesday night dinner at my place and then maybe we could go out for a drink how the new job going by the way i hope this isntinterrupting your work well write me back a time that good for you have a good day love allison lily folded allison carefree note and put it in her desk drawer she sounded so pleasant like nothing wicked was happening in the world with a final sigh lily went back to reading through the mass folders which she was glad to say making rapid pace through the cases she was studying were absolutely intriguing and it didnttake her long before she became absorbed in the files before it was time to go home james you didnthave to walk me to allison s she only lives a few blocks away lily insisted as she and james reached allison flat building tuesday evening james gave her his goofy grin and kissed her full on the lips yes i did this time of evening you never know what going on these days and you know the precautions no apparation in muggle villages his tone was joking but his words were full of seriousness lily kissed him back well thank you but you went completely out of your way no i didn t james argued lightly not for you you rushed from training to your flat to change your clothes to make me think that you werentin a rush and then you rushed over to my flat so we could then rush over here you re right james said i did go out of my way now appreciate me he grinned at her and she smiled helplessly at him before turning and pressing the button that let her up to allison s before she could get through the door however james pulled her around and kissed her again when they broke away lily just grinned at him i ll see you later tonight james now go get something to eat you ve got to be starving i am starving go to dinner with me james said with pleading eyes loosing the effect as he burst into laughter at lily face go away potter i am i am she heard james mumble as she made her way through the door lily sighed again before hearing allison voice come on to the intercom type device yes her voice greeted allison it lily lily replied feeling slightly silly talking to a wall lily allison exclaimed come right up lily smiled to herself as the doors opened and she climbed up the stairs to allison flat allison was waiting for lily by her door and rushed to lily and pulled her in a fierce hug when she finally let go allison was beaming up at her blonde hair flailing about her head wildly how have you been lily smiled good how about yourself allison grinned great come in the pasta is ready she then ushered lily in still beaming and then led lily into the kitchen where the impressive smells of allison good cooking emitted into the whole apartment making lily stomach which was still tight with nerves for the pending conversation with allison lurch with hunger allison began dishing the noodles followed by a meaty sauce onto two plates and lily looked around the flat there were pictures of allison and jacob together jacob and ellie the rest of jacob family some of allison s and then a picture of allison lily and ellie together in their fourth year lily grinned as she saw the picture her hair was done in braids and it was clear that allison had just done her makeup as lily typically didntwear too much of it and she had eye shadow flowing from her eyelid to her temples allison and ellie were laughing hitting each other with pillows and her fourteen year old self was trying to make peace ready allison exclaimed grinning at lily lily smiled and took a seat the meal progressed slowly with allison talking in a bubbly happy voice about jacob and then asking lily about her job and then james then the other marauders all of which lily answered with a polite smile finally lily managed to ask allison about her job at the daily prophet oh it going brilliantly allison replied ecstatically they actually published a story of mine a few days ago lily nodded and took a sip of her water now was the time yeah i saw that allison seemed to become even more excited and continued to talk did you really how did you like it the writing it was a short piece but i did my best lily expression became serious as she looked into allison eyes ceasing her chatter the writing was great allison but you dontreally believe what you wrote do you lily winced inwardly as she heard her words she knew instantly this was not going to end well but it had to be said allison cleared her throat almost nervously before looking at the ground and then back at lily her eyes set yes i do the ministry says so i mean barty crouch they say he going to be minister someday i have to believe it the ministry and the prophet stand behind it lily took another sip of her drink before talking again allison surely you know that there more death eaters than that surely you know the ministry isntexactly on top of everything remember what dumbledore said remember his invitation to the order the group that organized because the ministry obviously isnton top of everything her last few words had an almost desperate quake to them and allison looked away so that what this is about you re mad that jake and i haventsigned our lives away to an organization that deliberately interfering with the ministry work allison then looked directly into lily green eyes her blue ones piercing into lily soul lily felt herself loosing the battle she felt herself grow less confident it was one thing to argue heatedly with an enemy it was an entirely different thing to verbally battle with one of your best friends a girl lily had roomed with for seven years but allison kept talking and lily anger soon took over all doubt and that organization it a death wish do you want to die lily the ministry has everything under control there no reason for us to risk our lives to this this cause when we would be better served just going on with our normal lives he who lily standing up and facing her friend cut her off abruptly no reason allison no reason you arentstupid i cantbelieve you re believing all this this ministry propaganda bullshit cantyou see that whatever the hell they re doing if they re doing anything isntworking cantyou see that the rare number of deaths and disappearances that the paper does report is still shocking you cantsee the world tumbling down around us are you mad lily took a breath and she stared at allison who not used to being at the receiving end of the wrath of lily evans was practically in shock lily felt her face and knew it was absolutely scorching from her rage she settled her voice to a calmer tone and started talking once more and as for the order allison the order is going to stop voldemort if it means sacrificing my life to stop voldemort i ll do it because that how much it worth she then turned to grab her bag with every intention of storming out on her friend lily we re so young we just arentready allison voice trembled and lily was forced to stop and turn around and look at her this is so much i dontwant to see you lose your life lily please lily think it through lily let out a long sigh and shook her head my mind is about as made up as yours allison i hope you ll see differently i hope both you and jacob will join allison then stood up you dontknow what you re getting into lily she exclaimed lily raised her eyebrows and you do yes i do my cousins gideon and fabian prewett they re in the order they tell me what they ve been through not everything but still they practically have a close encounter with death every time they take a turn down an alleyway i know i not ready for it i dontthink we re old enough lily listened to allison words for a moment she had forgotten allison was related to gideon and fabian two top aurors that both james and sirius had a great deal of respect for i ve made up my mind lily said with finality she then picked up her purse and headed for the door i ll owl you later allison allison merely waved her off and began clearing the not so empty plates without a word lily shook her head and began to walk towards her flat against the dreary rain that had just begun to fall not feeling at all better when she had returned james had been waiting for her at her flat charlotte and sirius had helped him prepare a dinner for himself and they were in a heated game of exploding snap when she interrupted them james could tell by her red cheeks puffy eyes and sopping wet hair that things had not gone well he pulled her into a gentle hug and when she released dried her hair with the tip of his wand what happened james asked quietly as he led her into the sitting room and to the sofa charlotte returned with a mug of tea for lily and she and sirius took their game into the kitchen sensing that lily and james needed to be alone but eavesdropping all the same lily held in any tears and smiled weakly at james before describing the events of the evening special thanks to shawn small58 sharp tongued iamsoap stephanie xoxoxo star child complicated123 whitecamellia official cheeky devil heather gernenz chikichiki glowing ice blvd jude

comforted her for a few hours the previous night before she insisted on his leaving he had training first thing after all and lily was in considerably higher spirits noticing that it was only quarter to six lily decided to study over some case files before getting a quick dinner and then going to hogwarts to meet mcgonagall james of course had insisted on taking her as far as the classroom and had decided to come over at seven thirty lily always so independent and bold thought he was being ridiculous but appreciated it nonetheless seven thirty approached quickly as lily absorbed herself in her work and was startled when she noticed it was quarter past seven and she hadnteaten anything yet james arrived at exactly fifteen minutes later trying to look as fresh as possible but the large bags under his eyes told lily just how tired he was she greeted him with a kiss which he happily accepted and they set off they found themselves outside their old transfiguration room at five minutes to eight james hadntspoken much signaling his exhaustion you all right james lily asked before entering mcgonagall classroom james nodded stifling a yawn and grinning at lily we just had a lot of physical training today bloody exhausting he replied well this will probably only last an hour or so so if you d like to have dessert or something we could but i understand if you re too tired she smiled up at him her red hair flowing down her shoulders and her green eyes twinkling james leaned in and kissed her softly sorry love i think i need my rest he smiled apologetically but lily just beamed back at him i knew you were exhausted potter why didntyou just admit it because that would be no fun i wouldntget to see you tease me because you know i find it absolutely sexy when you do he gave her a wink before she hit him lightly i ve got to go see mcgonagall you get some sleep lily said in a quiet serious tone james nodded and saluted her yes ma am she went to hit him again but james was too quick and dodged her hand he grinned at her once more before planting a quick kiss on her lips and turning around to head back to the hog head have fun shnuckums lily let out a light laugh before shaking her head and opening the door where professor mcgonagall was waiting patiently for her hello lily professor mcgonagall greeted her in kind yet somehow prevailing severe manner good evening professor lily replied with a smile partly from common politeness and partly from the butterflies james had left her with shall we begin mcgonagall asked after a moment pause lily nodded energetically alright then let bring your skills up to par i going to ask you to do simple basic spells you use the same form with your eyes but this time dontsay the incantation go back to how you first learned from sixth year and incorporate it with wandless magic lily nodded again and began to concentrate with a furious determination she was going to get this right professor mcgonagall smiled once more before placing a single feather on her desk please transfigure this into a pillow lily nodded and took a deep breath before blinking her eyes and focusing not uttering a word she turned the feather into a pillow professor mcgonagall smiled appraisingly at her now we ll do it again lily nodded by now she knew that all her private lessons had one thing in common repetition xx james entered the old garage that was filled with all sorts of automotive junk in the center of it all was his work in progress the ford thunderbird convertible he sighed and rubbed the back of his neck he had changed into an old gray tee shirt and some old jeans that were already covered in grease stains before he set out to work james hadntbeen working for five minutes when he was interrupted sirius appeared in front of him tailed by a smiling remus and peter hullo prongs sirius greeted with a grin as he searched through the toolbox padfoot what are you all doing here james asked it was a thursday evening and he was exhausted he expected his friends to be the same sirius shrugged lily birthday is in three days and you arentnearly finished yet we thought you might need some help james grinned at his three friends before letting out a small yawn thanks peter made his way over to the car and looked at it for a minute before going to find some tools for himself james was about to question him but stopped himself peter probably knew what he was doing it was rare but peter did have some useful skills and sometimes he even surprised himself with his own cunning remus with tired bags under his eyes approached james smiling all the same james nodded and patted remus on the back full moon in a few days james stated we ll be there remus smiled thankfully you guys really donthave to i mean know that you guys are working you are already so tired nonsense sirius interrupted monday night we ll be in james basement as always it wontbe an inconvenience remus asked again uncertainly james shook his head no moony of course not besides lily and i are going to have dinner here monday anyways we re telling my parents about our engagement james added proudly remus smiled and shook his head i still cantbelieve it i know james replied with a tone that suggested that he really was in a state of disbelief i mean prongs got evans sirius added his eyes suddenly became brilliant and playful have you shagged her yet james laughed if i had do you really think i d bloody tell you sirius gave the most sincere face he could muster yes you d tell all of us remus and peter were now grinning at james you haven t have you peter asked james couldntresist anymore and just smiled and shook his head no we haven t not like it any of your business and lily would probably kill me for telling such personal information sirius raised his eyebrow well charlotte seems to think you have james remembering sunday just laughed that because charlotte walked in on us having breakfast honestly she too nosy and assuming for her own good well that what it looked like sirius added somewhat defensively james just chuckled more and began working on the car no it looks like you and charlotte are shagging each other james grinned wickedly before ducking under the car to avoid sirius grasp remus just chuckled softly and peter fidgeted with his tools in concentration take that back sirius exclaimed half yelling half laughing no james replied boldly because it true sirius just shot him a glare folded his arms and stood silently for a minute before smiling to himself well if you donthave a problem with it sirius said finally james let out a laugh oh bloody hell padfoot is that what you ve been worried about sirius gave him a dark look well i know how protective you are over charlotte she like a sister to you yeah padfoot and she also as wild as you are and i gave up long ago worrying about her she does what she does and she has sense and i deal with that james stated before laughing again and it you why would i care about you dating her you re like a brother to me i trust you i know you dontdo anything stupid intentionally sirius gave an admirable look to james before giving him a brief hug and then looking away james let out another small chuckle before getting to work on the car remus then appeared beside him holding instructions on how to repair a carburetor i think you re doing that wrong prongs remus said in a calm voice as he studied the map containing the inner workings of a carburetor james walked over and as he stood a few inches above remus looked over his shoulder at the instructions well i ll be damned i am doing that wrong thanks moony remus just nodded and continued to look over the instructions before helping james peter worked silently at the hood of the car insisting that he knew how to install an invisibility booster sirius meanwhile worked on the interior of the car with his wand claiming lily would love blue leather to match the pending paint job and that the muggles didntmake cars go nearly as fast as they should while he fiddled with the speedometer three hours later and the car was practically complete the only thing missing was a nice coat of baby blue paint which james had picked out himself at the local hardware store stifling a yawn james stretched it looking good guys thanks for all the help no problem sirius stated brightly james suspected he was still delightful about his approval yeah really it was nothing remus added although he looked just as worn out as ever peter just smiled glad to have been of use well we better get home james said after a few tired minutes i ll see you he motioned to remus and peter monday come by for dinner first we re going to have a sort of dinner celebration party peter and remus both nodded and then apparated back to their separate homes peter at his parents and remus at flourish and blotts let be off prongs sirius said finally james nodded before checking his watch i suppose it too late to stop by and see lily yeah and we have training in the morning sirius grumbled as he followed james out of the garage xx very good lily professor mcgonagall commented after an hour of practicing silently lily smiled and wiped the line of sweat that was forming on her brow professor mcgonagall checked her watch and then nodded i d say that enough for tonight lily placed her wand in her robe pocket and grinned back up at her old professor all right we ll schedule again at the next meeting which i d say will be in the next week or so she continued as she straightened some things at her desk i ll be waiting for the owl then lily replied yes yes mcgonagall continued her voice had something lily rarely heard in her tone an awkward willingness to continue conversation is there anything else professor lily tried diverting her eyes to the floor well yes mcgonagall said quietly in an almost motherly tone lily you and james and your

made her way out of the classroom as she walked down the halls of her old school her stomach lurched as she thought of the professor words she didntwant to lose her youth in the war and she was

tonight we need to talk about tomorrow owl me back when you get a chance i love you shnuckums james folded the note in his hand and scrambled around his parents garage as he searched for a scrap piece of parchment and a quill finding what he was looking for he wrote lily a quick reply that he would be over after a shower and patted ralph on the head before he set out on his journey james stretched and put his hand through his hair as he looked at lily ford thunderbird convertible now a beautiful shade of baby blue he sirius remus and peter had worked on it constantly the last few days and now it was actually finished he had rushed home from training just to make sure everything was intact before he gave it to lily tomorrow and was now heading back to his flat before rushing to lily for what was sure to be a delicious meal when james arrived at lily s he was overwhelmed with the aromatic waves wafting from the kitchen it was obvious that lily had been busy all day james lily exclaimed as he walked in she greeted him with an awkward kiss holding the knife as far away as possible while still being able to embrace james james grinned and chuckled is it safe to let you walk around with a knife in your hand or are you just ready to attack any intruders that have the guts to enter your flat lily smirked you really shouldnttease a woman with a knife in her hand potter you really shouldntleave your door unlocked like that lily james replied in a more serious demeanor lily let out a sigh as she walked back to the kitchen james tailing her at a safe distance as lily loved to talk with motions and she was currently holding a knife sharp enough to dismember any part of him i knew you were coming honestly i only unlocked it a few minutes ago it not like the apples are going to let just any stranger come up here you know that not what i mean james replied in a hushed voice causing lily to turn around and give him a solemn look i know i promise i ll lock it from now on and put a few charms on as well it was only this one time james honestly james just gave her a small smile as they entered the kitchen and focused his attention to the food being prepared as any hungry young man was likely to do i ve fixed pork chops lily said with a quick blink levitating the top covering the pan of simmering pork chops with her bright eyes james didntknow whether to be more fascinated by the food or by lily talent he decided to smile at her the pork chops look delicious are you practicing your optic magic no actually i was just darting my eyes around the place looking like a fool for absolutely no reason lily replied with a sarcastic smile causing james heart to speed up and flutter with laughter dinner is ready james nodded and began helping her carry the food out onto the table it was when he saw the table set for two that he realized charlotte wasntthere where charlotte lily gave a secret smile she out with sirius ah james replied as he took his seat i believe sirius did mention something about that what did he say what going on between them lily energetically asked with a girlish way about her james laughed at her amusement with the situation and explained what sirius had said to her leaving a few of sirius choice words out for sirius sake and his he highly doubted lily would like him talking about their sexual status with anyone it was a private matter after all over the course of dinner they laughed at sirius and charlotte secrecy talked about work and joked about exactly how petunia would react to their marriage it was only when james realized there was barely anything left on his plate when he realized lily had invited him with a purpose as she began to clear the table james stood up and helped her while at the same time continuing the conversation so was there something specific you wanted to talk about tonight about tomorrow he asked as lily levitated the dirty plates and glasses into the sink with the slightest of clanks and began bringing chocolate pudding out of the refrigerator james shortly occupied with the chocolate pudding focused his attention back to lily when she began to reply yes actually hold on she quickly placed the pudding and dishes on the table before dashing to her room and returning with a piece of parchment quill and a bottle of emerald colored ink james only raised his eyebrows as he returned to his seat intent on eating the pudding and listening to lily at the same time right well i was thinking about how to tell the news to my parents and i realized we need to have a response if they start flooring us with questions do you really think that likely james asked light heartedly even as his stomach began clenching with butterflies lily nodded with the most seriousness james had seen in her all night yes knowing my parents i just dontwant to be caught off guard lily explained as she watched james move his hand slightly to force the spoon to serve the pudding onto their dishes show off lily grinned and continued i think we ve just got to ask ourselves some questions about marriage to get some answers prepared james nodded while he spooned the dessert into his mouth and listened lily nodded responsively and began to talk again i think the first thing we have to ask ourselves is where we re going to live i know i have this flat on lease for a year so there still a good six months or so i going to have to find a flat mate for charlotte and then there your flat lily started writing down the question asked and prepared to write down their options james grinned as lily scrawled and he reached his hand over to put a lock of hair behind her ear that was threatening to fall into the inkbottle lily looked up and smiled back as he spoke we ll just have to look for some flat mates for sirius and charlotte i think remus could live with sirius and maybe grace with charlotte and as for where we re going to live i d like to buy a house for us lily raised her eyebrows at james presumptuousness are you sure we can afford a house james nodded doggedly yes i mean my parents have given me all sorts of saving bonds and such for an occasion like this and i working it wontbe a big place just a small cozy cottage maybe in the country a broad smile shimmered on lily face as she thought of a peaceful white cottage with a garden for her and james to share i like that idea if you re sure we can afford it and that it worth it of course it worth it it for us for you you re worth everything lily and so much more he gave her his silly grin and began eating again and lily smiled to herself as she jotted down the response as the evening pressed on they were able to touch a wide variety of topics dealing with married life and lily and james found themselves feeling excited and hopeful by the end of the evening they were certain life was going to be just perfect the parchment was full of their plans and dreams and lily smiled as she looked over it as james cleaned up the kitchen with a few half hazard swishes of his wand all done james announced triumphantly grinning and folding his arms proudly lily laughed as she placed the parchment back on the table and embraced james with a warm hug and a tender kiss i should help clean up more often james observed as they broke apart smiling like the fool he was lily swatted him playfully before her eyes lit up let go for a walk in the park james grinned and soon found himself following lily down the streets of london until they got to what lily claimed to be the best park in the city james just laughed and cooperated and as he looked at her he knew tomorrow was going to be one of the best days of his life and that everything would work out james had left lily two minutes after midnight after being the first to wish her a very happy eighteenth birthday it was now six in the morning and james had apparated to his parents house to pick up lily car and then drive it to london to pick her up he would have liked to have picked up the car and gotten away unnoticed by his parents but knowing his mother and father it had been impossible james is that you he heard his mother clad in a nightgown and robe call as she appeared on the back lawn watching james drive the car from the garage james sighed and put the car in park before going to meet his mother morning mum he greeted her with a hug what are you doing out here so early a questioning look passed over her striking yet tired features before realization hit her oh that right it lily birthday hold on i have something for her it can wait mum we re going to be over tomorrow night for dinner like i told you i ve really got to go we re due at lily parents for lunch and it a two hour drive to london from here and another two hour drive to surrey james replied in the most polite yet anxious manner his mother ignored him and continued on her way to the house monday isntlily birthday james she needs her present today james let out a sigh of impatient exasperation but let his mother run in the house to grab her gift she appeared minutes later with an elaborately wrapped package she handed it to james and then smiled that from your father and i tell lily i said happy birthday she said james took the present and nodded yes mum i ll see you tomorrow he then put the gift in the car and opened the driver side door when his mother stopped him yet again you look nice james she smiled james couldnthelp but blush a little he had put on a bright royal blue shirt with a dashing black tie with matching black pants drive safely james nodded and continued on his way appearing at lily door approximately two hours later happy birthday shnuckums james said as he greeted her with a kiss by the doorway she looked lovely as usual with her thick red hair cascading down her shoulders and wearing a pretty light blue summer dress james felt lily grin into him as they kissed and when they broke apart lily was smiling i so excited are you ready to go she asked with such an energy that it surged into james as well so that he felt that it was his birthday as well yes but you re going to have to close your eyes i have a surprise for you james said he pulled out a bright red handkerchief lily eyes sparkled with excitement and she beamed what have you done james potter nothing it just a small surprise now put this on lily put her hands on her hips in a playful way i know you potter there no such thing as small with you just turn around james persisted lily sighed and relaxed her arms to her sides as she turned around and closed her eyes james smiled to himself as he tied the blindfold around her head and then turned her to face him ready lily smiled and showed her white teeth i need my purse and coat i ll get them for you just stay right there where are they on the couch lily replied as she wiggled in the one spot teasing james by looking like she was going to move but never daring to she was clumsy enough with sight as it was james appeared behind her moments later with her purse and coat in tow he then locked the door behind them and led lily down the stairs and to her new car with caution lily laughed to herself as they made the slow trip people are going to think you re robbing and kidnapping me james chuckled as well i am just hold me for a good ransom at least a million galleons and here i was thinking you could go for half of that james teased as the noise of the street abused their ears as they exited the building james walked lily to his parking spot and held her still with his arms around her waist as he whispered into her ear ready lily smiled as long as you arentabout to push me into traffic yes james chuckled as he undid her blindfold and let it fall carelessly to the sidewalk he heard lily gasp as she opened her eyes james is this for me she asked astonished by the baby blue convertible sitting just inches from her touch no the present inside is james replied with sarcasm of course it for you i donthave any other fianc e to restore and customize american cars for lily elbowed him playfully and turned around to kiss him james obliged happily and let his arms travel around and down her waist this is too much james she whispered james smiled it not enough i love you and come on you ll look beautiful driving this car i really can she asked excitedly yes james replied as he held out the keys to her let go lily let out a small squeal as she climbed into the car as james walked to the passenger side door and let himself in three hours later after much in james opinion narrow escapes with death two run traffic lights and three times getting lost the arrived in lily old neighborhood bloody hell lily i thought you would be a good driver james teased as they started to make their way down a familiar street lily chose to ignore him with no response except for the smallest twitches of a threatening smile playing on her face they pulled into lily drive and james let out an over exaggerated sigh of relief thank merlin we made it alive and with all our limbs rejoice lily oh love he chuckled lily tried to glare at him but it was hopeless she turned off the engine and unbuckled her seat belt before turning to james with a smile ready she asked in a quiet almost timid tone james nodded and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek yes let go lily grinned quickly reached the back of her neck unlatched the back of her necklace and slid her engagement ring off the silver chain before delicately placing it on her left ring finger james grinned back at her and they made their way to the doorstep she turned the doorknob and let james in and walter her old lovable cat out lily dear is that you they heard mrs evans call from the kitchen yes mum we re here lily replied as she placed her coat and purse on the coat rack beverly evans appeared in the living room wearing an apron and smiling in a welcome motherly fashion before pulling them both into hugs and kissing their cheeks happy birthday dear she said to lily before turning her attention to james and i swear you ve grown another foot since i saw you last james smiled back at her with his face tingeing slightly red you two should really stop by more you arentthat far away you know lily mother commented as she made her way back to the kitchen lily looked at james before following her mother into the kitchen i write at least once a week where dad ms evans shuffled around the kitchen oh he outside doing something or another and when you write it only a sentence or two at least write longer letters all right mum lily obliged as she helped her mother set the table james stood in the kitchen awkwardly looking around for something to do when he heard mr evans come in the front door who car is out in the driveway bev he called out what car ms evans replied walking back to the living room as she hadntnoticed any odd car lily and james exchanged a look before smiling and following lily mother back into the living room like they were playing some sort of child tag game it mine dad lily said proudly james gave it to me for my birthday mr evans seemed to notice his daughter and her boyfriend for the first time as he turned his attention to her and then to james with the slightest of suspicious looks yes he fixed it up and painted it for me lily said standing closer to james james nodded that right sirius peter and remus helped too of course patrick evans raised an eyebrow are those mechanics a look of confusion passed over to james as he glanced at lily what was a mechanic um they re friends is it safe has it been inspected he asked yes sir it safe i wouldntlet lily in anything that was dangerous i inspected it with a few spells i know mr evans nodded approvingly and then smiled at james before patting him on the back it nice to see you james hope lily hasntdriven you mad lily rolled her eyes at her father nice to see you too dad patrick smiled at his youngest daughter well i suppose we should go on with lunch then it not every day a man youngest daughter turns eighteen i need a drink beverly chuckled at her husband the food ready she then turned to lily petunia and vernon werentable to come they had some important dinner for vernon work she dreadfully sorry and says to wish you a happy birthday lily scoffed i sure she did the fact that her sister and ignoramus brother in law werentthere for the meal only lifted lily spirits and she dragged james into the dining room for lunch taking their seats lily mother smiled broadly at her as she began to dish food onto her daughter plate lily shook her head and just laughed mum you haventput food on my plate since i was like ten lily protested lightly lily mother just shook her head you donteat enough honestly put some meat on those bones i have plenty of meat on my bones lily said somewhat self consciously as she looked down at her soft stomach and touched it lightly lily had never thought herself particularly pudgy but she wasntjust a bag of bones either james just smiled at her and then mrs evans began to pile food on his plate as well but james didntbother protesting this looks lovely beverly james commented as he looked down at the delicious pork chops lily had fixed only last night for him lily got james attention by placing her hand softly on his knee james looked up with surprise and they shared a smile james eyeing the pork chops and lily knowing he would never grow tired of them i just know how you love them mrs evans replied with a smile i hope you like everything else james nodded approvingly as he started to eat the noodle salad in front of him patrick evans just ate quietly and beverly felt the need to develop conversation so lily what are you doing tonight for your birthday she asked going out with friends lily dabbed her lips with her napkin and thought for a moment she hadntyet made up with allison but she hadntseen ellie in a few weeks sure they corresponded often but they hadntactually spent time together since june i think so it depends what time we get back tonight beverly nodded before you leave dontlet me forget to give you your presents and the cake it lovely lily smiled have i ever let you forget my presents no but eighteen that getting on up there patrick replied quick wittedly you ll start forgetting things soon lily stuck out her tongue at her father causing him to laugh james to chuckle and beverly to scold her that not polite dear lily grinned at her mother and continued to eat lunch passed by with loving conversation and many laughs and soon lily helped her mother clear the table and set the place for the birthday cake the cake is delicious mum lily complimented as she took another bite from her slice as james tried discreetly reaching for another piece mrs evans caught him however and piled a large slice onto his plate causing mr evans to laugh and james to thank her repeatedly once the cake started to disappear lily realized they needed to tell her parents she caught james eye and he nodded lily smiled at her mother and father and james cleared his throat beverly and patrick lily and i have an announcement to make he said with a deeper tone lily recognized as the mature tone he used when he used to ask her out james stomach knotted in anticipation and his palms were sweaty out of

in her middle age her ears were already deceiving her we re engaged mum lily said in a tone more courageous than she felt i thought i heard you right she said could you help me bring the cake in the kitchen lily lily excused herself quickly darting her eyes at james as if it wasntobvious her mother was getting ready to have a private conversation with her you re getting married beverly asked in astonishment oh lord you re pregnant she gasped pulling her hand to her mouth no no mum lily insisted trying to hold back any laughter at the severity of the situation i not pregnant are you sure then why are you getting married so early her mother continued so young i am not pregnant mother honestly james and i haventever lily face turned a deep red and she started talking again as her mother recognized what she had been about to say james and i we re in love and we re ready we just feel it mum we know we re young but we re ready for this beverly evans sighed as she looked at her daughter how long have you been engaged she asked lily sighed and looked at the floor her mother wasntgoing to like being lied to she should have seen this coming since graduation beverly evans didntraise her voice at her daughter she didntsay a word except to usher lily back into the dining room saying they d been putting cake away long enough lily returned to see james in deep conversation with her father and patrick evans nodding slightly at what james was saying she took her seat and her mother did so as well so i assume you ve talked about this together then do you two know the responsibilities of marriage james how do you plan to support lily do you know what you re getting yourself into before james could reply to the spanish inquisition patrick evans spoke up surprising both james and lily he got a plan bev they ll be all right he knows what he getting himself into and i think lily does too the best thing for us to do is to approve after all they arenttoo young petunia is only three years older than lily and she got married at twenty two i approve of james he a respectable young man lily loves him and james loves her he gave a quick look to james and james nodded still in shock that patrick was supporting their marriage beverly seemed to be shocked as well as she found herself momentarily speechless very well then i do approve of james lily you have our blessings beverly smiled at her youngest daughter and future son in law before she and lily became absorbed in the decorations for the wedding and patrick tried his best to give james advice on the evans women a little less then an hour later lily found herself back in her new car with a few of her presents this time with james driving are you sure you dontwant to drive james asked her a third time before they were even out of the neighborhood no i a little tired if you dontmind driving that is lily replied with a small yawn james just grinned with a mischief in his eyes lily knew too well no i dontmind check out what sirius and i installed lily eyes widened as she looked at james nothing illegal right james didntreply instead he pressed a button just under the radio and with a small jerk the car spun off at a dangerous speed zipping through traffic like a mouse in a maze james lily exclaimed out of fright and surprise you re going to get us killed james grinned no i won t look i got the idea from the knight bus muggles cantsee us and we re too fast to collide with anything as he was speaking however he was forced to slam on brakes before they rear ended the back of a bus one look from lily and james sighed and pressed the button adjusting the car back to a normal and safe speed oh you re no fun he complained grinning all the same he reached for her hand and stroked it gently as they proceeded back to london we re getting married lily james stated in a tone of wonder and bliss we are and my parents approve lily chimed in happily now we just have to worry about mine james commented in a lower tone they hadntput much thought into telling mr and mrs potter but now the fact that they would be dining with james parents the next night was quite present in their minds you dontthink they ll be upset do you lily asked with worry james smiled at her and shook his head i dontthink so they were fairly young when they were married and they re just fine lily nodded although her stomach was still tense she sighed and looked around the car noticing the beautifully wrapped package in the back seat for the first time what that james she asked as she began to reach for it that for you from my mum and dad i forgot i put it back there go ahead and open it james said casually trying to not let his curiosity show through as he paid attention to the stretch of road before him lily opened the package tenderly wondering what kind of gift awaited her she gasped as she tore the paper books items that would always be on lily gift list did you get something good james asked teasingly i got a book on charms and a magical cookbook and then one for house hold spells and a beautiful knit scarf and hat lily exclaimed as she fingered the mass pile she pulled out the matching scarf and hat and grinned wildly they re beautiful she exclaimed happily the scarf and hat were indeed pretty and well made with yarn of an exotic shade of yellow why in the world did she make you those now it august james commented embarrassed that his mother had given lily birthday enough thought to actually hand make her something so wonderful and at the same time glad that his mother approved enough of her to put the energy into it lily shrugged as she put on the big floppy hat and wrapped the scarf around her neck playfully oh it ll be cold soon enough these are so fun she giggled james looked at her and couldnthelp but to smile at her she looked so adorable and happy that his heart warmed for the moment he was able to watch her before turning his careless attention back to the road they look pretty on you he said simply enough lily smiled as she played with the scarf and sank back into her seat as she went through her new charms book i ll have to thank your mother when i see her tomorrow maybe i could make something from the cookbook oh wouldntthat be wonderful she exclaimed in thought before switching her books i sure she d love that james replied as they entered the traffic packed roads of london and made their way back to lily flat james smiled as he drove perfectly content being with lily he parked her new car outside of her apartment building and helped her out of the car shall we james said smiling as he offered her his hand only if you help me bring in these things lily replied holding her books out to james who took them happily as she made sure her hat was safely placed on her head and her scarf tight around her neck silly lily james commented in a sing song voice lily laughed and led the way to her flat they entered the dark flat together and james his hazel eyes bright with mischief came up behind lily put his hands over her green eyes lily tried to question him but james responded with a simple hush and lily closed her mouth tight on the count of three james whispered in her ear lily heart rate sped up at his voice what was going on one he said lightly blowing in her ear two his breath tickled her cheek and she giggled james smiled broadly before one final whisper three her black pupils shocked with the sudden burst of light shrunk to a miniscule size and lily gasped the entire flat was done in pastel shades of blue yellow violet and green streamers lined the walls and ceiling balloons of all shapes floated about and best of all her group of friends were standing in the room beside her she was immediately flanked by ellie and allison the latter pulling her into a tight hug i sorry for fighting but please let understand each other and get along allison said her blue eyes pleading with lily bright green ones lily nodded yes i d really miss you if you decided to never speak to me again i sorry ellie smiled at the both of them in their apology but lily had soon tackled her into a great embrace ellie i haventseen you in forever lily exclaimed well whose fault is that ellie said with a laugh miss i have a job lily pouted i sorry we haventbeen in better touch but we ll have to hang out as much as possible before you go to school you can help me plan the wedding and with her words the girls were launched into the exciting topic of holy matrimony the evening passed by happily full of much catching up laughs drinks and fun at one that morning lily james and charlotte had to convince their friends to leave as quiet as possible the apples might complain and charlotte and lily couldntafford to live anywhere else at the moment sirius left last behind remus and grace who lily found to be quite funny and entertaining once she opened up a little i ll see you in a few prongs sirius said before belching loudly causing the three remaining to make faces of disgust well i think i will unless you and evans here have something planned he gave a cheesy wink to lily who rolled her eyes at his antics james told him to shut up which he seemed to take to heart as he didntsay a word after but lily thought that might have had more to do with his mouth being occupied with charlotte until the moment he apparated home charlotte breathless excused herself to the kitchen to help clean up are you sure you dontneed any help cleaning up around here sirius peter and i did make quite a mess lily smiled at him well the food fight wasntexactly the cleanest game to play but i think i can manage a scourgifing spell or two your mother did give me that book i can use it she laughed lightly and besides you have to be up early for training you have to work first thing tomorrow james argued come on i ll help he made the motion to pass lily into the sitting room to start cleaning but lily put her hand up to his chest to stop him he looked down at her green eyes and raised his eyebrows in question james precious charlotte and i have it if you stay i worried you ll be more of a distraction than help before he could open his mouth to protest lily covered it with her lips and began kissing him letting her hand rest on his chest while his reached for her hips they broke apart eventually and james nodded i ll go i ll see you tomorrow evening though want me to pick you up lily nodded i ll see you at six we can apparate over right yes since it to a magical village we ll be fine i ll see you then happy birthday love she grinned at him and gave him one more quick kiss thanks for everything james i love you it nothing if it makes you happy good night james made his way for the door but lily playful words stopped him it good morning james james beamed at her and nodded before turning the handle and making his way down the stairs as discreetly as possible the next evening james knocked on lily door at ten till six lily rushed around her flat frantically searching for her blouse charlotte laughed at her as she spooned yogurt into her mouth lily glared at her answer the door please and distract him for a few minutes she exclaimed as she scurried from her sitting room where fresh laundry lay scattered from lola play she found the light green blouse slightly wrinkled but otherwise fit for wearing a groan escaped her why didntjames realize that when she said six she meant six ten didnthe know girls werentready until the last minute she buttoned up the blouse and reached for her wand producing a charm to remove the crevasses in the shirt she heard james deep voice giving greetings to charlotte who was successfully distracting him with conversation lily silently thanked her and rushed to her room where she put a brush through her hair changed her earrings and then checked her reflection once more content for the moment she smiled at herself before greeting james you look beautiful james said as he greeted her with a kiss on the cheek and your hair smells good like flowers lily laughed as she grabbed her purse and a cake she had made ready james checked his watch and smiled six o clock right on time lily gave him a look of exasperation did you plan it like that james nodded he knew that lily never started getting ready until the moment he arrived yes charlotte are you sure you dontwant to come sirius will be there peter and remus too charlotte shook her head no i ve got some paperwork to do tell your parents and sirius i said hello will do james replied cheerfully before offering lily his arm we ll be off have a good night lily gave charlotte a final smile before leaving her to her thick folders full of parchment good evening greeted margaret potter in a lively happy tone as she hugged lily and james lily smiled at her future mother in law hello how are you margaret mrs potter smiled kindly at lily her eyes were tired but glistening her skin smooth yet cracking with wrinkles she looked worn but happy i am well dear and how are you keeping james out of trouble i hope the best i can but you know it impossible to keep him out of mischief entirely especially when he gets with sirius mrs potter chuckled as james sighed and took off his coat i ve been good mum promise is that stew i smell he asked distractedly she nodded the house elves have been preparing a feast for about three hours now come in and take a seat sirius peter and remus are already here with their things in their rooms james nodded how moony a little tired looking but not as bad off as usual dark circles under the eyes but a smile twinkles in them margaret smiled and lily was compelled to address the cake in her arms thanks for the books and that hat and scarf they re so lovely i cantwait for it to get cold i even used one of the recipes chocolate cake lily said with a tone more at ease than she felt oh it looks wonderful we ll have to have it for dessert and i glad you liked the gifts james said you liked charms and cooking so i did my best the books are brilliant i went over recipes during my lunch break lily smiled bashfully oh did you get to the italian ice recipe it one of my favorites margaret replied with youthful energy i looked over it it looked delicious i ll have to make it for you sometime before margaret could reply a chime went off in the kitchen and she excused herself leaving lily and james to follow her james smiled at her and shook his head what lily asked grinning idiotically at him nothing it just sometimes i think you and my mother get along too well he laughed and lily shook her head the full moon is tonight lily inquired more of a statement rather than a question james nodded as he took her hand yes the guys are staying over for the transformation mum let us use the basement she knows about your animagi lily asked with surprise in her voice james parents seemed stern when it came to magical laws especially ones that if broken could result in a permanent stay in azkaban james looked uncomfortable and put his finger over his lips shh no well i haventtold her but she knows the guys stay over occasionally during the full moon for moony i reckon she might know but my father definitely doesn t lily nodded as they entered the kitchen to see sirius and peter clamoring about remus seated quietly by the window watching his two friends with amusement he was as margaret said tired but content at this time samuel potter entered smiled and waved at james and lily and took his seat at the dinner table before margaret insisted they were all eating in the dining room sam got up smiled at them again and made his way to the dining room like mrs potter he looked extremely exhausted but determinedly cheerful james put his hands on lily shoulders and began to massage them casually moony how are you feeling it appeared to be the first time his three friends noticed him and lily they turned to where he stood and nodded in recognition fairly well considering remus said quietly considering what peter foolishly asked in a moment of obliviousness considering he turning into a raging blood thirsty monster in less than sirius checked his watch six hours thanks padfoot remus replied sarcastically glad you re a sensitive bloke sirius grinned charmingly at him before going back to dueling peter with a spoon peter without a spoon or any utensil was trying frantically to curse sirius by tapping his wand against the spoon sirius barked with laughter and the other teenagers couldnthelp but join in does grace know where you are lily asked quietly as she took a seat next to remus he studied lily for a moment before opening his mouth to speak you mean does she know why i here yes i told her he said casually james who had taken the seat next to lily s grinned broadly and patted remus on the back well way to go moony lily smiled how did she take it remus took a sip of water before addressing the question she was a little nervous at first asked a lot of questions she muggle born after all then once she calmed down a bit she smiled apologized for her peculiar behavior and gave me a hug she says she still loves me lily keen ears picked the insecurity in remus mellow voice and do you have any reason to doubt her love remus shook his head no it just kind of hard to trust someone so much you know lily nodded and then looked at james who had been staring intently at her yes but it worth it trust is a great investment remus nodded as mrs potter announced dinner was on the table causing sirius and peter to stop their duel peter wand managed to backfire and shoot a cloud of soot into his flabby face and run to the dining hall the three remaining got up from their chairs and made their way to smell of aromatic food the meal was to everyone liking the boys at the table sam included had at least a second helping of every dish and lily couldnthelp but be tempted by the scalloped potatoes a few times margaret caught her on her third helping and lily looked away guiltily mrs potter just laughed and encouraged her to have as much as she liked when lily anticipated cake arrived she gave james a hinting look that it was time to make their announcement to her surprise james gave her a discreet shake of the head and continued eating his piece of cake this is all quite wonderful lily margaret complimented lily smiled bashfully thanks the recipe was rather simple though sam nodded as he took a sip of his brandy yes the food was delicious it was nice having everyone over too we dontsee all of you around here as often as we d like the teenagers look shamefaced into their empty plates dad we ve all go work and you know sirius and i are in training sam potter nodded in a proud way i know son i proud of the both of you all of you really you are all doing so well the awkward tension that comes with unexpected praise passed after a few moments and soon remus was dismissing himself to go prepare for the night peter and sirius followed insisting that they were sleepy and needed a nap mrs potter began to send the dishes to the kitchen and sam james and lily were left at the dining table sam stretched in his chair looked at his son and lily and then stood up i think i going to go see how your mother is doing in the kitchen james nodded without saying a word and lily sent him a look once sam had left the room lily opened her mouth to speak james we ve got to tell them she whispered urgently james turned and looked at her with sympathetic eyes i know i just lily fiery eyes cooled down at james present state she left her chair and stood behind him and began to massage his neck leaning her head down she whispered in his ear you re nervous james looked up at her with a small smile and sighed i suppose i am we need to tell them though he stood up from his chair gave lily a light kiss and then headed towards the kitchen motioning for lily to wait a few minutes later james sam and margaret entered the room james said there was something you two had to say sam said james took lily hand and nodded lily and i are getting married a quick silence passed through the room sam turned to margaret as if to be assured that he really had heard his son announce an engagement sam smiled at them both for a moment we know james face froze it wasntuntil he felt lily warm fingers in his that he thought to reply you mean just now or have you known how long have you known he stumbled over his inquisitive words without any real authority margaret smiled slightly before speaking up we ve known for about two weeks oh james replied dumbly how did you find out did one of the guys tell sam shook his head no meadows she came up to me about two weeks ago and congratulated me meadows you mean dorcas james asked suddenly he didntrecall ever telling dorcas about his engagement yes she a cute girl rather feisty she done some errands for dumbledore and some aurors in the past she also said what a brilliant auror you were going to make sam eyes sparkled with pride oh james replied quietly before taking his seat back he was trying to work out exactly how dorcas knew his father seemed to think the conversation was over he left the dining room with margaret behind him leaving lily standing quietly in the center of the room she turned to look at james sitting at the table absorbed in his thoughts somehow lily felt betrayed she knew it was a small thing to get upset over but she could not help her emotions james i thought we agreed not to tell anyone but our friends lily said in a quiet tone james woke from his stupor and looked up at her we did i didnttell anyone i dontknow how dorcas knew i didnttell her lily subtle anger however was not eased by his words and who is dorcas my training partner i told you that james said dismissively as he went back to his thoughts i dontremember you ever telling me who your partner was lily replied still quietly but her words were full of ice surely she would remember a name like dorcas james turned back to her i thought i did anyways it doesntmatter she just my training partner he seemed to feel lily coldness now and stood up to face her lily i sorry if i forgot to mention her it just dorcas she went to hogwarts she a few years older than us she got accepted to the elite program and we were paired that all but you told her we were engaged we agreed not to mention it to anyone until our parents knew lily replied her voice rising i didnttell her i told her you were my girlfriend and if it slip that i was engaged to you i dontremember it i sorry that i so ecstatic i canthold it in james barked back in frustration lily eyes softened and there were tears in them james anger ebbed and he moved towards her and pulled her into a warm embrace i sorry lily he whispered as he felt her hot tears splash onto his shirt i sorry lily replied muffled through james shirt james kissed the top of her head and held her a few minutes more before sirius entered the room in his usual disturbing manner lily and james broke apart and turned to look at him seeing that he had interrupted something he grinned sorry lovebirds but prongs it almost dark and these came he handed identical letters to both james and lily i going to go see how moony is feeling but then we really need to get to the basement sirius disappeared as quickly as he came and james and lily looked at their letters addressed in dumbledore loopy writing lily opened hers first followed then by james after scanning over the lines she nodded we ve got a meeting wednesday it sounds important james replied before folding his letter and putting it in his back pocket he looked outside the nearest window to see the sun setting quickly into the horizon he then turned to lily i ve got to go do you want me to apparate you home or your welcome to stay i sure my mother has all sorts of arrangements to discuss with you she always wanted a daughter she practically adopted charlotte lily nodded i think i ll stay for a few minutes and then i ll apparate back i ll be careful so dontworry james smiled and leaned in to give her a long kiss i ll see you tomorrow lily stated with a smile when they broke apart good night lily night james review oh and folks i going to be busy with some major senior

and romantic next poll what is your favorite winter time tradition and do you think snape is evil answer either or both but review chapter fourteen new assignments wednesday came slowly for lily madam bones complimented her on her outstanding performance and effort and then gave lily a completely new set of files to look over and a dozen new cases to document owen scruggs had offered a dozen times to help her but for some reason she found herself rejecting every one of his offers there was something about his manner that lily didntlike almost as if he was too eager all of the time owen scruggs however was the least of her worries her mother had called her four times since charlotte had finally gotten the phone to work wanting to make wedding arrangements as beverly kept reminding her that january was only a few months away and that lily hadnteven picked out her dress yet james had been too busy with training to spend time with her although he had written several sincere apologetic notes and lily was still trying to figure out who dorcas was exactly she knew there was no romantic connection between her fianc and his training partner but lily couldnthelp but feel jealous the time she couldntspend with james was spent with someone else overall she just missed not having the chance to spend every moment in james arms when wednesday evening came lily was ecstatic she would finally have something fresh and interesting to focus on not that she didntlove investigating cases but filing was rather dull she could see most of her friends and she could spend time with james who she was meeting an hour beforehand for a quick dinner at the three broomsticks she got to the pub at six fifty ten minutes earlier than she and james had set the date for but lily was to see him she got them an intimate table away from the windows and normal hustle of the restaurant as she sat there waiting realization dawned on her it had barely been two days since she had last seen james and yet she felt as if she hadnttouched him in years a sense of longing came over her and she dumbly watched the seconds tick by until seven james appeared at two after seven he seemed surprised to see lily already with two glasses of water at the table and looking through a menu she had been so intently looking at the menu as if she didntknow exactly what she and james would order to distract her self from her watch that she jumped when she put the menu down and saw james sitting grinning across from her james chuckled softly i sorry lily lily blushed slightly at her jumpy behavior and smiled i was just looking at the menu here like you didntknow that you were going to order a ham sandwich with lettuce and mustard with chips and a sliced pickle on the side james asked smiling playfully lily frowned as she played with the menu i was hoping to try something a little more exotic like what she scanned the menu for a brief second making it evident to james that hadntreally been reading the list of dishes at all grilled chicken club with swiss cheese she said with a triumphant tone sounds delightful i suppose we re ready to order james said quickly motioning for the waitress to come take their requests a young woman of about twenty hastily appeared and asked what they would like to eat i ll have the ham sandwich with lettuce mustard with chips lily said and then nodded towards james james shook his head and smiled i ll have the same except add onions and mayonnaise to my sandwich when the woman disappeared james looked at lily for a moment before taking a deep breath is there something on your mind he inquired finally lily took a quick sip of her water and shook her head no i fine she lied are you sure james asked again yes i sure she laughed like it was a foolish question why wouldnti be james studied her for a brief second and shrugged you dontseem yourself you just looked over a menu for merlin knows how long and didntget anything other than what you originally would have you re eyes arentsparkling usually they have a twinkle unless you re tired or bothered and you haventsaid much like you re thinking about something what is on your mind lily lily didntknow how to reply she was quiet and lost for words how was she supposed to word exactly what she had to say to him and before she could stop herself she heard herself speaking i falling even more in love with you the words sounded odd to lily yes she loved james but even she was puzzled at acclimation james however just nodded i know exactly what you mean his words were easy and comforting and lily couldnthelp but grin confidently at him as their food came with her feelings liberated lily enjoyed her dinner with james and then they left hand in hand for the meeting please be seated dumbledore echoed through the old classroom immediately after james and lily entered before they could spot their friends james found them two seats in the very back beside an older wizard in a brown cloak that they hadntmet before thank you now i ll call fenwick up to give the reports and we will get started dumbledore said with a respected authority the man named benjy fenwick quickly took over the spotlight and gave a somber smile before reading off the parchment in his hands he who must not be named followers were thwarted by order members a few nights ago as two wizards in dark hoods attacked a muggleborn witch in the hopes of getting information regarding the minister of magic the death eaters were stopped but disappeared before they could be properly captured and turned into respective authorities a muggle bus vanished with three passengers on board three nights ago officials think death eaters may have been behind the attack and several investigations are under way james got the same chill as the last meeting and the same influx of rage pumped through his veins the color drained from lily cheeks and her eyes were sparkling with energy james wordlessly reached for her hand and began to stroke it lily eyes met his and some sort of communication passed through them once benjy was done dumbledore stood and gave his directions for what was to be done he then called several people to see him two being lily and james both surging with curiosity they swiftly walked over to the old headmaster good evening professor lily greeted with her usual friendly but business like manner when it came to teachers james smiled to himself and then greeted dumbledore as well dumbledore smiled at them with the usual twinkle in his eyes three others joined them dumbledore showed the way to his office one witch james seemed to recognize a petite young woman with bobbed brown hair dorcas james greeted with a pleasant smile still holding on to lily hand the petite woman that was walking a few meters ahead of them and steps away from dumbledore turned around at james voices and smiled back hello potter she replied easily coming into stride on the other side of james lily felt herself move instinctively closer to james who put his arm around her but kept his eyes on dorcas i thought i saw you at the meeting last time but i wasntsure dorcas continued her eyes darted around james and she spotted lily who tried to look as friendly as possible you must be lily evans she said rather plainly i ve heard a lot of things about you i dorcas meadows lily nodded yes i ve heard a few things about you too before lily could continue with an inquiry they arrived at the door to dumbledore staircase they followed dumbledore quietly and they entered his office taking respective seats dumbledore took his chair behind the desk and looked at the five people standing before him james looked around the room to see two people he hadntreally noticed before one was the man that had been sitting beside him at the meeting the other was a witch that looked a few years older than him in bright colored robes that he didntrecognize james potter lily evans and dorcas meadows dumbledore pointed out elphias dodge and marlene mckinnon the two groups looked at each other and nodded in recognition without saying a word and dumbledore proceeded i have called you up here because i have a favor to ask each of you dumbledore started the order has a few tasks that need to be carried out as privately and discreetly as possible in front of you is a folder containing your assignment if you have any questions owl me i sorry for such a brief meeting but i have some business in bulgaria that i must attend to before they could blink dumbledore had vanished lily looked down at her lap where a green envelope sealed in a gold binding had appeared as dumbledore disappeared lily looked to james who was fumbling with his but not tearing the gold seal he looked up at lily well if that it are you ready to go or would you like to stop by and see the guys james asked her lily shrugged i think we should probably just go on home usually if dumbledore gives out something so secretively he doesntwant it known to everyone right away and you know how sirius questions james nodded as he thought of all the scenes sirius was capable of making i suppose that best dorcas smiled at them yes sirius does make a ruckus when he wants to doesnthe james raised his eyebrow do you know sirius oh a little bit i remember him from school dorcas explained and i ve bumped into him a few times at the academy lily was about to inquire further when james mentioned that they should probably get going she waved at the three remaining people and left with james i was just about to ask about how she knew about the engagement lily said with exasperation as james clutched on to her hand and they found their way back to the classroom and back down to the hog head i know james said shortly and i thought it best to get out of there before you did something irrational lily stopped walking immediately and pulled her arm away from james just as they returned to the dirty bar what do you mean irrational lily questioned fire burning in her eyes james took a deep breath he had gotten himself into something he wasntsure he could get himself out of i just mean well you seem very frustrated with dorcas and i didntwant you to oh well let your anger sort of well take over and make the situation bad and uncomfortable because dorcas hasntreally done anything lily brow furrowed as james spoke hasntdone anything james she told you father we were engaged but she didntknow not to james retorted and besides i think i know how she found out lily rage lessened with james usual rational calming words how well she mentioned she sees sirius every once in a while i wouldntbe surprised if he let it slip james explained as the attention they had drawn in the bar began to turn itself back to drinking james reached for lily hand again and she didntresist they entered the street of hogsmeade before lily spoke again do you really think he would do that lily asked not on purpose but out of excitement or forgetfulness or something james explained trying to appease his fianc e and defend his best friend at the same time lily nodded quietly well i guess that could make sense but we should really ask sirius i will the next time i see him james promised hugging lily i should really apparate home lily mentioned would you like to have some tea james grinned and nodded and together they apparated to lily flat when they arrived back at lily s she walked to the kitchen and put a kettle on the stove using her eyes and began bustling around the kitchen in search for some biscuits james smiled as she scurried around the kitchen and finally approached her and grabbed her around the waist i not that hungry lily dontworry about the biscuits james commented lily turned around and smiled who says i was worried about you being hungry i famished lily laughed and james couldnthelp but feel his grin broaden he leaned in and kissed her breaking apart after a minute you know what we haventdone in a while he said lily raised her eyebrows playfully what snogged lily folded her arms and pouted i beg to differ we kiss all the time james nodded yes we kiss but lily when was the last time we just snogged lily thought for a moment i cantsay that i know what you re talking about james opened his mouth to argue but lily closed his with hers and began kissing him feverishly before he could say anything many minutes later they resurfaced for air i think the water is ready lily whispered out of breath james nodded slowly and pulled his hands away from her lily poured two cups of tea for them and gave one to james before heading to the sitting room and turning on the television james followed her and took a seat on the couch beside lily outside it began to rain and lily felt herself curl up to james for warmth and comfort it wasntuntil she was in perfectly comfortable position that she remembered the green envelope james she asked as a commercial blared yes he replied rubbing his hands over her sides lily looked at him for a moment have you read what is in your envelope yet james sat up straight no have you lily shook her head before untangling herself from james and rushing towards the kitchen she returned with the identical envelopes and stopped as she looked at them which one was hers and which one was james mine should be a little torn on the gold seal james mentioned rising to meet her lily nodded and handed him the worn one and then tore hers open she read it carefully and found nothing too exciting she was to research and pay careful attention to the cases of carrow and macnair james read his letter and lily watched as his face grew pale what is it lily asked walking to him voldemort using these things called inferi he said after a moment the look of disgust remaining on his face lily pressed his arm what are those they re dead bodies of witches and wizards taken from the grave and possessed with dark magic voldemort uses them as real people real soldiers i ve got to research them and come up with a spell to use against them that sounds dreadful lily commented holding on to james but i sure you can do it you re brilliant james looked down at her and smiled i d better go it getting late and we both have early days tomorrow lily nodded and let him go before he left she gave him a final kiss dontworry james it ll be okay james gave her a final grin and waved i know thanks to the reviewers thanks scooter5710 heather gernenz xxfirephoenixxx dancergrl119 missing summer complicated123 official cheeky devil iamsoap blvc

amantes story the first four years it good it a lily james fic that from their younger days so check it out chapter fifteen summer ends summer was fading rapidly the temperature began to decline slightly the sun shone less and the leaves began to fall from their branches weeks had passed since the last order meeting lily had kept busy with researching case files and doing the work madam bones gave her currently she was standing outside prim and proper a local wedding boutique in surrey she was waiting for her mother and margaret both were eager about picking out lily wedding gown margaret more so as she had never been in a muggle wedding shop before moments later beverly evans pulled up in her car parallel parked and greeted lily with a hug margaret apparated seconds later and greeted lily and beverly with hugs and a kiss on each cheek and then continued to tell them just how excited she was it a good thing we picked saturday james wontbe around she continued i remember when sam and i were getting married he kept appearing at random times trying to catch me off guard when i was looking for my gown but you know the groom is never to see his bride in her dress until the ceremony sam never liked following the rules much a trait james seemed to inherit along with that unruly hair let me tell you there nothing you can do about that hair margaret smiled and had that usual motherly twinkle in her eye and lily couldnthelp but smile there nothing you can do and i thought there was just a grooming spell he hadntdiscovered yet lily replied laughing oh heavens no merlin knows i ve tried to find one even come up with one but it hopeless besides even if there was one i doubt they d use it they think it has some level of attractiveness to it margaret continued while beverly just chuckled to herself about the two women in front of her she ushered them into the shop but they continued talking yes james used to mess up his hair even more when girls were watching especially when i was near i swear he didntknow i hated it so much he thought it made him look like he had just come off his broomstick mrs potter just grinned a clerk nearby raised her eyebrows at the word broomstick and the three ladies burst into giggles the same clerk appeared in front of them instantaneously may i help you she asked politely beverly nodded yes we ve got a bride here and she needs a wedding dress the clerk smiled kindly oh really she looked at the women and then eyed lily are you the lucky girl lily nodded happily yes all right well i think we have some styles that will suit you re fashion and figure down this way she directed them to a corner in the store this is where most young women look first now when the wedding january ninth lily said just as happily well let move you away from the summer selection then the clerk laughed leading them to a wide variety of winter dresses and we have a selection of bridesmaid dresses too if you d like to look there afterwards she added lily smiled kindly we might just do that if it not too late the clerk nodded well let me know if you need any help i ll be around the store the name olivia okay thank you lily replied as soon as the clerk was out of site the three women started looking through the dresses with girlish excitement in thirty minutes they had found five for lily to try on one she thought was absolutely hideous but both margaret and her mother thought it was beautiful so lily thought it best to humor them it took lily twenty minutes to put on the first dress which was a ball gown type with long sleeves and a long train both margaret and beverly heartily approved but lily shook her head after looking in the mirrors it pretty but not quite elegant she said four dresses and an hour later they were down to the hideous dress and lily was frowning this dress was tight fitting and sleek with long flowing sleeves beverly and margaret had to admit that it did not flatter lily curvy figure and gave her permission to take it off lily returned minutes later slightly disheartened but eager to find the perfect dress she stumbled through a dozen more dresses finding nothing before the friendly clerk reappeared excuse me are you lily evans she asked lily nodded in confirmation there someone waiting just outside for you i asked him to come in but he said something about you killing him if he did she looked slightly bewildered and lily just nodded i ll be right out she appeared moments later to see james pacing in front of the boutique james what are you doing here you arentsupposed to she was cut off by james kiss which she returned before pushing him off i serious you arentsupposed to help with the bridal shopping she stated although a smile was pulling at the corners of her lips james nodded i know but i couldntresist and arentyou supposed to be at training she inquired james shook his head lunch break well really james you should probably get going how d you find me in the first place you said you were going wedding dress shopping this morning and my mother asked me last night if i knew where prim and proper was and i just put two and two together and hoped you were still here i was worried there might be some other lily evans in there and she d come out and take me as her husband then what would you do that absurd james lily said trying to sound authoritative but giggling slightly it could have happened i deserve a kiss for bravery he announced pulling her close he leaned in but lily wouldntoblige him with a kiss no you ve got to leave i ll see you tonight before ellie thing james sighed all right did you want to come to my place and then we ll go to jacob and allison s that sounds wonderful lily replied now get back to training james smiled peevishly and pulled out some catalogs from his coat pocket he had remembered not to apparate with his cloak into muggle surrey he just hoped his cloak was still in the leaky cauldron what that she asked taking them from him wedding dress catalogs dontworry i didntlook at them i just thought you might not find something in there and you might be able to in those so james replied grinning oh thank you she exclaimed hugging him doesntthat earn me a kiss james asked playfully lily broke apart from him and grinned impishly nope you ll get your kiss tonight she said before walking back into the boutique james grinned and shook his head that girl is such a tease he muttered smiling all the same before apparating back to the leaky cauldron lily returned and margaret and beverly were shaking there heads and laughing that was james wasntit margaret asked lily blushed and nodded yes he was on his lunch break and tracked me down sometimes he so much like his father that it scares me she added shaking her head she smiled and held up the catalogs he brought me these margaret and beverly both took one and began fingering through them lily searched through one and gasped when she turned to the next page the dress was beautiful slightly summery but beautiful nonetheless it had an a line cut was sleeveless but came with gloves had a princess bodice and a long train in the back the veil was beautifully made so that it flowed around the face but not in front of it the fabric was embroidered with small white flowers on top of the white fabric it was everything lily had been searching for a combination of elegance and beauty that she adored oh mum i ve found it she exclaimed both beverly and margaret came up and looked over her shoulder that would look gorgeous on you beverly stated it would and james would love it margaret added lily grinned as her mother called olivia back over can you get her measurements we d like to order this one she asked pointing the one in the magazine the clerk nodded yes m am it ll be here in three to six weeks would you like to pay now or later we ll pay when it comes in mrs evans replied kindly olivia smiled good option thanks for your help lily stated just happy that she had found the dress it was nothing come again she said before laughing well not for a wedding dress but for bridesmaids dresses lily laughed unsurely and left happily with margaret and beverly well she was nice beverly commented a little odd margaret added but i dontknow too many muggles so i cantreally judge i thought she was okay lily stated i starving would you ladies like to get some lunch i know this great place down the corner beverly said charley place lily asked excitedly her mother nodded and lily jumped with delight margaret looked at her oddly and she felt inclined to explain it this cute little diner you can get the best deli sandwiches there mum and dad used to take petunia and i down there all the time on saturdays when we were little margaret nodded we ll just have to go there then that night lily apparated into james flat to find sirius lounging on their sofa with charlotte beside him lily smiled where james sirius smiled his usual cunning grin and pointed back to the hall where james room was getting ready i swear sometimes the bloke is just like a girl charlotte and lily shook their heads and lily went to find james after a knock or two james hastily opened the door holding his hand on top of his head lily he said with surprise lily smiled and gave him a kiss on the cheek are you ready she asked playfully james nodded and then winced slightly yeah just give me a minute to finish freshening up he grinned again but before he could take a step back into the room lily caught him by the arm what wrong with your head she asked james shrugged what head your head james honestly let me see she said with authority pushing james back into his room charlotte and sirius who had only witnessed the interaction and not the conversation shared a look before laughing unable to defend himself against a determined lily james removed his hand which had been clotting a giant gash with a cloth lily sighed how did you do that in training we were trying some attack spells on trolls and one had a good punch in him james smiled and winced again that looks terrible lily exclaimed and why didntmad eye fix it up for you james laughed have you seen the scars on his face i think he thinks it builds character or something lily shook her head let me fix that what were you doing to it well before you graced me with your lovely presence i had been searching through a healing book but i hadntfound anything useful yet james replied in a sarcastic manner lily gave him the look she used to let james know when she wasntplaying around james simply grinned she searched the book for a minute before nodding muttering a few words under her breath and then closing the book to look at james sit down for a minute she demanded as you wish my lady james remarked lightly holding his head lily pulled out her wand and gave it a swish the pain ceased for the most part instantly james looked at her gratefully and went to put his hand to his forehead donttouch it lily scolded you re going to infect it i thought you healed it james replied with a pout lily sighed it cleaned up now and i got rid of the pain but you re going to need to wear some sort of bandage but i ll look like some sort of idiot walking around with a bandaged head james remarked if i had a heroic story maybe but i just got hit by a bloody troll they have to be one of the dullest creatures on the bloody planet you are too proud lily commented as she went to his bathroom and searched through it in an effort to find some gauze she knew the boys had to have some what with their encounters with remus every full moon maybe james said but you re the one that going to have to go to the party with a fianc with a bandaged head walking around like a clumsy goon lily smirked upon returning i love you now james potter and you are a goon james grabbed her around the waist pulled her down on to his bed with him and began tickling her sttopp lily laughed let go james no take it back james teased lily caught between fits of laughter finally managed to wrench james arms from her pin his arms down with hers and keep him down by strategically placing her knee in between his legs so that it was just pressing on the bed centimeters away from a very sensitive spot in james opinion you ve got me you win you win james whispered desperately lily smirked triumphantly we re late and you re going to get hurt again time doesntmatter when we re together james said warmly well that sweet but i highly doubt ellie will feel the same way as it is her last night before hogwarts fine you win james stated yet again lily smiled ten minutes later lily and james apparated into jake and allison flat about a half an hour late charlotte and sirius winked at james and lily who raised their eyebrows lily went to go say hello to ellie and sirius greeted james she a rough one eh prongs sirius joked james rolled his eyes sod off padfoot sirius grinned and patted james on the back just ribbing with you mate i going to go see how remus is fairing girlfriend and ex girlfriend deep in conversation james looked across the sitting room and grace and ellie were in an animated discussion with lily and allison listening and laughing remus feigning conversation with jake peter and charlotte but it was obvious to two of his best mates that he was listening close to every word that was exchanged between the two girls james grinned with his best friend and walked over to talk to remus ellie i so jealous you get to spend another year at hogwarts oh i miss it already lily sighed with a reminiscent smile ellie scoffed and twirled a piece of her dark hair with her finger jealous i jealous of you guys out on your own merlin i cantwait i not going to know what to do without you all this term you re going to have fun dontworry allison replied all those guys chasing after you like usual ellie couldnthelp but giggle lily and allison laughed and grace just smiled politely yes eleanor oakes do you have any gentleman callers lately i know last it was todd or somebody and then there was that one boy from hufflepuff and then there was remus allison counted off ellie smile suddenly slackened a bit at the mention of her once long term boyfriend grace didntseem to notice and just continued to smile oh that right you and remus did date last year for a while didntyou she asked yes for a while ellie replied at her replacement but it didntwork out lily was eager to change the subject she knew ellie didntcare for remus as she once did but she was still protective of what they had have you thought of what you might want to do next year she asked ellie turned her attention to lily and allison who was already talking about careers they thought might suit ellie and grace was giving her opinion as well ellie laughed at some of their suggestions one being a hippogriff tamer and had a good time for the rest of the evening sirius and james finally got remus to relax soon enough the two groups merged to eat and laugh wished their best to ellie and promised to write and then they were gone back into their separate lives some being more connected than others what the bloody hell are you doing prongs sirius grumbled it sunday bloody sunday and you re waking me up and it not even he glanced at his watch bloody hell prongs it not even seven james smiled i need your help get dressed sirius glared at him for a moment i hate you well that nice i got some toast for you get ready so we can apparate sirius grumbled for a few more minutes before throwing on some dirty clothes and meeting james rather sourly you know it only or strong friendship that keeps me from asking what the bloody hell your on about this morning but merlin if you are disturbing me to go curtain shopping or some girly thing like that i ll kill you james just grinned you better plan my funeral then sirius jaw dropped i kidding padfoot honestly james said handing him

answer the poll question have a good day chapter sixteen the hunt james appeared on a street lined with identical houses and lawns he looked around for a moment and searched his cloak pocket for a piece of paper all of a sudden a loud pop rang through the air and he was thrown to the ground with something immensely heavy holding him down get off me padfoot james cried as sirius stood on top of him his black boots crushing james back sirius looked down and jumped off immediately sorry mate bloody hell james moaned as he rolled over and stood up brushing his clothes off you told me to apparate to the address and that what i did sirius defended i didntthink we d land in exactly the same bloody spot james commented rubbing the back of his head he pulled out the clipping he had been searching for before the impact and pulled out the paper sirius read over his shoulder so what are we doing here james smiled to himself we re here to look for a house sirius shrugged i thought the apartment was just fine mate i mean the plumbing isntthat great at times with the amount of times the toilet been clogged up at least and i know it gets a bit drafty at night but really james cut him off not for us for me and lily sirius stopped rambling at once and nodded oh yeah forgot about that he smiled at james but james could tell it was forced it not for another five months padfoot dontlook so glum james stated leading the way down the road in search for the house they were going to look at well how far away is this place from our flat sirius eventually asked when they reached the yellow house it was identical in style to every house on the street and both young men got an eerie vibe from it an apparation away james replied or twenty kilometers if driving is it a magical subdivision yes then why is it so odd sirius said skeptically as he looked around the neighborhood because every house looks exactly alike and even the mailboxes are the same or maybe it the pastel coloring of the whole damn place james answered sarcastically it just the first place we re looking at and the price is nice denise should be here any minute he added checking his watch suddenly a middle aged witch apparated in front of them she was of medium stature and had short curly brown hair she wore horn rimmed glasses and a shocking pink cloak hi i denise dot the realtor for this area you two had an appointment she started in a high pitched bubbly tone james nodded yes well my fianc e and i will be married in january and we re looking for a place denise turned to sirius and looked him over with a smile i take it you re not the fianc e no sirius said giving her a charming grin she beamed back at him well let take a look inside shall we half an hour later and the boys stumbled out of the house with denise behind them are you sure you dontwant it she asked flashing her eyelashes in their direction yes james said with finality james shoved the next slip of paper into sirius hand and disapparated sirius read the next address gave a wave to the woman and followed james what the bloody hell james commented as soon as his best friend appeared that woman was off her rocker sirius added i cantbelieve she tried to kiss me james shook his head at least she didntpinch your arse sirius who would have usually laughed but still in a state of horror from the shock of the violent red lips hovering over his just nodded well what do we have here he asked looking at the white cottage standing before them james smiled this is the house i was looking forward to looking at it looks lonely sirius stated james looked around and found that sirius was right there were no houses in direct sight except for far off there was a small red dot that he could assume was a house it only a twenty minute drive to the city though and lily and i can have some privacy and look there a big backyard with a fence and a garden james exclaimed happily sirius rolled his eyes at his friend and checked his watch it was almost nine thirty prongs is there another realtor we re supposed to meet or can we just go in there a realtor a man though james replied easily he should be here soon just as the words came from james lips a man popped before them he was a little shorter than sirius and james wore an old brown cloak that looked oddly shaped and bulgy in certain areas he was fairly young could only be a few years older than them and he was smoking a cigar hullo the man greeted them and shook each of their hands the name mundungus fletcher you can call me dung james potter and sirius black james stated smiling are you going to give us the tour he gave them a smile before giving his cigar a hard chew and spitting actually i ve got some business to attend to down in yorkshire a great bargain if you know what i mean i was just going to unlock the place for you boys you look trustworthy james nodded all right then we ll be careful will you be back soon yeah i ll be back bout half in hour if all goes well and we can talk he said before casting a spell towards the house and disapparating sirius laughed as he left bloke must be off his rocker leaving us to look at this house by ourselves we could steal everything if we d like i sure he knows exactly what in there and it looks like he might have stolen from it already james added smiling at least we can tour the house in peace they ventured in cautiously and began to look around james fell in love with the hard wood floors and the spacious downstairs there was a big kitchen and sitting area he smiled to himself as they went upstairs lily was going to love this he didntcare how much it cost he was going to buy it for her forty five minutes later when mundungus returned james was on his second tour sirius followed him although he was bored and just talked with him they were able to catch up as they hadnthad a real conversation in awhile what do you think dung asked grinning at them as they came down the stairs i love it james said so do i have an offer dung asked hopefully james put on a serious face and said in a very business like manner how much oh i d say twenty thousand galleons would be a bargain james thought this over i ll give you fifteen and pay you tomorrow in full deal i ll get the papers for you and you can return them to me then he reached into is old cloak pocket and held out a stack of parchment to james who took them and grinned thank you i ll see you tomorrow do you want to meet here or your office james asked mundungus puffed his cigar we can meet here what time is good for you six thirty i ll see you then have a good night mundungus answered before apparating well little jamie poo is buying himself a house sirius teased all of those years of playing house with charlotte will finally pay off sod off padfoot james replied although he was grinning let go we can get some lunch let see if wormtail or moony will meet up with us that d be good i haventseen wormtail in a while i mean besides last night he never around well he working and you re training and i sure he has to spend time with his family you know how his mother is she thinks he the ray of sunshine on a cloudy day sirius sniggered as they apparated together away from james future home later that evening james knocked on lily apartment door a dozen red roses in his hand charlotte answered the door in a classy black dress looking elegant as usual oh i thought you were sirius lily didntmention you were coming over she didntknow james replied smiling i know i not sirius but could i come in charlotte grinned and pretended to shut the door laughed at james expression and let him in she not prepared at all i think she back in her room going over papers or something charlotte added another knock and charlotte giggling let james know that sirius was here he smiled and went to find lily he knocked on her door but he could hear her music playing and knew she wasntgoing to come to the door he entered cautiously tip toeing across lily room to where she sat furiously writing and going through files bob dylan blowin in the wind was playing loudly james smiled and cupped her eyes with his hands lily squealed and james held in his laugh guess who he whispered vernon dursley she guessed playfully how did you know petunia is out back but i suppose we could snog real quickly she isntas good at kissing as you are james replied releasing his hands as she turned around to face him james potter what a surprise i should have known it was you vernon cologne is much stronger and smells like rotting begonias james kissed her and smiled you look snazzy she murmured james did look handsome he had black dress pants on a deep blue shirt on and a black tie you dontlook that bad yourself james smiled lily stood up i look a mess james i didntknow you were coming over if i did i would have changed out of my pajamas long ago but you look beautiful james replied handing her the roses what are you working so hard on those are gorgeous james she smiled as she smelled them i was writing a report to dumbledore about the carrow and macnair cases horrible stuff i ve been researching them all day well i d say it about time you got out could i take you to dinner james suggested i haventeven showered yet lily replied uneasily i ll wait our reservations arentuntil seven thirty james said calmly playing with a strand of her hair all right then make yourself comfortable she said as she went to get in the shower half an hour later lily appeared in the sitting room where james had moved once he realized lily needed her room to change ready to go she was dressed in a black dress that ended just before her knee with a plunging neckline elegant black heels and a silver necklace james sucked in his breath she looked so sexy you look great he finally said ready to go lily smiled yes just let me grab my purse i take it we re going somewhere muggle correct james replied as he pulled out his car keys i visited my mum and dad this afternoon and they re letting me borrow the mercedes well that nice of them lily replied grinning we could have just taken my car though ah yes but i wanted to drive james commented smiling at her next time i ll let you lily returned with a black purse and put her roses into some water she took james hand and whispered only if you think you can handle my speed james swallowed and grinned back at her oh i know i can once they were in the car and on the highway for twenty minutes lily couldnthelp but question where are we going james she asked somewhere nice he answered simply lily nodded and looked out the window to see nothing but fields and a few scattered houses in the middle of nowhere maybe lily folded her arms james potter what are you up to lily evans i have no clue what you are on about i am simply taking a nice scenic route to our restaurant didntyou say our reservations were for seven thirty it seven twenty now lily replied suddenly james turned sharply and parked the car lily looked up and suddenly all time was forgotten this house is beautiful james but why are we here well sirius and i decided to look at some houses today and i was wondering if you d like to check this one out i think you ll like it and it a good price james rambled nervously he sure hoped lily adored the cottage as much as he did can we check it out do you have a key lily inquired excitedly james grinned let check it out they approached the door hand in hand and james fumbled through his pants pocket he pulled out what appeared to be a pocket knife dontyou have a key lily questioned well no but we ll be fine james tried hoping lily wasntgoing to stop him isntthis breaking and entering she asked as he pulled out the blade and started for the door and how is that going to work seeing as it practically ours i dontcall it breaking and entering and this knife is one sirius gave to me it can pick any lock just dontget us arrested potter lily replied giving in to the temptation of looking in the house or i ll have to go head girl on you james grinned as he opened the door and let lily inside he pulled out his wand and emitted light into the dark foyer this is beautiful lily exclaimed as she walked in the foyer once lit showed three passage ways into the house lily took the one to her immediate right and james followed her the kitchen is huge she stated with amazement it was of considerable size especially when compared to her flat kitchen there was sufficient counter top space and a place to put bar stools enough space for a table and four chairs and a place for an oven lily inspected it for a few moments before venturing to the room which she assumed was the dining room a small chandelier hung from the ceiling and there was a big window that looked out on the backyard and garden do you like it so far james asked as he came up behind her and grabbed her around the waist yes i love it she said as she looked up at him show me the other rooms james smiled and they made their way back to the foyer and into another passage where they found the sitting room and stairwell it got two bedrooms and two and a half baths james commented as she looked around the half one is downstairs and there one in the master bedroom and in the corridor upstairs so we have a bedroom for ourselves and a guest one lily smiled that perfect for now she added as she hugged james james grinned well hold on there room for children he said in complete seriousness he walked over to the stair well and to the cupboard on the side he opened the door we can put our first child here there plenty of room he said lily followed him with her hands on her hips we are not putting any child of ours in a cupboard james james looked at her and then walked inside why not there plenty of room in here we can put a bed here lily went in after him james this isnthygienic for any kid they d have the authorities on us in a second james laughed i only kidding lovely lily lily love he wiggled his nose and eyebrows at her and shut the door lily kept her hands on her hips you were just trying to get me in a broom closet with you potter maybe he smirked pulling her close it ll bring us back to hogwarts days we were never in a broom closet lily muttered indigently oh yes you were never one for broom closets james chuckled as he kissed her it would have looked outrageous if we were caught lily said exasperatedly when james broke apart from her the head boy and girl caught in lip lock in the third floor broom closet by mrs norris and you know how rumors spread there james smiled again and kissed her holding her close to him i love you i love you she replied in a whisper dontwe have dinner reservations she added distractedly as she pulled at james black tie yes for eight thirty james answered as he went in for another kiss she kissed him back and then stopped well show me the rest of the house then one more kiss james murmured they appeared from the cupboard under the stairs minutes later before exploring the rest of the house and heading to dinner thanks to my reviewers james girl forever scooter5710 melodicmoonstar89 blvd

professor dumbledore friendly voice james potter turned the knob and entered his former headmaster familiar office dumbledore smiled at his former head boy hello james please take a seat james smiled and obliged good evening professor james greeted how are you doing professor dumbledore smiled tiredly i all right james this war is getting more severe by the day however voldemort is gaining more supporters by the hour at least that how it appears one cantalways trust appearances luckily james nodded soberly yes i wanted to actually talk to you about my last assignment dumbledore raised his eyebrows ah having trouble i imagine not so much i wanted to show you what i have so far i researched it and wrote a report on my findings there are only three known inferi from what i found in the ministry records voldemort of course may have made more than they know of i wouldntbe surprised of the three the ministry has one isolated to observe the other one they terminated and the last one is still lurking out somewhere dumbledore listened patiently that good development more than i expected were you able to find out how they terminated the one unlucky or should we say lucky individual james sighed from the reports all i could tell was they tired it out with a few stunning spells and then continued to beat it to death there was no particular spell they used i ve taken the liberty to try and collaborate a few spells to form one good james the old headmaster replied with a kind smile i knew you could do it but there a problem i take it james laughed softly well yes see i ve developed two spells but there no way to test them the ministry doesntwant me to kill theirs professor dumbledore nodded i see i will try and work out a way to let you test them the best i can think is a boggart but i suppose your worst fear isntan inferi i recall professor latham saying something entirely different about your boggart there was a small twinkle in his eye and james nodded and sir inferis are too unknown for anyone to have their deepest fear be having to face one ah true sometimes james we just have to trust our product i will tell certain people about your situation and the spells you have come up with i ll overview them and we ll see i sure your work is useful and effective if not an immediate spell to defeat an inferi james smiled well if that all sir i better get going sirius and lily wanted to have dinner i might be a little late of course of course personal lives are still vital in times like these james it was nice meeting with you and if you dontmind me asking how are the wedding plans going james beamed so professor dumbledore had heard the news we ve just started them headmaster dontworry you ll get an invitation i was hoping so dumbledore replied have a good evening and send mr lupin in if he out there already james gave a puzzled expression but nodded gathered his things and went down the stairs on the way down he bumped into remus moony james exclaimed meeting with dumbledore remus smiled nervously yes he called me in for something how are you good i about to meet sirius and lily for dinner if you d like to join us we re just at my flat grace is welcome too remus nodded i ll see how this goes i might stop by for a drink later all right dontstress moony it just dumbledore i ll try not to remus said as he went on his way and james on his james apparated to his flat to find sirius laughing and lily in the red face he approached them it was bound to be entertaining lily saw him and smiled hello james how was the meeting with dumbledore she said this all very quick and excited it went well he looked at sirius who was still laughing what is so funny padfoot and why does it have lily all frazzled he asked grinning at his best friend while we were waiting for you lily and i being the chums we are were sitting here talking about work and stuff you know like friends do and it was all quiet and then lily goes and steps on a little frog sirius grinned but she wontgo ahead and admit it already because it was my shoe sirius my shoe if i have to explain that to you one more time lily exclaimed with exasperation james sniggered oh come on lily everyone does it no need to be embarrassed about a little wind breaking he teased lily stared at james in disbelief i am not embarrassed because there nothing to be embarrassed about it was my shoe if you say so james smiled taking her hand let go to the kitchen i think dinner is waiting for us the house elves were supposed to send something we ll have lily stay off the beans though sirius added laughing james laughed and lily let go of his hand you boys are so immature it was my shoe look she said stepping out of her heel about an inch and then pressing back down the boys just erupted in to laughter again at the sound and lily sighed and went to serve the food two hours later sirius james and lily were sitting in the living room talking and laughing when a knock came to the door i ll get it sirius offered pleasantly hopping up from the floor he was laying on and running for the door the door swung open and he found remus standing before him his hands in his robe pockets and smiling soberly hey he greeted moony come on in mate sirius returned letting remus enter before shutting the door we re all in the living room care for a drink yeah remus said softly a bit of firewhisky if you dontmind drinking hard now that i can admire sirius replied ushering remus to where james and lily were and hurrying to the kitchen james waved slightly grinning at him hello remus lily said remus sighed and took a seat before putting his head in his hands i dontknow what to do he said finally after moments passed with lily and james looking alternately at each other and remus sirius reentered at this exact moment dontknow what to do about what exactly girl problems eh grace trying to tame your wolfish ways moony no remus said coolly as he sat up right his face was tired and painted with worry and a full moon had already passed for the month what is it remus lily asked kindly he sighed again i met with dumbledore today his three friends nodded to show their interest and he was talking about my condition you know and he started explaining some things about werewolves they re dark creatures as everyone knows and most all witches and wizards are frightened of them they can do horrible damage to anyone without killing they have the power to turn a perfectly good wizard into a dark being but you re different moony james exclaimed with fervor you re a great friend and guy and you would never join i know remus cut him off not angry but almost impatient i know but see most of them are and dumbledore has asked me if when the time comes which it inevitably will to join the werewolves as a spy for the order there was silence for a moment before remus began speaking again sensing that no one knew what to say dumbledore thinks a few might try and recruit me and when the time comes he wants me to say yes but only if i comfortable and i dontknow if i am werewolves are deadly creatures and most arentsuitable for company once so ever there fenrir greyback he said to be the leader james and sirius both shuddered at the name they had heard about fenrir greyback from auror training and remus he was the werewolf that had bitten remus in revenge towards remus father lily looked at james who he she asked shyly although she had been a part of the wizarding community for over seven years now there were hundreds of things still foreign to her he one of the deadliest and most vicious werewolves out there he enjoys killing biting and feasting on humans for any reason he has no consciousness and feels no guilt he bit remus james answered her in a low tone due to the issue sensitivity lily cupped her mouth with her hand oh dear she gasped sending a sympathetic look towards remus who shrugged she got up and walked towards him she bent down and hugged him from where he sat he couldntbear to look at her and hung his head low i dontknow what to do when they come i dontwant to be in their society he said quietly and that a cowardly thing i am one of them i shouldntmind he quipped almost spitefully sirius sighed it is at the good of the order though it wouldntbe in vain i know remus answered immediately i know i ll probably end up going with them for a little while at least i ll probably be able to sneak off for periods of time dumbledore said he d help me in every way possible it just so hard to think about i ll have to end it with grace she wontdeserve to have me gone unexpectedly because i canttell her no one must know you all really shouldn t but i just had to talk about it and i trust you all lily let go of him we wonttell a soul if you leave remus but do you really think you ll have to break up with grace surely you wontbe gone very long not at first i dontthink but if this war gets worse which i find in all likelihood quite possible then i ll end up leaving for longer and longer periods of time it wontbe right to her i shouldnthave gotten involved with her in the first place he finished sullenly dontsay that moony james started you deserve grace and she deserves you dontget down on yourself this day may never come but if it does dontjust disappear until you have to just dontbecome a stranger moony remember that we ll always be here for you always remus nodded i know i love you all we love you too mate sirius said strongly now come on cheer up we were just having fun talking about lily sister and brother in law surely you ve heard of them a bit a heartless sister and an oaf of an in law right he said smiling slightly yes james said happily trying to levitate the mood oh you should meet them sometime moony they ll make you laugh for a while and remus smiled as the conversation dove back into a silly mood talking of what petunia and vernon household was like exaggerated to the extent that they couldntkeep still from laughter remus even joined in occasionally although his spirit was never quite lifted later that night as james dropped lily off at her flat she couldnthelp but think of remus do you think he ll be okay james lily asked distractedly as she took of her coat james sighed as he walked around to the kitchen for a drink of water i think he will be i not sure i feel so bad for him but remus is wise he ll do what he knows his best james said as lily approached him as he searched the cupboard for a glass she reached to the top and handed him one he smiled thankfully what is that exactly lily couldnthelp but question james grinned trouble is only remus knows we can only support him in whatever he does i guess you re right lily said finally as she leaned on the counter folding her arms and checking the time it late james dontyou have training early yes i do but tomorrow should be easy at least nothing physical we are going over some advanced defense spells he replied dripping the water down his chin in the process she handed him a dishcloth oh all right i take it your meeting with dumbledore really did go well james nodded well he canthelp me too much with getting something to test my spells out on he said i have to just trust in myself lily laughed james potter not trusting in himself now that something i have faith in my work thank you very much james stated playfully affronted i see that lily quipped with mock sincerity now potter i really must say you should get back it past twelve james put his glass down find fine i ll go i see i not wanted here he went to leave but lily pulled him in a hug and gave him a quick kiss before sending him off dontyou dare disturb the apples lily called out quietly in a warning james grinned and waved at her good night a n okay i hope you enjoyed the chapter dontforget to review i thought i should mention that james and lily house is not godric hollow that mundungus may or may not be up to something and that sirius does not know him torch phoenix not knowing the difference between charms spells hexes jinxes and curses is nothing to blush about heck my beta and i had to think awhile before knowing how to answer charms are used on things where spells are used on people no exclusively but that usually how it works out they arenttypically evil things either hexes and jinxes are usually pretty mild compared to a curse and are something you could just fool around with to annoy your friends or enemies with ginny famous bat bogey hex for example curses like the unforgivables are more serious and you d usually only use them on your lethal enemies that all i have on the subject if anyone would like to add something feel free to also thanks to my reviewers dancergrl19 hermione

thanks to my beta by the way did you see the snl skit on bill o reilly they made fun of him and it was hysterical but the funnier part was that a few days later the clip was on cnn and they were pissed off at snl and the actor that played him oh that was great those people have no appreciation of humor that for sure a n hey everyone my apologies on such a long delay but i ve got good reasons i promise first i had most of this chapter written days after posting the last one and then my computer crashed it still in the shop if that tells you anything about how badly it messed up and of course i didntsave anything on back up even after all the lectures my english teacher gave me frankly i think i didntdo it to spite her shows you where that got me so now i working on my mom lap top with the jump drive she got me and waiting to either get a new lap top or my old computer back ok so there that and then i wrote this chapter from memory and then the usual process of getting it beta ed so i had it in my email this week and what happened the day i was planning to post i become violently sick half my swim team does we all got a nice dose of food poisoning apparently seeing as i had to run out of my ap euro class and hurl in front of my ap psych teacher room lovely i know the bathroom is really too far away so today i am feeling better and ready to post so sorry for the delay and the long author note one more thing last poll question it appears you all had some imaginative first ambitions and as for this post poll do you honestly care about groundhog day does valentine day make your heart go pitter patter anyways you know the drill chapter eighteen watches james paced around the sitting room of his london flat he was just in his red flannel pajama pants his arms folded behind his back as he treaded the carpet under his bare feet he sighed and looked out the window and then started to hum on the floor a crumpled piece of parchment lay hardly forgotten it was a letter a letter addressed to james dear james please enclose your watch that you wear regularly and send it with this owl it will be returned to you on thursday morning yours truly albus dumbledore james had replied immediately taking off the gold watch lily had given him for his birthday and giving it to the barn owl that had delivered the letter to him sirius had gotten a similar letter he did not wear a watch however and had to borrow one of james old ones he had then ranted all of what james had been thinking when he had taken off his watch what the hell is dumbledore up to why does he want a watch what kind of bloke regularly wears a watch anyways at sirius last comment james had merely shook his head and smiled lily had also received the letter she however didntthink too much about it she simply told james it was probably something with the order this only peaked his boyish curiosity he didntknow what dumbledore had up his sleeve explaining his anxiousness at getting his watch back preferably before he had to leave for training at last a familiar tapping came to the windowpane of his sitting room he rushed towards the window opened it and let the two brown owls inside one presumably carrying sirius package flew around the corner to sirius room and began tapping obnoxiously on his closed oak door james practically wrenched the package from the bird talons causing the poor creature to squawk he muttered a quick apology as he tore the paper hiding his watch not noticing the letter that fell from the bird beak and onto the floor once his watch was revealed james began inspecting it he let out a loud sigh it looked exactly the same he couldntfind one bloody difference between the way it was now and what it had been before he gave it to the delivery owl the watch ticked closer to six and james groaned he had to go get a shower and get ready for training that day leaving the time piece on the couch he went to grab a towel just as he made his way to the bathroom sirius came bounding out of his room swearing and flailing his arms manically at the owl which had started to make quite the hole in sirius bedroom door damn bloody beast he swore as the bird frantically dropped the package and flew back out the window bloody early sirius continued to grumble collecting the parcel and retreating back to his room james chuckled and continued on his way temporarily forgetting his disappointment in the vague watch you ve been working quite well these past few months lily madam bones announced as she walked into lily cubicle lily looked up from the parchment she was currently scrawling furiously over thank you i glad you re pleased with my performance she replied as causally as one could in front of their very intimidating boss i was just looking over some of the cases you ve been covering and writing reports for madam bones vaguely explained if you keep up the work you can expect a promotion shortly lily smiled well you can expect me to keep up with the work then madam bones nodded i going to go get some lunch make sure you take your break soon at this farewell her eyes caught a glimpse of a picture by lily desk it was one of lily and james on her couch both of them smiling up at her who is that she asked in a casual manner lily looked to where her boss gaze led the photo oh that my fianc james potter she answered warmly a small smile forming at the corners of her mouth madam bones gave a slight smile i see well i ll be going before lily could properly reply madam bones had disappeared she looked back down at her parchment and picked up her quill preparing to continue writing when someone coughed lily looked up to see james grinning handsomely down at her she ginned hello james what a pleasant surprise are you ready for some lunch he asked bending down to where she was sitting and grazing his lips across her cheek looking into her green eyes and then producing a boquet of wildflowers those are so pretty lily commented grinning if only i had a vase james took the half full coffee mug on lily desk and moved his hand concentrating on the incantation the mug turned into a slender crystal vase half full with water in front of lily amused eyes ready for lunch darling he asked again lily put the flowers in her new vase and turned to james give me a moment i ve got to put this away it being strictly confidential and all you can go sit and get a cup of coffee i ll only be a minute she pointed down the aisle to a coffee station complete with a small table a self brewing pot several mugs and two comfy chairs all right i ll wait james said she smiled appreciatively at him and he left her cubicle james walked down the corridor and took a seat on one of the vacant chairs his gaze lingered around the array of cubicles and busy witches and wizards working he looked up after a moment to see that he had been joined by a young man with neat dark hair and piercing blue eyes hello the young man greeted i dontbelieve i ve seen you around here before james was about to introduce himself when the man continued i know just about everyone see james grinned to himself and nodded not wanting to continue the conversation any longer this man gave off an arrogant air that stunk of stupidity his hazel eyes caught sight of lily walking from her cubicle to the office across the corridor from hers to have a word with its occupant and bend over to throw a piece of parchment away james heard his companion sigh and take in a breath as if he was going to start talking again james inwardly groaned she one hot piece of arse isntshe he whispered james blood boiled and his fists clenched no one talked about his fianc e like that he thought for a moment as his cheeks began turning a slight shade of red she wouldntapprove of him starting a brawl in her place of work and this man sounded like the kind of git that could talk until he got himself in trouble james decided to play along oh yes she is a beauty he said sighing for affect i am going to get her soon she not going to no what hit her the young man continued brutishly james looked at him surely she has a boyfriend i mean she absolutely stunning his unwanted partner smirked and took a sip of his coffee yes but no bird can resist my brilliant charm and dazzling good looks for long james had to control himself from snorting with laughter this boy was absolutely idiotic as the two sat in a moment of awkward silence lily sent a grin their way and started walking towards them james observed that the man beside him primped his hair slightly put a hand casually into his robe pocket and took a sip of his coffee hello lily greeted hey lily the man smiled do you need any help with any of your cases i know it can be a little overwhelming and all being the junior intern lily grinned politely but james could tell she was slightly irritated oh i ll manage just fine owen i always do owen looked put out for a brief moment before regaining his confident air i see you ve met my fianc james lily introduced james as he stood up beside her the color immediately drained from owen cheeks and he appeared quite shell shocked oh yes and what a pleasure it been james grinned cheekily at him ready darling lily nodded and studied owen for a second are you all right owen shrugged yes fine i ve got to go get back to work important cases to do reports on and madam bones requested my assistance okay then see you later today lily replied not giving a second glance to his retreating back and focusing her attention on james what did you do to him james gave a devilish smirk and put his arm around lily shoulders and ushered her out of the building i ll tell you over lunch speaking of which where would you like to go lily thought for a moment she usually didntgo out very often she enjoyed bringing her own lunch and eating with her coworkers in the lounge it reminded her of the days her mother would pack her lunch for her and petunia to take to primary school nevertheless she enjoyed the occasionally lunch outing with james usually they were planned but she enjoyed his little surprises what about that place just around the corner there it a little italian restaurant emma a girl from the office says it good i think it may be muggle though and we cantexactly go in there dressed like this how about we just apparate to the three broomsticks james liked the way lily thought he grinned pleasantly and nodded the three broomsticks it is madam rosmerta hasntseen us for awhile reckon we could get a few free sandwiches lily playfully hit him we are not going to keep bumming ham sandwiches from the woman i swear every time we go in there she gives us free sandwiches what did you boys do to her that made her like you all so much you dontwant to know love james smirked before pulling out his wand ladies first of course lily smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the lips see you soon moments later they were both in front of the three broomsticks james smiled and held the door open for his red headed date they took their seats side by side at a booth madam rosmerta was there in seconds to ask for their drink orders two butterbeers please james asked winking at the friendly bartender james you are too much she beamed i ll bring those right out it nice seeing you two ham sandwiches dear james questioned as lily looked over the menu or are you actually going to be a little adventurous i adventurous lily defended looking at james teasing hazel eyes and you get the same thing each time too i suppose you re right so ham sandwiches lily shook her head i think i going to go with a nice garden salad i need to be watching my figure i dontwant to be a huge cow in that wedding dress james pouted eating a ham sandwich will not make you a cow she raised an eyebrow just because you and sirius can eat fifty roast hams each and not gain an ounce does not mean all of us have that wonderful metabolism you two possess he let out a small sigh fine but even if you did turn into a huge fat cow i would still love you i d even pay for your dress alterations lily shook her head and chuckled lightly sod off potter madam rosmerta had returned with their butterbeers by this time and looked at the two of them is miss evans telling you off again james she does tend to do that james replied grinning lily kicked him from under the table and james let out an exaggerated ow and she abusive too honestly i dontknow why i stay with her i ve got to wear make up just so my parents and friends dontsee the bruises lily shook her head and madam rosmerta laughed i ll have a garden salad with italian dressing please no tomatoes or onions james will have a ham sandwich no no james cut in if lily dearest is being adventurous i going to be too i ll have the roast beef sandwich with mustard and onions and chips on the side madam rosmerta smiled and left to prepare their order so what was it that you did to owen james lily asked finally studying his handsome features as he turned towards her well i didntreally do anything he started sure lily replied as she took a sip of her butterbeer because you never start anything no really we were sitting there james plunged into his story leaving out owen brasher comments and replacing them with less crude terms by the end of his short tale lily was speechless well not exactly few things could make the fiery red head at loss for words that little berk she exclaimed what a pervert and i have to work with him well not for much longer if madam bones gives me that promotion she hinted at but really what an idiot he just goes and talks about that sort of stuff in front of any random guy what if it had been my dad sitting there who knows what would have happened she ranted james gave her a comforting look and stroked her hand i think he learned his lesson lily and i could always kick his arse i mean i had to restrain myself from doing so today didntwant to start a ruckus in your office or anything you can not fight him james lily insisted seriously honestly we re adults now they donttake brawls lightly anymore fine i wontfight him but maybe a threatening glare when we return he offered grinning idiotically lily sighed as their food appeared and she began to eat as she picked up her fork james noticed her wrist you have your watch back he asked as the gold caught his eyes like a snitch waiting to be caught lily looked down and swallowed before answering yes i got mine back this morning didntyou james nodded and went to show her his watch only to find his arm bare damn james thought i must have left it in the sitting room this morning yeah but there was nothing different about mine i dontunderstand dumbledore sometimes she raised her eyebrow didntyou read his note what note james asked curiously the note the owl was carrying with the package lily replied easily no wait there was a bit of a ruckus this morning with the owls and sirius it must have dropped without me seeing it james said as he thought well it said this is a device for the order lily explained patiently that it ll burn slightly when there an attack that requires our assistance the face of the watch will tell the location and it will flash if it a serious emergency james nodded smiling to himself that makes sense and the watches all look the same until we re needed right dumbledore is such a brilliant man lily laughed at james and continued eating he shook his head at her and began to eat his roast beef sandwich just as lily reached to take another sip of her butterbeer she suddenly felt a warm sensation tingle down her wrist thanks to my reviewers iamsoap elise bentwin official cheeky devil scooter5710 kaean glowing cie

been chewing on and smiled awkwardly what wrong lily he asked careful not to let his panic show her green eyes looked down at her watch and james smile vanished with his realization oh lily where does it say to go he questioned lily shook her head as she suddenly came to her senses she read the watch face surrey a primary school in surrey she said standing up and fishing for something out of her purse i ve got it james said standing up quickly and throwing a handful of sickles on the table he guided lily out of the caf you okay lily he asked as she pulled out her wand he followed suit yes it just this is the school petunia and i went to when we were little it a small private school we ve got to go james her voice was frantic and it unnerved james like nothing else lily yes we ll be there in seconds but before we go i need you to take a deep breath come on relax james cooed softly with a demanding edge she inhaled for a moment and exhaled okay i ready james nodded and watched her apparate before following they appeared outside a tool shed a moment later both looked around searching for any familiar faces james caught sight of sirius and dorcas in the street both appearing to be studying the situation with apprehension james dug in his pocket and pulled out a mirror lily had seen him use to contact sirius before sirius black he whispered lily watched sirius dig inside his cloak pocket as three more people apparated beside him benjy fenwick and grace melbourne a middle aged woman came bustling out of the school at them grace benjy and dorcas all pulled their wands out the woman didntseem to be intimidated by the people standing in front of her waving sticks she spoke a word with sirius before the entire group made it to the shed right james said as they appeared james this is ms figg she a teacher here and a squib grace said calmly she reported the situation to dumbledore yes yes i did the woman started funny things started happening owls floating about and then a few people with dark cloaks appeared well i read the prophet and my family has been friends of dumbledore for years and i knew something was wrong how many are there where did they go and how long ago did they appear lily asked a powerful urgent tone in her voice the woman seemed to recognize lily her eyes widening slightly but she otherwise gave away no sign of recognition they arrived ten minutes ago the owls fifteen i ve seen about six of them they ve sealed off the dining room the seven and eight year olds were having lunch the nine and ten year old classes were on a field trip today and the five and six year olds are having a nap in one classroom i dontknow if anyone has penetrated their room i put on my cloak when i saw what was happening and was able to get out of the cafeteria and get help an invisibility cloak james asked yes my family gave me one for protection she replied easily right lily sirius i want you two to go to the five and six year olds lily knows the way james looked sirius straight into the eyes and a sense of communication seemed to pass between them sirius nodded and james went for his cloak pocket and handed lily his invisibility cloak you two take this and do what ever you can to keep them out of that room dorcas and i will go to the dining room with ms figg here keep your invisibility cloak handy and benjy and grace can keep outside in case more come benjy looked at james dontyou think you ll need more help if there are six in there and only two of you dorcas cut in as sirius draped the cloak over lily and himself we will be fine but if we need any help we ll send blue sparks into the sky all right benjy nodded and his face became stony with seriousness grace come with me sirius and lily stealthily made it their way to the back of the school do you know where we re going he asked in a hushed whisper yes we re going through the custodial closet i hoping they didntknow about that entrance we can easily get to the other rooms from there lily replied as they stopped at a very old looking door lily pulled the handle and the door easily opened to reveal the very cluttered dirty closet follow me and keep quiet lily said holding the invisibility cloak up with sirius closely following behind her she heard a light crash and sirius inhale sharply and guessed that he had stubbed his toe years of sneaking around the hogwarts castle had given him great subtle slyness although lily hated to admit it they reached a hall and lily ignored the posters around the school celebrating the end of summer and beginning of fall they finally reached a door lily peaked in and saw two dozen youngsters napping soundly in a dimly lit room with two teachers reading in the corner she realized that this classroom probably had no idea of what horror could be happening in the cafeteria at the moment the death eaters had probably put a silencing charm on the room and they were probably unaware for the time being of there being any other children in the building okay lily whispered these are muggle school children sirius they probably dontknow why we re here and we re probably going to have to explain ourselves to the teachers i ll do that you distract the children entertain them i know you re good at that here she smiled kindly at him before continuing just dontblatantly use magic in front of them we dontwant to have to do too many memory charms sirius nodded all right lily smiled this was the most serious she had ever seen sirius lily didntbother knocking she merely opened the door as quietly as possible the sudden influx of light caused the teachers to look up as well as a few of the children that had only been pretending to nap sirius immediately shut the door behind them and quickly performed a locking and silencing charm on the door as subtly as he could and lily headed to the teachers who were opening their mouths with questions sirius then headed to the group of children that had begun to stir may we help you the older woman said eying lily odd garb she had a black cloak over a skirt and blouse excuse us lily said as politely and calmly as she possibly could but we have a situation you re going to need to listen to me and believe every word i say you re going to have to trust me the two women stared at her fixedly prepared for whatever this odd looking young woman had to say xx all right the dining hall is down this way follow me ms figg said although she couldntbe seen dorcas and james followed the sound of her hushed voice she led them to a pair of great polished oak doors there her voice quavered they re in there james and dorcas looked at each other they had studied methods of surprising and attacking enemies but they had never really been tested now here they were the only people around that could save a bunch of muggle school children dorcas peered in through one of the windows in the doors they have the kids lined up and facing them there re two that appear to be the leaders and there four just sort of lurking in the back about six members of staff seem to be bound by invisible rope okay chances are this is just a fun killing james said no one is dead yet ms figg replied anxiously from a corner no james corrected himself ms figg thank you for your help but i think it would be best for you to go into one of these classrooms he pointed to one of the doors across the hall for your safety i ll put a locking charm on it ms figg seemed to think this was a good idea and a moment later the door open and closed quietly without any sign of a perpetrator james cast a locking charm and then nodded at dorcas on the count of three dorcas nodded her brown bobbed head looking extremely fierce one two three together they whipped out their wands and cast the strongest unlocking charms they used causing the doors to burst open the children petrified as they were they turned to the intrusion as well as the group of death eaters uniform in black cloaks and hoods their identities protected ah came an oddly familiar voice the leader of the group i see we have company the four death eaters in the back had the nerve to laugh you can watch i suppose the voice said in a cocky roguish manner james tried to pin the voice it sounded like someone he remembered bumping into once or twice we didntcome for a show james said holding out his wand his eyes scanning the room quickly the oddest sensation came over him and he suddenly felt like he was back on the quidditch pitch trying to win the game but you have such good seats the leader cackled before pointing his or her james decided the voice was definitely female wand at dorcas and flicking her wand dorcas lazily cast a shield that deferred the spell over to the wall causing it to crack this seemed to queue the entourage of the lesser death eaters all who had suddenly left their stations in the back corner and plunged at dorcas and james casting spells every which way the two by the children carried on with their business of interrogated the petrified school children now can anyone tell me what you all are james heard the voice ask again as he dodged a poorly cast unforgivable and attacked with the leg locker jinx effectively paralyzing his attacker and causing him to fall on the floor dorcas had stunned two of the death eaters that had assumed she would be an easy target in the background james heard a small brave boy attempt to answer the question british he squeaked nervously he heard the loathsome cackle before a scream of pain the boy was coiled on the floor and thrashing as if he was in some sort of epileptic seizure if only i could get to him james thought he tried to make his way to the child when the fourth death eater sent a silent jinx on james back who turned around just in time to have a deep gash form in his left arm his hazel eyes were didntlook down at the wound only at his attacker he knew that curse snivellus he spat venomously the death eater staggered back slightly but raised his wand again preparing to attack the boy blood curdling screaming had stopped james was quick however and sent him in the air his ankle holding him up as if he was on a hook you never did learn how to defend that one properly snivellus james said before moving his wand again and stupefying him causing him to crash onto the floor causing an unpleasant thud to echo throughout the room james turned around as he heard the sound of clashing glass dorcas was now taking the two remaining death eaters on by herself the one that had been lurking behind the leader had clumsily sent a curse at her which she had easily deflected towards a tray of glasses more screams rung through the room and james deflected as many cruciatius curses as he could as the leader moved her wand lazily causing the unprepared children to fall to the floor twitching a crying out in agony soon james had distracted her by a duel and dorcas was dueling the remaining hooded opponent in the corner crucio the voice cackled james ducked to miss it and sent back the first thing that came to his mind tarantallegra the hex was deflected but james had yelled out another expelliarmus the death eater stumbled backward slightly but quickly recovered sending a ray of green light at james which he deflected with a shield charm i see dumbledore has taught you well the voice taunted going to try an unforgivable potter i hear the ministry has almost stooped to our level you arentworth it james countered bitterly and the ministry could never get lower than a bunch of blood obsessed lunatics the death eater laughed horribly again i see potter you mudblood lover you could have been great you know coming to our side you can still be great if you make the correct decision soon enough the dark lord can forgive a few mistakes if you join us now potter james grinned oh well then that settles it if the powerful great dark lord will forgive what he considers mistakes immediately i ll join right now bellatrix if you had told me sooner that i could be forgiven for not joining a bunch of murderous crusades i would have put on that fashionable hood long ago his sarcastic reply returned no response from bellatrix black instead a ray of green light was cast james lazily deflected it yet again and bellatrix ran for the window apparating as soon as she got outside a few moments later james saw the death eater dorcas had been fighting follow his leader out the window james sent a quick bat bogey hex at him and he immediately shrieked as his face was attacked by a flock of bats dorcas then paralyzed him sending him crashing to the floor james turned to see what had happened to the first four only to see that snape or the cloaked man he assumed to be snape had vanished along with one other formerly stupefied masked villain he swore loudly as dorcas reached his side it okay we ll just gather these three and then untie the teachers we could possibly get a confession of their accomplices we ve done well potter james nodded slightly although he still felt angry at the thought of snape getting away his thoughts drifted to sirius and lily his stomach clenched at the thought of his two best friends and he prayed they were okay deep down he knew they were sirius would take care of lily well lily could take of herself but he felt better knowing his best mate was with her lily and sirius had been lucky for the last half an hour no death eaters had come to the door it was as she had expected they had not counted on their being any other school children in the building of course she doubted that they were here for any particular purpose other than muggle torture and didntcare if there were any more kids there were as long as they were able to kill a good dozen or so sirius was busy doing card tricks for a group of the children who had never seen such magic in their entire lives and lily found herself engulfed in a group of little girls asking her to play house and drink tea with them the teachers were merely trying to look as if they were reading they had explained to the class that their guests were from a local college and they were studying to be teachers and wanted to play with them in the back of the room exchanging apprehensive looks every few moments this is josie a small girl with blonde hair and bluish green eyes said holding up a doll with the same golden locks josie very pretty lily replied to the girl delight play house with us again miss lily one of the other girls said you can be the mother but we need a daddy one of the others insisted let get sirius to play lily looked highly amused at this idea and checked her watch thirty three minutes had passed since they had become elementary entertainers her thoughts wandered to james and she prayed that he was okay a knock came to the door just as the group of girls dragged sirius to her giving him the guidelines on how house was played lily looked up and caught sirius eye he nodded at her and she headed to the door her wand handy she peeked through the glass window on the door and saw james grinning stupidly at her waving his hand for her to come out she nodded at sirius before unlocking the door with her eyes and snuck out james grabbed hold of her and gave her a loving embrace as soon as she was within reach you re okay he said taking in the scent of her hair before letting her go you re not she said her smile dripping off her face what happened to your arm she reached his left sleeve which was soaked in blood and torn oh well i ll give you the specifics in a minute i wanted to tell you that the dining hall is secure dorcas called ministry officials and they re sending some healers for the minor injuries but i think they re going to have to send two of the kids to st mungo s they re going to have to do a bunch of memory charms as well benjy and grace stopped two more death eaters from entering but they both escaped we apprehended three ourselves but three escaped james reported sounding slightly disappointed and irritated with his last words lily reached for his uninjured arm and caressed it but no one is dead you did a good job james you did too james replied sorry to keep you and sirius back here i know you two wanted to be in the actual action and you would have been brilliant he said smiling at her and pulling a strand of red hair out of her face but i just felt you two would be the best handling the children if anything went terrible lily nodded and smiled slightly it okay james we had a good time speaking of which i missing a game of house are the ministry officials here yet james shook his head no they should be here in a few minutes make sure you get your arm looked at or i ll tell your mother lily replied reaching for the door handle i better get back the kids think sirius and i are students from the local university future teachers that wanted to play with them today good story james smiled i ll be back in a few minutes as lily returned to the room a pack of wizards and witches in ministry robes entered the building ready to perform dozens of memory charms not five minutes had passed when two ministry officials and one mediwitch entered the classroom sirius addressed them and explained the situation before both he and lily were dismissed the children not prepared for their new playmates to leave said goodbye rather tearfully and they went out to the front of the school where three stern looking guards apparated with the three stupefied death eaters james and dorcas were being told to apparate to the auror headquarters when lily greeted them we need to dress your wounds one man explained and we cantrisk doing it in a muggle village he turned to look at lily and you should probably be checked out as well and where black he needs to be sent fenwick and melbourne have already gone james looked rather grudgingly before nodding i really dontthink it necessary for sirius and i to go get checked out we had no contact with death eaters lily interjected she needed to get back to work she was suddenly remembering her promise to madam bones to put the finishing touches on a few cases the man gave a stern look his gray hair falling into his eyes you had no direct contact you still need to be looked over ah there black he headed over to sirius and left lily no chance to debate him any further fine she mumbled james grinned at her come on shnuckums maybe i can persuade the nurse to put us in the same room together he waggled his eyebrows at her and lily playfully hit his chest before she could reply with a witty remark dorcas interrupted them let go she said in her usual forceful manner a sour looking sirius appeared just in time to apparate with james lily and dorcas to

her she was usually up by nine on weekends but this saturday she was exhausted she had spent thursday evening at the ministry first being checked out for injuries then giving reports to aurors then talking with the daily prophet or rather james fought off the prophet he later explained to lily that dumbledore wouldntwant any details out her interviewer had been allison who hadntbeen that miffed but was disappointed and then she sirius benjy james grace and dorcas had all gone to see dumbledore they had each given him their separate accounts of what had happened and they were dismissed james had left angry after dumbledore had according to james made excuses for snape james expelled a rant of curses and foul language till the time he dropped lily off may or may not have been snape what bullshit were the last words james had muttered before kissing lily softy telling her everything was going to be okay and asking if she needed anything she had shaken him off by asking how his arm was and telling him he should rest and take the day of training he had refused she knew he would but it was worth a try he left her in a slightly lighter mood and she had hurried to her bed friday had been hectic she had to explain to madam bones that she had eaten a terrible bit of fish that she had gone home violently sick immediately and was much too sick to even write and then had to spend the rest of the day catching up on her work from the previous afternoon and listening to owen go on about the responsibilities of being senior intern she spent her evening at james checking on his arm and making sure he got plenty of rest his day had been worse than hers as he had to answer to moody and continue with training she was sorry to leave him but he needed to get to sleep for his saturday of training so here she was saturday morning dressed in baggy pajama pants and a t shirt her hair pulled back into a lazy ponytail and her stomach growling for breakfast she entered her kitchen and began pulling out pans when she heard a gigantic yawn startled she turned to see sirius walking into the room wearing nothing but his boxer shorts sirius lily exclaimed covering her eyes sirius turned lazily towards her continuing his yawn for a few more moments before scratching himself not understanding lily discomfort oh hi lily didntknow you were still here he said making breakfast he added hopefully lily nodded with her hand still over her eyes um yes actually i just got up er sirius do you think you could go put on some trousers if you want me to sirius replied disappearing to charlotte room lily had time to compose herself and place the frying pan on the stove before he returned is charlotte here she asked as she searched the fridge no she left early this morning for paris some work stuff apparently and she went to see her dad oh lily replied as she took out some eggs well is there anything particular you would like sirius grinned handsomely french toast lily laughed at his eagerness you re just like james sometimes sirius french toast it is bacon or sausage sausage he replied not missing a beat as he took a seat on the barstool as lily pulled out her wand and began to cook so got any big plans today he asked lily shook her head as she placed the egg soaked bread into the pan no well i really need to get on with these wedding plans i ve got my dress the bridesmaids gowns are ordered james said he had his dress robes my mum and i have picked out the flowers but other than that there still so much left to do it all just so stressful sirius nodded oh well you ll get it together i mean it you and james we re talking about you two can pull off anything and the wedding is still he counted on his fingers three months away three months lily repeated frantically that three months sirius well slightly more than three months we have this week of september and the first week of january but it three months and we still need to get the house set up it needs furniture you ll get it done sirius said calmly as he opened the paper just relax i can always help you guys if you need it well thanks lily said taking a deep breath as the sausage sizzled in the pan ten minutes later and two places had been set at the bar and lily sat down beside sirius putting a plate in front of him this looks great and it smells great hell i ll even bet a galleon that it tastes great sirius said taking his fork to the food lily smiled and began to eat she was halfway done when an idea hit her i was actually thinking of going furniture shopping for the house today just a few things i plan on buying them as james insisted on paying for the house and all i sure james would want to pay for the furniture too sirius interjected smiling rich bastard lily nodded exactly so i dontwant to take him because he ll insist on buying everything and i want to do something for the house to make it feel like i belong there if you know what i mean yeah i know what you re saying if you dontdo anything for the place you ll feel like james just is sort of presenting everything to you and you ll have to like it or at least you feel like you do james really wouldntcare i sort of felt like that when the potters took me in just between you and me i hated this one chair in my room puke green and this horrible yellow it was revolting lily laughed i think i know what chair you re talking about it hideous well can i ask you a favor she said sirius nodded of course but only because you fixed me a delicious meal would you go with me to pick some things out i dontwant to take james and you know what he likes i dontwant to choose anything to girly sirius thought for a moment and for a brief second lily thought he would say no but he nodded all right i am free today and you are my best friend lover he grinned lily pushed him lightly but he exaggerated the hit by falling off his stool some appreciation i get he said folding his arms as he stood oh sirius you prat thank you for agreeing to go let me change into some different clothes and we ll go okay i ve got to piss ten minutes later and they were bounding down the streets of london on their way to diagon alley james wiped the beads of sweat collecting on his brow with the sleeve of his cloak training for the day had just ended and it had been more brutal than usual moody had brought in some top aurors and had them practice sending their worst curses hexes and jinxes at the students who all had to work together to defeat the army of aurors it had taken them five hours but the class apprehended the aurors the experience was eventful and valuable but james was completely drained and in dire need of water dorcas approached him with a cup of cold water nice job potter you saved my arse a few times she smiled at him and james nodded well it not like you werentthere when the prewetts tried to two team me dorcas grinned again and then looked past james for a moment before turning and patting him on the shoulder moody coming i think i going to go find a ladies room she smiled once more before disappearing james silently cursed himself as he turned to see moody feet away from approaching him he had no escape from his grueling instructor potter he greeted gruffly james nodded hello moody nice performance today although i think your reactions should be a little quicker next time yardley nearly lost his nose moody started oh yes sir i ll work on that it just i ve been james stopped himself he had been about to say tired but didntwant moody to think he was complaining about the long excruciating hours of training i dontwant to hear excuses potter an auror must always be on his toes constant diligence i always say now i believe you have some hours to make up with me for leaving early the other day james opened his mouth in a desperate chance to delay his extra practice but closed his mouth and thought better of it he had planned on having dinner with lily that evening but he didntwant to risk moody thinking any less of him yes sir could i please send an owl before we start james asked hopefully moody sighed but his one real eye twinkled slightly as the other looked him over if you must potter but be ready in five minutes i ve got a supper to eat you know thank you sir i ll be back in three minutes james smiled appreciatively before running off to find a ministry owl lily and sirius returned to her flat that evening sirius looked rather worn out but content and lily was talking jubilantly thank you so much for coming with me today sirius i really appreciate it and james will too i sure he wontbe living in a effeminate house now she laughed slightly as she took of her black jacket it was nothing lily i had a good time he checked his watch or rather james watch james should be off training soon do you two have plans tonight lily nodded yeah we we re going to have some dinner and maybe go down to diagon alley and see what going on there you re welcome to come if you like no no i fine sirius grinned i was going to get a drink with peter tonight and wanted to know if james wanted to come along lily nodded oh well if you really want him to i mean dontlet me keep you from him you know if you guys want to go out sirius waved his hand it fine lily you can have james for the night he gave her his usual wink that always resulted in lily kicking him if you re sure she replied smiling kindly rather than hitting him and are you going to see remus tonight i worry about him getting lonely he gets a little depressed when he alone too long sirius chuckled and his black hair fell into his eyes he ll be anything but lonely he spending the evening with grace and we all know what an animal remus is he laughed again in his crude manner and lily shook her head before opening the door for him thanks again sirius have a nice night you too sirius replied before giving her a pat on the head tell jamsie boy his best mate said hello bye sirius lily chuckled as she shut the door she turned and headed to the sitting room where she saw an owl at the window lily hurried over and let the bird in it fluttered around for a few moments before dropping the letter and rushing back out the window lily picked the note up scanned its contents and sighed james wouldntbe over till past nine deciding that she had a good few hours ahead of her she picked up her purse and put on her jacket again and headed to the market if she was going to wait for james she might as well make him a nice dinner almost four hours later a knock came to lily door lily sat up from where she was reading on the couch stifled a yawn and headed to the door hoping that it was james she opened the door to find a very tired looking james smiling at her sorry i so late moody was being extra moody tonight he started walking in lily closed the door and gave him a comforting hug it all right i had enough time to make a three course meal so i hope you re still hungry i famished james replied rather happily at the prospect of food but donttell me you still haventeaten it almost ten o clock of course i haventeaten you canteat at a candle light supper for two without two people it against the rules james grinned i suppose it is i hear they hang people for it in germany so the rumors are true lily said playfully taking james hand and leading him to the small dining room sadly yes you donteven want to hear what they do to people in ukraine it simply horrific lily laughed as guided james to his chair before he sat down however he grabbed her around the waist and kissed her when they broke apart lily smiled up at him what was that for i decided to thank you appropriately ahead of time for a delicious meal he smiled handsomely his hair sticking up in all directions as usual and his glasses shimmering in the dim light you might want to actually make sure the food is good before you thank me it probably dreadful your cooking is always fantastic lily james grinned and besides even if it was burnt to a crisp i would eat it now i ll hold you to that potter lily replied before disappearing momentarily into the kitchen james patted his stomach lightly as he finished the treacle tart lily had provided for dessert he studied her for a moment while she continued to eat he often observed her indiscreetly when he was tired and just happy to be alive lily was always to beautiful and radiant and her presence always gave him such warm jubilant feelings what lily finally asked dabbing her mouth with a napkin james had been studying her for a few minutes and his eyes were starting to glaze over oh ah james started startled from his reverie i was just er thinking he yawned slightly and smiled at her are you okay lily inquired slightly worried at james state she often saw him after training when he was exhausted and sweaty but he was never quite as withdrawn as he was currently i fine james replied with an attempted finality he however had looked straight into lily bright green eyes which always glowed when they were in an inquisitive state james sighed and put his hands through his ebony hair i just a bit stressed is all training takes up so much time you know and well everything just keeps coming at me moody the order stuff voldemort the wedding merlin lily there so much left to do for the wedding lily stood up from where she was seated across from james and moved over to where he was sitting she put her small soft hands over his shoulders and began to massage them the diamond ring on her left hand twinkled in the candlelight you ve just got to relax james she whispered dontget too stressed out it ll be okay everything always works out james nodded his head upward so he was staring straight up into her eyes how do you know he whispered back i just do lily replied kissing him lightly on the forehead and smiling as she remembered sirius words after all it is me and you we re talking about here we can do anything james grinned and reached his hands up to touch her face which was lingering inches away from his and brought her lips to his for a sweet tender kiss you mean everything to me he whispered softly moving his hands over her arms and pulling her around towards him she sat on his lap and he held on to he as he burrowed his head into her shoulder and played with her red hair twirling it in his fingers like had always done when they had spent late night studying together at hogwarts for that moment they were both at peace at peace with each other and at peace with the world thanks to missing summer

that d be my favorite thing so anyways review please chapter twenty one peter among other things it was tuesday evening and james found himself strolling the streets of diagon alley the lanes werentas crowded as they usually were more and more people were getting scared of you know who and insisted on staying indoors during darkness james however felt confident in his magical ability and as he was free that evening lily was at allison and sirius was with charlotte he felt the need to just peruse around town he walked down the street and took in the sunset he was wearing one of his favorite cloaks it was dark navy and of light weight material perfect for the early autumn deciding that he could use with some extra spending money he made a bee line for gringotts the impressive white building always took him by surprise it was simply gigantic and he always marveled that almost the entire wealth of the magical community was stored in that one building as he approached the large bronze doors he remembered the goblins merlin he hated goblins they were useful creatures however they were shrewd and fierce good qualities to possess when guarding the fortune of the wizarding world as soon as he entered the building a goblin in a gold and red caught his eye and gave him a severe look over before bowing to him james shrugged it off and headed towards the counters where the goblin tellers waited for money orders hello james greeted the teller he tried smiling but the creature frowned at him may i help you the goblin asked looking him over james nodded er yes i ve come to take some money out of my vault the name james potter the goblin nodded a potter eh he gave a greedy smile and showed off his pointy yellow teeth you have your key i presume sir of course james replied smiling and pulling a gold key out of his pocket just as he was about to hand the key over a large crash happened just behind where the goblin had been sitting behind the counter james looked down to see a short plump young man on the floor scampering around and trying to pick up the pile of papers scattered on the floor james smiled slightly it was peter pettigrew idiot the teller yelled turning harshly on peter canteven use your wand peter stood up holding the stack of papers in his chubby sweaty hands i sorry sir i i just i tripped over the foot of your chair there and i i am sorry he mumbled his watery blue eyes praying for mercy from the savage goblin between james and himself i ve told you a thousand times pettigrew watch where you re going you worthless lump he scolded hey james interjected that my friend there sir and i d appreciate it if you didnttalk to him like that now he said it was an accident he sorry and he cleaned up his mess the goblin turned to look at james the goblins shrewd eyes flickered but something inside the little monster decided that james potter wasntworth arguing with very well mr potter he looked at him for a moment more before calling for a goblin to take james to his vault before james left he motioned for peter to come and talk to him peter the papers still in his clumsy hands nodded and stepped towards the counter you okay wormtail james asked his friend peter didntlook okay his eyes had dark circles under them and he wore a slight frown yes i fine peter replied hastily as the goblin was looking over them and was more than likely listening to their conversation i ve got to put this away before i spill them over again he made to turn away but james stopped him wait peter what time do you get off seven eight the goblin interrupted giving a glare towards peter james nodded right well i getting some shopping done and i ll be around for awhile care to meet for a drink or something sure peter replied his eyes lighting with excitement the leaky cauldron eight thirty sounds good bye peter and be careful james said grinning before following the impatient goblin that had been waiting to take james to his vault after a round trip on the rickety cart james left with a good pile of gold silver and bronze coins stowed away in his cloak he tapped his pocket lightly before heading towards the first place he could think of quality quidditch supplies he admired the variety of brooms new jerseys and other trinkets that came with his favorite sport for half an hour before deciding he had nearly everything that could be of any use to him as he walked down the nearly empty street he caught sight of familiar face through the glass of the most popular bookstore in diagon alley remus was working at flourish and blotts the bell dinged lightly as james entered remus looked up from where he was returning unwanted books to their proper places on the shelves prongs he smiled tiredly the full moon was approaching i didntknow you read james grinned at his old friend oh you know the occasional book on quidditch but i was thinking of getting something for lily and i saw you in the window there remus nodded as james approached him they were almost completely alone except for an old witch in the back who was looking at used cookbooks how have you been james asked haventseen you for a few days oh i fine just a little tired you know remus looked warily out the window to where an almost full moon was beginning to emerge in the dusk yes i know we ll be there james replied looking at his friend with sincerity are you free at eight thirty i ran into wormtail at the bank and am going to meet him for a drink after he got off remus shook his head smiling slightly i d like to but grace invited me over to her place for dinner james nodded okay then he leaned in closer to his friend to whisper have you heard anything about dumbledore plan for you lately no well i wontbe leaving anytime soon i did speak with him the other day though he says a meeting is coming up soon remus answered quickly as the old woman approached him books in tow to purchase i got to go take care of this prongs there some knew charms books we have in the front there that lily might like i ll see you later okay moony have fun tonight james grinned at him before patting him on the shoulder and going to the just in display at the front lily packed up her bag stuffing it with folders and papers she had been working on that day it was half past six she had stayed late at the office dumbledore had sent her some names to look into and she saw no harm in staying after her coworkers went home to research them now she was forcing herself to leave the interesting world of criminals and meet allison for dinner they were meeting at this chic new restaurant in diagon alley allison had picked it out lily had offered meeting at a muggle caf but allison wasntin the mood for muggle dining she stopped at her flat for a few minutes to drop off her folders and such before heading towards diagon alley when lily arrived at the purple mushroom she found that allison was already waiting for her at a table for two lily over here she called catching the attention of several other diners she smiled a slight blush rising in her cheeks lily laughed lightly and went to sit down by eight twenty james had purchased a number of books for lily visited remus for a few more minutes stopped by the apocothary and was on his way to meet up with peter when he arrived at the leaky cauldron he found peter sitting on a bar stool with vacant seats on both of his sides sitting there sipping on firewhisky he looked so lonely he was as usual dumpy looking and oblivious to everything around him wormtail james greeted slapping him on the back and causing peter to spit out whatever drink had been in his mouth in surprise he looked up bashfully hullo prongs take a seat james obliged and waved tom the bartender over a bit of firewhisky please he said before turning his attention to peter and smiling so how you been haventseen you in awhile i ve been busy and i imagine you have been too peter nodded slightly well you know my mother not doing to well these days and i kept pretty busy at gringotts damn goblins he shuddered james frowned what the matter with your mother peter waved him off and tried to shrug oh you know she just getting old she was nearly forty when she had me she worn out and stressed i see well she just needs some rest and i imagine she ll be fine james smiled kindly at him i sorry your er coworkers for lack of a better word arentmore friendly peter shrugged again his face was sweaty despite the draft coming into the bar his flabby cheeks glistening in the candlelight well i knew what kind of company i d be getting when i accepted the job prongs well of course but they donthave to be such bastards to you james quipped taking a drink from his glass yeah well peter continued before smiling slightly although james thought it looked rather forced almost a grimace how are you and lily the wedding plans and all james grinned like the love struck fool he was we re brilliant she got her dress and things picked out and i ve got my stuff picked out and we ve picked out our invitations and a few other things there still a lot to do of course we ve still got to get a cake find a place for the wedding that really the most important part isntit no just marrying lily is doesntmatter where or how just as long as it her he smiled to himself lost in his fantasy world that was the most reality he had ever experienced well just make sure i get an invitation peter said taking a sip from his cup sure thing mate james grinned it not that far off we should probably send those off soon he pondered for a minute before peter broke the silence i wontbe able to make it to the next full moon on friday there no way they re going to let me off in time james mind quickly changed gears oh but he studied peter well all right if you have to remus ll miss you and it wontbe the same i hope we can manage you ll manage all right you dontreally need me there nowadays anyway it not like you re still trying to get past the whomping willow james shook his head now that not right it not whether we need you or not it that we want you there pete he looked at his friend sincerely his dark hazel eyes piercing peter watery blue ones well as long as you ll miss me peter replied half heartedly i sorry i cantgo dontbe sorry just poison those goblins for us james chuckled good naturedly and patted peter on the shoulder lighten up wormtail he and peter went their separate ways after a good twenty minutes more of mindless talking peter had said he needed to get back to his house that his mother would be worried about him james didntdoubt him he was rather eager to get out of peter presence although he hated to admit it peter was rather depressing lately as he pitter pattered along the alley yes he could have gone off to his flat but he didntfeel like it just yet he heard a familiar laugh echo around the lane he looked ahead and saw lily form with who must be allison laughing and talking happily james grinned mischievously as he pulled out his wand with a swish of his wand lily handbag suddenly yanked itself out of her reach and dangled itself a few feet in front of her she looked at allison who looked just as bewildered as she did and reached for it the brown leather bag jumped out of her reach and continued to dangle like a carrot in front of a hungry horse what the hell lily interjected making to grab it only to be thwarted again allison lunged for it too and lily pulled out her wand like the sensible witch she sometimes forgot she was she went to summon the bag but it only went further out of her reach she stomped her foot in frustration and turned around james potter lily love james greeted her in open arms lily pulled away what the matter you ve bewitched my bag she said as if to make a point she motioned her hand towards the bag which still hovered in the air out of her reach i did no such thing james replied grinning i was merely leaving peter at the leaky cauldron when i saw two beautiful young ladies being robbed by someone in an invisibility cloak cantbe very fast or bright though lily hit him none to lightly in his chest potter james laughed and pulled out his wand lifting the spell sorry love couldntresist lily sighed and allison shook her head i better be off jacob is going to be home soon and he might want something to eat they keep holding him later and later at work right then it was nice to see you allison james said smiling at her yes dinner was wonderful we ll have to do it again sometime lily added giving her friend a quick embrace before letting her depart now james lily said turning to him that little stunt wasntfunny james pouted really and i thought your sense of humor was better lily oh i have a sense of humor potter it just happens to have taste she replied grinning at him well then you ll have to teach me to master your tasteful humor i d hate to not be able to make you laugh he grinned goofily at her and lily gave him a small smile good thing i a brilliant teacher lily retorted and i happen to fancy a good snog now and again james waggled his eyebrows at her and reached for her pulling her body close and kissing her tenderly now let me deliver you safely back to your flat then you can maybe invite me in for tea and ask me about my dreadful day going over military tactics with moony and i can hear you complain about owen she smiled at him and kissed his nose before taking his hand and walking with him back to her flat they sat together on her couch lily cupping her tea in her small slender hands and james resting on the coffee table not to far off from where they were sitting james had his arms wrapped around lily who was telling him about her dinner with allison she says she wants to double date sometime lily continued looking up at james by tilting her head back i suppose we can do that james smiled have her pick a date and time well hold on there a catch lily replied quickly that why i didntagree to meet her and jacob sometime on the spot james furrowed his dark eyebrows i see are they going to ask us to do the whole wife swapping thing again because although the idea is creative i not sure we can play seeing as we re not married yet lily stuck out her tongue at him and james laughed actually i think allison wants you to somehow bring up marriage on our date i dontknow i think she wants to get jacob thinking about it lily looked deep into his hazel eyes and could see the uneasiness that lay there i dontknow lily i dontwant to pressure jacob into something if he not sure about it i mean if he ready he ll feel it james started not that it isnta nice idea marriage but you need to know when it time on your own not have your friends pressure you into it my thoughts exactly lily quipped taking a sip of her tea now how should i tell allison that be creative james answered vaguely speaking of marriage and weddings and all i thought sunday we could get together and do some serious planning get everything settled start on the house it still needs to be furnished and cleaned up lily nodded all right i can pencil you in it does mean i ll have to cancel my lunch with gilderoy lockhart james silenced her with one of his long slow kisses that always managed to take lily breath away once they broke apart james knew her mind would be completely frazzled and she would temporarily forget anything they were just talking about lily felt herself losing her senses like she usually did when wrapped in james embraces but she ignored it she turned her body so that she was lying lightly on top of him her hands which had just been holding her mug of tea that now lay empty and forgotten on the floor tugged at his shirt he pressed against her closing in any space between their bodies his strong large hands caressed her torso and he let his long fingers play with the white buttons of her blue blouse all of a sudden a door burst open and laughter echoed throughout the flat charlotte and sirius lily and james brought back to reality opened their eyes a slight crimson spread into lily fair cheeks her loose red hair dangled over james face and he looked into her green eyes trying to read her thoughts he sighed and let lily slip off him hello charlotte lily called giving an apologetic look to james before brushing herself off and picking up james and her mugs taking them back to the kitchen charlotte turned to look at lily giggling slightly as sirius kissed her neck hey lily sorry if we woke you up charlotte apologized although not looking sorry as she gave lily slightly disheveled appearance a glance over oh i wasntsleeping i didntknow you d be in so early lily replied forcing a small smile just at that moment james appeared from the dark sitting room and into the kitchen he nodded to acknowledge sirius and charlotte he squeezed lily shoulders and planted a quick kiss on her lips i better go i ll see you tomorrow james smiled and waved at his cousin and best friend before letting himself out charlotte looked at lily for a moment her dark eyes questioning for only brief moment lily grinned in an almost nervous manner well i ll be off to bed i was going to try to go in early tomorrow morning good night charlotte called to her sirius merely grunted in acknowledgement and continued with his flow of ticklish kisses causing charlotte to giggle into the night poll what your favorite thing about spring summer so thanks to my reviewers i really appreciate it misshertfordshire missing summer official cheeky devil xxxxparvati patilxxxx

harry and ginny will get back together cause i was pissed when they broke up it was just so stupid anyhoo read review chapter twenty two invasive ideas the rain was flowing heavily that thursday afternoon from where she stood sipping her coffee and looking out the window of the lounge lily could tell the water splashing on the streets below was cold it was the first of october the leaves on the trees outside had all turned various shades of reds and browns and some trees had already lost their leaves she loved the cold and she loved the rain and although it made the work atmosphere stuffier and made many of her coworkers irritable she couldnthelp but feel relaxed and content especially as the rich coffee scent wafted around her her solitude was interrupted as two young women maybe a few years older than she burst into the empty lounge it was half past two and most employees had already had their lunch lily recognized the two late diners as cynthia and becky she had never bothered to learn their last names cynthia was tall and thin she had bright blue eyes that always looked excited her hair was very curly and she had put her dark chestnut locks into a loose bun cynthia was the department receptionist and lily had always found her strikingly beautiful becky was a happy sort short bodied curvy with blonde hair and a bright smile she was the secretary of one of the most influential judges on the wizengomot barty crouch they noticed lily once they had both taken a seat at the large oak table hello there lily didntsee you there for a moment care to join us cynthia asked looking up at lily with friendly eyes lily smiled oh well i ve already had my lunch break an hour or so ago they both were staring up at her now and it made her feel slightly uncomfortable at least join us while you finish your coffee surely you dontwant to get back to old madam bones too soon becky continued as she pulled a salad out of her lunch bag lily seeing no harm in staying for a few minutes longer decided to take a seat beside cynthia moments later she was wondering why they had even bothered inviting her to sit down in the first place they were wrapped up in their own conversation and had barely recognized lily at all besides offering her portions of their salads so tell me cynthia as you have failed to mention your date last night how did it go becky said cynthia sighed and rolled her eyes that bad huh becky concluded taking a sip of water but he looked so promising tall that blonde hair he rich too of good blood has connections oh he as all that he mentioned it about fifty times before the food came cynthia added and then he had the nerve to try and invite himself inside when he dropped me off becky sighed what did you tell him i didnttell him anything he came right in and we had a wonderful time you know how i cantresist a man with a little edge cynthia laugh echoed throughout the small room and becky shook her head smiling lily had almost choked on her coffee so are you going to see him again becky inquired eagerly oh no i dontthink so when he left this morning i made it perfectly clear that the actual date was dreadful and that i never wanted to see him again cynthia replied nonchalantly becky shook her head not that great of a shag then not good enough to sit through another date like that cynthia quipped smiling her excited cerulean eyes reminding her that lily was still there so lily are you seeing anyone she asked attentively becky was staring at her now as well lily smiled although she had been caught a little off guard she always enjoyed an opportunity to tell someone she was marrying james potter i engaged lily answered finishing the last of her coffee really becky exclaimed that so exciting is he handsome wealthy cynthia added to the inquiry very handsome lily replied and he is fairly well off what his name becky pondered james potter potter the two girls exclaimed at the same time you get to marry a potter why didntyou tell us sooner cynthia asked flabbergasted the potters are one of the most influential families in all of england before lily could point out that she only saw both cynthia and becky for a few seconds on a normal day and that she had never had real conversation with either one of them becky started talking again so how is he her light green eyes lighting up he a wonderful man i couldntask for anything more lily replied wondering what kind of question that was why would she marry a horrible person becky and cynthia both giggled she means in bed cynthia elaborated lily nodded slowly realization coming over her she prayed her face wasntturning too red at her embarrassment oh well yes of course she started both of her companions staring at her we um well just then becky gasped crouch is back from his lunch i ve got to go she pointed at the man walking by he was wearing all black and looked very serious in a way that reminded lily of professor mcgonagall i better get back too i ve been getting a cup of coffee for long enough lily interjected taking her opportunity to get away from the two however nice prying girls a minute later she found herself in the quiet of her cubicle madam bones hadnteven noticed she was gone she sighed and tried to get back to work ten minutes later she found herself looking at the same document on a man named macnair and that her eyes were glazing over she wasntgetting any work done because she couldntget it out of her mind sex sure she d thought about it how could she not james was always so pleasing and handsome did james think about sex sure he did lily told herself probably more than she did especially with sirius around always bringing the subject up did he want to of course he did did he expect it of her no she decided they talked about it once last spring james said he d wait as long as she wanted did he still feel the same way lily couldnthelp but feel that he really wanted to especially with the look he had given her the other night on the couch it had been so imploring so full of desire he loved her she loved him she trusted him lily sighed and put down her quill as she thought there was only one question left did she want to she thought about james and closed her eyes he came into view he looked absolutely amazing as usual his dark messy hair his dark energetic eyes his goofy glasses that would make anyone else look like some sort of prick his body his toned beautiful body she did it was decided she really really would like to make love to james potter but the timing would have to be right and when would she bring it up she sighed she could think of the details later she had to get back to work before madam bones or to her dismay owen came to check on her james stepped out of the hot shower reaching for a large blue towel on the counter top he dried his hair first tousling it just so he wrapped himself up and grabbed his glasses placing them on his damp nose as he left the bathroom and entered his bedroom the steam left his glasses foggy a knock came to his bedroom door an unexpected knock a polite knock a knock that would not come from sirius as he liked barging in on people come in james called wrapping his towel tighter his mother might be at the door after all the door opened and lily walked in smiling at him her cheeks turning slightly red as she found james in a towel hi james greeted are you ready lily asked him looking around his room her eyes darting anywhere but to james half naked body james walked towards her for what his eyebrow was quirked slightly and he was grinning for for the meeting james did you not know about it we got the message on our watches this afternoon sirius has already left and i figured i d come by just in case you didntknow because you usually owl me after you find out about a meeting lily said this all slow james was getting closer and she could smell the soap he had just used in the shower meeting oh james said in a surprised voice i didnthave my watch on for a little while today moody made us take off all jewelry something about a spell back firing and burning our wrists he a bit dotty yes well there a meeting at eight and it already ten till lily replied she smiled at james appearance he was looking down at her a perplexed expression crossed over her face his glasses were sliding down his nose he looked adorable she stepped closer to him and brought his head to hers kissing him in a swift motion james slightly taken aback responded quickly lily then let go and made her way to the door i ll wait for you to get changed have you had dinner james shook his head and lily shut the door he appeared a few moments later dressed in a pair of jeans a blue sweater and a water repellent cloak to wear in the rain lily handed him a sandwich which he took hungrily ready she asked studying him for a few seconds james nodded as his mouth was much too full james lily glad you could make it professor mcgonagall greeted in her professional manner james gave an apologetic look to lily they were almost ten minutes late lily however just smiled and took a seat in the back of the classroom should i serve my detention now or later professor james asked sarcastically this was uncannily like being late for transfiguration just take your seat james professor mcgonagall replied trying her hardest not to smile at her former student we were just discussing some offensive strategies all right well continue james grinned at her again and took a seat beside lily we seem to think that he who must not be named is meeting with his supporters in a few locations one of them is bound to be very isolated and heavily guarded with old dark magic we also think he has a few more public meeting spots places that are openly supportive of the dark arts we want to find these locations if we can find where he meeting there are opportunities for spies and such do we have any ideas where these locations are or are we just looking for sand in fairy dust professor james asked in a bold manner several of the people surrounding them turned to look at james nodding their heads before professor mcgonagall could answer dumbledore who had otherwise been unnoticed by many stood up we have a general idea but only very general we are trying to eliminate places we know they cantbe meeting to find the places they could be meeting it a difficult process but i think if it is accomplished we will have gained a definite advantage over voldemort a few people gasped peter did james noticed he was sitting beside sirius remus and grace and looking terrified james glanced at his friends and suddenly got an idea james stood up i think i can be of assistance headmaster as well as all of the marauders if they want to that is lily looked at james with an eyebrow raised dumbledore smiled i ll need everyone help james but i think you re right the marauders could be of particular help in this case talk to me after the meeting james nodded and sat back down exchanging looks with an ecstatic sirius an interested remus and a worried peter what are you on about lily whispered james smiled at her lily if there anything i know it marauding and what better skill to have when looking for top secret locations right lily replied amazed at james cleverness well i want in on whatever you four are doing james knew he couldntobject to lily so he merely nodded his head and put an arm around her together they listened to other updates in the order of the phoenix at the end of the meeting the marauders and lily rushed over to greet dumbledore he smiled at them all and his blue eyes twinkled behind his half moon glasses what do you want us to do james asked sirius nodded where do we need to go dumbledore chuckled lightly follow me to my office would anyone care for a lemon drop lily nodded and took a candy from her old headmaster offered hand once they were all seated in his office dumbledore pulled out a large map james recognized it as diagon alley certain places had a bright orange phoenix hovering over them the places marked with the phoenix are locations we know are true to the order dumbledore announced as the five of them hovered over his desk looking at the map lily noticed that olivander and florean fetiscue shops were of those marked and she smiled we still have a number of unmarked shops madam malkin s for example dumbledore started as diagon alley is barrier between muggle and magical london it is important that we search all these areas now i wouldntbe surprised if none of the places here were the head quarters of the dark lord but we must check the most obvious places before we move on to more suspecting places knockturn alley for example the five former students nodded and listened as professor dumbledore continued half an hour later they found themselves walking down the spiral staircase james and sirius were talking eagerly devising plans that seemed a little outrageous and foolhardy lily and remus talked of more rational ideas while peter stared at the floor with his hands in his robe pockets are you okay lily finally asked him as they made their way back to the classroom peter looked down at her he wasntthat much taller than she at only five eight and the fact that he was slouching brought them almost to eye level it nothing lily i just tired he replied in a soft voice he gave her a small smile thanks for your concern lily nodded as she thought of james words from the other night peter had seemed a little depressed then hadnthe well if you need anything i here for you lily said giving him an encouraging smile and so are your friends i know peter replied without saying anything more let go out for a drink come on moony prongs evans and wormtail i know you all want to sirius proposed i want to see you piss drunk evans i dontknow about getting piss drunk sirius but i d be more than happy then going for a drink care to join me james or are you too tired from training lily responded smiling and reaching for james hand a night with my favorite people i wouldntmiss it for the world james said flashing a cheesy grin and an exaggerated wink remus chuckled i can come too it settled then you coming wormtail sirius asked draping his arm over peter shoulders peter shook his head i better get home i ll see you all later have a good night ten minutes later they were all huddled in a booth at the three broomsticks talking and laughing together and then frank was so embarrassed that he let us break for lunch early so he could go and fix his trousers sirius said his usual mischievous glint in his eye you really shouldntdisrespect your mentors like that lily scolded slightly fighting to suppress a giggle it not polite sirius waggled his eyebrows at her as she was sitting across from him curled up beside james sod off lily you re not head girl anymore lily gasped in an affronted manner and resorting to kick sirius from under the table ouch sirius yelped he turned to james cupping his hands over his mouth and whispering loudly mate i should warn you you re girl is playing footsie with other men sirius winced as lily kicked at him again she was wearing heels after all james laughed and turned to lily next time kick him harder he doesntget kicked enough some friend you are sirius retorted he draped his long arm over moony and gave him a manly pat on the back at least i have ol moony here remus shoved sirius arm off he was looking rather tired and worn out as the full moon was the next evening but was determinedly happy get off me padfoot hell if i ll have lily kicking my shins remus smiled as he lifted his pint of mead i see how it is sirius replied lousy rotten friends poll do you think

and protesting just as the former generation of hippies had done all right so answer that review thanks chapter twenty three when it rains it pours just over a week had passed since the meeting it had been a fairly nice week if james said so himself remus transformation had gone well at least considerably well no one had to be sent to st mungo s training had been ruthless as usual but mad eye had been in a chipper mood that is to say as chipper as mad eye could get james had spent sunday with lily they had gotten most of their wedding plans done they had decided after much petty arguing to get married in lily childhood church her very muggle church they had decided to post on the invitations going to james few relatives and other magical friends that would be attending it was going to be a relatively small wedding to wear only muggle attire lily hoped they took the recommendation to heart james hoped they didntcome in something completely ridiculous the only thing left to decide was the honeymoon but james was sure lily was going to pick the canary islands at least he hoped so it always seemed so pleasant there yes it had been a good week james established and now it was saturday evening and they were standing in front of madam malkin dress shop on business for the order lily and i will go check out madam malkin s james decided his invisibility cloak tucked into his robe pocket while you lovebirds go buy robes we ll check out quality quidditch supplies sirius said giving a wink to lily and gesturing towards remus and peter good luck you too james replied patting sirius on the back dontdo anything too risky lily added ignoring sirius rolling eyes and speaking to remus remus smiled no need to worry lily you know i was always the sensible marauder and consequently the one that missed out on all the fun sirius added we better get going let meet back out here in a half hour we ve got three more places to go after this james mediated placing his arm around lily shoulders and waving his friends off he leaned in and whispered in lily ear an action which if witnessed by a passer by would have shown the utmost affection and intimacy shown between the two james whispers werentintended for pleasure however okay so you can try on the robes and i ll look around james whispered why cantyou try on the robes lily asked not keen on getting her measurements taken she had the feeling she had been gaining a little weight these past months and wanted nothing more than to ignore it james sighed i always feel like she groping me and that she enjoys it fine but next time i get to look around lily compromised smiling at the thought of james being groped by a middle aged woman thank you james replied kissing her cheek and who knows lily you might get a new set of robes out of this lily laughed as they walked through the doors to the shop the tiny madam malkin appeared out of nowhere measuring tape draped around her little shoulders what can i do you for she asked looking pleasantly at the couple my fianc e is interested in some new dress robes james said smoothly she to have what ever her heart desires madam malkin took lily by the arm excitedly right this way dear as she was pulled away from james lily turned to give james a slight glare he grinned and gave her a cheesy wink five minutes later james was observing lily up on a stool in front of a few body length mirrors she was wearing a repulsive brown gown that madam malkin had insisted would look perfect on lily despite lily protests madam malkin was currently poking her with a very sharp needle lily bit her lip to keep from snapping at the woman and james held in a laugh at lily discomfort we may need to take in the sides a little half an inch on each side tops the energetic woman decided oh okay lily replied glaring at james struggling with his laughter while you girls tend to that i ll go and find lily some more gowns james interjected he hoped to be able to snoop around the shop while madam malkin was occupied go ahead deary there some dazzling ones in the back there my niece was in here the other day trying them on and she looked absolutely beautiful in them i sure she did james replied he caught lily eye and winked at her leaving her with the seamstress james walked through the small shop and headed to the counter where the register was he looked around quickly and then pulled his invisibility cloak over himself he searched the drawers the list of customers in all the books on the shelf behind the counter james found nothing there that looked suspicious the names of the people ordering robes had no particular pattern and no known death eaters were on the list he saw a few family photos one was a large young woman standing next to madam malkin james assumed it was her niece he gave up on searching the counter and went to go look into the storage cupboard after a few minutes of quick searching james had nothing however he did hear madam malkin calling his name to come and see lily james returned from the closet and pulled off his cloak just a second i having trouble finding what i want her to try on next james called looking around frantically for something that would look good on lily and something in her size he remembered charlotte not talking to sirius for a week when he bought her a dress three sizes too big he found a few gowns in lily most flattering colors or at least what he thought looked sexiest emerald green ivory and black when he returned to the fitting area he found lily down from the stool turning for madam malkin yes yes i think that looks fabulous she exclaimed lily smiled at gave the woman a satisfactory answer now son what have you brought us the middle aged woman asked turning to james she snatched the robes from james hands and inspected them you look lovely lily james told his fianc e who he truly thought looked beautiful despite the hideous gown madam malkin had made sure to take it in so that it flattered every one of her curves lily rolled her eyes at him but the small smile creeping on her lips told james that she wasntreally mad at him ah these are lovely you re lucky to have a man that knows his fashion madam malkin started would you like me to make the same alterations to these lily bit her lip searching for an answer she didntwant to have to try on all of those robes oh wow lily it seven thirty all ready and i told your mum we d come over for that wonderful cherry pie she makes this evening we d better get going james lied but jamie kins i want to try on all of these lovely gowns you ve picked out lily replied in an exaggerated manner james frowned and rubbed his chin as if in thought i know i know we can come back and try them on but you know how your mother is she doesntlike to be kept up too late let just get this gown you have on now and we ll go five minutes later lily and james were back in the street james holding a large bag that contained lily new robe will you be changing into this now or are you saving it for some special occasion james asked grinning down at lily and draping his arm around her lily glared at james next time you have to be the distraction and i going to pick a revolting store to investigate how about that lingerie store down the bend i sure earl the clerk would love to size you up diagon alley doesnthave a lingerie store james stated yes it does lily replied winking at him you just have to know the right people so does that mean you ve been buying new undergarments lately james asked waggling his eyebrows lily smiled flirtatiously at him no it means that you ve been looking for a lingerie store before james could gather what she had said sirius and remus joined them both looking flushed find anything sirius asked breathing heavily no but madam malkin has a lovely niece the size of a whale james answered you sirius smiled slightly ah ruby i ve met her and no nothing unusual as far as quidditch is concerned lily looked from sirius to remus where peter the two men standing in front of her exchanged glances just as peter came running down the lane in the distance an old man yelled something unintelligent and shook his fist in peter direction old mr bates caught peter er investigating behind the counter and sort of got a bit mad at him remus stated as peter bounded into their group you couldnthave come and helped me peter panted sorry mate but i got caught nicking something from that place once and my left buttock hasntbeen the same since sirius replied as his hand ventured below his waist and he patted his bottom wincing slightly in remembrance james chuckled slightly let finish up we ll get ollivander and you can take florean place all right remus replied meet you in fifteen minutes but james i thought we d check out the lingerie lily exclaimed laughing there isnta lingerie store in diagon alley sirius reported with a sense of all knowing wisdom if you know the right people lily started before being tugged away by james an hour later lily sirius and james were sitting in james and sirius shared flat remus had told the group he would report to dumbledore they had found nothing as he had some other things to discuss with him and peter had insisted on tagging along charlotte coming over tonight sirius announced as he searched for something to drink that nice james replied as he sat on the recliner in the sitting room pulling lily on top of him haventseen her in almost a week she been out of town sirius continued are you trying to tell us to leave sirius because we d be perfectly happy doing so lily finally called out squirming as james attempted to tickle her more or less so sirius replied as a loud crash erupted in the kitchen damn maniacal giggles erupted from the living room as lily flailed about she supposed to be over in a few minutes sirius called out ignoring lily shrieks for help fine we re going padfoot james said finally helping a teary eyed lily off the floor as he stood up have fun yes have a nice evening sirius lily added winking at him before following james out the door well what would you like to do james asked holding lily hand in his as they walked the london streets the time had changed and it was now dark lily thought for a moment as she swung her arm lightly carrying james with hers have you had dinner yet i had a sandwich before we met earlier today but i could eat again let go to his restaurant down the lane it has the best desserts lily suggested over thirty three kinds of pie and forty three ice cream flavors james frowned slightly is it muggle lily grin faltered yes do you not feel like going muggle tonight he shook his head causing his many rebellious hairs to fall into his eyes no it just that i donthave any muggle money we d have to go exchange at diagon alley first lily kissed him spontaneously on his nose dontworry i have money and dontgive me any of that i have to be a gentleman and pay bullshit i can count the number of times i ve paid for our dates on one hand but i like paying for you james replied smiling sweetly at her as they walked lily shook her head her red hair fell loose on her shoulders shadowing her profile james could tell she was grinning what will you be having the tall waitress asked she had dark hair that was pinned tightly to her small head she seemed rather impatient and annoyed i ll have the custard pie lily decided after reading the menu she and james had been seated for only a few minutes when the hoity waitress had demanded for their orders dessert for dinner i only hope you wontenforce these unhealthy eating habits on our children james said keeping his smirk hostage and looking at lily with the utmost seriousness lily took a sip of her water sod off what will you be having the woman asked staring pointedly at james james always one for teasing and annoying already stressed out people hence teasing lily for the better part of seven years smiled and read the menu slowly the waitress huffed and began tapping her foot hm does the chocolate pie have any gooseberries walnuts or legumes in it the waitress dark eyes flickered at him no it a simple chocolate pie like the description says oh i a little bad with reading after that terrible eye operation i went under as a child had a tumor in my right eye you see and when i was ten this pencil got stuck in my left eye and well i ve had to undergo numerous operations to try to restore my vision i still have to wear these wretched glasses he continued talking slowly and elaborately as if the woman standing before him cared i sorry to hear that sir she replied nonplussed so the chocolate pie if you re absolutely sure there are no gooseberries i deathly allergic you see then yes and a slice of apple and can we get two mugs of coffee james finally ordered thank you ma m the waitress left with their orders not sure what to make with the gentleman she had just encountered i glad you ve matured so much these past few months james lily stated once they were left alone it been hard love james replied cheekily sliding closer to her in their booth and planting a kiss on her cheek after almost half an hour of waiting and james outcry of how long does it take to put a piece of bloody pie on a plate their pie was delivered to them along with two warm mugs of coffee cheers james said grinning his typical wide toothy smile and lifting his mug to hers that was lovely lily said as they left the small restaurant she was clutching james hand as they walked close together the temperature was dropping quickly and lily was regretting not wearing her cloak for the most part james replied i still cantbelieve you tipped the waitress it impolite not to tip lily quipped he shook his head not if the service is lousy she wasntthat bad if you werentbeing so childish lily pursed her lips she was beginning to get irritated i wasntbeing childish james defended they walked in silence for a moment then james spoke again she was being rude you cantsay she wasn t you just have that rule about being nice to everyone lily sighed and stopped walking so that she could turn to james all right she was being rude but that doesntgive you the excuse to irritate her even more she probably really sweet normally probably just having a bad day james looked down into lily bright eyes he knew she was getting angry he also knew she was right i sorry he finally said if you want we can go back and i ll apologize lily smiled slightly james always looked so endearing when he was feeling guilty it okay she well maybe she deserved it james leaned in and cupped her head in his hands and tipped her head back as he kissed her lily let her hands travel to his hair and she ran her fingers through his messy black mop seconds later a cold downpour shocked them apart freezing rain fell heavily all over london and james and lily were caught in the middle of it a block away from lily flat care to run james asked reaching for her hand as she nodded and they set off in a scurry laughing lily tried to keep up with james who was doing his best to not let his long legs leave lily shorter ones behind a few minutes later lily stopped and james nearly tripped in his haste to halt lily clutched her side and laughed into the rain cramp james asked a genuine look of concern playing on his handsome features just a little one lily replied smiling and breathing heavily although i never thought you could get out of shape if you were never in shape to begin with james chuckled and just looked lovingly at lily her red hair was sopping wet and her long eyelashes were collecting small droplets of water care to walk slowly then he suggested i can even transfigure us an umbrella or something james looked around for something he could transform but lily stopped him no i fine i like this just like this she held on to his arm and led the way home through the slowly flooding streets they reached lily flat drenched and cold but happy after fumbling with her keys lily opened her door to james come on in i ll fix some tea and we can dry off james smiled and walked in letting the warm air welcome him lily set her purse by the door and took off her jacket before heading to her kitchen while she was pouring water into a kettle two hands clapped around her eyes shielding all light from her green eyes guess who james whispered into her ear lily felt his warm breath touch her cheek and she reached her small hand up to his letting the kettle drop onto the counter she pulled his hands down and turned to face him welcoming his kiss james leaned into her never letting his kisses falter as he pushed her against the counter his hands reached around her waist before traveling up her shirt which until that point had been stuck to her wet skin his made to pull her shirt upwards and began to kiss her neck lily mind was racing but she did the only thing she could think to do and grabbed his hands with hers he broke away from her instantly too much he asked looking at her with imploring hazel eyes lily said nothing just kept her hands on his and pulled her top of her head james reached for her hands and kissed her softly lily smiled against his lips and then guided him down the hallway and led him to her bedroom she went to kiss him again but james pulled way and touched her cheek tenderly with his thumb are you sure he asked his voice soft and husky lily nodded and continued to kiss him pulling at his belt james pulled off his shirt as well wrapped his arms around lily and guided her to bed poll do you think that the current youth should get out there and start demonstrating and protesting just as the former generation of hippies had done thanks to my

morning was a warm heavy feeling in his chest he opened his eyes slowly to see lola lily now overweight calico cat resting on his upper body a small smile pressed upon his lips as he lifted his hand to pet lola who responded by stretching happily james was very aware of lily sleeping body entangled in his as his grin broadened so as not to wake her he reached slowly over her to grab his glasses from the nightstand he spent the next quiet moments watching lily sleep she looked simply beautiful her hair cascading wildly in every direction her smooth pastel skin illuminating in the early morning light lily green eyes opened slowly and james enjoyed watching her wake up one eyelid opened at a time and then a small smile formed at her lips good morning she said in a slow raspy voice that james found undeniably sexy her eyes locked with his before she asked have you been up long james shook his head only a few minutes i didntmean to wake you lily smiled and admired his ruffled appearance his hair was skewed in all directions and the sleep hadntquite left his eyes yet you didn t good he replied almost dumbly his hand had reached for her hair and he ran his fingers through the red mess untangling small knots as he did so as his hand reached the back of her neck he leaned in and kissed her in a tender way lily smiled against his lips and rolled on top of him taking half the sheets with her as they became more entwined with one another what time is it lily whispered into james ear james mumbled something along the lines of it doesntmatter but when he felt lily moving to get up and check he quickly glanced at his watch on the nightstand it half past six lily sighed and smiled as she looked down at james his hands were holding her waist and they were threatening to move lower i could have sworn it was later i feel so energized for it to not even be seven yet i am not a morning person james smirked at her and pulled her down to him not tired lily he whispered mischievously and she let out a mix of a squeal and a giggle it was almost seven thirty when lily finally suggested breakfast i ll make you something anything you d like james said energetically as he kissed her forehead lily grinned slightly you donthave to besides you re a terrible cook james huffed not terrible i ll prove it to you now what does your little heart desire schnukums pancakes french toast eggs benedict waffles he listed off the top of his head with a half smile lily resigned herself to james and replied some pancakes would be delicious that my girl james smiled as he moved to leave her bed now sausage or bacon bacon lily answered as she moved to follow james i ll show you where the pans james held up his hand to stop her from leaving the bed i know where they are schnukums you stay here i ll call you when i done all right but please dontburn down my kitchen or building i happen to like my belongings and i sure charlotte and the apples will agree lily stated smirking as she watched james put on his boxers but i want to burn down your kitchen hell i want to burn down this whole side of london now excuse me while i go start a grease fire james answered coyly winking at her before leaving the room fifteen minutes later lily couldntstand it anymore she kept hearing pots and pans clashing and james mutter the occasional damn or shit she sighed and jumped out of bed she grabbed a bathrobe and sniffed good lord was that smoke as she walked down the hallway to the kitchen the smell got stronger and she could see a small hazy cloud enveloping the entire flat merlin james she called through the cloud pulling out her wand and dissipating the smoke she heard james laugh lightly and she finally saw his figure waving his arm around clearing the air and smiling what did you do lily asked not sure what was so funny did you put the fire out james laughed that wasnta fire i found a candle but apparently it wasnta candle i think it charlotte s or maybe mine or sirius it came from zonko s a zonko product lily laughed james you re losing touch if you were fooled by the company that got you through hogwarts i know james replied i feel so old and decrepit quick check are there any gray hairs am i balding my eyesight it blurry lily laughed and kissed him on the nose do you need any help he shook his head stubbornly i told you i d do it now you go sit down over in the sitting room and turn on the television and watch those mad people go on about the weather they re never right but then how could you expect them to be it not like they re wizards or anything you re too cute was all lily said as she shook her head and headed to the sitting room plopping down on the sofa after many minutes of anticipation lily was finally allowed to come to the kitchen your breakfast my dear is ready james announced lily nodded and looked him over good you still have your eyebrows funny i know i know lily smiled as james showed her to the rarely used dining room she wouldnthave been surprised if he had to clean off an inch layer of dust he had decorated with a vase full of lilies which she could only assume he had transfigured from something it was october after all and she didntremember having any vases this looks lovely james lily complimented kissing him softly before he pulled out her chair and motioned her to sit down that morning was indeed lovely much to lily surprise the pancakes had turned out quite nicely but lily told him even if they hadn t she would have said they were delicious anyways the bacon was perfect and james had even prepared a dish of strawberries i glad you enjoyed it james said as they finished and lily had run out of things to compliment him on lily made to reach for james empty plate when an owl swooped into the dining room hitting the vase of lilies and causing water to spill across the white table cloth damn old bird james swore righting the vase and yanking the piece of parchment from the graying owl beak he handed the letter to lily it for you from my mum i suppose lily recognized the old owl as the one mrs potter treasured and occasionally used for relatively short trips so that the bird didntfeel useless in its retried age she couldntrecall its name boris perhaps james cleaned up the mess made by the morning delivery and then began to clean up the dishes as lily read the letter your mother has invited us to an early dinner this evening she says my parents are going to be there as well lily stood up and met james in the kitchen oh damn is that today james asked slightly startled i was supposed to tell you about that so the letter says lily grinned slightly stroking james arm with her hand he looked endearing standing in her kitchen with nothing but his boxers and trying his hand at cleaning dishes this was the man she got to spend the rest of her life with it was a comforting thought i going to get a shower i ve got to make something for this evening lily said quietly admiring james looking down at her you dontneed to make anything if i know my mum which i daresay i do she ll have enough food for five christmas feasts no no i ve got to bring something it only polite lily argued softly and passively i ll make a dessert what would you like it doesntmatter james replied anything easy james i ll use magic it all pretty easy now what would you like james smiled cherry pie i love that all right cherry pie it is she grinned kissing lips quickly now i going to shower is that an open invitation james called out chuckling lily didntreply i take silence as a yes lily dear james left the dishcloth on the counter top and went to explore the bathroom later that evening lily and james found themselves knocking on the potters door lily had almost walked right in the house before james had pulled her back he insisted that his father sometimes forgot he was at home and not out on the field and could set off all sorts of jinxes and hexes towards any intruder without so much as a glance at to who the trespasser may be so they stood together knocking on james former residence his mother answered the door looking as happy as ever to see her son and future daughter in law she hugged them both after magicking lily pie to the kitchen not without a compliment to how beautiful the dessert had turned out and then sent them to the parlor where she informed them lily parents were already waiting james greeted lily parents first giving a strong hand shake to patrick and a warm hug to beverly lily you look lovely beverly told her daughter hugging her tightly i miss not seeing you so much you know you should at least call once in awhile you got that phone installed but you barely use it sorry mum i just get so busy sometimes lily replied knowing it was a terrible excuse for not keeping in touch with her own flesh and blood not good enough love her father said as he gave her a hug i ll call once a week from now on lily promised or more if work isnttoo hectic her parents smiled at her and returned to their seats on the sofa james and lily took a seat at the couch perpendicular to lily parents just as they sat james mother entered the room looking around merlin where is your father he promised to come down as soon as he was done with the letter he was writing chances are one letter turned into two or three mum you know dad when it comes to business james responded looking up at his mother his mother sighed wringing the dishcloth in her hands well dinner is ready you all can go take your seats i ll go get sam james showed lily and her parents to the dining room where gigantic proportions of food were displayed lily thought their meal could rival one of hogwarts they all sat for a moment before james mother returned alone sam will be down in a moment please go ahead half way into dinner sam potter joined them taking his seat at the head of he table and giving them all an apologetic look sorry for keeping you he stated beckoning the roasted chicken towards him with his wand hope everything all right beverly said noticing the tired worried air sam seemed to carry around with him oh well matters are just grave at the moment sam spoke truthfully but we re doing are best to take care of it james and lily both looked at sam with arched brows and pursed lips wondering what had gone wrong before james could question his father margaret potter diverted their attention to a different topic now beverly i ve heard lily has a sister margaret started yes petunia she a few years older than lily beverly offered ignoring lily blanched expression margaret didntnotice an edge in the air and continued ah she all muggle then yes she was married a few months ago actually lily mother explained her father tactfully engaged sam and james into one of his favorite topics cars that thunderbird you restored for lily james was a piece of work i d like to ride in it sometime patrick conversed james smiled i ll have to talk lily into letting you take a ride although i sure you could persuade her to drive it there a great difference between being behind the wheel and a passenger in a car like that i would imagine so patrick replied grinning and then looking to the man that looked so much like james it was rather shocking do you make a hobby of cars sam across the table james heard lily ask just how are the dursleys these days mother with only the slightest amount of annoyance in her tone james thought for sure he was the only one who picked up on lily current animosity they are fine petunia had a wonderful time setting up their house with all the proper decorations she is so anal about some things i think she spends half her day cleaning that house her mother continued margaret smiled and took a sip of her red wine james stroked lily hand lightly under the table as he continued to listen to sam and patrick conversation a few minutes later margaret offered dessert a choice between lily cherry pie and beverly brownies james requested both as did sam and patrick this is delicious lily you ll have to give me your recipe beverly said sure i ll send an owl over tomorrow lily quipped taking a small bite of pie i d like it too if you dontmind dear margaret added lily nodded and smiled after the plates were cleared the party was directed back into the parlor but james excused both he and lily to take a walk around the manor both sets of parents readily released their children and moments later james and lily found themselves outside walking in the chilly but refreshing october air lily wrapped her cloak tighter against the wind and admired the setting red sun and brown and golden leaves illuminating in the light from their piles on the dead ground james draped his arm over lily shoulders and gave her a swift kiss on the cheek lily smiled and wrapped her arm around james waist as they walked i get the feeling our parents wanted us to leave lily said james nodded i think they re discussing our wedding present what makes you think that lily asked looking up at him with her green eyes my mother had her present face on the one she gets around christmas and my birthday when she either finished buying my presents or wrapping them she looked the same to me lily said matter of factly to you she would but dontworry you ll pick up on it james smiled kissing the top of her head they walked at a comfortable pace through the fields of potter manor occasionally lily would remark on the beauty of the trees and the simple nature and james would provide her with the history of what ever she had pointed out care to sit for a moment james asked her as they reached a small pond the water is going to look bloody brilliant against the sunset lily grinned and nodded taking a seat next to james so what do you think our parents are getting us lily asked playfully leaning her head on james shoulder and intertwining her hands with his i dontknow he pondered i was thinking about but no i dontthink they would not yet at least lily studied his profile in the dimming light what i was thinking well i know this estate is endowed to me i the only heir but i dontthink i dontknow my dad is just acting so strangely lately i hope they arentgiving the estate up as a wedding present james rambled as he thought no they know we ve bought a house james words stopped as lily placed her lips on his and kissed him he smiled and responded appropriately letting his arm catch lily back as she leaned towards the ground allowing james to hover over her just kissing her james was a great snog lily had decided that long ago but it always surprised her how he treated kissing like an art he could kiss for hours and not push any further just snogging letting his lips travel around her jaw bone and nibble at her ear creating that delightful ticklish feeling that always left lily wanting him more she knew he got as much pleasure from this exercise as she did she knew that he liked the way that she could move her lips across his neck and leave traces of her hot breath seeping into the pores of his skin james finally broke away for air smiling down at lily whose lips were slightly swollen she grinned back at him waiting for him to say something or better do something you re very pretty he said finally breathing heavily i know lily replied with a smirk james smiled and pulled away kneeling beside her stroking her fingers he suddenly looked very contemplative and lily sat up wondering what had come over him so quickly there was something else i needed to talk to you about james started almost in a whisper lily huddled closer to him and rested her head on his shoulder looked up at him and smiled what about she replied in a playful voice as she kissed his cheek james sighed and let his smile slip off his face it serious the change in mood seemed to finally have hit lily and she held his hand tighter what wrong well i ve been talking with mad eye and he been stressing with us aurors are becoming more and more scarce lately either being killed injured or just quitting because they couldnthandle it anymore dawes had to go on a much needed vacation which is just ministry lingo for something terribly wrong imperius probably i know things are rough now james lily interrupted i ve been filing the cases for madam bones it seems like every week we have a least one file coming in a murder muggle terrorism but you ve just got to look above it this will pass the ministry and dumbledore the order are all going after voldemort and his death eaters things will get better damn it lily i not telling you my training is getting to me that these dark times are bothering me i trying to tell you that moody has asked me to join the aurors james snapped even in the increasing darkness he could see the color drain from lily face what lily asked he cantdo that you haventeven come close to finishing your training i wouldntbe a full fledged auror it would count towards my training lily let out a dry laugh oh that fair we re not going to call you an auror we re just going to work you like one let you die like one i in the elite program lily i not completely incompetent james retorted shaking his head pulling at the grass with his fingers i dontthink you re incompetent james lily said in a soft tone i just wasntready to let you go out there yet i thought we d at least have a few more months of being safe nothing safe anymore lily donttry to live in a illusion james said in an equally soft voice and moody said it wontbe a full time thing i ll still go to training it just when the aurors need help they ll call on me i go tomorrow to get my contactor i know you ll do amazing she said with as much confidence she could put into her voice you re the most brilliant person i ve ever met lily knew it was important for her to support james now he needed to know that she had faith in him he was silent but lily could see a small smile forming on his thin lips lily moved closer to him and wrapped her arms around his torso holding him in a warm embrace his head buried in her chest as he whispered i love you dontforget to answer the poll do you have any bad habits that you know you

few smokers bad eaters and procrastionaters too i procrastinate a lot one of my bad habits is smoking clove cigarettes the smell good taste good and kill you as for this chapter poll what your favorite joke yeah so read review and answer the poll thanks chapter twenty five early november hog head was a place that was usually full of suspicious looking characters the colder weather and damp air had come with november and the number of odd patrons to the dirty dark bar seemed to have tripled it was crowded and noisy the perfect environment for the meeting about to start in the smoky corner two figures sat side by side at one of the tables in the back one of the cloaked figures was smoking the other was checking his watch and sighing two more cloaked figures approached the table you re late said the man checking his watch the taller of the two men spoke sorry it proved a bit more difficult to leave the castle than we originally thought dumbledore was keeping an eye on us the man smoking put out his cigarette on the table well sit we donthave all night what has been going on the shorter of the visitors said as he took a seat next to his companion nothing that concerns you malfoy the time watching man said oh sod off severus you act like you re superior malfoy said snidely what are you two the dark lord messenger service my brother lucius is closer to him than either of you could ever be so donttalk down to me got it he continued venom leaking through his voice he smiled cheekily and then looked at the other man and macnair what are you doing here didntyou have a case against the wizengmot coming up i didntthink the dark lord would trust you after that last mistake under your watch the man called macnair glared at the boy in front of him this business actually has very little to do with you marlon snape started talking with his typical murderous tone the dark lord just thought it would be an advantageous move to have you come he likes to check in on his young followers make sure they re coming up to par he d hate to have a insufficient supporter and keeps a closer eye on the two of you as well as others than you d care to know now we have news for black the taller of the two visitors nodded from the dark lord of course snape answered taking a sip from his glass it looked like it had never been washed and marlon malfoy looked more than a little disgusted he thinks you are ready regulus but not me marlon stated appalled i ll have him know that my family and myself have shown more loya enough macnair growled slamming his fist on the table the black family is just as pure as the malfoy family and if i do say so myself they re interest in the dark arts greatly exceeds that of yours marlon despite that blood traitor of a brother of yours regulus snape continued regulus who shared the same handsome aristocratic features as sirius although quite a bit paler nodded it all right my mother disowned him long ago now what is this of the dark lord he thinks you are ready to join him that is if you can leave hogwarts snape stated looking into regulus gray eyes i can leave an education under dumbledore is nothing when being taken under the dark lord wing regulus replied without much thought or emotion snape sneered i assured him of your willingness but this news will delight him macnair passed a slip of paper across the table to regulus dontlet anyone he looked at malfoy see that paper it the address meet there tonight 11 o clock you can apparate regulus nodded good burn that parchment as soon as you memorize the details macnair finished see you then lay low and you ll be getting your invitation soon malfoy snape said getting up to leave and letting macnair follow him leaving the boys at the table as they exited that bar x sirius please let not go in there it so filthy charlotte said to her boyfriend as she held on to his hand sirius smirked down at her with his usual rueful grin his hair was starting to get a bit long and it fell into his gray eyes all right love i ll do whatever you want i at your disposal just as charlotte was about to reply a passerby ran into her shoulder sending a sharp pain throughout her side ouch hey watch it there sirius shouted at the assaulter who was walking speedily away with his companion sirius went to make sure charlotte was all right when the two men turned around black is that you one voice called out trickling with dislike sirius looked up and came face to face with his old enemy snivellus i didntknow you went outdoors he greeted stiffly clutching charlotte arm protectively with his left arm while his right went to his wand and i surprised you re not in azkaban yet snape replied sneering at him and then moving his attention to charlotte surprised i not in azkaban why snivelly i could say the same for you sirius retorted glaring at snape and his friend you two out on death eater duty or are you gay now snivellus i cantsay i didntsee it coming oh dontlook at me like that there nothing wrong with it snape ignored him and focused on charlotte who are you he asked in a domineering voice before charlotte could reply sirius cut in that none of your business sirius put his arm around charlotte and puffed out his chest proudly now if you dontmind we ve got places to be snape let out a dry laugh but macnair looked anything but amused sirius black protective over a girl and here i was thinking the rumors were true that you were actually a slightly more than mediocre auror in training but you re just as weak as ever caring about someone doesntmake you weak it makes you compassionate a better stronger person although i doubt you know anything about that snape face fell slightly as his eyes bore into charlotte hazel eyes that looked vaguely familiar and just who are you another one of black little flings they always think they re worth more than they are they never see that he never really sees anything in them sirius black was never one to let the ones he loved be insulted especially by severus snape that why he suddenly found himself lunging towards snape grabbing the front of his robes and pressing his own wand sharply into the center of his pallid throat say anything else snivelly and i ll hex you and your friend into the next life sirius whispered viciously through clenched teeth the said friend however had his wand out now as well snape surprised sirius by waving it down and letting out another laugh black you need to learn to watch your tongue or better your back there are certain friends of mine that find blood traitors like you and your girlfriend i suspect very bothersome they wouldntmind paying you a visit or her a visit if things got out of hand snape said gasping towards the end of his speech as sirius withdrew his wand and released the front of his robes dontyou or the people you hide behind snape touch her because the rumors you have heard are true i am a very powerful wizard and unlike most people i donthave limits with his words sirius grabbed charlotte hand and pushed his way through snape and macnair just missing his brother and malfoy exiting the bar and meeting their previous visitors my dear brother causing problems again severus regulus asked looking pointedly at his retreating kin black is nothing to worry about he ll get his soon enough snape said quietly you better get back to school and collect your things the dark lord is awaiting you and mind he is not a patient man regulus nodded and made his way back to the castle marlon malfoy tailing him x how many of these things to go through james asked tiredly he and lily had been working on their wedding invitations for the past hour or rather lily was addressing them and james was flicking his wand and putting them into their envelopes only seven more to go lily said patiently as she reached across james dining room table for another invitation i dontsee why we cantsend magical invitations to your muggle relatives it so much faster james commented for the fifth time that evening lily sighed the magical ones were indeed quicker to prepare and mail out a few flicks from her wand and a trip to the owlery and they were done they wontunderstand why an owl is delivering them a piece of parchment james they d probably freak out she repeated for the fifth time i know i know james said i just didntthink we were inviting this many people most of my family wontcome these are more like announcements to be polite lily conversed we re not a very close knit family she grinned at james as he sighed again james caught her eye i ll try to look on the bright side of things that a good idea lily responded going back to the invitations at least i marrying you imagine if i was marrying someone else this wouldntbe nearly as amusing i sure hope you re not being sarcastic james potter lily replied not even looking up from her work i not imagine if i was with say chloe marble from hogwarts this would be absolute torture was that the girl with the cleft foot and lisp a year ahead of us she had that weird obsession with prehistoric dragons lily asked looking mildly amused as she caught james eye why yes she was a bore to talk to and spit would always get on your face if you got too close lily let out a small laugh that lightened up the droll mood well i ll look on the bright side too i could be doing this with gilderoy lockheart james grinned happily at her and was about to speak when his eyes bulged slightly lily was beginning to know that look and she sighed as his hand moved down to his cloak pocket he pulled out a small device that lily still hadntmanaged to figure out how it worked it made sense to james however and he looked at her with apologetic eyes i sorry but i ve got to go there been a slew of muggle attacks james stood up from the table and brushed off his robes he leaned in and kissed lily quickly i ll be back later tonight if you ll wait for me lily nodded i ll be here be careful james i really am sorry i do want to help you with the rest of those i was only joking james continued as he made sure his wand was in place i know just go do what you have to do and mind dontget yourself killed i keen on having a wedding and contrary to popular belief i wouldntrather marry gilderoy james smiled and kissed her once more i ll be back sooner than you think love you and with that he was out the door lily sighed and looked down at the almost finished invitations it had been almost three weeks since james had received his contactor this was the third time this week james had been called out two days ago he had been called before the previous order meeting james had informed dumbledore of his position who was very encouraging having james with the aurors would be good for the order the first time that week they had been getting ready to go to lily parents for dinner and although she resented having to be in petunia and vernon company without someone to keep the atmosphere civil she was more irked by the fact that when she had explained james absence as being work related her parents had commended him on his willfulness and hard working attitude sirius was till patting james on the back every chance he got even james parents though wary were proud and encouraging everyone seemed to feel that james new position was a good idea but she had still to get used to that thought she didntsee why the aurors needed to take her james from her so early and she knew she was being selfish she let out another sigh and went to finish the invitations before deciding to tackle the mound of paper work she could do for work it had been lucky she had brought her things for the next day x lily awoke the next morning to find james strong arms wrapped around her she turned around carefully to face him to make sure he was really there and it wasntsome extension of a dream james face was peaceful he inhaled softly and then exhaled he always slept with his mouth closed lily had discovered she on the other hand slept with hers open most of the time and sometimes she drooled she smiled at the sleeping figure and looked to see what time it was five forty four the alarm was going to go off in a matter of seconds lily groaned and she felt more than a little sorry for james he was about to be woken up and he still looked exhausted what time had he gotten in last night she hadntheard him come to bed the shock of the alarm awoke james and his arms immediately left lily as he sat upright he turned to look around the room an anxious expression worn on his face he caught sight of lily and smiled oh the clock he said yawning and rubbing his eyes before reaching for his glasses on his nightstand lily studied him carefully he looked rather frazzled james rarely appeared anything but calm and confident are you okay james turned to lily and nodded yes i fine and nice pajamas by the way they look absolutely lovely on you lily blushed slightly she hadntbrought her own pajamas because she had assumed she wasntgoing to be wearing any with james absence however she had decided to pick out one of james shirts and a pair of his old pajama bottoms i hope you dontmind i didnthave any james shook his head and kissed her forehead of course i dontmind he gazed into lily eyes for a moment and lily smiled at him james grinned back and then surprised her by giving her a warm loving embrace was it bad lily questioned timidly as she caressed his back she felt james nod into her shoulder yes there were a group of death eaters going on a muggle killing spree we had to chase them down three houses completely demolished before we could catch up to them three families murdered by the time we caught them in burnby village even the children lily hugged him tighter and he did the same when they broke apart lily stroked his hair softly and let her hand rest on his cheek did you catch anyone james sighed we got one i sure it ll be in the papers today victor crandall two got away though chances are i ll be doing his legal work today lily replied i better get ready let me make you something for breakfast do you have to go in today james nodded yes but mad eye said i could come in a little late if i needed to well get some rest then i ll make you something before i go are you going to be up for meeting allison and jacob for dinner if you re not it fine i think you d be better off resting i ll go we haventseen them in awhile and allison been wanting to go on a double dinner date forever yes but another day wouldnthurt lily retorted as she hopped out of bed james stared at her and gave her a loving grin that showed all of his teeth it ll be fine lily if you say so lily replied as she rummaged through her bag to get her toiletries get some rest x lily had a busy day at work the paperwork seemed to form skyscrapers around her every time she blinked which she found slightly ridiculous seeing as it was almost impossible for the ministry to actually convict anyone it was getting frustrating the time the effort the workload two people had quit in the last month lily wasntplanning on quitting anytime soon however she still felt like she was making a difference and madam bones really appreciated her work the fact that she had priceless resources to research some of the people dumbledore would request information on didnthurt either at seven thirty james knocked at her door lily let him in and together they set off for the three broomsticks where they were going to meet jacob and allison for dinner james are you sure you re feeling quite all right you dontlook lily started as they walked into the pub i fine james replied cutting her off believe me lily he gave her a reassuring grin and let his hand move to the small of her back guiding her to the table where an ecstatic allison and a smiling jacob greeted them allison immediately embraced lily after exclaiming just how excited she was to see her old friend jacob and james exchanged a firm handshake and took their seats their girlfriends giggled and chatted amicably for a few minutes before madam rosmerta appeared asking for their orders once the familiar barmaid had disappeared with their requests allison felt it necessary to start a proper conversation how many months till the wedding now she asked the couple sitting across from her in the booth rather redundantly it not like she didntknow their wedding was on the ninth of january about two james said with a content glimmer in his eye mailed off the invitations just today allison smiled everything planned and in order i know how anal lily organization skills are we ve taken care of just about everything lily replied easily the only thing we have to is the house james interrupted smiling slightly and giving lily a look lily wontlet me in though jacob laughed for the first time that evening until that moment he had been shifting rather uncomfortably in his seat not even married yet and she kicked you out james shared an appreciative chuckle to which allison joined in on lily merely gave james a pointed look i am working on the inside you arentallowed in until i finished she had been for the last few months collecting furniture for their new house and stowing it away inside the quaint house to james dismay she had put just about every charm she could think of to keep him from investigating she often wondered if james hadntfound a way around the enchantments here she was trying to keep the chief marauder out of his own house she let out a small sigh that didntgo unnoticed her fianc grinned at her and touched her shoulder lightly as their food appeared i cantwait to see it they passed the next few minutes with their attention focused primarily on their food but finally allison initiated conversation again the next hogsmeade trip is in a few weeks lily i got a letter from ellie she would like us to meet up with her that sounds great lily said happily after she finished taking a sip of her water i haventseen her in ages i ve written a few letters but i so busy i know what you mean allison replied the stories never stop at the prophet well the news is always changing jacob added with a slight edge in his voice his dark features suddenly looked wary allison chose to ignore his comment and continued eating james exchanged a glance with lily and made to change the subject when a friendly face appeared in front of them sirius allison exclaimed i haventseen you in forever she jumped out of her seat and enveloped him in a hug sirius smug features looked amused when she released him merlin prewitt i never thought you enjoyed my company that much he grinned and took a sip from the mug of mead in his hand so what brings you all down here i didntknow you had a date tonight jamesie sorry didntsee you this morning reckon you and charlotte could ve come james answered him easily yeah next time i suppose well i better be off dumbledore wanted to see me for something cantimagine what unless he secretly thinks i responsible for the exploding toilets in derbyshire sirius winked at lily as he saw her lips start to move only joking lily i ll see you all later james nodded and took a sip of his drink and waved at his friend the rest of the evening passed unusually slow and both james and lily were eager to leave once they were at lily flat she shared what was on her mind did allison and jacob seem rather she paused as she searched for the word james supplied one for her strained lily nodded yeah they did a bit edgy maybe jacob just had a rough day he offered as he took off his cloak i hope that was it lily said her eyebrows knitted together with worry i sure they ll be all right james assured her bringing her into a hug he kissed her forehead and lily smiled and kissed his lips lightly i ll make some tea for us that sounds lovely james responded letting her go and watching her walk into the kitchen he silently thanked merlin that she was his and that for the moment they were safe and happy x remember to answer the poll what your favorite joke thanks to all my readers and reviewers hermione

six nightmares arentreality the darkness enveloped the room it was quiet an unnatural calm in the middle of the night there werenteven any old house noises to give it a haunting feel no creaking floor boards or rusty pipes giving hollow sounds james let out a breath he was alone it was cold and all around him he could feel the impending disaster that was bound to find him james turned about the room as he heard the quick swishing of a cloak someone was in the room ever alert his right hand tightened around his wand as he glanced around in the blackness it was impossible to make anything and he began to sweat with nervousness he hated being like this stranded and waiting like a mouse in a trap this couldntend nicely all of a sudden the room illuminated and james eyes were shocked into adjusting to the brightness three hooded figures in black robes were staring at him death eaters where had they come from how did he not at least feel their presence the man standing in the middle smiled menacingly as he pulled off his hood there was no mistaking the black greasy hair snape james shouted holding his wand up severus snape sneered at james with his cold black eyes potter potter potter i thought dumbledore would have told you never to attempt missions alone it just takes one mistake and something bad could happen something tragic what have you done with lily james demanded his voice sharp and quavering at the same time the panic had really hit him now lily was missing and there was no one to help him snape let out a hollow laugh and his two hooded companions joined him with their own cruel snickers where is she james shouted his whole body trembling with intense emotion it was taking all his inner strength to keep from foolishly attacking them it was three on one after all she right here snape said lightly stepping back and to the side to reveal a body limp and still on the ground james made to rush to her but the two unidentified wizards pulled out their wands snape laughed again not too fast potter wouldntwant to do anything rash would you because now you know whose life is on the line james glared at severus snape with the utmost loathing he pulled out his wand and made to curse snape and his friends with the most horrifying curse he could muster avada kevadra he shouted clutching his wand and sending the spell his arm tingling with the sensation of the green death light snape merely smiled and with almost inhuman speed ducked and to james horror his curse hit the lifeless lily on the cold floor james blood ran cold and the color visibly drained from his face he had done it he had killed lily his lily the one person that he was supposed to protect james james james jerked upright his naked body was cold and drenched with sweat james are you quite all right you look so clammy you re trembling lily james replied his voice faint and disbelieving well who else would be here with you in bed lily asked looking at james with concern james hazel eyes looked at her as though he had never seen before he studied her for a moment before wrapping his arms around her bringing her red hair to his face and taking in the smell as he held her lily wasntquite sure what was wrong but returned the embrace whole heartedly i thought you were dead i thought i had killed you james whispered in a low tone that sounded akin to the soft hum of a swarm of bees what no james i right here with you alive one hundred percent alive you can even take my pulse if you d like she grinned and she could feel the heat returning to james body i sorry i never want to hurt you ever james kept repeating holding his lily tightly james let me fix us some tea and you can tell me all about your dream it ll help you go to sleep you ve got to work first thing in the morning you need your rest he nodded and released her carefully before grabbing his pants and following her to the kitchen an hour later and james was finally sleeping restfully in lily bed she watched him with her loving green eyes as he slept his chest rising and falling in a peaceful rhythm she was really starting to worry about her fianc the strain of training and joining the aurors was eating away at him he was becoming more and more stressed and she was wondering when he was finally going to crack from the pressure she had started hinting at him to take things slower but he hadntlistened very well like she expected james had never been one to back down from his responsibilities especially with a war waging on and civilization at the brink of destruction the most she could hope for was that he would find a nice balance she didntknow that she was what kept him going what kept him from breaking down when things got too hard although she had her suspicions pass me that cloth sirius lily asked the young man standing in the room with her who was currently turning about and inspecting his surroundings what pass the cloth she said pointing to the corner where a cloth lay sirius looked at her dumbly oh never mind lily resigned going for the cloth herself that rag sirius asked why didntyou just summon it i donthave my wand on me at the second you should always carry your wand with you it not safe not to lily sighed exasperatedly i know sirius it just not the most comfortable thing to have it in my back pocket jabbing my arse i didntthink you minded a little jab in the arse sirius retorted winking at her i didntthink you did either sirius laughed and patted lily on the back well i think that does it for this room the furniture hasnteven been arranged yet sirius lily stated reaching for her wand and motioning for the sofa to get into alignment now that it for the sitting room shall we hit the dining room next we can polish the oak i suppose sirius replied starting to wonder why he had promised lily that he would help her arrange the new house as a surprise for james dontwant to overexert yourself with excitement or anything i know how delicate you are lily retorted her words laced with her usual sarcasm sirius sighed dontworry about me love i do believe i ll make it lily let out a light laugh as she checked her watch damn i ve got to go meet ellie and allison for an early dinner ellie has a hogsmeade day today i really wanted to get this done today james is getting so impatient she sighed it ll be nice to see ellie though you know sirius started rubbing the back of his neck i wouldntmind finishing up the sitting room for you and dontworry i wontmake a mess of it i remember exactly how you wanted it set up oh sirius you d do that lily asked happily i d really appreciate it are you sure i know it had to have been pure torture working with me on this house i know how anal i can be sirius shrugged it fine i love helping you and james out it no problem i donthave anything else to do until later tonight anyways i going to meet moony and wormtail for mead well thank you lily exclaimed giving sirius an appreciate embrace james is going to love it i know sirius replied grinning his usual handsome smile revise you cantgrin a smile now go i ll take care of everything and dontforget the charms lily called out before she left you remember them oh charms what are you talking about you couldntpossibly be speaking of those million spells you cast compulsively every five seconds could you are those what you re talking about i m i get it sirius just do them please all right keep your robe on i will now have a good time and dontworry about anything thank you lily finished before finally leaving him to his own devices lily a shrill excited voice exclaimed loudly directing previously engaged witches and wizards to the bombarded red head that walked into the three broomsticks ellie she replied smiling as she embraced her old friend before taking a seat across from her at the old oak table allison not here yet no she ll be a few minutes late she sent an owl this morning ellie answered taking a sip of her butterbeer lily nodded oh well how have you been then i feel like i haventseen you in forever that because you haven t you busy prude ellie retorted sharply a brilliant smile still plastered on her pretty face i am sorry about that lily apologized everything is happening and changing so fast i just get carried away well i sure if i was engaged to a handsome brilliant and wealthy man i wouldntpay attention much to my friends either ellie grinned in her wicked fashion slag lily teased ellie stuck out her tongue dontpretend he isntthe thing that keeps you so occupied lily thought for a moment well he is a big part of it but there work you know and the war going on and what not lots of stuff happening and things to keep up with yeah i know all about that the prophet wontlet anyone forget ellie said sourly as madam rosmerta approached the table just a butterbeer for me rosmerta lily ordered giving the barmaid a small smile before they both went back to their previous activity well it has gotten quite terrible people are disappearing left and right and you dontknow who to trust anymore lily continued as allison approached them waving and smiling brilliantly hello my dears she exclaimed her awkward angle and outstretched arms demanding hugs from both lily and ellie i have missed you so much ellie you ll have to tell me all about your year i know i know i get your letters and jake talks about you all the time but letters dontallow for much girly detail not much has changed ellie responded pulling a dark lock of hair out from behind her ear and twirling it around her index finger no boyfriend allison prodded raising her blonde eyebrows no i single and unattached it feels nice actually ellie said as madam rosmerta sent a round of butterbeers for the girls i ve been so on and off with guys for the past year or so and it just relieving really to be independent no one latching on to me sucking the life out from me you talk about boyfriends like they re leeches lily commented laughing they can be i know what you re talking about ellie always wanting and needing more needing to know what you re doing allison agreed ellie nodded with a chuckle jake wearing you out much allison sighed oh you know how it is relationships just take so much time it nice to have the companionship though lily stared down into her fresh mug of butterbeer she considered herself really lucky to have james he never felt like some sort of parasite she always enjoyed his company and never got tired of him the way allison and ellie were describing lily smiled to herself and zoned back into allison and ellie conversation they had changed topics and lily was trying desperately to figure out exactly what they were talking about before they asked for her oblivious opinion anything interesting going on at old hogwarts lily heard allison change the subject ellie shifted slightly well yes but i thought you two would have already known about it what happened lily asked her interest peaked by ellie information yes what you cantexpect us to keep up with all that school gossip now that we re out in the real world allison commented said in her shrewish voice well i cantbelieve you haventheard really ellie hesitated regulus black has left school he been missing since halloween night the rumor is that he finally joined you know who she finished in a whisper lily green eyes bulged what wait does sirius know ellie shrugged i would assume so although dumbledore is trying to keep it as hush hush as possible he doesntwant it to seem glamorized running off in the middle of the night to join a conquest with the dark lord oh dontact so surprised lily we all knew sirius was the only good seed in a basket of bad apples it was only a matter of time before regulus joined up with you know who that whole family is so deep into dark magic allison stated airily dismissing the news like it was only a topic of a early snowstorm so shopping she suggested smiling excitedly i haventhad time to shop for ages allison you were saying that you just bought that pink cloak just this past week lily commented laughing as she took another drink from her half full glass contemplating the news did sirius know did james know they would both be furious if they knew a week without shopping ellie exclaimed laughing let go lily got up reluctantly and followed her friends out sirius and regulus at the back of her mind lily returned to her flat later that night after a day full of girlish gossip and shopping it had been a fun outing with her old friends the good company made it easy to pretend the bad times were only illusions that the world was still a happy place to be she smiled to herself as she took off her shoes and cloak and went to the kitchen to fix a cup of tea she had the house to herself tonight it was going to be nice to relax someone had other plans a banging came to lily door that startled her from her daze she felt her stomach leap into her throat at her excitement who would be calling she wasntexpecting anyone lily grabbed her wand and opened the door cautiously standing in front of her was a ruffled and anxious looking james james is everything okay she asked relieved that it wasntanyone dangerous but a new nervousness settled into her heart he shook his head frantically sirius is gone dontforget to answer the poll if you could be all knowing in

21st i excited and i going to try to finish this story by then i know i ve got a ways to go but if i can set a deadline for myself i can hope to get things done well enjoy this chapter the poll is valentine day overrated and as for the last chapter poll i was suprised that people had different things for the most part the ability to be all knowing in guys would be really helpful as well as math talking to horses i d like to be able to talk to my cats haha history of the different countries that would be really helpful people in general scinetifical information the ability to protect your family as a seer i think that would be good too i just had a dream my twin died terrified me and of course magic as for a recap for last chapter james dreamed of losing lily lily and sirius finished decorating lily and james house lily met with her friends and sirius disappeared chapter twenty seven the first encounter what do you mean he gone lily asked her face whitening under the sudden terror james words produced james threw his hands in the air he didntcome home remus said he was supposed to meet him for a drink but that he never showed remus is off checking his underground sources for any information on where sirius could be james voice was higher than usual and he was as panicked as lily had ever seen him lily put her arms around him and kissed his cheek it ll be all right james let go go where james asked releasing his grip around his fianc to dumbledore he probably knows something and then i sure we ll be going to voldemort voldemort james face contorted it had been his first guess and his worst fear he decided that he needed to pull himself together what good is his auror training if he couldntsave his best friend all right let go he prepared to apparate when lily grabbed onto his arm she started to explain trying to be calm but feeling anxious all the same james they could be tracking if they have sirius they already know we re coming and with his words he grinned nervously and sucked in a breath ready go to the hog head lily nodded and with a pop they both apparated seconds later and a few unpleasant sensations later lily and james appeared in the middle of hogsmeade and just outside of the dirty bar that was their key to dumbledore james pulled something made of shimmering material lily recognized it right away it was his invisibility cloak there might be people in there waiting for us i wouldntbe surprised if they knew something went on in here with the order james held open his cloak and lily met him under the sleek material letting her body disappear with his they didnthave to wait long in the cold for someone to stumble out of the bar leaving the door open long enough for them to slip in undetected once in the smoke filled pub james held onto lily and guided them to the back of the bar where they let themselves into the empty store room they had become acquainted with since they joined the order james led them to the statue of the one eyed witch and lily touched the head james inhaled and whispered the magic word dissendium suddenly they appeared in hogwarts it only took them a few minutes to navigate their way around their old school building and scurry up the winding stairs to albus dumbledore office james lifted his fist and knocked on dumbledore door in a beat that pleaded a response only none came he looked down at lily who looked as disheartened as he felt james threw manners to the wind and barely hesitated to turn the knob and open the door he walked in and looked around the room lily not sure what james was looking for followed him in and peered around the office as well there got to be something james muttered he must have something who are these intruders just barging into the headmaster office outrage intruders bandits lily and james looked around the room alarmed one portrait was awake an old stern looking wizard was shouting at them and waking the other paintings we better hurry before they all wake up and cause a ruckus james told lily lily had a better idea excuse me sir we didntmean to intrude here right right you bandits expect me to believe you the one time albus leaves the door unlocked bandits no sir we re not bandits we we know dumbledore we re looking for him where has he gone is he coming back it urgent the old wizard gray eyes shifted past lily to james who was pilfering around dumbledore desk what are your names he asked turning his attention back to lily lily evans and james potter we were head girl and boy here last year and we really need to see dumbledore lily answered distracting the portrait while james continued to search for anything helpful ah i ve heard him mention you secret business eh the old wizard rubbed his nose with his sleeve lily held in her grimace and continued to smile as politely as she could under the circumstances he left almost two hours ago something urgent top secret stuff i imagine i wouldntexpect him back anytime soon he told me to keep a lookout for him i told him he could always count on m did he say where he went james interrupted growing more frantic with the passing of time the aged wizard seemed perturbed at being interrupted but answered james question no he didn t james huffed lightly and dragged his left hand through his hair making it stick up in every direction thank you sir tell the headmaster we were looking for him please do you mind if we look around a bit the painting sighed but nodded despite himself lily could be charming without saying anything remotely amiable it was more in the way she spoke it was a talent that had gotten her far in her short life thank you lily replied with a smile as she began to peer around with james whose disdain at this point had rendered him quite useless but lily was sympathetic and continued to look for something to give him hope dumbledore wouldntleave them in the dark would he james there a file here it got the maps we were using to find voldemort meeting places i think dumbledore has something here for us lily said her words filled with hopefulness james hazel eyes lit up and he walked over and looked at the papers in lily delicate hands the old shoe store james pointed at the map as he drew the same conclusions dumbledore had come to dumbledore thinks they meet in the old shoe store in diagon alley just then a faint whisper rippled in the room james and lily looked at each other and then lily looked down james i think it coming from your trouser pocket his eyes lit up again and he pulled out what appeared to be a mirror padfoot is that you james whispered into the mirror the reflective glass was dark and foggy and it was hard to distinguish anything prongs i in diagon alley i at an explosion of some sort cut sirius off but he continued to talk his voice more urgent i ve got to go i need help before james could ask any questions sirius was gone james looked at lily he got to be at that shoe store let go the new direction in their mission livened james and he and lily made it to diagon alley in record time covered in the invisibility cloak lily although she had been to diagon alley a dozen times had no recollection of their being a shoe store anywhere james where exactly are we going james slowed his stride as he explained softly dragon hide and hippogriff hair it a very old store i dontthink i ve been to it since i was little something about them using real hippogriffs deterred my mother from letting us shop there after making several odd turns and finding the shop it became apparent that most people must have had the same idea as james mother it was a worn out desolate looking place a sign swinging from a single hinge indicated to lily and james that they were at the right place the writing was practically illegible but if lily strained her eyes she could make out the faded gold lettering dragon hide and hippogriff hair in lily opinion it looked like a grotesque place death eaters would meet okay james started looking hard at the building while he thought lily could tell from his assertive manners he was more nervous than he was trying to let on we re going to go in the front door i think that safest they wouldntbe holding anything in front of the windows once we get inside i going to leave you the invisibility cloak it too hard for us to navigate in there together then we ll go from there james then looked down at lily right into her eyes lily i need you to promise me that if i get into trouble you ll turn around and go for remus or mcgonagall someone to help we cantboth get trapped only if you promise me the same thing james potter we dontneed you devising a single handed heroic plan only to get us all killed go for help lily demanded her eyes blazing with the fierce passion she seemed to always carry around with her always waiting for a moment for someone to light it from inside of her at this moment james was the candle i promise james said before kissing her quickly on the lips and slipping something in to her pocket what is that lily whispered as they turned to the store it the two way mirror use it if you have to james answered just as quietly are you ready yes she replied strongly gripping her wand with her right hand okay let go they entered the dark room as quietly as possible it had the smell of old leather and mothballs it was a strong combination that made lily nose wrinkle slightly james ignored it and stepped out of the invisibility cloak to get a better look around the deserted shop james lily whispered under your feet i think there a trap door james registered her words and glanced down at his feet he smiled to himself and bent down and pressed his right ear to the ground footsteps shuffling of something what was it furniture bodies he opened the door a crack so that he could peer through the room below was dim with light and the space was just illuminated with the light of a few wands james could make out four or five men in dark cloaks but it was impossible to see how many there really were he kept the door open just a crack so that he could listen without being detected stupid boy he heard a man voice say his friends chuckled in agreement oh that my dear cousin for you always behaving foolishly impulsively he never had much of a head on his shoulders just look at his friends for merlin sake mudbloods halfbreeds and mudblood lovers a woman voice chimed in maliciously at a shrill pitch well that me bea i never thought you understood me but i see now that you do it really must be true blood is thicker than water james heard sirius voice with its usual sarcastic quips and his heart leapt with in his chest dontspeak to me about the blood we share sirius yours is poisoned by the company you choose to keep beallatrix replied tartly quick retorts seemed to come with the black nature despite what associations they preferred sirius let out his barking laugh which transformed within seconds to a sort of scream james face went white as he racked his brain for a plan of escape the screaming soon ended you wontbe laughing for long a darker smoother voice that was new to the conversation said a few nodded and the man continued no when our master gets here you wontbe laughing at all grinning maybe for that defiant look in your eye may be frozen forever when he shows up just let me speak to regulus he doesntbelong here you people dontwant him for whatever the hell it is you re doing i dontknow what he told you about himself but he really isntcut out for this sirius said hurriedly james could tell he was starting to panic oh regulus understands perfectly dear cousin beallatrix informed him with an amused tone yes he understands i afraid it you that doesn t and unfortunately it you that going to have to pay i ll never join you sirius yelled in defiance his voice so loud that james was sure someone outside would hear them are you sure black this new voice was cold almost hissing james could almost feel the air below him cool and could hear the breathing of everyone below him pause he was there you speak rather foolishly for a man without a wand black although i suppose dumbledore would confuse that particular quality of yours with bravery the rhythmic breathing claimed the room once again among the death eaters sirius was still frozen and at loss of what to do james froze at well stuck between the impulse of fleeing the building or crashing through the trapdoor and surprising everyone lily feet away from james and still wrapped in the invisibility cloak noticed james tense posture immediately and had to fight the urge to ask him what was wrong at the risk of being discovered james for the time being paid close attention to the conversation below as well as the positions of the company that would receive him even in the dim light and awkward angle james could tell lord voldemort was sneering i believe the noble thing for you to do black is to duel me right lord voldemort chided as much as i d like to i afraid that option isntavailable sirius had regained his voice and consequently his self destructive wit lord voldemort almost looked interested and why is that black scared the dark lord followers praised his words with an appreciative chuckle that did not go unnoticed by their master who smiled to himself no not that exactly sirius continued disregarding the people around him well i dontappear to have a second someone to take up for me after i die and you on the other hand have about five potential seconds here so i hardly think it is fair that is what you get for jumping in the lion den black voldemort retorted harshly raising his wand arm threateningly james not having any better idea as a means for extracting sirius from so deadly a mission chose this opportune time to make his presence known lily watched james in disbelief and horror as he plunged to what she could only assume to be his death out of the intensity and desperation of the situation an idea occurred to her and she reached for her left arm and found her watch james landed rather gracefully and with his wand raised he soon found five wands pointed at him ready to kill sorry to interrupt james said in his most arrogant tone i just heard something about a possible duel and my good friend here needing a second and well i always sirius second sirius looked at james with admiration lord voldemort glanced from james to sirius with malicious amusement i see black i ll take you as my second sirius eyes grew wide as one of the cloaked figures stepped forward yes master it was the voice of regulus black you bloody idiot cantyou see what you re getting into sirius couldntresist shouting his rage bubbling inside of him regulus didntgive sirius the satisfaction of a response instead he walked towards his lord taking his place at lord voldemort right side james watched lord voldemort it was clear to him that he had no intention of needing a second and that he had only called for one for this pleasure the rest of you voldemort started leave us but master beallatrix lestrange interrupted with a tone that suggested that she wanted nothing more than the enjoyment of seeing her cousin destroyed voldemort turned to her warningly go you have better things to be doing beallatrix nodded yes my lord and with her words she apparated with her companions to some location that was a mystery to james and sirius now lord voldemort said as he turned his attention back to his prey i believe it is time for us to conduct the niceties up above lily crouched over the opening that james had left wide open in his haste she kept the invisibility cloak wrapped around her tightly as she watched sirius and voldemort turning and pacing back into opposite directions only to turn around briskly and face each other she held her breath and prayed that someone from the order would receive her signal of distress and arrive soon two bright flashes shot across the room one red one yellow sirius was on the floor screaming twitching uncontrollably lily could see the horror on james helpless face just then she heard an old door opening she stood up quickly however reluctantly and quietly moved over to the front of the store to get a look at who was entering a short blonde woman walked in with a fierce look in her eye and behind her stood a tall lanky man alice lily whispered into the air frank they both turned towards the sound of their names being called only to see nothing who there frank demanded stepping beside alice both of them with their wands raised lily remembering she still had her cloak on pulled it down it lily evans look we donthave time she started hurriedly cutting them off from asking any questions lord voldemort is down below in the cellar he got regulus black with him he dueling sirius james is down there too we ve got to hurry before he kills them the facial expressions on their faces didntchange but when alice spoke it reflected the urgency of the matter we ll use your cloak one of us will jump down invisible but making a crash a distraction the other two will follow after okay i ll go first lily said ushering her saviors to the trap door motioning for them to be as quiet as possible when she got back to the opening in the floor she pulled the cloak back on and looked below hoping sirius and james were still alive lord voldemort seemed to be taking his time torturing sirius for mere amusement james had stopped looking horrified and wore a distant expression lily sensed he realized his emotion gave lord voldemort satisfaction sirius was down on his knees now forced down by what appeared to be the imperious curse his face and hands were covered in blood without looking back lily fell down landing on regulus black the next thing she knew she was awakening into an illuminating world of white poll is valentine day overrated thanks to all my reviewers i greatly appreciate the feedback lia amitair thanks for your feedback i ve never really thought of my stories starting and ending the same way but i ll try to be more creative thanks for reading snow white

materialism sigh but what else can americans be but materialistic and this summer i working for the man yeah i a hypocrite but i need the moneys oh as for the poll what your favorite summer activity mine would be going to the beach anyways read and review and have a nice day chapter twenty eight the offer lily awoke in a state of exhausted confusion her vision was blurry and her eyes were having trouble adjusting to her bright white surroundings in an effort to make sense of where she was she shifted her body to sit up her vision began to clear and she was able to make out intimidating objects and machines it didnttake long for lily to realize she was in a hospital lily you re up she turned sharply to her left and saw james getting up from his chair he looked a mess he had large bags under his eyes and his hair was surprisingly messier than usual lily didntknow it could get any messier he rushed to her side taking her hands up in his and kissing her all about her face thank merlin he cried his happiness radiating from his eyes and grin i ll go get the healers while james went to get the healers lily looked down and inspected the damage that had been done to her body her right arm was bound with white gauze material and the other had a series of tubes stuck into the nook of her forearm and bicep she looked to what machine the tubes belonged it was a ghastly looking machine that looked to lily like a small muggle fish tank but instead of gaudy faux plants and bright fish it was filled with a bluish gel like substance she shivered a little at the thought of that goo running through her veins just as james returned he brought with him a stout woman of about thirty five she had her blonde hair trapped to her head with a series of pins and spells lily thought for nothing could be that stationary could it the woman didntappear to be very friendly and her staunch white cloak gave her the look of being swallowed by a large cotton ball are you feeling better ms evans the healer asked in a voice that suited her professional and void of all emotion i suppose so lily managed to say realizing they were the first words she had spoken in days weeks months how long had she been here surely she hadntmissed the wedding maybe that why james looked so distraught how long have i been here lily asked sharply as panic took hold of her the amount of work that would be awaiting her at the office and poor james nine and a half days james replied as he approached her side taking her right bandaged hand softly and caressing it it november twenty sixth he added for lily looked slightly confused oh she said relief flooding over her she hadntbeen here that long everything would be okay is everyone else safe she avoided asking what had happened while the nurse was in the room the last thing she remembered was falling on top of regulus black james nodded yes sirius was here until just a few days ago actually frank and alice are fine too they were just checked out and they were able to go home lily smiled showing her white teeth and you james grinned tiredly i fine i so glad you ve awoken they were a little doubtful about the effects of the curse but now that you re awake there little to worry about i dontknow what you ve got this young man under the healer started but he hasntleft your side much at all i was going to give him a sleep draught if you re conditions hadntimproved soon she smiled slightly maybe she wasntso staunch after all lily decided you ll need to rest another day i think she continued i just want to make sure you re in working order before we set you loose lily nodded at the woman that sounds good she turned to james james go home and sleep okay you look terrible i thought i looked quite dashing james quipped guiding a hand through his hair and smiling lily chuckled lightly go rest i ll be fine all right james conceded i ll let sirius and everyone know that you re up they ll probably want to come visit you i mean i dontknow why they would very funny lily replied smirking at him i love you james said as he leaned in and kissed her lips lightly i ll be back tomorrow before training after training james you need to sleep she remarked with finality and then added i love you too james nodded and kissed her once more before leaving her to rest later that afternoon sirius remus and peter appeared at her side it nice to see you finally got james out of here sirius stated as a way of greeting poor bloke was in here all the bloody time i surprised he didntdie in training from the fatigue and strain he was putting on himself really evans what have you done to him that keeps him at your bedside all night probably some sort of charm she was always so bloody good at them at school now we know why she just wanted to bed poor prongsie remus quipped as he kissed her on the top of her head it good to see you re doing better he added sincerely yeah it a good thing you came around i d hate to see james if anything more serious had happened sirius added with a genuine tone smiling at her where should i put these peter asked quietly holding a gigantic basket up for her to see it contained an array of roses candy stuffed animals and if lily wasntmistaken dungbombs just give it to her sirius suggested his eyebrows raised mischievously no no dontput that over here merlin knows what you ve done with it lily exclaimed with as much energy as she had all that day do you really think that poorly of us lily sirius asked feigning his typical hurt look look at peter he knows there something wrong with it are those dungbombs going to go off the second you give them to me lily continued pointing at a confused peter sirius sighed he was always the one that would give it away peter shrugged and placed the basket on one of the counters as he did a series of obscene noises and smells were emitted into the room buggers lily cried rotten dirty oh calm down sirius said lightly we dontwant to give you an aneurysm or anything he grinned at her remus was more practical he pulled out his wand and did a fresh fragrance charm he smiled at lily once more before returning his wand to the pocket of his robe lily pursed her lips together to keep from grinning after looking around the room again and deciding it was clear she spoke up guys what exactly happened after i fell what happened to me the three young men smiled at her sirius was the first to speak james hasnttold you yet lily shook her head no he was just so worried about me and well he was just so tired i didntwant to strain him sirius nodded and waved his hand to silence her figures anyways it just more fun for us to tell you he grinned broadly accentuating his handsome aristocratic features you me james alice and frank have just become the first people to encounter lord voldemort and survive lily ignored peter shudder and looked past sirius who was grinning boastfully she studied remus who didntlook as happy as he had just been what wrong remus she asked is there anything else oh moony just likes to bring up a little depressing detail every time i mention this which hasntbeen a lot really canttell many people what padfoot is leaving out is that you are now on lord voldemort most wanted list remus interrupted peter shuddered again and put his hands in his pockets nervously lily face whitened ever so slightly and she let out a breath well she thought if not now if would have happened eventually right it was one of the risks of belonging to the order i see was all she said and of course james is aware of this and alice and frank yeah remus said you missed the last order meeting sirius did too but dumbledore talked to them described what you guys are all in to now he ll probably want to meet with you now that you re awake he visited you three times you know hoping you d get better soon lily smiled and although she didntfeel that tired she yawned remus seemed to get the hint well we ve probably excited you enough for one day he said we ll go and i ll tell grace hi for you she ll be glad that you re doing better yeah and i guess ol wormtail and i ll be off i ll make sure prongs doesntgo too crazy tonight sirius added smiling again and grabbing hold of peter and ushering him out i ll bar the doors if i have to he getting a full night sleep tonight miss evans so keep your charms away i ll try but you know how i cantcontrol myself lily retorted sweetly i ll see you all later thanks for stopping by no problem you invalid remus said waving at her before he shut the door lily sighed well she thought this is it she finally made it home the next morning james came and picked her up took her to her apartment and after half an hour of insisting that she d be okay and promising that she would not go to work that day james left for training after he had left lily owled the office and explained that she had been terribly ill for that past week and a half and told them she would be in tomorrow she also asked if there was anything she could do while she was at home an hour later madam bones herself replied dear lily i am aware that you have been ill for awhile now and have been at st mungo s albus dumbledore has explained the situation to me and i can only say that i am glad that you re alive and on the way to recovery dontworry about what you ve missed owen scruggs has been covering you at my request take care and if you re sure you re feeling better i ll see you tomorrow sincerely madam bones lily gave a small sigh of relief it was nice that she wouldnthave to make excuses for her absence but she really had hoped bones would include some things she could research or look into so that she didntfeel so useless just then charlotte appeared from her bedroom looking sleepy and freshly awoken lily she cried as she rushed to embrace her roommate sirius told me that you would be back soon i so glad you are okay that must have been some case of dragon pox do you have any scars my second cousin edward had them once and he had a terrible pock mark on his nose lily smiled as charlotte released her so this was the story she was going to have to keep up oh yeah it was terrible no pock marks though they have this lovely potion nowadays keeps from scarring i came and visited you once before i went on this trip to india i actually just got back late last night you were pretty out of it charlotte continued i saw sirius too he had a terrible accident in training but i suppose you know all about that yeah was all lily managed to fit in before charlotte continued talking and dontworry i saved all the prophets i know how you love to keep up with the news although it bloody depressing right now charlotte pointed to a giant stack loitering by the sofa would you like some tea and eggs i hear hospital food is terrible that sounds great lily answered smiling thanks for saving the papers no problem charlotte called out as she went to go make a late breakfast she returned fifteen minutes later with two plates and handed one to lily as she made room for herself on the sofa they ate together in varied degrees of silence every once in a while charlotte would chime in with a oh i remember that or a nasty thing that happened there and lily would occasionally ask a question and charlotte would attempt to answer finally charlotte got up and took both of their plates i ve got to go to the office but i ll be back for dinner lets invite everyone over we can have a welcoming back dinner charlotte said happily lily nodded with a smile it sounded like a nice idea sure that sounds excellent i can start on some of the food i donthave much else to do all right then i ll be home around five want to have every one come out at seven sounds great i ll owl everyone i ll see you later take it easy lily i hear these viruses can come back if you re not careful charlotte warned with a caring glance i will have fun at work lily waved her off and went back to reading the papers charlotte was right it was bloody depressing one entire family had been murdered in their beds three people were missing five muggles had been harassed so badly they had ended up in st mungo s only two people had been arrested by the ministry and in lily opinion they didntseem guilty at all it looked like the ministry was just trying to arrest anybody in a pathetic attempt to look like they were achieving some sort of progress and making some sort of difference she sighed and pulled up her legs onto the couch and then spread out across the sofa and continued to read she only had three days left to catch up with just then she heard a knock at her door startled all the papers fell from her lap and on to the floor she got up in a haste and stood up rather drunkenly suddenly an idea struck her she wasnt expecting anybody james was at training and it wasnthis lunch break of anything her parents wouldntbe visiting her alice would be at work too could it be petunia no she almost laughed at that thought and then real worry struck her death eaters voldemort would the most evil sorcerer of all time knock maybe she held in her breath and gripped her wand tightly as she approached the door who is it she asked with more courage than she felt at the moment albus dumbledore came a vibrant cheerful serious voice relief washed over her face and she opened the door dumbledore stood before her in bright purple robes good morning lily he greeted as lily let him in good morning professor lily replied cheerfully her eyes darting around her small flat for any signs of mess or embarrassing personal things left about with charlotte you could never know once lily found charlotte bright red bra on the kitchen table she really didntwant to know how it had gotten there so she didntask now lily i dontmean to chastise you but you should really think of some sort of system when answering the door what if i had been imperiused lily nodded she knew she should be more careful i know i ll be more cautious professor but if you dontmind me saying if you had been imperiused we would be in more trouble than we previously anticipated dumbledore smiled i glad you think of me so highly lily would you like to sit down the sitting room is a bit distraught looking but it comfortable that would be lovely professor dumbledore replied as lily pointed him in the right direction and would you like some tea then we get down to business i sure this is a business visit sir lily asked awkwardly she knew her old headmaster must have something vital to share with her he usually didntmake house calls she actually didntrealize that he knew where she lived it didntreally surprise her albus dumbledore knew everything sadly yes it is a bit of an urgency that i speak with you and i would love some tea sugar and cream please if you have it of course lily added before making her way to the kitchen a few minutes later she appeared in her sitting room where she found dumbledore sitting on her couch and staring at the television she handed him his mug and took a seat in a chair across from him he nodded in thanks and spoke up these television things i never did quite grasp the concept although i find it very fascinating lily smiled and took a sip of her tea james gets a real kick out of it once or twice i ve found him and sirius trying to meddle with it they think people are inside of it dumbledore chuckled softly and raised his mug to his lips and took a long sip before a serious expression took hold of his aging features i would like to congratulate you on your bravery lily you and james going after sirius after he disappeared was very noble and i must say you two acted with great skill and cunning to get to him in time sirius black owes you his life i sure lily nodded and looked away she had been avoiding the reason for the whole fiasco why had sirius left alice and frank longbottom helped too i quite certain if they hadntreplied to our distress we would have all been done for ah yes the longbottoms very brilliant aurors dumbledore smiled slightly i came to talk to you lily about the results of that night dumbledore took a sip of tea before looking up at her again you james sirius and alice and frank are now the only people that have stood up to lord voldemort and survived therefore i find it most vital for you to understand the significance of your position voldemort and his followers will most likely be hunting all of you down from now on nothing will ever be as safe as it once was i am afraid that from now on you have to consider yourself in mortal danger dumbledore let out a breath that is why i am giving you the opportunity to leave the order if you wish i already presented the offer to james sirius and the longbottoms if you choose to do so i can promise you that i will do everything in my power to make sure you are safe and hidden but i cannot promise anything lord voldemort is a vengeful fellow one who does not like to be shown up dumbledore words swarmed over lily head like a powerful cold wind that she hadntbeen expecting what did james say lily asked lightly she couldntmake her decision without knowing what james reply was dumbledore smiled as if he had been anticipating this response james said that depended on you he ll do whatever you like he has your safety as his top priority i want to stay lily said with force she knew james did too now that we re in this really in this we ve got to stop it her green eyes blazed with vigor and passion dumbledore nodded then i am relieved dumbledore took another sip of his tea i am very pleased that you have agreed to stay on and now i must warn you again you have to be careful at all times i not saying be paranoid paranoia can make the sanest people utterly crazy and careless i saying that you should always know who you re with and that you should always be aware of your surroundings i trust you will do well you re a brilliant witch lily lily blushed ever so slightly at her former headmaster compliment but she also understood the gravity of his words you can count on me professor i ll be as cautious as ever good good dumbledore replied lightly now if you will forgive me i must be off i will see you at our next meeting it a week from today see you then lily said as she stood up with dumbledore to lead him to the door be careful lily oh and madam bones knows of your situation so dont be too worried she has a few new files to give you that we will all find very interesting good day and with his words dumbledore was gone lily breathed in heavily and went to get a glass of water poll what your favorite summertime activity much thanks to my reviewers joham shtarky becky6 once upon a teardrop glowing ice

minutes later and as a result he was in a bit of a rush he knew lily wouldntmind if he was late but when it came to lily james liked to be punctual after his quick shower he changed quickly into a set of suitable clothes and then went to see if sirius was still around james found him in the kitchen eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich padfoot we re going to eat at lily and charlotte s james said as he did a drying spell on his wet hair it dried and fell to its usual disorder within seconds i know sirius replied with some difficulty as he crammed the rest of his sandwich into his mouth chewed it slightly and then swallowed a bite so large james could have sworn he saw it travel down sirius esophagus i was hungry he added as an obvious explanation james smiled and shook his head you ready to go sirius nodded and eyed james hand which was holding a small duffel bag staying the night at miss evans sirius grinned cheekily as he opened his mouth to add another comment before james interrupted him yeah i am james replied dismissing his friend teasing let go all right i coming james greeted lily as she opened the door she kissed him softly before smiling at him how was your day long he replied before sirius introduced himself i see how you are evans acting like i not here sirius said boisterously lily smiled and shook her head sorry sirius how was your day all right i suppose we would have been here earlier if james hadntspent so long primping he like a bloody woman we we re late because somebody had to have an appetizer james protested indignantly i was just waiting for you to get ready jamsie poo sirius retorted grinning at james before ruffling his hair playfully and going to greet his girlfriend ugh james sighed as he put his hands through his hair trying to undo whatever damage had been done lily smiled again and hugged him and stood softly against him for a moment she then kissed his nose and put her hands through his hair remember when you hated that james asked her in a soft tone i never hated it lily replied still smiling come on in everyone else is here well except allison and jacob they couldntmake it but peter remus and grace are already here and i sure peter ready for dinner he asked about if for about ten minutes now he an impatient fellow only when it comes to food james replied as he followed her into the dining room where their friends were already seated talking happily amongst each other prongs peter greeted hastily we can eat now he said to everyone else at the table james smiled as he sat down hello wormtail how have you been haventseen you in awhile peter faltered for a split second he had a bowl of mashed potatoes in his hands and was now spooning a healthy portion onto his plate oh you know work those goblins arentexactly friendly i working all the time and taking care of mother she hasntbeen well recently oh i sorry to hear that james replied as peter handed him the potatoes yeah i hope your mother gets well soon remus added and the others nodded in agreement i ll tell her um what you guys said peter said quietly looking down at his plate now care to pass the roast padfoot sirius was currently forking mass amounts of roast beef onto his plate he looked up at peter just a second peter gave a disgruntled kind of noise that didntgo unnoticed by sirius well it not like you need it that much and let me get some before you eat it all sirius mumbled james chuckled softly as well as the others only lily always the good natured conscientious friend was able to contain her laughter sod off sirius peter said quietly james looked up from his plate and caught sirius eye and then remus the three exchanged a look and sirius passed the roast to peter sorry mate i was only joking sirius apologized james had to hand it to him sirius was never great with apologizing to anyone peter didntsay anything he just took the roast and began piling it next to his potatoes well let eat lily said in an attempt to break any left over tension dinner went by much better after that but there was still a bit of unspoken hostility in the air until everyone but james lily charlotte and sirius were left lily and james were finishing with the dishes when charlotte came in to the kitchen all right well sirius and i will be off she wore the mischievous smile that resembled her cousin s i wontbe back so you two have the house to yourselves she winked at them do we even want to know what sirius idea was lily asked oh well charlotte continued to grin and then leaned towards lily and away from james she spoke with a tone she must have thought was quiet and secretive he was reading one of my magazines you know what i talking about and there was this article i think it was called something along the lines of adventurous things to do with your tongue enough james cried holding his hands over his ears charlotte laughed well james you should have been covering your ears earlier honestly if you werentso nosy you coming charlotte sirius called from the other room hold on charlotte replied loudly she smiled again and said goodnight to lily and james we should never ask when it comes to sirius and charlotte james said as soon as they had left lily laughed as she dried the last dish with her wand well i have that article she was talking about do you really james replied instantly new energy taking over his body yes i do somewhere lily said tapping her forefinger to her chin as she thought smiling i think i may have misplaced it james looked his teasing girlfriend over before reaching towards her and pulling her to him he kissed her deeply and pressed his hips into hers wait i think i left it in my bedroom lily said finally grinning playfully later that night lily rolled over next to james and watched him he was currently lying on his back looking at the ceiling the playful mood had dissipated and was replaced with a quiet content atmosphere dumbledore came and saw me earlier today lily said finally moving her fingers slowly over james arm in a soft caress oh yeah james replied turning over to see her i figured he d want to talk to you yeah he thinks voldemort will be keeping an eye on us to say the least lily continued looking into james hazel eyes he wanted to know if i wanted out of the order james nodded to show he was listening but said nothing i said no and that i want to keep helping the order of course lily finished james gave a small smile and i said i d do whatever you chose i want to continue to fight too i know you do but james are you scared lily asked timidly it had plagued lily mind all day and the truth was she was rather frightened yeah i am james answered with the endearing honesty he always seemed to save for her most desperate questions just a little but i mean that how it is i suppose i think it was only a matter of time before voldemort noticed us really we ve always been against him so it just a risk we re going to have to take i suppose i know lily replied as she cuddled closer to him i love you james james smiled and kissed the top of her head as he embraced her i love you too and it perfectly natural to be a bit fearful and james i ve been wondering lily started the things that had been occupying her mind for the past couple of days were finally surfacing and lily could do nothing to stop them from venturing out of her head and through her lips yes well dontget me wrong i dontmind going after sirius he means a lot to me and he means a lot to you it just i ve been wondering how did sirius get in that predicament to begin with she held her breath as she watched james who seemed to be thinking before answering her question finally he spoke using the same delicate tone that seemed to be occupying her bedroom you know about sirius family he started and about his brother regulus lily nodded as she looked aptly at james who continued to divulge sirius and regulus actually used to be fairly close they are so close in age and they used to stick together against their mother rants you know they were brothers sirius would always have regulus back and regulus would have his but you know all that changed well not even when sirius was sorted into gryffindor sure his mother and father werentpleased practically disowned him when they heard that bit of news anyways regulus still looked up to sirius they were still brothers and confidents but then regulus was sorted into slytherin and hell broke loose so to speak eventually regulus was sucked into his parent world they praised him after all and supported him and well we know how they feel about sirius james took a breath and looked at lily who was still deeply immersed in james words but at the end of the day they are still brothers james continued or were i think this was the last straw for sirius dumbledore told sirius what had become of regulus leaving school and joining voldemort sirius wanted to stop him from making that mistake lily nodded but raised an eyebrow but how did sirius know where to find him how did he know how to go after him lord voldemort was trying to recruit sirius james answered flatly lily gasped slightly james looked at her again well he knows how sirius is believe me but sirius is still a black and the blacks are notorious for their obsessive interest in the dark arts and their infamous blood purity so sirius went to them and well we both know what happened after that things went terrible and regulus didnteven acknowledge sirius as his brother wow was all lily managed to say it was always hard for her to imagine the intensity of sibling love where you would sacrifice yourself for your brother or in her case sister she knew petunia would never come looking for her if she happened to hear that she was in grave danger and petunia would probably be mad if lily tried to save her james smiled and then kissed her on her nose a sudden thought struck lily james has voldemort tried to recruit you james shook his head no no he hasn t yet the potters are very wealthy and pureblood but are nothing like the blacks it is pretty widely known that my parents and family have been against dark arts for ages oh the noble potters lily said sarcastic and smiling james laughed lightly but became serious once more i really think it only a matter of time before he asks me to join him james exhaled loudly i mean i know he knows i an auror in training but it would be stupid for him not to try really my blood is notoriously pure it would be a great advantage for him to have me on his side it only a matter of time james finally looked a little scared what will you do when they approach you lily asked in a hoarse nervous whisper say no of course that d i rather die james replied sternly a defiant look in his eyes i would rather die than betray myself my friends or you lily lily blushed slightly she was surprised james still had the power to do that james moved close to her and took her in his arms holding her tightly as they both drifted off to sleep in a few days time lily james and sirius found themselves at the order meeting they took seats next to a friendly looking frank and alice who was waving them over they were soon joined by peter remus grace and dorcas meadowes james partner nice to see you re well lily alice greeted her her round face smiling i glad you re all right too lily exchanged looking equally as friendly before they could immerse themselves into steady conversation albus dumbledore stood up automatically beckoning the room attention he stood tall and imposing in his purple robes and spoke it is excellent to see all of you here and all in good health his blue eyes flickered gently in lily direction you all know that a few of our very own have now stood up to voldemort and have lived to tell the tale to lily surprise the people in the room nodded as one a few daring to steal glances at her james sirius and the longbottom directions dumbledore continued voldemort is now forced to acknowledge that the order is a force to reckon with as a result we need to collectively double our efforts we will need people within the ministry keeping an eye on coworkers that could either be working for voldemort or under the imperius curse we also need people recruiting new members as of now voldemort supporters outnumber us two to one but that is to be expected he has been recruiting members gradually for the past fifteen years we also need the members among us within the ministry to be exceedingly careful about any information they disclose any information could be a weapon if it landed in the hands of lord voldemort we also must investigate certain people within the wizarding community that may be supporting voldemort either by financial backing passing information or actively working for him at the end of this meeting everyone will receive a piece of parchment outlining their duty it will burn as soon as you re done so read carefully now benjy will read this week updates after about twenty minutes the meeting was over and james and lily stood in the corner of the room with their pieces of parchment just before lily opened hers to discover her task she felt a hand on her shoulder she turned around quickly her hand instinctively searching for her wand in her robes the man in front of her chuckled at her jumpiness and that how you can tell someone is in the order lily laughed and loosened her grip on her wand and took the hand that was now outstretched to her caradoc dearborn the man offered lily evans she replied taking in the man appearance he was fairly tall and imposing but his face was round and kind she turned around to find james who she intended on introducing but found that he was being confronted by several order members as well sorry i didntintroduce myself earlier usually i just in and out at these meetings i just wanted to tell you that i really impressed with your standing up to voldemort like that he smiled again and then looked at his watch but i do have to go now see you and good luck he hadntbeen gone five seconds when she was approached by two identical men with wild flaming red hair hullo evans one of the men said he too was smiling i gideon prewett and i fabian said his twin taking a low bow as a way of greeting we heard you know our cousin allison sorry about her she a right prude lily couldntsuppress a smile well anyways we thought it would be best to meet you seeing as now we ll probably be working a lot together gideon started and we thought we d congratulate you on the whole defying voldemort thing fabian finished lily laughed lightly thank you i ll take that as a very big compliment james and sirius tell me you guys are some of the most impressive aurors they ve ever seen to her surprise the twins smiled but their ears turned red as if they were embarrassed gideon spoke next oh that just black trying to brown nose we re helping longbottom teach the new aurors see well sirius has always been a smooth talker but he really did sound genuinely impressed when he talks about you both lily smiled and looked around the room it was almost deserted except for the huddle of people around james lily and sirius alice and frank stood back smiling to themselves and talking lily was surprised to see that they too werentsurrounded by people they had done just as much to defy voldemort as she did probably more considering she blacked out well we better be off early morning tomorrow and we have these tasks to complete now fabian finally said tugging his brother out the door with him we ll be seeing you lily by the time everyone had made their excuses for leaving it was ten o clock james lily and sirius met up with alice and frank outside the old classroom well congratulations you three alice said her round face beaming at them what do you mean james asked evidently he had noticed the lack of praise surrounding alice and frank too you did as much as we did why was everyone so amazed by us it simple frank replied come on james you ve played quidditch it like when you re the new member on the team and you ve just done something remarkable to save the game and win you belong now you ve proved yourselves to the order alice finished still smiling that was one hell of a game then james said slapping sirius on the back and then reaching for lily hand we d better be going i suppose we ll see you two later lily and sirius offered their goodbyes and then they were off well if that the kind of reception we get i say we defy voldemort more often said sirius smiling smugly to himself oh no they ve just fueled sirius already gigantic ego lily teased as the walked together out of the castle poll what your favorite

dough please read and review thanks chapter three mysteries in the garage and wedding plans how was your stay at the potters patrick evans asked his daughter the following sunday evening after james had dropped lily off lily smiled as she searched for a mug in the kitchen for her tea it was great james had a nice birthday and he liked the watch i got him lily replied that excellent patrick conversed as sat at the kitchen table with his mug of tea beverly was in the living room ironing mr and mrs potter invited all of us to come up for a few days lily said casually as she took a sip watching her father expression at the idea he nodded things getting serious between you and james then lily almost blushed her father in all his years never seemed like the kind of man to talk about his daughters relationships she almost wished petunia spoke to her so that she could ask her if he ever asked questions about vernon well we have been dating for over six months so i d say so lily answered as best she could then i suppose i could take a few days off work when was the invitation he asked lily shrugged anytime i could write james well you do that and your mother and i can go at anytime patrick evans replied kindly lily nodded with a smile alright then i ll right him now dad her father looked up from his tea yes dear you like james and his family right mum does too doesntshe patrick sat back in his chair and studied his daughter well of course honey james is a respectable young man and your mother is quite fond of him why do you ask just making sure lily replied with a grin i better go write james and then i ll go to bed good night dad patrick evans smiled good night lily the evans found themselves packed into their volkswagen beetle the following saturday at six in the morning patrick evans had a road map out and was studying it carefully before they set off with one final look he handed it to his wife told her to keep it out and they were off the conversation on the way to the potters seemed to have only one topic lily and james relationship lily was slowly dreading even mentioning the invitation to visit the potters and you ve been dating for how long again beverly asked five and a half hours later for the third time lily sighed and folded her arms just over six months mum unless we ve gone forward months in time it hasntchanged in the last seven minutes so you werentdating when you went to his house the first time over christmas she asked no we started dating the night we came back to hogwarts we were off the train and in the common room and we were just talking and he asked me if i wanted to go out with him and i said yes lily snapped at her mother in a quick rant patrick evans whistled to himself and pretended that the two in the car didntexist oh alright then beverly replied satisfied for the moment and completely unaware of her daughter frustration is that all lily asked tiredly although she regretted the words as soon as they were out of her mouth beverly seemed ready for the opportunity to take the questioning further well what do you do for dates at hogwarts lily sighed we go to hogsmeade the magical village you signed a permission form for before i started third year you could go to quidditch matches but james is usually playing and you could go for walks around the lake or whatever she stated in an even tone that sounds nice beverly replied still keen on ignoring lily annoyance your father and i used to go out on dates all the time lily groaned and slid back into her seat as her mother droned on about the lives beverly and patrick used to lead before petunia and lily were born and before patrick had his practice full time lily peered out the window and saw the familiar hill rising with the road this is it lily practically yelled stopping her mother one sided conversation short and making her father slam on brakes patrick turned in casually and drove like he hadntjust come to a screeching halt and they pulled into the potters drive at their expected time to lily surprise it was margaret potter that greeted them at the door lily had have expected james to come rushing out towards her and pull her into his arms like in a scene from an over dramatic muggle movie margaret smiled at lily and told her james was out back by the garage with sirius she then graciously welcomed beverly and patrick into the home and told a house elf to go and retrieve their luggage the last thing lily heard mrs potter say as she searched her way through the vast house to the back was that she was going to show the evans where they were staying lily reached the backyard and looked out to the garage where sirius and james were allegedly working as she approached the garage she heard sirius and james muttering about padfoot i think i heard lily pull up i have to go see her she heard james voice and smiled just hold this for a minute prongs she heard sirius reply she then heard james let out a sigh of impatience hello boys she called out before reaching the garage prongs lily here sirius exclaimed as she approached she heard more cluttering and then james appeared wearing a pair of old jeans and a t shirt that was covered in grease he smiled at her hello he greeted holding his hands back i d hug you but i filthy and i dontwant to get you greasy well thanks for the consideration lily replied with a smile as she walked into the garage which was surprising filled with tools old car parts and a motorcycle what have you two been up two she asked in a curious but pleasant tone as she looked from james to sirius who looked far filthier than james did i helping sirius with his motorcycle he bought from an old muggle we re putting a flying device on it james explained lily nodded is that all she continued with a curious voice as she peered around the place some more james stepped in front of her and nodded yes that all let go inside shall we our parents are probably waiting for us with lunch and padfoot and i better get cleaned up we ll meet you inside in a few minutes james said smiling at her lily backed away grinning you re hiding something from me james potter i know it she exclaimed wildly before heading back to the house james chuckled and turned to sirius well let change it back and put it in storage he said simply sirius nodded and flicked his wand causing the toy car on the floor to turn into a real life size ford thunderbird convertible that was missing several parts and a paint job james proceeded to cover the car up and move it into a closed area in the back before he left for the house with sirius following behind him they entered the dining room after cleaning themselves up to see mr and mrs evans mrs potter and lily all sitting at the table james and sirius smiled at the group and sirius felt obligated to introduce himself i sirius black he stated before taking a seat mr and mrs evans seemed at odds of how to respond to this kind of introduction they were used to simply shaking hands and exchanging names mr evans smiled at him after a moment i patrick evans lily father nice to meet you sirius said as he poured himself a glass of milk and i beverly lily mother beverly evans said after a moment well i thought so you look stunningly alike except for the obvious hair color and eyes sirius replied charmingly mrs evans smiled and looked at lily we hear that quite often dontwe lily lily smiled and nodded at her mother and james could tell she was trying her best to remain polite and even tempered with her mother yes we do james grinned as he sat down beside her and he felt lily hand rest on his knee he looked at her and she just smiled innocently before putting her fork through a piece of melon margaret then engaged beverly in a conversation about muggle gardening and sirius started talking to patrick about motorcycles leaving james and lily to their own conversation guess what we re going to do tomorrow james whispered to her lily grinned and thought hm i dontknow play quidditch james eyes lit up as if the idea had never crossed his mind no but if you want to i was joking lily quickly replied but we could play later if you like james smiled i plan to take you up on that no i was thinking we could maybe go out to lunch and talk about the thing his eyes then traveled to the necklace she was wearing and she smiled alright but what will sirius do i worried he ll take my father to buy a motorcycle or something the two looked over at sirius and patrick who were indeed talking animatedly about new motorcycles james turned back to her charlotte should be back tomorrow she was visiting her dad for the week he ll be distracted and he has his own motorcycle to work on maybe you re dad could help him lily laughed my dad work with engines and stuff like that hah give him a heart though and he ll work with that james grinned well my dad will be around they re usually guaranteed sunday off as long as he entertained lily smiled i cantwait feel like ice cream james asked as they walked the streets of diagon alley i haventbeen to florean place in a while lily grinned yes i love ice cream james laughed as they approached the shop and took some seats outside while florean came to their table i ll have three scoops of chocolate in a bowl with chocolate syrup james ordered and i ll have two scoops of strawberry in a bowl with sprinkles lily added florean smiled at the two and disappeared to get the ice cream you sure love chocolate dontyou lily asked james grinned yes i do it keeps me healthy lily looked like she seriously doubted this but smiled anyways so what would you like to talk about james pulled his chair in closer and smiled at her i was wondering when you would like to have the wedding actually lily looked ecstatic and james could tell she had already planned it out in her mind i was thinking a winter wedding december or january she said her eyes lit with excitement james nodded that sounds brilliant how about january a nice start to the new year and all that way we can have our one year anniversary too that sounds like a great idea so we ll set it for january the first saturday of the month she asked before she dove into her purse and pulled out a planner that sounds perfect james said smiling as their ice cream appeared before them lily grinned and i was thinking a medium sized wedding not too many people just friends and family james nodded as he pulled the spoon out of his mouth yeah mid size or smaller is probably the best thing we dontwant to draw too much attention seeing as things seem to only be getting worse lately james voice still possessed the happy excited quality as minutes before but something different a grave undertone seemed to appear lily bobbed her head in understanding yes we ll just invite the closest friends and family and we can worry about dresses and tuxes and such when we tell our parents lily eyes then lit up do witches have wedding robes or wedding dresses because when i was little and i thought about my wedding i always had this mental picture of why my dress would look like james grinned he knew from charlotte that most young girls daydream about their wedding and their prince charming wedding robes i think but if you want a muggle dress i ll insist on it and it will be okay lily grinned her almond shaped green eyes twinkling and leaned over the table to kiss james who as it was an awkward movement spilled his chocolate ice cream all over his lap when he tried to meet her half way lily broke away laughing as james stood up from the cold shock to his lap chocolate stain all down his pants oh dear nothing gets chocolate out lily said between giggles and gathering napkins to hand to james after a second lily seemed to remember she was a witch wait she pulled out her wand and pointed it at james pants i do hope you know what you re doing james teased but nevertheless looked worried this is a very sensitive area lily let down her wand and let out a giggle before pulling her wand back up scourgify the chocolate mess vanished immediately from james pants and lily moved her wand to the table where she preceded to clean up james took his seat and frowned what wrong lily asked still smiling at the situation the chocolate came off your pants i know but my ice cream is all gone he pouted lily giggled and scooped half of what she had left into james bowl there she insisted james smiled delightfully i love you i ll let you decide on lunch lily raised an eyebrow this isntlunch james shook his head we canthave dessert for lunch dessert first but as lunch never lily giggled i glad your mother knew how to feed you me too james replied smiling all the same much thanks

reviewing a n so here chapter 30 enjoy oh and nice summer songs guys i think mine is that amy winehouse rehab song it just so fun well sort of you people know what i mean this week poll if you could do one thing to change the world anything what would it be anyways read review and enjoy these last few weeks before our fate is sealed in the deathly hallows chapter thirty false alarms vs real threats james potter pulled his wool cloak tighter around his neck and then stuck his hands in his pockets trying desperately to grasp onto some of the limited heat escaping his body it was the second week of december and it was cold and the last thing he wanted to be doing was what he was currently doing walking outside in the cold air in the rainy winter night but james had work for the order he was trying to accomplish his task assigned to him from dumbledore so far james had been relatively successful in his efforts but the people dumbledore had asked him to investigate were getting farther and farther up the ladder in the ministry and therefore it was getting harder and harder for him to track and spy on the people with out being detected it was easy to discover that david balmer was a voldemort sympathizer if not an outright supporter but david balmer was only the custodial worker in charge of keeping the ministry lavatories spotless a job he had done well james admitted but dumbledore had assured james that every person james could discover and track would help build cases against them that could land them in azkaban and not out supporting voldemort however james could tell that when he had been able to overhear a conversation yvonne macnair had been having with known death eaters dumbledore had been noticeably more pleased yvonne macnair was one of the junior ministers of the department of magical transportation she had been watching over certain ministry fires and making other ones conveniently private for death eater activity she was currently in a cell in azkaban awaiting her trial so james kept his head up and worked on his latest and last at least for now person a person relatively high up in the ministry a person james was eager to out as a death eater ingemar mulciber head of the accidental magic reversal squad however the case on mulciber was just now forming so it was vital that james find accurate information without disclosing that mulciber was under investigation james sighed and kept on walking trying to not think about all of the things he would rather be doing eating dinner with lily for example or playing a game of exploding snap with sirius and remus and peter inside where it was warm suddenly james thoughts the ones he was trying not to have at least were halted he saw two men in thick black cloaks coming towards him unaware of him for the most part talking to one another in hushed voices they did not even glance at james as they turned and entered a pub on the corner james was on their tracks sure that one of them was mulciber going to his casual meeting with a few death eaters probably just to have a few drinks and shoot the breeze talk and smile about the latest muggle killings no doubt james felt his insides curl with a mix of anger and anxiety he waited a few moments before entering the bar in case he looked suspicious unfortunately as soon as he entered the pub a shady place in knockturn alley that he had never been in before the grubby looking barman immediately walked up to him no underage wizards tonight he said forcefully wearing a scowl as he wrung the rag he had been cleaning glasses with aggressively squirting brownish water on to james new trainers james was indignant he didntlook under seventeen did he he should have grown out a beard for the occasion i not underage james replied honestly attempting to be discrete the last thing he wanted was for the group of what he knew must be the street clothed death eaters meeting in the corner to notice him the barman laughed yeh right well even if you turned seventeen two weeks ago and your testicles have dropped you dontbelong in here so get out james racked his brain for something to reply with something charming and winning something that could tell this man that james really was a down trodden hard working shady man like him just eager for a drink after a grueling day but james wasntstupid and he could tell that not even his superb bullshitting skills he had gained over the years of being one of hogwarts most notorious trouble makers was not going to get him a seat at the bar so he nodded fine he said trying to look not too disappointed i ll get a drink somewhere else and mind i ll tell my friends that the service here is something to be desired james didntwait for the barman response he was sure it would be sarcastic and infuriating so he turned and left thinking hard for another way into the pub once outside he looked around the dangy building but there werentany accessible windows just a backdoor james sucked in his breath as improbable it was at being successful he should at least try he approached as quietly and discreetly as possible checking the alleyway for anyone approaching he turned the knob it didntturn a millimeter james pulled out his wand alohomora it unlocked unfortunately he also heard two sets of feet scuffling against the ground one approaching the back door from the inside and one coming from the street james cursed himself for not bringing his invisibility cloak lily had asked to borrow it or rather james had forced it upon her to carry around at all times and he made the quick decision to back out casually into the streets it wasntworth it to be rash and reckless he made his way back out of the alleyway before any questions could be asked and he apparated back to muggle london james arrived on the outskirts of his flat building it was just as sopping wet in london as it had been in knockturn alley and even colder as the night was getting darker and when james looked up he could see large billowing snow clouds forming he shivered and then made his way inside to the warmth and dryness of his flat nothing could have really prepared james for what awaited him after a long day of training and then right on to order business he was tired and just wanted to get into the safety of his home it wasntso much the disarray of the flat that sent shivers down his spine his possessions flung all around his room his furniture smashed it was that no one was there it was nearing eight thirty and it was a tuesday sirius was supposed to be home undoubtedly as tired and worn out as james was at the threat of his best friend being in danger yet again james apparated to the first place on his mind panic setting in although he tried to reason with himself sirius couldntbe dead there was no dark mark hovering over the complex the urgent relentless pounding at the door alerted everyone in the sitting room and the conversation and laughter immediately stopped lily sucked in her breath anxious at who would be at her threshold and what news they had she knew james had order duties tonight and she had been on tenterhooks all evening therefore she had distracted herself with charming company lily let me answer i ll get it no i ve got it lily said forcefully a blazing look in her eyes so fierce that no one bothered to argue with her who there she asked in a half whisper it james let me in came her fianc voice in such a panic that she didnthesitate to open the door without asking anymore questions james lily cried at the state of the man in front of her the color had left his face and his hair was sticking up even more violently than usual i think they have sirius he said not even greeting her with his usual kiss and striding past the threshold we ve got to find him they ve james james lily tried to get his attention finally resorting to lunging herself at him grasping him around the shoulders and holding him straight so that she could look him dead in the eye he here james sirius is here he and charlotte and i were all just having some tea everything fine he here he all right james said his breathing slowing and his face relaxing he seemed to take in his surroundings for the first time and he noticed sirius standing with charlotte in the corner padfoot james exclaimed relief setting in at the site of his best friend sirius approached him eagerly are you all right mate what wrong sirius asked anxious from his friend frantic behavior our flat it completely trashed it been ransacked i thought they had gotten you there wasnta dark mark but i dontknow you werentthere i figured you would be i glad you weren t james then embraced sirius for a few solid moments before releasing him i glad you re okay sirius nodded i am too i wonder what they wanted what they were there for i thought that was obvious enough lily said they were looking for one of you or both it not like either one of you are on lord voldemort good side you didnthear james replied smiling with relief we re going to be playing quidditch together yeah we had a bit of a chat well at first he wanted a chaser position but i think he really fit better as a beater lily couldntlaugh james dontjoke this is serious someone wants you and it looks like when they get you they wontbe very happy well loads of people want james lily sirius said smiling slightly or have you forgotten hogwarts lily folded her arms she couldntbelieve james and sirius were being this dismissive about the situation this isntthe time for that sirius there is quite a big difference between the hormonal teenage girl population of hogwarts and the murderous death eaters but we re okay lily we re all right we ve escaped them james said trying to sound calm and soothing it wasntworking are you bloody kidding me lily shouted letting her arms break free from each other and fly in the air with forceful exasperation what this we ve escaped them horseshit it voldemort james he doesntlet something escape him and go oh damn better luck next time let put on a kettle he doesntlike being outsmarted james quit being an idiot by the time lily was yelling at the boys her cheeks had a healthy red flush and her nostrils were flaring james was speechless he hadnthad lily full wrath directed towards him in a long time it was as humbling as it always had been and james immediately sobered up i sorry lily james said quietly preparing for another attack sirius had slipped back into the corner with charlotte both of them looked rather apprehensive james however stood his ground like he always did lily anger ebbed and her lips quivered as she folded her arms together bringing them close to her body as if they alone were security enough against the evils of the world james someone is after you or sirius and they arentgoing to stop until they find you and if it is the death eaters they wonttake rejection well they will try and kill you james nodded and he walked towards lily putting his arms around her and holding her tightly against his body we re going to go back to the flat he paused as lily began to protest but he continued sirius and i we ll go back see if we can find anything to tell us what they wanted then we ll meet you back here and we ll stay here the night then tomorrow we ll go to the house hardly anybody knows we ve bought a house it ll be fine james said all this with a strong confident voice and it eased lily although she didntreally feel like any of her worries had gone you cantgo back there they ve just they wontcome back tonight it too soon james said as if he really knew how the minds of death eaters worked lily sighed in resignation i want to come with you no you ll stay here james retorted if they do come back to your flat they ll have more and the two of you will be no match for all of them half of them are currently at a meeting in a pub in knockturn alley lily they must have hit up my place hours ago when they thought i d just be back from training unaware you need to stay here with charlotte lily wasntgoing to give up that easily so she continued they re subtle argument i going with you james if you re going i going i ll be worried sick until you get back and besides they know i live here no where is safe we re both going with you two lily chanced a look towards charlotte making sure she was up for the adventure charlotte nodded defiantly at her cousin fine james said tersely he could never resist lily let hurry up i want to get back so i can send an owl to dumbledore let him know what up that the first good idea you ve had all night lily said giving way to a small grin they ended up at the mess and devastation that was james and sirius flat merlin sirius said his eyes falling on the mess he knew it would be bad but nearly everything was destroyed even his favorite chair it was a good thing that he had never cared much for material possessions lily gave the smallest of whimpers as she imagined what it would have been like if james had come home straight from training charlotte followed closely behind sirius waving her wand in an effort to tidy up a bit although she would admit that it was rather pointless james ignored the remnants of his belongings for the most part determined to find a clue or a message or anything that would tell him who was there and what they were looking for he didnthave to look long once he had entered the kitchen it was clear who had come and what their purpose was floating in the air as if it had been spray painted on an invisible wall were the words we ve come for you potter join us or we ll be back there was no signature but just under the writing floated a neon green skull a snake moving through its mouth and around its head behind him james heard someone gasp he knew it was lily he put an arm around her and looked from the writing to her watching her face as she stared at the message well that clears that up he said i ll just grab a few things and we ll go back to your place lily lily nodded turning her gaze to james and letting her burning green eyes meet his defiant hazel ones we re really going to have to be careful now james nodded and went to gather his things before he could think too much about it an hour later after returning back to lily and charlotte and having a drink to relax themselves james lay in lily bed exhausted but unable to sleep he lay with his arms folded behind his head and gazing straight ahead moving his foot slightly under the covers and watching lola lily now full size cat chase after the possible prey she attacked his foot biting and scratching at the thick comforter covered foot not inflicting too much pain on james lily stood at her dresser taking out her earrings in her process of getting ready for bed she soon joined james pulling the covers up to her chest and sitting up beside him are you all right lily asked quietly james nodded as he took off his glasses and put them on the night stand how did it go this evening james smiled and rubbed his tired eyes do i look at least seventeen to you she raised an eyebrow and looked him over yes you look older than you are actually at least i ve always thought so well the barman at the pub thought i was underage and he wouldntlet me in james said chuckling softly oh no so you werentable to see i saw mulciber go into the pub with another wizard i saw him in there with a group of people probably death eaters before being kicked out at least it all right though i ll have plenty of chances to out him for what he is although i d rather it is sooner than later lily nodded you ll get him and look at it this way if they were there and they had just come back from your flat they dontknow you re tracking him that is a good point james agreed as some of the tightness that had built up in his chest relaxed he turned to lily and put a hand on her cheek and stroked her skin softly with his thumb before kissing her how is your task coming along he asked when they parted lily smiled brilliantly i was able to finish my file on nott today during my lunch break i ve got five years worth of information that ties him to financially backing the death eaters no way james cried pleased and smiling how did you get that much information so quickly surely you had to go to gringotts which is controlled by those terrible goblins who wouldntgive information to anyone who said anything about having to go through the goblins lily asked grinning slyly james raised his eyebrows and lily continued alls i had to do was persuade the translator to give me the information and you know how charming and sweet i can be lily grinned at the sight of james face a mingled expression of admiration and disbelief in the end burt stevens thought nott was my dying brother and that he had requested me to get his files and statements before he made out his last will did you cry for effect let a tear fall dramatically down your cheek james questioned fully sitting in bed now gazing at lily smiling lily beamed well it really added to my performance i think james laughed before springing up and pouncing on her laughing still as lily tried to fight against his body hovering over hers we ve got to go to bed james it really late and we have to be up early tomorrow lily tried to reason but failing as james had resorted to tickling her sides two of her most ticklish spots no really she yelped tears of mirth rolling down her cheeks before she managed to kick james in the knee ow james exclaimed trying his best to look hurt and injured but unable to keep the grin off his face fine fine we ll go to sleep just as james was moving away from lily in his attempt to get back over to his side of the bed lily had yanked him by his shirt back down on top of her poll if you could do anything to change the world what would it be much thanks to my readers and especially my

answer that one well read and review thanks chapter thirty one one hell of a christmas james lily sirius and charlotte moved in to house that james had bought months before the next day lily with the help of sirius had long since decorated the place and furnished it accordingly but between the mishaps with the order and thwarting voldemort she had not yet had the chance to surprise james with their home he had loved the house the way lily had made it commenting on the furniture arrangement and the colors of the walls although really he would have loved it any which way not really knowing anything about interior design and was just happy that lily would be living here with him they had given charlotte and sirius the guest room although they both swore they were only staying a few days and that they would be gone for sure by the time the wedding rolled around which was to happen in a few weeks time james had insisted that they stay as long as necessary to which sirius gave him a dogged expression claiming that he did not want to be around for the honeymoon stage all the while winking and jabbing james in the ribs james had hit him across his head and sirius shut up about the subject temporarily lily enjoyed having her fianc and friends in her house it made time slip by so much faster and it made the work for the order so much more bearable being able to know that when she got home there would be comfort and love the next week and a half passed by very quickly although james was no closer to outing mulciber as a death eater he had been successful in following him around and discovering his habits the places he stopped at on the way home from the ministry and the people he met there james had informed dumbledore what had happened to his flat and dumbledore had come personally to their new home helping lily put all sorts of defensive charms and spells on the house to keep it more protected he had even suggested the fidelius charm but lily and james had been adamant against using it they would be entirely isolated from the order and helping stop voldemort and james felt that they would be skirting their responsibilities dumbledore had dropped the subject and looked slightly relieved that they had decided against it between order meetings and working on their separate tasks christmas snuck up on them quite suddenly so lily found herself decorating furiously christmas eve before their small group of friends came for dinner the next day james can you help me please lily called from their sitting room a slight note of panic lining her words james had just returned from his evening task of tailing mulciber and came home to find his fianc e trying to control a small herd of hyperactive pixies zooming around their downstairs sirius was currently trying to stun the few who were trying to make it upstairs and charlotte was screaming as they pulled at her fine black hair he quickly pulled out his wand and began stunning as many as possible soon the room was littered with frozen pixies how did they get in here james asked pulling an immobile pixie out of lily red hair lily panting pointed at sirius the tree he brought in hadntbeen checked for inhabitants sirius shrugged and looked apologetic sorry i ve never had the task of getting a christmas tree before charlotte free from the ravishing pixies went to the bathroom to fix her hair and clean up the many scratches on her hands and face well it is a beautiful tree lily said as they all stood back and admired it i was putting the garland on when they came out she pointed to the shredded garland and flicked her wand repairing the decorations how was dinner at your parents james asked looking slightly guilty i sorry i couldntmake it but dumbledore sent me a last minute message saying mulciber was known to be meeting a few alleged death eaters before going on a muggle torture spree it would be their idea of a happy christmas did you stop them lily asked her face lined with apprehension yes well i think so frank alice fenwick and the prewett brothers met up with me and they fought them off well enough to make them think twice about attacking anyone the next couple of days james face hardened slightly and he continued somewhat bitterly i wish i could have fought them and give mulciber something to reckon with but dumbledore said i couldntrisk being seen lily put her arms around him and rested her head upon his chest dontbe so eager to fight them james you ll get your turn soon enough is everyone on our side okay she looked him in the eyes and he nodded yes for the most part frank got a pretty nasty cut on the side of his face but it nothing alice cantfix she pretty amazing about knowing certain remedies for things like that lily nodded that good so how was your parents james asked again returning the embrace lily had given him as he pulled his arms around her body oh it was all right petunia and vernon were there so it was a rather dry evening mum kept bringing up our wedding and i think it put them in right sour moods but i cantreally tell with them they always look like they ve just been fed lemons vernon just jealous that i get to marry you in fourteen days james said kissing her on the top of the head yes i sure that it lily replied sarcastically as she untwined herself from james now will you help me finish decorating we have a lot to do before tomorrow i want it to be perfect oh why did i have to be involved with such a perfectionist james complained teasingly lily shot him an intimidating stare i dontknow mate but we re all suffering sirius replied well out of reach of lily wrath as he strung garland around the banister christmas day should have been a good day in any other place in any other time it could have been a happy day as the world was currently torn between the struggle of good and evil lily knew it was naive of her to hope for a regular christmas where the meeting of friends lovers and family would be a time to celebrate the day had started out nice enough she james sirius and charlotte had hopped over to the potters for a christmas brunch after opening their presents no one had gotten anything too expensive or exciting no one had much time for excessive shopping lately but everyone had managed to give and get something quite special and meaningful sirius had given james three books one on the chudley cannon quidditch team which was both guys favorite team one on modern defensive spells which lily made a mental note to borrow and one that james tried very hard not to let lily see being a cunning and creative woman lily was able to retrieve the book almost as soon as james had attempted to hide it what not to try with your other wand a young wizard guide to preventing magical mishaps of the worst kind lily read the title trying to stifle a giggle classy as always sirius i especially like this chapter title engorgio donteven think about it she turned to james do i have anything to be worried about shnukums no james said huffily defending himself this caused sirius charlotte and lily to laugh harder and james resorted to snatching the book back i ve never tried anything like this and i d like to think that i donthave a reason to he gave lily a narrowed glance to which she immediately tried to stop laughing but failed as james was doing such a good job at being offended anyways you looked like the real wanker buying it james told sirius who grinned widely not when i asked to have it gift wrapped the others laughed but james continued to pout until lily declared him a more than satisfactory lover and gave him an apologetic kiss on the mouth after the laughter had died down and the sitting room was cleared of the wreckage that comes with unwrapping presents on christmas morning the foursome set off for james parents place lily chose to wear her yellow hat and scarf mrs potter had given to her for her birthday and they had a lovely time talk of the upcoming wedding continued around the table and lily and james although they were both unaware of the others feelings began to get tingling sensations in their bellies that left them antsy all day when they finally made it back to their house there were only a few hours before their other friends would be coming over for supper so lily set off frantically for the kitchen accompanied by charlotte and a handful of cooking books james and sirius werentquite sure what to do but eventually decided that they should probably help the girls in the kitchen although they werentquite sure if their aid would be more of a hindrance than help james put the turkey on the table please lily said as she flicked her wand over the potatoes forcing them to mash themselves into creamy white mounds when she first felt the burning sensation on her wrist she just thought some of the steam from the potatoes had grazed her hand as the warmth continued however she realized it wasntany steam but her watch alerting her to some business with the order she looked over to the table where james had just sat the christmas turkey he was feeling it to she knew as his eyes wandered to his left wrist sirius soon reappeared in the kitchen with charlotte he too looked alert are you guys ready to go he asked them lily and james nodded although charlotte looked a little more than confused go where arentremus and peter and all of them coming here she asked her blue eyes darting around the room from sirius to james to lily and then landing quizzically on sirius again we ve got some stuff to do it a bit of an emergency it for dumbledore sirius said trying to give his usual charming smile why dontyou go to james we ll be back soon for a moment they all thought charlotte wouldntlisten that she would put up a real fight which would eat away at the precious time they had but she seemed to sense the vital nature of their work and she merely nodded before disapparating to the potters moments later they found themselves in a small muggle village far from the cozy home they had been in seconds earlier they had apparated on the outskirts of the town but it wasnthard to spot where they were needed in the middle of the village a huge fire blazed sending clouds of smoke and shrieks into the cold night air without looking at each other they set off as fast as they could to the heart of the village lily looked to the fire to try and figure out what needed to be done the flames sprang from a muggle apartment complex and a muggle fire truck was currently trying to squelch the flames these flames however were done by magic and were impossible to kill with mere squirts of water before she could reach for her wand she felt a hand on her shoulder easy there came a voice that triggered some sort of familiarity within lily brain she turned around to face one of the prewetts she couldnttell which brother it was death eaters i thought we scared them off earlier i guess not he said frowning you start with some extinguishing charms i hear your brilliant in charms i going to look for those bastards i sure they re still around this is the part they love to watch be careful evans lily gave him a nod and started swishing and flicking her wand towards the flames casting the most powerful extinguishing charms she could recall as the fire started to die down lily saw that her charms had been joined by benjy fenwick emmeline vance and elphias doge the muggles that had come to watch the horrific scene stood transfixed at the magic that was currently dousing the fire lily gave them a worried glance but soon saw that ministry obliviators had arrived along with mad eye moody and a team of aurors the fire was soon squelched although smoke continued to pollute the air lily tried spotting james in the confusion and saw that he was joined by dorcas meadowes and they were currently trying to apprehend a death eater they seemed to have the situation under control as the death eater was soon stunned and lily made her way to the wreckage looking for any muggles that remained in the scorched remnants of the building that had held their homes help me please help me lily heard a woman cry my baby my baby lily looked around for the frantic woman spotting her in the corner of a charred room that appeared to have held their christmas tree now all that was left was a thick black stick protruding from a tree stand i going to help you lily said in a voice she hoped was soothing she approached the woman cautiously my baby the woman sobbed harder and lily could now see that the woman was cradling something black and burned in her arms her baby lily felt her heart rise into her throat and tears threatening to gush from her eyes but she held them in she wasntquite sure what to do but she knew that she must not let this woman see her cry she must be strong give her to me i here to help we ll get you both medical attention hand her to me i ll help you lily said trying her best to remain calm no no the woman cried louder you arentgoing to have her how can i trust you how do i know you didntdo this she started shouting her voice growing louder and louder at first lily was speechless how did this woman know she could trust her she had just seen a group of people in cloaks and with wands things this woman had probably never seen and they had destroyed her home almost killed her baby lily refused to even think that the baby was dead although she couldntignore it quiet stillness and injured her why should this woman hand lily her baby lily didntknow much about motherhood but she had the inkling that if she had been this woman she would not hand off her baby to just anyone all right hold on to her but please come with me i can get you both medical care please this building is not safe or sturdy as if to emphasize her point the building let out a long groan as if the boards above them had finally decided that holding all this weight was too much to be expected from them i wonthurt you let go lily pleaded the woman looked down at her baby and up at lily her blue eyes watering she gone kill me please the woman begged in a hush whisper lily green eyes were losing control of her tears maybe maybe not come with me please the woman wouldntbudge and so lily decided to take matters into her own hands she put her wand in her cloak pocket and went towards the woman lily lifted the lady up which was a miraculous feat as she was a bit larger than she was and was no longer cooperating with any movement at all the woman just cradled her child lily are you all right came a voice it was james his hazel eyes met lily s and he looked at the woman lily was trying to hold standing against her and threatening to topple over on top of her he walked towards them and brought the woman into his arms i ve got her he whispered to lily he then heaved her into his arms and walked out the door looking very much like a young husband carrying his new wife across the threshold to their new home in a perverse terrible way lily thought she was going to be sick lily and james arrived back at their home hours later but they both felt as if it had been a year since they d been home it couldntpossibly be christmas james grabbed hold of lily hand as they entered their house together sirius had gone to fetch charlotte as he had promised and told them that he d be spending the night at the potters they were all exhausted james caressed her hand softly and lily looked up at him but they were both at loss for words they had been members of the order for half of a year now they had seen muggles being tortured they had seen people die they had fought the death eaters and lord voldemort but nothing they had experienced in the last six months was as disturbing to them as tonight had been the poor woman had been right her baby was dead when the healer announced this to the woman in a soft and sympathetic voice the woman had shrieked louder than any of the screams they had heard that night as they walked through the foyer lily remembered that they had invited people over for the evening peter grace and remus were all in the order so she hadntgiven it much thought she just assumed they would be called into action too allison jacob and ellie however were not in the order and so she wasntsurprised to find a harassed owl with a note waiting for her what surprised her was grace melbourne remus girlfriend sitting at the dining room table looking as worried as anything grace are you all right she asked trying not to be frantic was remus hurt a harsher wiser voice entered her head was he dead grace looked up at lily her gray eyes sad remus left me she let out a sigh i was hoping i was just dreaming or something or i dontknow that he had been kidding that there was a surprise home waiting for us to move in together or something that if i came tonight he would show up but we all got called to do order business i couldntgo i thought he d show up still maybe lily heart ached would this day ever be over she d had quite enough she looked over at james who had been writing a reply to allison frantic note he was looking very uncomfortable was there a note are you sure he all right and all just getting up and leaving you that doesntsound like remus lily tried to reason although she would rather have remus leave grace on his own accord than him be captive to death eaters and voldemort grace smiled sadly yes there was a note i know he left it it his hand writing and all he said it over that he has to go away get out of this place well more eloquently than that you know how remus is well i sorry grace lily said as compassionately as she could would you like to stay here tonight sirius and charlotte have the guest room but the sofa folds out no no dontbother grace said standing up from her lonely chair at the dining table i better get going my parents will be worried about me i thought i d just make sure he wasntwith you guys see you lily james she got up and gave them what she must have thought to be a convincing smile and it pained lily to return it good night grace happy christmas yeah happy grace said softly letting herself out lily let out a long sigh once she was sure grace was gone i cantbelieve remus would do that on christmas and everything i sure he didntwant to james replied talking for the first time on the subject allison owl had finally gone and he just stood rather stoically in the corner remember what he said dumbledore wanted him to do lily she remembered he gone to live with the werewolves she whispered horrified for remus sake how terrible poor remus james nodded and sighed before combing his hands through his hair this is one hell of a christmas he looked so tired and worn out he was paler than usual and had large dark bags under his eyes lily realized she must not look much better perhaps we should get to bed she suggested without any real conviction in this offer she felt so lost at the moment james shrugged and looked at his fianc e dontyou want to have some of the turkey you ve got to be hungry i really dontthink i can eat lily said dryly come on lily i can hear your stomach growling from here let eat james suggested again this time a little more forcefully all right but not too much my stomach is in knots as it is lily sat down at the chair james pulled out for her and let him make a plate of food for her happy christmas he said smiling at her as he sat the plate in front of her i dontknow about that james shrugged as he took his seat we re alive lily i think that makes it a happy christmas lily nodded thinking james must be right but not feeling much better it was later that night that she thought of it in her futile attempts to find sleep she discovered a plan that seemed like it would relieve one of the many knots that had formed in her stomach that day james she whispered tapping him on the shoulder trying to wake him james turned over to face her he looked like he had just found sleep himself and lily felt a little guilty for rousing him what is it are you all right he asked tiredly yes i fine but james she bit her lip in apprehension i have an idea yes he asked reaching over her for his glasses let get married james raised an eyebrow arentwe already doing that i know i know but i mean let run away and do it let not have a big wedding with all those relatives my mother invited it so public and well what if there an attack there i couldntlive with myself if someone was killed at our wedding james looked down at lily considering this option the details of their wedding didntreally matter to him so long lily was his bride if that what you want lily if you re sure i think it sounds like a fantastic idea he smiled to show that he really meant it can we talk about it in the morning though i really am tired lily smiled feeling the happiest she had all night one of the knots seemed to untangle itself from her stomach and she nodded good night dontforget to answer the poll do you think jkr will kill off harry ron and or hermione and thanks to my reviewers an aspiring author lazy lilies justcallmedollface glowing ice lia amitair leanne princess eclpise messyblackhair66 and elise bentwin a n alright guys this is it the final chapter i want to thank all of my readers and reviewers i appreciate it all so much so thank you i meant to post this the 20th i even had it written but then my internet went down and by the time i got it up i had deathly hallows in my hands and well i chose to read it because i didntwant to come on to fanfiction and see stories inspired by dh thus ruining the book for me anyways have fun reading this and review please chapter thirty two a hopeful future so he gone sirius said again letting the words fall out of his mouth lazily to join the werewolves james nodded yet again sirius had been rolling this bit of news around his head and out of his mouth for the last five minutes as if he was waiting for the information to really hit him to become real peter shuddered in the corner he accepted remus disappearance with a curt nod and then took his seat in james sitting room james had felt it was his responsibility to tell his friends what had happened and had invited peter over as soon as sirius had returned from the potters i just thought he would at least owl us or something sirius said that really doesntsound like remus just leaving like that he would have told us he couldnthave told us james reasoned it has to be secret remus has to blend in completely with the werewolves in order to gain their trust in order to find out what they re up to he couldnthave risked letting us know when he left it was probably very sudden they probably just came for him and he had to go he couldntlet them see him using an owl or anything james rambling went on for a good few minutes and it seemed like he was trying to rationalize his way into believing himself in the meantime a dark looked passed over sirius one that contorted his usually handsome features into an expression usually worn on less likable members of the black family when this look hit sirius it never bode well what if he really joined him james james rose to his feet immediately this accusation accompanied by the use of his first name changed the atmosphere completely that completely ridiculous remus wouldntdo that well where the proof sirius asked also rising he just left we dontknow anything about this so called mission we dontknow anything about it from dumbledore he could have just made the whole thing up so he could go off and that enough james retorted his tone cold and commanding remus would not do that he our friend and we ve got to trust him sirius let out a breath and shrugged not willing to argue his best friend on this subject sirius james started easing his voice padfoot i ve got to know you trust him sirius shook his fine black hair out of his eyes it was getting longer and he didntplan on cutting it anytime soon he looked james in the eye they were almost exactly the same height he then looked away to peter who remained seating and quiet throughout the whole exchange of words between the best friends what do you think wormtail sirius asked his gray eyes boring into peter watery blue ones peter had to look away his eyes darting from james to sirius trying to decide who he wanted to agree with rather than what he believed i i dontknow peter started stumbling over his words and both james and sirius looked down at him it does look suspicious he stopped at the sound of james huffing in indignation but he our friend and i trust him peter shuddered slightly waiting for sirius to lash out for not choosing his side sirius however just nodded and looked at james again all right he let out a sigh putting his hands into his pockets i believe in remus and i trust your judgment okay james replied glad they were able to agree arguments with sirius were by far the worst right up on top of his unpleasantness meter as having a row with lily any tension mingling in the room and spreading through the air ceased and calm took over the room there something else i wanted to tell you both james said after a few moments sirius and peter looked up immediately their eyes wide more bad news lily and i have decided to alter the wedding plans a bit he started you re still getting married right sirius retorted instantly a look of horror striking his features james chuckled and nodded yes of course thanks for your concern padfoot well if all that pining and moping for all those years had been a waste sirius started to rant but james merely waved him silent it all right really it just we ve decided to jump the gun a little james attempted to explain but was interrupted again by lily entering the room taking off her heavy cloak and apparently clueless to sirius and peter presence merlin i just want to hurl she exclaimed preparing to vent about her visit to st mungo s where she had gone to check up on the poor childless mother from the previous night attack when she was halted by sirius pouncing on top of her embracing her tightly you re pregnant he said happily oh you two he released her and then rounded on james hitting him in the arm you old dog prongs lily merely looked from sirius to james eyes bulging wondering what exactly she had walked in on james laughed again no padfoot we re not pregnant his eyes darted to lily as far as i know at least i not pregnant sirius lily said loudly wanting to make no more misunderstandings we ve decided to go away and get married instead of the whole planned thing we ve decided it best to do it more spur of the moment safer at least james finally divulged smiling at the confusion that had occurred oh all right replied sirius am i still best man of course and peter i still want you there as a groomsman james gestured towards peter who was being quiet as usual sitting in his chair peter smiled just let me know when you need me when is this event taking place then sirius asked looking at james and lily who were now positioned cozily in the same chair they merely looked at one another we re not really sure started lily in the next couple of days i ve got to talk to my parents we want to see dumbledore to get his opinion we were going to go later tonight to see him actually sirius nodded is it going to be just us lily shook her head a few others will be there hopefully and am i still allowed to orchestrate a bachelor party for jamesie sirius asked as if this was the most important question regarding the whole situation you better be james said smiling at lily as he said so i ve got to enjoy my last few hours of freedom lily merely looked at james grinning as well yes allison ellie and charlotte better be throwing me one too it my last chance to rendezvous with gilderoy lockhart james made a face at her before tickling her as she was incredibly vulnerable sitting on his lap and sharing his seat lily giggled loudly trying to smack james away but failing peter and sirius just exchanged a knowing look and smiled to themselves they were lost in their own world oblivious to all but themselves xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx lily let out the deep breath she had been holding there beverly evans as she stepped back from her daughter does it fit all right lily turned around to face her mother smiling yes perfect actually glad i didntgain any weight though beverly evans looked her daughter over her eyes glistening with tears you look so beautiful and grown up lily hugged her mother dontcry mum you ll make me cry and i dontwant to risk trying that make up charm again so close to the ceremony starting i felt like i almost blew my face off earlier luckily i here to make sure you dontdo any permanent damage ellie said coming to stand next to beverly looking very elegant in the pale gold bridesmaid dress she was wearing her dark hair pulled back into a chic up do allison and charlotte joined her too both looking exceptionally gorgeous and excited yes and good thing i brilliant with hair allison added beaming lily grinned thank you guys so much oh it nothing really charlotte started her blue eyes holding the same mischievous glint lily recognized james having i mean we didntwant you going out there looking terrible i mean james has still got to say i do the girls all laughed lightly enjoying the simple excitement and happiness of preparing for a wedding ceremony take a look at yourself lily you re gorgeous her mother said trying very hard to hold back her tears lily walked over to the full length mirror occupying the bathroom how they all fit in here lily didntknow but she assumed magic had been involved she gazed at her reflection and grinned a thousand butterflies swarming in her stomach i cantbelieve this is happening she let out softly holding the sides of her dress in her hands and turning around to watch her reflection she indeed was beautiful wearing the same dress her mother and james mother had helped pick out months ago the dress was white and flowing making lily feel quite like a princess allison had done her hair although it hadnttaken much work half of her red hair was pulled back into an elegant braid keeping and loose strands out of her eyes the rest of the red mass flowed around her shoulders she wore a small veil not wanting anything too lacy or gaudy but it is a voice said lily turned around it was margaret potter james mother lily embraced her oh thank you so much margaret it really so nice to be able to get married here my parents were able to come that wouldnthave been so easy in any other magical place oh i glad to have helped i never thought i d be able to have my son get married in my own house but what the sense of having such a big home if you cantdo things like these in them said margaret smiling but we better get ready to start i just came to make sure everything was all right she kissed lily cheek and then was off ellie squealed with anticipation as they heard the organ start the familiar wedding tune xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx james sucked in his breath as the little old witch started at the organ that had been placed in the vast elegant room james parents always used for balls and parties the room was arranged and decorated for their midnight wedding and about twenty guests had taken seats in the small pews james dad had conjured for the occasion ready mate sirius said quietly from the side of james james nodded and sirius could tell from his profile that he was grinning the procession started with two small children making their way up the aisle one was sirius cousin daughter also a disowned black she was small and a little perplexed at her task of throwing flowers down the aisle but with the ring bearer in front of her she kept focused james barely noticed the other members of the wedding party once lily entered the room accompanied by her proud looking father who appeared to be getting quite accustomed to dress robes james had to keep him mouth from dropping once his eyes landed on his bride she looked amazing simply beautiful and she was coming closer and closer to him ready to become his wife it seemed to take forever for lily to reach james at least from their point of view and as soon as patrick evans left his daughter by james with a nod and a smile to his soon to be son in law time seemed to have stopped james stared at lily his hazel eyes smiling as much as his lips were lily grinned back at him as he took her hand and it was a good few seconds before they realized the vows had started they both turned to face albus dumbledore who like them was smiling happily his eyes twinkling under his half moon spectacles james your vows dumbledore said after a moment james nodded and looked directly into lily emerald eyes oblivious to everyone else lily i knew you were special the moment i first saw you it took me a few years to realize what the swooping sensation in my stomach and the way my heart rose to my throat when ever you were around meant and it took me even longer to not act like an idiot around you because of it he continued as she beamed at him i so grateful to you for finally giving me a chance you re such an incredible person you re brilliant and beautiful inside and out and i would like you to be my wife together we can face everything lily with you at my side i know that we can make it lily had to breathe in slowly after hearing this she didntwant to tear up as her turn came james you ve seen every side of me you ve seen me furious you ve seen me sad and vulnerable you ve seen me happy and you ve been the cause of all of these emotions at some point in time she let out a small nervous laugh and james did as well but i wouldntwant to be with anyone else i love you for all that you make me feel and i know that you re the only person that will ever make me happy i know we re going to go through hell together but i wouldntwant it any other way she continued to smile and was slightly stunned to see that tears were gathering in james joyful eyes the room seemed filled with love at that second a few dreamy sighs and noses were blown and everyone was caught up in the moment dumbledore looked down at the couple and checked his pocket watch it was eleven fifty nine for a few more seconds 1978 for a few more moments james you may kiss your bride james lifted lily veil over her head and just as the clock struck twelve his lips reached hers binding them together as husband and wife holding them together as one fierce hope for the future as the new year rang in lily and james realized they were leaving any carefree times behind for good they knew that their lives would never be easy again but they were prepared to go on together fighting lord voldemort and ending all fear thanks to all of my reviewers and to all of my readers that made it this far i really do appreciate it no spoilers in the reviews please just thought i d made a disclaimer just in case a n hello here the next chapter as for the poll on the last one i only had several votes but they all had something in common chocolate and a baked good cookies and brownies and such i going to dedicate this chapter to an asshole the asshole that invented college applications they are such a pain and the essay topics are horrible sigh i guess i ll just have to deal like everyone else has i ll try to update as soon as possible until then read and review chapter four unpacking and flat finding james and sirius stood in the hallway with boxes and trunks surrounding them they had just finished signing the final papers giving them their new flat to the young men it was perfect it was located on the second floor had two bedrooms two bathrooms one small kitchen a small dining area and a living room for company it was everything they wanted or needed they were finally on their own the flat was located in london a magical flat that appeared like an old deserted caf to muggles it had been advertised in the daily prophet and sirius and james had decided it was the one for them almost immediately james smiled as he looked around and then gazed at his watch moony and wormtail should be here any second to help unpack he stated sirius nodded shame they dontwant to live with us james shrugged remus is working at flourish and blotts and that comes with a flat above the shop so mr flourish is letting him live there no excuse for peter sirius replied grudgingly he canthelp it if his parents want him to live at home james remarked with a sigh as he heard two pops they re here he exclaimed as a knock came to the door james opened the door with a grin on his face and he looked at his two friends remus was looking unusually chipper and peter smiled modestly so this is it remus stated smiling sirius nodded yes welcome to our humble abode please grab a box and help unpack with wands of course the boys chuckled as remus and peter walked in to get a good look of the place before helping unpack two hours later they were done and sirius and james looked around pleasantly at their new home it was simple with a masculine air too it yet there were a few objects that linked the household to a well off family solid gold goblets on the counter top for example would you gentleman care for a drink james offered to their guests in the playful ecstatic humor that comes with having your first residence remus grinned sure a butter beer please i ll just take my seat on the couch i helped unload sirius went off to the kitchen and looked around james we donthave any butter beer he called out james looked towards the kitchen and called back are you sure yeah sirius replied actually we donthave anything how do we get food james thought for a moment well my mother always goes to this store in diagon alley but i dontknow what it called maybe we could owl her no we cantdo that we have to prove to her that we can live on our own sirius protested from the kitchen still clattering about remus just smiled and shook his head while peter sat on the sofa looking around the flat well what should we do then james called back i dontknow sirius shouted let just go to the store moony can come with us i sure he knows what to do james nodded and then looked at peter and remus alright let go to the store remus just chuckled this was going to be an adventure i just think it wise to wait to search for a place when you have a steady job that all beverly evans told lily as they walked down the streets of london a copy of the daily prophet in hand mum i got a letter that basically told me i had the job as soon as my n e w t scores came in i ll be fine and if i dontmove out when it feels right i might live at home forever lily retorted becoming slightly agitated mrs evans looked at her in a way that made lily think that her living at home permanently might not be that bad of an option lily sighed come on we have to meet charlotte in five minutes at the first flat lily replied as she continued to walk hastily down the road she stopped abruptly when she came to a tall imposing building i think this is it she said well it looks nice her mother resentfully said it indeed was a nice looking building and the streets did look safe is it is it magical beverly almost whispered lily nodded well it located in muggle london so obviously we ll have to be careful but since it was advertised in the prophet i assuming magical people lived here previously it not like an unplottable building like the leaky cauldron or hogwarts though muggles can see it as an actual occupied edifice charlotte father is a muggle so i dontthink it a problem did i hear my name came charlotte friendly sleek voice lily smiled as she saw charlotte she was still somewhat awkward in her presence as she had only really spent time with her at james christmas and birthday party they didntreally know each other at all except from what james had told the two about each other yes i was just telling my mother that your father is a muggle my parents are muggles too you see lily explained slightly embarrassed at being caught talking about her charlotte nodded as she put her sunglasses into her purse yes yes james told me let go in shall we lily nodded and she and her mother followed charlotte into the building five minutes later the three came hustling out i sorry but i refuse to stay anywhere with rats charlotte exclaimed lily nodded as she looked back at the house i have to agree it was completely uncalled for trying to rent out the place with vermin crawling about it did look pretty though charlotte complimented but rats beverly evans shuddered i wouldnthave let you stay there even if you had overlooked that aspect it completely unsanitary next place then charlotte suggested lily and beverly nodded yes just down the road a bit and make a left lily replied as she looked at the paper this one sounds nice and i think it about like this one it sounds muggle let go take a look charlotte said once again leading the way forty five minutes and three rejected flats later and charlotte and lily seemed to have found the one and even beverly approved it was on the third floor in a muggle building which was owned by an old muggle couple it was well kept in a safe location and a block away from the leaky cauldron this was just lucky lily exclaimed as stood in the sitting area in the flat i know it wasnteven advertised in the prophet i glad you had your eyes open charlotte said equally as excited and we can be careful with magic we both grew up in a muggle house hold after all and we re only a few minutes away from the leaky cauldron so we can apparate there and oh goodness lily we can even have electricity and television it like the best of both worlds lily giggled as her mother took another long tour of the place her mother returned and not having found anything horribly wrong with the place smiled it perfect lily let go ahead and sign the lease two years sound alright i believe that what the sign said she asked lily eyes slightly bulged she and james would be married and living together in two years she looked at charlotte who seemed to sense her dilemma well mrs evans do you think that wise i think a year would be much better she started as beverly gaze found her and i mean the couple downstairs they re pretty old i wouldntwant to still have the flat if they god forbid died and we were left with an absolutely atrocious land lord and lily and i wouldntbe able to get out of it beverly seemed to think this was a good idea yes charlotte that is a brilliant point i ll go have a talk with them she then turned to lily lily you are lucky to have such a thoughtful flatmate lily grinned and watched her mother hurry back down the stairs before looking at charlotte with the utmost gratitude thank you so much she exclaimed charlotte grinned well i couldntlet my favorite cousin have his wedding called off or anything when do you plan on telling your parents and james s i assuming they dontknow on my eighteenth birthday we ll tell my parents and then james s it just you re not legal in the muggle world till your eighteen and i just want my parents to approve charlotte opened her mouth to say something what it was lily didntknow as her mother had returned baring papers they will allow a lease for a year you just have to sign they said move in whenever but i think you should wait a few more weeks at least lily lily sighed mum i should be getting my n e w t scores this week dontworry i ll have a job and charlotte already has one as an assistant in the international magical cooperation unit in the ministry as she lived most of her life in france and all and beaxbutons gives their scores early so we know she hired everything will be fine beverly evans resigned herself and nodded alright then let sign and go the car is at least four blocks away five lily corrected her as she happily signed charlotte held in her giggle and signed as well making their first contract to their first flat lily will be over in five minutes james exclaimed to sirius as he ran through his flat picking up dirty laundry and putting dishes in the sink with a few swishes of his wand every once in a while he and sirius had only lived there two days and it was already a complete and total mess sirius sighed and helped james and in approximately two minutes their place was practically spotless well as spotless as a place could get with sirius living in it james took a breath and went to check his reflection in the mirror sirius just laughed at him until he heard a knock i ll get it james yelled as he rushed towards the door of course you will sirius replied sarcastically it been a full two weeks since you last saw ickle lilykins if you dontcount the ten owls a day that have been flying through here that is james rolled his eyes as he opened the door to see lily standing in front of him looking more beautiful than ever and standing behind her was charlotte james lily cried out before embracing him with a long kiss which james more than readily returned sirius let out a noise of disgust before plopping down on the couch charlotte made her way past the couple and into the living room to see sirius lazily reading the daily prophet sirius black reads she said as an introduction her tone playing between amazement and amusement sirius looked up at the sound of her voice well yes it the only way to find out which clubs are hosting which bands charlotte nodded as she played with her purse sirius looked over at lily and james who were talking animatedly want to go check out diagon alley he asked hopefully charlotte turned to look at him with a smile sure sirius hopped up from the couch alright then let go sirius made his way past james and lily with charlotte tailing him i wonder where they re going lily commented as james closed the door behind them they certainly werentplanning anything james replied dismissing the two actions well there enough dinner for three we didntexpect charlotte i guess we should have but that doesntmatter now want to go sit in the dining room it rather small wait i ll give you the tour first james continued talking as his thoughts shot through his brain lily laughed and nodded as she held on to james hand yes i want the grand tour james smiled well this is the grand living room he moved a few feet backwards and pushed the door to the kitchen open while holding on to lily hands and this is the kitchen where sirius and i fail miserably at cooking we just learned how to grocery shop the other day lily laughed as james then led her to the small dining room complete with a table for four the dining area where sirius and i share candlelight suppers james smiled and winked before walking back out of the dining room and kitchen still holding on to lily as they entered the hallway and down here is the bathroom james motioned to the first door on the right and then to the room opposite of it and this is sirius room they walked a few more meters until they reached the final door which james opened elaborately and bowed to lily and this is my room i have a bathroom too how did you get the room with the bath lily asked coyly sirius and i had an exploding snap competition and i won he still sore about it really lily laughed as she looked around james room was still james except there seemed to be a more mature reality about it instead of quidditch posters being displayed all throughout his room there were pictures of friends and family he had a blue patchwork bedspread instead of the bright gold and maroon combination that had taken over the d cor of his hogwarts room his old dresser was in the room as well as a nightstand and a chair my quidditch posters are in my closet james said as he watched lily look around his room he laughed as he saw her smile this is really nice james your whole flat is really perfect it suits you and sirius she commented as she felt james come up behind her and broke her gaze let go eat some soup before it gets cold i have to warn you i not sure how great of a cook i am for the past couple of days sirius and i have been eating at home whenever possible lily laughed as she followed james back to the kitchen and what am i going to be your test subject well i was hoping we could all be test subjects together james smiled lily giggled as she took a seat and james appeared with two bowls of steaming vegetable beef soup and a loaf of bread it smells good lily complimented as james set the bowls on the table that always a good sign but it can be misleading james remarked with a smile as he took his seat as soon as james sat down he stood back up we need wine lily couldnthelp but laugh as james poured two large glasses in a french waiter style she had seen in films with a white napkin draped over his arm and tipping the bottle ever so carefully he raised his glass when he had sat back down again to us and our n e w t scores which should be pounding down our doors at any moment lily grinned as she clinked her glass with james s i hope mine turned out alright i was going to give dumbledore my final answer about the order after they came i didntwant to give him a reply to eagerly and then have him come up to me lily you received a troll in transfiguration we just canthave you in our organization you re a liability james grinned at her oh come off it you did not get a troll in transfiguration you know you did well i bet you got an outstanding in fact i d bet my life on it well maybe i did get a dreadful lily continued winking at james have you written dumbledore back yet james shook his head no i was going to wait for you sirius was going to send his today remus already did peter is waiting for sirius and me of course i dontknow about the others lily nodded i haventreally heard from anyone else she looked down at her soup i suppose it safe to taste james grinned we ll do it together you cantmess up soup too badly alright then lily replied lifting up her spoon on the count of three james grasped his spoon and prepared for the dive one their spoons dipped closer to the bowl two the silver spoons dipped into the soup and came up with the broth three they each put their spoons into their mouths lily let the warm broth trickle down her throat and tried to hide her face of disgust the soup was rather wretched but james had tried so hard james however was not going to act as if he enjoyed it and made a face that was absolutely terrible i sorry i made you go through that lily smiled as she dabbed her lips with her napkin it isntterrible it just needs some seasoning or something she tried it was horrible lily james continued go ahead and say it it really wontinsult my masculinity my feminine side is a different story lily laughed alright it wasntthat good but you tried that what matters james smiled at his fianc e well as long as i get points for that should we go down to diagon alley florean might still have the ice cream parlor open oh i love his ice cream lily exclaimed well then let go james stated pulling out his wand and sending the rejected dinner to the kitchen ok but next time you re coming to my place and i cooking can that be trusted i dontbelieve i ve ever had any of your cooking james teased i wontdie will i not tragically at least lily replied with a grin let go alright but i get to hold your hand james stated as he opened the front door for lily well i dontknow about that lily replied gilderoy was hanging around here somewhere james laughter joined lily as they walked down the steps of

envelope in her hand lily held it up mouth open and silent open it lily it not a howler or anything charlotte said laughing at her flatmate lily moved her mouth without saying anything before words managed to escape it my n e w t scores i just know it lily muttered charlotte grinned well open it then you haventshut up about those scores in god knows how long lily smiled weakly and held the letter in both of her hands well here it goes she bit her lip and closed her eyes as she tore open the letter lily inhaled while opening her eyes and then scanned the letter before dropping it in shock charlotte reached for the fallen letter is it that bad she teased as she read her scores merlin lily charlotte murmured in amazement ten outstandings what the hell are you on lily grinned i cantbelieve it i even did well in transfiguration i ve got to owl james can i borrow your owl and dumbledore i have to write dumbledore oh and my parents they ll be dying to know she exclaimed in an excited voice charlotte laughed and nodded yes ralph is in his cage in my room probably sleeping but go ahead disturb him lily smiled thank you so much she then proceeded to prance all the way back to her room charlotte just shook her head and continued to eat her cereal twenty minutes later lily appeared back in the kitchen well i think we need to celebrate how about we have everyone over here tonight is that alright i mean this will be one of my last nights without having to work if the ministry is given my n e w t scores on time and they still want to hire me lily rambled excitedly charlotte nodded sure everyone hasntgotten together in a while it might be nice and plus you haventseen james in six days you two might die if you wait any longer lily stuck out her tongue childishly before grinning oh come on charlotte i know you re just dying to see sirius charlotte decided to turn a deaf ear and began eating her cereal again lily just smiled before heading back to her room to get dressed i guess that means i ll be needing to borrow ralph again when he returns to send out invitations she called out go ahead charlotte called back before clearing her place and heading to the shower at quarter to six lily walked through their flat while putting an earring on as the doorbell rang i thought you told people to get here at six charlotte called out from the bathroom i did lily replied as she went to the door wondering who would come this early she opened the door to see james grinning down at her with a bouquet of flowers for mademoiselle james offered bowing in greeting lily giggling took the flowers hello james the party doesntstart till six you know james smiled as he walked in and kissed her lips softly i know he replied but i wanted to be able to congratulate you personally before the others arrived he kissed her again charlotte walked in to the room to see the two and shook her head i thought i heard james horrible french accent the two red faced and smiling broke apart and looked at charlotte who was wearing an elegant red dress that complimented her raven hair so well lily could have never worn anything like it and was naturally impressed you re early charlotte stated unnecessarily good evening dear cousin i was just dying to see you he winked at her and charlotte smiled and turned back to the kitchen so how did you do on your scores lily asked james grinned ten outstandings of course that brilliant james james grinned at her lily was the type of person that could derive joy from others success it was one of the things he loved about her and she looked so beautiful tonight wearing a summer dress in a lavender shade her outfit contrasted drastically with charlotte s who had taken on a very sexy mature approach to the evening which fitted her personality perfectly james however was content with lily and her cute friendly dress i know my parents were proud and a letter from the auror academy should arrive any day i wrote dumbledore to confirm his invitation as well james said as he strolled through the girls apartment care to give me a tour while we wait for your timely guests lily smiled excitedly she hadnthad the chance to give a tour yet yes follow me she said energetically as they walked out of the foyer area this is the dining room and if you follow this door you ll get to the kitchen lily said as she crossed the room to the kitchen where she and james were now standing and we have sort of a bar type breakfast nook there lily pointed out before grabbing james hand and walking out into the kitchen and into the hallway where they then walked left into an open area complete with a couch two comfortable looking chairs a coffee table and a television this is the sitting room where we sit lily continued before pulling james back down the corridor and charlotte room is to the left she got the master bedroom with the bath but that okay and then to the right is the bathroom that i use and then at the end is my room lily finished james kept walking can i see your room he asked grinning lily nodded well i suppose it only fair james grinned and walked into her room where lily queen sized bed sat in the middle with her white fluffy comforter a pine desk a pine dresser complete with pictures and little collectables she had received as a child several tiny unicorns on the dresser top made james smile to the left of lily bed was her bookshelf which contained lily collection of books as well as the record player he had given her and her collection of records and in the very far corner was lola cat bed that had lola who had grown a great deal since james had last seen her balled up and sleeping james walked over and bent down to pet her head causing her to look up at him almost smiling despite the fact that she had been disrupted from one of her catnaps lily walked over to him and smiled yes lola likes it here at home walter went mad when he saw her and he didntlike it here at all so my mum is keeping him your place looks very comfortable james commented when we get our own place i ll have to let you decorate my flat looks completely disheveled and mismatching that sounds like a plan if i hadntbeen a witch i might have considered interior design as a career lily smiled playfully and james was tempted to kiss her he couldn t however as the door bell rang announcing the other guests lily and james entered the sitting area as charlotte ushered their guests ellie jacob and allison into the room lily grinned at her two best friends and went to talk with them james smiled and then went to talk to jacob how were your n e w t scores allison asked energetically i got four outstandings and four excellents but i know you did ten times better lily grinned sheepishly ten outstandings i couldntbelieve it even in transfiguration well it couldnthave hurt that you got your year best transfiguration student as your personal tutor ellie commented smiling happily lily cheeks turned only a slight shade of pink while allison and ellie just looked from her to james honestly if you had told me this time last year that you would be engaged to james potter i would have turned myself into st mungo and gotten you a referral allison said lily laughed i wasnt that horrible to him but even as she spoke her words lily knew that they werenttrue oh yeah ellie said do we really need to go into detail lily lily smiled well alright i was terrible she then gazed over at james who was talking to jacob in a serious manner but i so lucky now arenti you are allison said looking at jacob we both are ellie made a sound of disgust at her two lovesick friends the doorbell rang again and charlotte answered to greet sirius peter remus and grace lily seeing that everyone was present called everyone to order alright everybody charlotte and i have slaved in the kitchen for hours today so we ll all go grab a plate and then return here seeing as our dining room isntexactly the biggest room in the house sirius jumped up at the prospect of food and found his way to the kitchen being tailed closely by peter as everyone else followed in after them james appeared by lily on the couch minutes later smiling happily you made pork chops he exclaimed happily lily grinned as she spooned her potato salad well i figured if i marrying you i going to have to cook my mother pork chops james smiled and then eyed the television oh i love those remus sirius allison and peter who had never seen a television stared at it in wonder sirius took the bold move to run up to it and began playing with the knobs i think i ve heard of these before it like mini people stuck inside a box and they act out for you it simply brilliant i wonder how they shrink people like that crazy muggles remus and peter were now watching sirius intently as he pressed a button and the screen clicked on displaying a comical show where the wife was being scolded by her husband in a foreign language padfoot you re an idiot james said brightly they dontshrink the people they shoot real life sized people with electricity rays and it creates their image lily charlotte and grace being raised in muggle homes just shook their heads jacob and ellie coming from muggle born parents naturally knew what a television was even if they didnthave one in their home oh i love this episode it the vitametavegamin one grace exclaimed making her presence really known for the first time that night lily and charlotte giggled i love this one too lucy gets drunk charlotte added i just love lucy lily replied and lucille ball had red hair how can you tell asked james as he squinted at the screen it in black and white i ve seen pictures of her lily commented wisely sharing a smile with james the group was soon sucked in the show and hardly said anything throughout dinner after the show was over and everyone was done eating charlotte began taking everyone plates sirius jumped at the chance to help her and followed her into the kitchen with his own stack of dishes i really proud of you you know james whispered to lily as they sat together on the couch squashed between peter and ellie lily looked up at him smiling i proud of you too james smiled and leant in and kissed her around them allison asked what happened to the people once the show was cut off and grace tried to answer her which was followed by disbelieving laughter from peter when they broke away james grinned mischievously and i so glad you didntgo completely mad for nothing he said in mock seriousness if you had gone completely off your rocker and gotten ten trolls i would have been really worried lily pushed him playfully and laughed sod off james james stuck out his tongue didntknow i brought out such a mouth in you what would your mother say lily made a face and then pushed him swiftly off the couch making him land with a thud the group which had been previously occupied with the explanation of television sets and programs turned and looked at james sprawled on the floor glasses tilted sideways and lily smiling victoriously on the couch james and lily didntnotice them however as they were in their own little world as usual not paying attention to his friends james tugged on lily legs and soon she was on top of him hitting him but laughing all the same their friends just shook their heads with the same thought those two were so hopeless review

scores and on this day fateful letters were sent out to the recent graduates that had newly succumbed themselves into the magical world at least for the first time on their own lily was cooking breakfast in her nightgown when a small tawny owl flew in delivering a letter on the counter top she left the frying pan on the stove the bacon momentarily forgotten as she walked swiftly to the counter to reach for the letter the parchment was a typical yellow with royal blue ink scrawling out her name and the ministry of magic seal delicately sealing the letter lily held it up to the light as if to predict the contents before inhaling closing her eyes and tearing open the letter just a few blocks away james and sirius were being awoken by annoying taps on their foreheads bloody bird james mumbled while shooing the owl away this particular owl was on a mission however and dove for james fingertips pecking them vigorously james sat up bloody owl he rubbed his eyes from sleep as the owl continued to peck at him just a second he snapped as he fumbled around for his glasses once his spectacles found their place on his head he reached for the letter and the owl zipped away he heard colorful loud swearing and knew sirius was being awoken too james recognized the seal and inhaled it was the letter that could make or break his future the letter from the auror academy he tore the envelope delicately with his thumb and forefinger as if he was scared to damage the letter inside he then pulled it out quickly and let it fall on his lap he stared at it for a moment longer before picking it up and reading his future dear mr james s potter congratulations you have been accepted to the auror academy your n e w t scores proved more than satisfactory and we would like to further this acceptance letter into that of the elite auror training program this program designed for individuals that have accelerated in academics and are known to possess great natural magical ability allows one to get the required auror academy training in a shorter amount of time i would like to discuss this further with you so if you would meet in the auror department at the ministry my office on the twenty ninth of july seven am i look forward to seeing you alice longbottom james read the letter over again just to make sure he had understood it the first time he had been accepted into the elite program his heart leapt with joy and he smiled he had heard of alice longbottom from his father she was married to frank longbottom and together they were two of the most unstoppable aurors frank and alice has also been gryffindor seventh years when james was a third year and he found himself hoping they didntremember his reputation just when he was about to scan the letter over again sirius rushed into his room jumping up and down with only his boxer shorts on his identical letter clutched in his left hand prongs i got in i got in i going to be an auror he exclaimed happily jumping onto james bed james laughed and sat up and smiled before a horrible feeling lurched in the bottom of his stomach was sirius in the elite program before he had a chance to say anything sirius had reached for the letter in james hand i know you got in prongs if i did you had three more n e w t s than i did and mine were only excellents most of the time and you were head boy sirius said as he read the letter his voice trailed off he then looked back up at james wow the elite program you ll have your training done in a year it ll take me at least two probably three james stood up and looked at sirius studying his expression yeah i dontknow why they chose me though i get into just as much trouble as you do and we re practically equal in magical ability loads of times you were better than me sirius shook his head and forced a smile and handed james his letter back no you deserved to be chosen i mean you did behave more this year at least and you were head boy i happy for you prongs james smiled still unsure of how sirius really felt it was going to be different he and sirius until this past year had always been together being head boy had separated them at night but even in the classes they had together they always performed the same they went through everything together and it seemed now that their paths really were changing in james heart he truly felt that it wasntfair for him to be admitted into the elite program when he had only just aspired to be an auror mere months ago sirius had desired to be an auror for years it was one of the only goals he had of his life and here james was with a letter that was going to make all the dreams sirius ever had possible in a third of the time it was going to take him james felt extremely guilty and he felt even worse that he was happy for himself sirius gave him a halfhearted smile and a pat on the back at least you ll be able to figure out all the horrible situations before i go through them make sure you warn me mate he grinned james grinned back i ll be sure his grin faltered and he gave sirius a sympathetic look it really isntfair for us to not be together i feel like it should be you with this letter instead of me sirius laughed well then let check and make sure they addressed them right really james it alright i proud of you i ll be fine i happy to just be admitted i was worried that my surname would keep me out the academy permanently i grateful for what i have with one final smile he left james in his room and a whole new horror struck james what if he had only been accepted into the elite program because of his surname james felt sick and decided to go take a shower he would have to see lily today she always knew what to say to make him feel better lily stood in her kitchen still reading the letter she was alone in her flat as charlotte had already headed off to work that morning and there was no one to hear her give a little squeal of excitement she had gotten the job she was going to be interning a lawyer at the international magical office of law who she would be following she didntknow but she had a meeting with them on the first of august that friday lily smiled to herself and clutched the letter to her breast she was going to be a criminal lawyer she decided to head back to her room and write her parents and james with the news charlotte wouldntmind if she borrowed ralph halfway through her letter to james a small owl came swooping into her bedroom lily recognized it as a hogwarts owl it contained two envelopes of yellow parchment one had dumbledore emerald green ink and loopy individual handwriting the other which the owl dropped on her desk along with dumbledore s was in a scarlet she recognized the neat direct handwriting as professor mcgonagall s any letter from her alma mater made her anxious and lily dropped her quill and immediately picked up the letters trying to decide which one she should open first after closing her eyes and picking one randomly she opted with dumbledore s dear lily congratulations on your n e w t scores and new position at the ministry thank you for accepting my invitation the next meeting will be at the hog head the second of august eight p m ask the bartender the best of wishes albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry order of merlin first class grand sorc chf warlock supreme mugwump international confed of wizards lily folded the letter and laid it back on the desk never had she seen a letter so informative yet so vague leave it to professor dumbledore to know she already had a job she then moved on to the next letter which spiked more curiosity than the first she had expected dumbledore to reply to her acceptance she had no clue what her former transfiguration teacher could want with her dear lily may i offer my congratulations to your n e w t scores you certainly made me proud with your transfiguration score but we both knew you could do it i would like to continue our lessons a meeting after the one saturday would be best to discuss this further i ll be expecting you there minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress lily smiled as she folded the last letter and placed it on top of professor dumbledore s she had yet more news to put in her letter to james so she grinned and continued to write at seven thirty james knocked on the door to lily and charlotte flat after having a conversation with the elderly couple downstairs charlotte answered the door smiling at her cousin and hugged him kissing his cheeks james grinned as she broke away what is it dear cousin i so proud of you jamie the elite auror training program i sure your parents are pleased james nodded yes when he had written the news to his parents they had been very pleased he had a new stack of galleons in his gringotts account he didntthink he d ever seen his father prouder he had hugged james as well as sirius and had offered an award to rival james to sirius as well sirius had respectively declined and insisted being accepted was an award in its own yes they are is lily ready he asked peering around the corner hoping to catch her down the hall charlotte smiled yes she just finishing up in her room give her a few minutes care for a drink james shook his head and walked into the sitting room and took a seat on the couch charlotte followed him in and studied him for a moment so is sirius happy she asked finally james looked at her with a lopsided grin yes he thrilled he been accepted i wish he could have gotten into the elite program too she nodded her black head yes but when you think about it sirius doesnthave what you have yet he hasntreally shown his maturity at least not in his marks i sure they find him capable they wouldnthave accepted him otherwise james nodded his cousin words were comforting i sure he ll do well james replied as lily entered the room looking as beautiful as ever charlotte smiled once more and left lily and james to themselves james stood up and hugged her in greeting ready he asked smiling down at her lily grinned yes good there this great place i stumbled across the other day in diagon alley james said offering his arm after saying goodbye to the elderly couple in the bottom floor of the flat james and lily were off walking down the street towards the leaky cauldron so you know the apples lily asked as they walked down the street hand in hand james raised an eyebrow is that their name well i just had a little conversation with them downstairs before going up to see you they absolutely adore you and charlotte friendly people lily nodded yes they keep trying to invite me over for dinner i keep smelling boiling cabbage from the downstairs though so i rather frightened to accept an invitation was that what smelled i thought it was just old people james commented as they reached the leaky cauldron lily laughed as james ushered her in after taking several turns down roads lily had never explored very closely james stopped and held the door open for lily she managed to read the sign on her way in the enchanted boar lily asked with question before turning to james james smiled it good i promise lily looked like she highly doubted this before the hostess addressed them good evening please follow me james grinned and wrapped his arm around lily as they followed the hostess to a empty table she gave them a booth and left them with menus and the promise of a waiter shortly james what is this place lily asked as she looked around the dining area looked like a taxidermist dream stuffed animal heads lined the walls and every once in a while one would make an unexpected noise james chuckled sirius and i went here the other night it a bit odd but the food is great i think it a real adventure lily smiled as she watched james excitement well i suppose we ll have to try it then i just wontlook at the deceased victims while i eat that the spirit james commented with a laugh as the waiter arrived what can i get you to drink he asked politely i think a bottle of your finest champagne as we are celebrating after all that okay with you lily james said that sounds excellent she said with a smile the waited nodded as he conjured the champagne glasses a bottle of champagne as well as some glasses of water i ll be back in a few minutes for your order he said and with a pop he was gone well james dearest what do you recommend lily asked as she searched the menu the chicken is good and the beef stew james replied i think i ll try a nice steak what are you thinking of lily closed the menu i could use a nice steak myself with a twice baked potato james asked hopefully lily nodded yes that sounds lovely as if hearing them decide on their dishes the waiter popped back up making lily jump up slightly and causing james to chuckle two steaks and two side orders of the twice baked potato the waiter asked as a quill scrawled everything the ordered onto a piece of parchment the quill had a mind of its own it seemed yes please lily confirmed glancing at the quill with amazement how would you like them cooked medium rare she looked at james with question and he nodded both done medium rare the waiter nodded and what kind of dressing ranch lily said quickly bleu cheese for me please james said the waiter nodded robotically as the quill continued to write is that all yes thank you lily said as the waiter disappeared yet again once the waiter had disappeared lily took a sip of her champagne so we are celebrating she stated smiling happily at james who grinned in response yes you got your job i got accepted into the auror academy we need to celebrate james replied lily nodded not just the auror academy james the elite training program james nodded and the smile on his face began to falter yeah lily glanced at him for a moment their dinners magically appeared in front of them but neither paid much attention to the hot food before them what wrong james you are happy about the elite program is it sirius he did get into the academy right james sighed yes sirius got into the academy but lil he got into the three year program and i in the elite program it just not fair he wanted this for so long and i feel like i dontknow that i dontdeserve it i worried it just because my last name is potter i know it if his wasntblack lily cut james off her eyes flashing with determination james stop it right this second you do deserve this you were head boy captain of the quidditch team that won the cup every year that you were captain i might add and you did far better on your n e than sirius did you and sirius may have the same raw natural magical ability but james you ve done things that show your leadership responsibility and independence sirius hasn t dontget me wrong i love sirius but he just now growing up the academy was right about accepting him and all but from what they ve seen he isntready for the responsibility of the elite program they know he brilliant james they dontknow if he mature james listened to lily decided words they did comfort him yes everyone else had been saying pretty much the same thing but only lily seemed to reassure him it had something to do with her eyes her beautiful green almond shaped eyes but there was something that was still worrying him what what about if it just because i a potter what if that the only reason he asked carefully lily looked at james and smiled at him james i sure they ve looked beyond that now your name might have been what interested them at first but when they saw how extraordinary you were they did what they thought was best lily words were no longer fierce but loving and comforting james seemed to think her words over for a minute and he knew she was right she was always right this was lily evans he was dealing with he grinned his lopsided smile at her i love you so much he said as he picked up his fork and knife well i glad your feelings haventchanged lily teased and i love you too the two smiled and both happily tucked in and began to eat smiling at each other a n lily engagement will be announced on her eighteenth birthday which will be in early august i ll put the exact date in the story soon please be patient with me i may find writing a little hard for a while give yourself a pat on the back if you read this chapter now give yourself an

already anyways i ll let you read please review sorry for the delay chapter seven the training begins james woke up at five the morning of july twenty ninth he hadntbeen able to sleep at all due to nerves and woke up in a cold sweat he looked around his room in a daze before pulling the covers off himself he knew sirius would have to get up early this morning too he had to meet with someone from the regular auror academy at eight he knew it was early as he looked out the sky and saw the sun barely rising over the buildings of london james decided what he needed was a good run he hadnthad a real jog since hogwarts and it always helped him clear his head after suiting up he left a note for sirius to tell him where he was although he seriously doubted that sirius would be up before he returned half an hour later james returned sweating and feeling utterly refreshed the exercise had eased some of his nerves but the excitement of the anticipated meeting gave him a completely new set of butterflies when he returned he heard sirius groaning and swearing from his bedroom james chuckled as sirius stumbled out of his room just wearing his boxer shorts and swinging his arms at an owl that was flying above his head charlotte owl i not bloody prongs sirius shouted diving at the owl in an attempt to shoo it from his head james laughed again and sirius looked up at him almost glaring ruddy owl james is there sirius pointed at james before heading back to his room and slamming the door james laughed again to himself as ralph flew over to him looking pleased that no one was hitting him and dropped the letter in james hands dear james sorry if this is too early but i was excited for you and couldntsleep and then i woke up early and i decided you were probably nervous too you dontneed to be james you ll do fine they want you there they know you can do it i know you can do it and i know you know you can do it you arrogant toerag i love you you re brilliant everything will be fine come visit me after you re done for the day i ll make you dinner pork chops i love you your shnuckums p s charlotte and i wish sirius luck too james chuckled as he read the letter lily certainly did know him she knew him enough to know how to comfort him and he loved her he knew everything would go all right today and smiled with his newfound confidence he began to get ready he also made sure sirius was up and went down to a local muggle caf and got them some breakfast james entered the neat office of alice longbottom at exactly seven that morning he had actually arrived at the ministry at six thirty but took the time to walk off some nerves and grab a cup of coffee alice a short round faced woman with shoulder length blonde hair smiled up to him as he entered and stood up her hand out stretched hello james nice to see you again i was alice stone back at hogwarts do you remember me she asked in a kind tone james nodded yes ma m he replied with a grin you dated longbottom back then i assuming you married alice beamed and held up her left hand yes one year we married right after we completed auror training although it was frowned upon aurors arentsupposed to marry each other after all she continued to smile and offered james a seat while reclaiming hers the elite program is something new developed this year due to the lack of aurors she started immediately changing to a serious business like tone james smiled she sort of reminded him of lily you have been selected due to your fantastic marks n e w t scores recommendations and obvious natural talent there are eleven others new to the program she went on she stopped for a moment and studied james you have stopped fooling around so much haventyou i know you and your little friends used to be such big pranksters james nodded eagerly yes yes ma m i was made head boy this year and lily straightened me out alice smiled lily lily evans red hair brilliant at charms james grinned yes that the one i take it you stopped annoying her so much then i remember the rows you two used to have she had quite a temper when it came to you at least pretty even tempered and kind hearted to everyone else james smiled again yes i managed to shape up and she managed to give me a chance alice nodded i know this is slightly unprofessional but let just say we re catching up as friends for a few minutes i d like to get to know you if you re going to be working here and all she smiled sneakily and continued so are you two dating yes actually james beamed and then stopped he had almost said they were engaged but remembering that this was an auror office and that his father was in close proximity closed his mouth well we ve been dating for about seven months alice smiled and nodded not noticing anything peculiar about james alright then friend time over back to business she grinned you will be able to complete your training in a year you have double the time of training in a shorter period of time however and it will be vigorous can you devote six days a week for the next year to the program you wontbe training all day but you will be expected to show up six out of seven days you will get some vacation time limited however are you up to it james nodded yes alright then it time for you to meet your instructor alice announced closing some folders that had been lying on her desk and standing up james stood up but had a confused expression on his face arentyou going to be instructing me james asked hopefully he had been looking forward to having someone as agreeable and kind as alice to train him she could understand james needing time off for a wedding alice almost laughed no no they wouldntlet me train the elites yet not after being out of training for only a year myself frank and i are in charge of the regular auror academy james nodded trying to hide the disappointment from his face alice patted him on the back as she walked out of her office dontworry james you ll be fine if you need anything feel free to come to me and frank oh and tell lily to write me sometime i d really like to know how she doing james nodded as they stopped outside a plain oak door no doubt his trainer office alice knocked and waited for a gruff voice to reply she turned to james and smiled extending her hand again it been a pleasure meeting with you james i ll see you around she smiled and as james shook her hand she turned to leave deserting james by the door of a very grumpy sounding person he sighed and then turned the doorknob to enter what he saw was a harsh looking man sitting behind his desk he had wild hair several scars on his face and most peculiarly an electric blue eye that pivoted in all directions james face tightened as both eyes focused on him name he said potter james potter sir james said in the most mature voice he could muster he managed to take a glimpse at the name tagged on the desk alastor moody james recognized that name he worked with james father james remembered his father talking of the man brilliance even if he was slightly paranoid they called him mad eye if james remembered correctly he was an excellent auror mad eye moody didntseem to have a need to reply to james as his electric blue eye looked james over he had the horrible feeling that it could see through him and gulped very well then moody finally said take a seat my name is alastor moody you re to call me moody if anything james nodded as he nervously took a seat moody waved his arm and the oak door behind james slammed shut leaving james inside the office with a man he wasntsure was sane james trudged into his apartment at half past five feeling completely and utterly exhausted alastor moody had made it completely clear that the elite program wasntgoing to be a bunch of laughs after having a strict interview with james which he was sure lasted almost three hours in itself moody had decided that he needed to personally see where james skill level was at needless to say he had spent the rest of the day despite a fifteen minute lunch break and two five minute bathroom breaks having spell upon spell being thrown at him he was physically and mentally exhausted he was almost angry that the ministry had first introduced him to alice it was as if they were just taunting him saying here how nice we can be too bad for you james sighed as he looked around his flat he needed to see lily before he could leave to apparate he saw sirius sprawled out on the floor in the living room you alright james asked peering over at sirius sirius nodded his head yes just got back from training an hour or so ago bloody ruthless that longbottom is put him and his wife together and they re bloody i dontknow they look so young and friendly but they re so skilled and i just beat we had so much training today four hours at least james would have liked to retort something along the lines of only four hours with sane people but he knew that the regular auror academy was no picnic and it wasntfair to pull sirius effort down just because he had more to endure sirius looked up at him from where he was sprawled almost motionless i imagine you had a hell of a day you look terrible are you going to lily like that sirius said james groaned he had planned on going to lily right then but when he looked at himself he realized he need to shower get a change of clothes and do the best he could to manage his hair no i going to get a quick shower do you want to come for dinner i sure she d love to see you james offered sirius nodded jumping up from his previous comatose state and patted his stomach i could use some food and i haventseen those two in a while james grinned to himself as he headed to his room and bathroom sirius and charlotte had something going on if only he could get them to admit it james and sirius once in clean muggle clothes ventured to lily and charlotte flat and knocked on the door lily greeted them beaming and letting james pull his arms around to give her a long kiss sirius just shook his head and walked towards the kitchen in hopes of finding charlotte so how was training lily asked him james sighed but was able to manage a grin it started out so nicely i met with alice longbottom and i thought maybe she d be my trainer she is so nice and friendly you remember her from hogwarts lily nodded yes but she was alice stone then right oh my she and frank got married how cute lily exclaimed they were head boy and head girl their seventh year too james smiled yes she d like you to write her sometime catch up james watched lily as she nodded and then he continued and well that was nice and everything and then she drops me off at this other office and tells me she and frank are leading the regular auror academy and that my trainer is inside the office lily gasped before ushering james to the sitting room and motioning him to sit down beside her well my trainer is this completely insane old auror very respectable my dad speaks most highly of him but he mad his name is alastor moody but he got this eye it electric blue and swivels around and i think it can see through things his nickname is mad eye but i dontthink i ll ever be able to call him that he was so brutal lily smiled sympathetically and put her small hand through james hair affectionately but he probably one of the best i sure it ll be alright and if your dad respects him he must be absolutely brilliant james nodded before laying back on the couch yes i suppose you re right but he going to kill me if we keep going on like this james then grinned at her tomorrow we go over charms maybe it wontbe so bad lily smiled back at him it ll get better training is going to take some getting used to that all think of it as conditioning for quidditch the smile on james face widened this was why he loved lily evans james leaned in and kissed her letting his hand touch her face softly lily responded and let her hand pull on his arm urging him closer james moved towards her and began to kiss her more feverishly and allowed his hands to caress her sides sirius and charlotte then appeared in the sitting room grinning at each other they watched them for a second preparing to make the most out of an embarrassing situation sirius turned to charlotte so charlotte i d say it a little hot in here he said in a loud obnoxious voice charlotte giggled as they watched james scramble off top of lily and lily sat back on the sofa her face turning a bright red james cleared his throat so is dinner ready lily stood up and brushed off her skirt yes it is we better eat before it gets too cold lily smiled at james pork chops james jumped up happily and followed her into the kitchen well if it is cold we know just the two people that could warm it up sirius exclaimed behind them smirking as the back of james neck turned red as pulled lily hand into his pretending not to hear his best friend those two are so cute charlotte exclaimed smiling sirius nodded yes well they should be it took forever to get those two together charlotte grinned at him showing her perfect white teeth sirius smiled back at her and put his arm around her waist the food is calling he stated grinning charlotte nodded as they walked into the kitchen together special thanks to anonymously morgan scooter5710 xanthia sharp tongued glowing ice

if you d like to read and review and leave your answer in the review that would be delightful well enjoy chapter eight the first meeting lily entered her flat on the last day of july with the usual dizzying feeling she got after spending an evening with james it was the day before she would begin her job and she had been a complete nervous wreck james being the caring loving fianc he was had invited her out for dinner when he had come home from his third day of training he had been completely exhausted but he had found the energy to be there for lily when she needed him and lily was still smiling from the butterflies in her stomach the night had produced she let a yawn escape her mouth as she looked around her flat charlotte was away at a convention in germany something about getting the german wizards to cooperate with the french ones and so far it wasntfaring well lily almost felt relieved that she had chosen law over diplomatic work the stories charlotte came home with were enough to make lily glad she only spoke one language fluently yes magical law was sure to be an exciting and promising experience and with these hopeful thoughts in her head lily was able to get to sleep quite easily the next morning lily awoke to her alarm clock and she scrambled out of bed to find her shower her nerves for the morning had returned and she was delighted to find an owl from james by the time she had made herself a bowl of porridge she was having trouble getting the lumpy hot cereal down as it was my lily good morning sunshine i know you are already up you probably got up an hour in advance just to make sure you wouldntoversleep dontworry lily you ll be great because you are the most talented witch that the ministry has ever laid eyes on and you re beautiful too so if

do fine i love you your james p s i want to see you tonight so write me when you get off lily smiled as she read the letter and then placed it on the counter she took a deep breath and relaxed james was absolutely wonderful nerves subsided lily ate and finished preparing for her first day as an intern lily walked the halls of the ministry of magic was pure fascination she had never been in the place with the wizarding world government took place and it utterly excited her it was a few minutes before eight the time she was to meet with her mentor she found the office her letter had guided her to and held her breath watching the clock with anticipation as it ticked closer to eight her clock watching was cut short by a small tap on her shoulder lily jumped in surprise and turned to see a young man facing her smiling nervously he smiled at lily awkwardness and then he extended his hand hello my name is owen scruggs are you a new intern he asked lily nodded was this her mentor he certainly didntlook old enough he couldnthave been but a few years older than herself he was tall had neat short dark brown hair a thin somewhat handsome face with piercing blue eyes he smiled kindly i thought so you certainly look new are you just out of school lily nodded shyly yes i just graduated from hogwarts in june you must be brilliant then if bones wanted you he replied lily raised her eyebrow and then looked down at her watch it was a minute past eight lily inwardly cursed this man who had faltered her punctuality she turned from him and knocked on the door she heard a woman voice allow her to enter and lily walked in a woman who couldnthave been over thirty five smiled politely at her she had short dark hair and thick eyebrows she appeared to be a kind woman and the peculiar monocle she had placed over her right eye gave her a wise expression please take a seat miss evans she addressed lily lily smiled and then sat down in a chair in front of the woman desk the woman took the seat behind the desk and was about to say something when a knock came to the door come in she said in a even yet polite tone the young man lily had met in the corridor entered grinning shyly madam bones i have the papers you wanted on the carrows he said focusing on madam bones and handing her a file of papers he backed out of the office in a quick manner and madam bones turned back to lily owen scruggs he a senior intern for me he rather brilliant i prefer him than any other to do my paperwork he always very careful lily nodded and was keenly aware that she hadntactually said a word yet to madam bones and wondering when the appropriate time would be to get a word in so you re miss evans albus speaks most highly of you i am expecting great things amelia started while going through a file on her desk lily tried to peer over to get a look but it was snapped shut almost immediately as madam bones began to talk according to your references you should be absolutely brilliant you will be expected to do background research for trials you will be expected to attend trials and you are to help me with any interview or other task i may need assistance with the main object of your training as a junior intern will be to learn how the system works what to do in certain situations and how to prosecute and defend she looked lily over for a second and lily impulsively smiled when i see that you are ready you will be promoted to a senior intern they do more work on their own and get more involved with the more dangerous cases then you will take the steps to become a full time criminal lawyer once there your opportunities are endless lily nodded that all sounds very well madam bones she finally said glad she had thought of at least one thing to say madam bones nodded i ll expect you to work monday through friday nine to five unless i need you to come in earlier stay later or i may need to call you in for an important task on a weekend do you agree to these terms lily nodded again yes i do alright then i ll give you a tour of the office and the lobby and then i ll show you your desk right now i d just like you to go over the files of cases i working on at the moment so you know what we re working with then i ll get you to organize some data for me she continued with a sharp tone but some how lily didntfind her as threatening as some of her previous professors madam bones seemed likable and lily thought she could work with that lily love glad you could make it sirius exclaimed later that evening when lily arrived at their flat he opened his arms to her you deserve a hug you intern you lily laughed and then let sirius give her a gigantic bear hug where james lily asked sirius chuckled you both have such a one tracked mind is lily here yet padfoot where james after receiving a death glare from lily sirius just smiled he trying not to burn down the kitchen lily nodded with a grin i better go and help him yeah if we still want our flat that is personally i ve grown quite attached sirius replied sarcastically before checking his watch well i better be off see you two later before lily could ask sirius where he was going james appeared from the kitchen and to lily amusement wearing an apron lily began to laugh and james looked confused before looking down realizing what lily was laughing at his cheeks flushed slightly and he put his hands on his hips i didntwant to get my clothes dirty he exclaimed but his voice gave way to laughter and only joined lily s lily as soon as she could keep a straight face walked up to james and kissed his lips lightly you look handsome precious she said grinning james smiled and then pulled her into a deeper kiss you look beautiful too he motioned towards the kitchen now please may i ask you to dine with me and you can tell me all about your first day as an intern lily grinned and nodded yes but please take off that apron first james pouted but i thought the pink brought out the color of my eyes your eyes are hazel james lily commented before laughing as james followed her into the dining room that beside the point james stated throwing the apron on the kitchen counter before pulling out a seat for lily and then taking one for himself lily looked at the table it was covered with dishes of pot roast ham mashed potatoes steak and kidney pie green beans and broccoli heads with a dish of mustard on the side james did you make all this lily asked in amazement james grinned i helped the house elves at my mother when i got home from training i just wanted to make sure the food was edible lily laughed then why were you wearing the apron james pouted again i didntwant to risk getting my clothes dirty while setting up then looking to distract lily from the fact that he was wearing a pink apron he had borrowed from his mother and forgotten to take off pointed to the broccoli look i remembered you only ate broccoli heads and you dipped them in mustard lily turned her attention to the broccoli and then smiled i love you james james grinned well i love you too the two smiled and then shared the details of their days james listening first to lily first day as a junior intern and then filling lily in with the latest in his elite auror training the topic of conversation had then moved over to the order of the phoenix meeting which was to take place the next night will you be off training by then lily asked remembering that james had to train on saturdays as part of the elite program james nodded yes i ll be done by six want to get a butterbeer at the three broomsticks before we go to the hog head that place can be quite grungy lily smiled and raised an eyebrow sure but how do you know what the hog head looks like james shrugged sirius and i have been in there a few times peter and remus too it ll be the perfect place for a meeting it loud and there a back room lily nodded as butterflies entered her stomach and she knew james was just as excited working for the order to fight against voldemort was something they had longed to do all summer and now they d finally have the chance the two finished eating then ate cherry pie for dessert and then james kissed lily goodnight before she apparated back to her flat james still had to be up early in the morning for training after all and lily didntwant to keep him up too late james waited outside of the three broomsticks for lily it had been an exhausting day of training moody had seen to that and he was dying to see lily and to get a nice drink he had owled lily to tell her to meet him there at seven and as he checked his watch he realized that he had managed to be early five minutes later lily appeared beaming and looking as pretty as ever her hair was up in a loose bun with strands dangling by her face james loved it when she wore he hair like that it brought more attention to her beautiful eyes hello she said smiling and giving james a kiss james smiled back at her hi you look stunning could i buy you a drink lily raised her eyebrow playfully i dontknow i usually dontdrink with strangers not even real handsome ones james replied in the same relaxed manner well there always the exceptions lily stated putting her hand on her chin as she pretended to think hard as if straining for a memory like that bloke with the black mustache he was absolutely captivating james pouted i ll just have to sit here and grow a mustache then lily checked her watch well we donthave time for that i guess you can be an exception she grinned and kissed james again and grabbed on to his hand leading him to the pub forty five minutes later james and lily had two butterbeers each and madam rosmerta had insisted on them taking a pile of ham sandwiches complete with a side of chips madam rosmerta sure does like you lily commented as she patted her stomach lightly as she and james made their way down the street walking towards the hog head james held on to her hand and grinned no she likes you she never gave me such treatment until i started dating you a free butterbeer now and then but never ham sandwiches so that why you ve dated me for so long free ham sandwiches lily teased well it an added bonus james replied smiling all the same they followed the streets and james guided them to the hog head a place lily could safely say she had never ventured to her entire hogwarts career if only because she had not the desire when they first walked into the stranger less popular pub of hogsmeade lily immediate reaction was to grasp on to james for some sort of protection that and to hold her nose it had a dirty old mildew smell about the place and the customers of the hog head were far grungier from anything generally allowed within the proximity of the three broomsticks james seemed to read lily mind what was dumbledore thinking having them meet in this place where all sorts of low lives could hear supposed vital confidential information it easy to blend in to hide and carry on with secret information in here it so loud and no one really pays any attention to you james commented as they walked through the bar room trying to find where they were supposed to meet lily wasntexactly sure what james meant about blending in she knew she and james stuck out looking young and wearing relatively clean clothes and people were noticing them she had seen creatures she had only read about in books staring at her in james and it was making her uneasy the bartender seemed to know them james at least as he beckoned them over to the bar james not letting go of lily walked swiftly to the bar the old man didntsay a word but looked both of them over before motioning towards a door in the back james nodded and followed to where the man had laid his eyes james gave a quick smile to lily before turning an old knob that belonged to an even older looking door which lily noticed you could barely see when in the bar they entered a room full of vacant chairs and tables towards the back of the room was a statue of a witch with one eye james thought the witch looked awfully familiar and walked towards it lily trailing behind him her mind racked with questions while james was filled with curiosity they reached the statue and a james smiled dumbledore is a clever man he stated lily looked at the statue there one like that in hogwarts she exclaimed as she recognized it but what is it doing here james pulled out his wand and lily watched him wha lily began to ask but james silenced her hold on to the statue he said smiling at dumbledore ingenious lily looked at him with eyebrows raised but did as he said dissendium james said with his voice only slightly above a whisper one hand holding on to his wand with the other holding on to lily a jerk was felt in james and lily stomachs as their world went black lily who had never used a portkey was not used to the tugging sensation at her belly button but was clever enough to guess what it was and where it was taking her she and james appeared at a classroom door it was one on the third floor that was usually unused lily smiled at james you re explaining this to me as soon as this is over james nodded and then opened the door for her before quickly following behind her the room was full of wizards and witches sitting in chairs standing by the walls with heads together talking most heads managed to turn to the door as lily and james walked in however and lily found her cheeks tinged with pink due to the attention brought to herself and james yet another time that evening the chatter almost immediately resumed once james waved and the people staring found it necessary to turn back to their conversations it was rude to stare after all lily saw emmeline vance grace and remus standing in the corner looking slightly out of place and unsure of what to do she pulled james over to the obviously new members hey lily greeted smiling and then looking back at the crowd of people before turning back to the three people standing in front of her and the one standing beside her hi remus smiled haventseen you in a while lily and james i glad you remembered the password grace and i happened to run in to emmeline here so we were able to get in i hope peter remembers james chuckled i knew the days of us sneaking around this castle would pay off lily sighed so is this the first meeting you all have been to emmeline spoke up yes i just replied to the invitation after getting my results her tone was even but she spoke rather quickly as if she was anxious grace then nodded as she joined the conversation lily found that she didntspeak much and she wondered how the relationship between her and remus faired hopefully better than his and ellie had it ours too i so nervous we re basically signing up for the war effort we re putting our lives at stake for the better of something it nerve racking yet thrilling all the same james commented as he put an arm around lily waist and smiled their attention was soon turned to the door as sirius and peter came bounding in bloody idiot how bloody thick are you we ve used that password for years sirius exclaimed as they walked through to peter who appeared to have forgotten the password to the statue the two also seemed to not realize that all eyes were on themselves sirius straightened up once he noticed the attention they were receiving and tapped peter who was mumbling his useless excuses sirius just gave a charming smile and waved whereas peter gulped and shifted nervously good evening mr black mr pettigrew professor dumbledore stated in his usual calm and steady tone that could call attention to crowds with a simple word his eyes were twinkling characteristically through his half moon spectacles he smiled at the crowd now that everyone here we may begin lily eyebrows shot up and she looked at james who looked around the room making sure he hadntmissed anyone and she wondered if he was thinking the same thing she was where were jacob and allison thanks to sappy1990 dreamergirl86 glowing ice scooter5910 myzteek ktsweep08 anonymously morgan chikichiki forest unicorn kaean jude harrison maraudergirl87 zippy wings and sharp tongued and of course my wonderful beta hcgolfinfool by the way i thought about what you said about changing it from madam rosmerta to someone else as you think she too young well i ve always thought that too but in book 3 she talks about how she used to always see sirius and james the number of times i had them in here she just makes it sound like she was older than they were although she couldnthave been that much older i mean ron fancied her i ve never really understood her age but i used her in the tragic flaw so i kept her thanks for your input though a n alright once again sorry for the wait but you all already know that i busy lol for the last poll what fanfics do you hate reading a few reviewers said they didntlike reading fanfics where lily was originally dating remus i dontcare for those much either but i really dontlike the ones where she dates sirius i dontknow i just think james has been in love with her for a long time and that his friends wouldntdo that to him and plus i dontreally think lily would ever have dated sirius he more of a brother anyways the next poll question which muppet or loony tunes character do you like most and why i love the muppets and loony tunes and my beta does too ok so read and review chapter nine a bone to pick the meeting lasted an hour after professor dumbledore had taken roll of who was present he introduced the newest members of the order to older ones he explained the order of the phoenix had been functioning for six months as voldemort power and support had begun to increase at a rapid rate and it became clearer that the ministry of magic wasnthandling the situation with the most responsibility professor dumbledore then went over how secretive the order was before explaining that there were smaller groups with in the order with different tasks based on their standing in the magical world and what they could do for the war effort they all contributed they all had one common goal to defeat voldemort and his death eaters one of the older members a man by the name of fenwick was called to the front of the classroom and professor dumbledore took a seat next to professor mcgonagall benjy fenwick smiled nervously around at the people in the room and then turned to the paper in his hands he was a middle aged man of small stature he wore old eccentric robes and a bright purple pointed hat lily thought he looked quite silly but all the more agreeable his voice was quite deep from what she was expecting however as he began to talk loudly he who must not be named has struck again this week we believe john riggs from the unspeakable department was put under the imperious curse two muggles have been brutally killed within london apparently by the slow painful death of the cruciatius curse lily squeezed james hand as he continued to read out what appeared to be news james looked down at lily and smiled weakly at first james had felt sorry and perturbed as voldemort latest evil doings were read aloud those poor people they didntdeserve what was given to them james sorrow soon bubbled over to anger however how was it that a man could be so evil and get away with everything how was it that the ministry could be so ignorant of what was going on how could they be so careless blood rushed to his cheeks as he concentrated harder on fenwick words and soon his anger subsided slightly and he was left with determination he bit his tongue to keep from making an outburst he knew he would have to control himself this was his first meeting after all fenwick smiled once more after finishing the headlines and hurried back over to his seat professor dumbledore then got up to again and asked certain people to stay behind and others to please turn in various reports they had been working on he then adjourned the meeting and everyone stood up either heading for dumbledore or heading for the door james lily sirius remus grace emmeline and peter being new didntknow quite what to do or what to make of the situation before them james suddenly burst into an energetic rant soon accompanied by sirius lily listened to james angry words touched his shoulder softly then added to what he was saying grace sirius emmeline and peter soon felt inclined to add to the heated conversation when i get my hands on one of those death eaters sirius started before making a violent hand motion i cantwait to be given an assignment james added vengefully to get out there and show voldemort there are people who will stick up to him remus nodded thoughtfully it will probably be a while before we get put out on difficult tasks i mean we just graduated and are new members you think so peter asked desperately to sirius he almost sounded hopeful he then shot him a quick glare and continued describing the one hundred ways he d like to torture and kill a death eater particularly anyone that was related to him much to the disgust of his group of friends lily was about to say something when she felt a tap on her shoulder she turned to see professor mcgonagall standing behind her chair smiling slightly but with her usual severe manner i believe we have something to discuss lily she stated lily thought for a moment and then nodded with a friendly smile yes we do she then followed mcgonagall to a deserted corner of the classroom she smiled nervously this was the first conversation she had with one of her professors after leaving school and she wasntquite sure how to act how has your summer been lily mcgonagall asked lily smiled great i ve gotten my own flat and am working for the ministry professor mcgonagall nodded with a slight smile and you ve got a birthday coming up if i remember correctly lily nodded almost astonished that the transfiguration teacher knew she was used to professor dumbledore and his mysterious ways but she certainly had never paid attention to the curious side of professor mcgonagall yes the eleventh right mcgonagall nodded lily smiled and wringed her hands behind her back as she waited for the professor to say anything now that you re working for the ministry and the order i was hoping you d be interested in continuing your lessons i believe you have great potential lily bobbed her head excitedly yes professor i d be delighted that is if you dontmind working with me surely you have better things to do professor mcgonagall smiled no lily i believe that training you will be a great use of my time great things are expected of you after all you and james both lily smiled sheepishly well when would you like to meet thursday night at eight my classroom i take it you know how to get there from the outside by now she said lily smiled and nodded yes but i wouldnthave if james hadntbeen with me professor mcgonagall smiled again i would have been severely disappointed if james hadntfigured it out the number of times i caught him and sirius there your second year her voice was lost in reminiscence and she smiled before excusing herself lily walked back over to where james stood in a slight daze over a side of mcgonagall she had never seen before james was talking to a man lily thought she may have seen before he was middle aged and was holding out his wallet with many pictures pointing out chubby smiling faces to james this is clara she a year and a half now he said excitedly as lily approached james smiled and looked at the baby girl giggling in the picture and bobbing her head full of curls in delight she adorable james stated feeling lily at his side he introduced her edgar this is lily evans my girlfriend lily this is edgar bones he works in the auror department james introduced lily eyes brightened as she took his extended hand it a pleasure to meet you edgar smiled kindly at her and nodded with enthusiasm i believe i ve heard your name before lily perhaps you work in the ministry lily nodded yes sir i interning in the international magical office of law edgar bones seemed impressed really do you know my sister amelia bones then realization passed over lily maybe this was why he looked so familiar yes actually she replied with excitement forgive me for not realizing the relation i her intern james grinned at lily and edgar as they talked ah you re going to learn plenty then and dontworry amelia may seem stern but she a real sweetheart lily smiled she does seem to be a nice lady before edgar could reply his watch went off he checked it frantically oh i better be off it quarter to ten and the family needs me he gave one more smile shook both their hands and was off are you ready to go james asked lily as he studied her she looked tired and worried with small bags appearing under her eyes and a smile he could tell was only half hearted she nodded and james smiled alright then let just say goodbye to everyone and we ll be off are you feeling alright james asked lily as they walked into her flat lily let out a sigh as she slipped off her shoes and turned to james yeah i okay james frowned you know i dontbelieve that i going to go start some tea and you re going to tell me what on your mind lily gave him a small grin and kissed his cheek before heading to the sitting room charlotte had a hamper of dirty clothes waiting to be sent to the wash and lily knew she must already be in bed james appeared a few minutes later with two mugs of steaming tea and a plate of biscuits he placed them on the coffee table and sat down beside her lily took one of the mugs and sipped does it taste alright james asked calmly lily grinned up at him his eyes were full of care concern and love yes if you had messed up tea i really might have to be worried she teased i would be worried too james grinned so is this about allison and jacob he started lily eyes opened a little wider and she nodded i just dontknow why they wouldntbe there lily said as she looked down into her tea do they not care she felt james hand caress her arm lily sometimes people are scared i sure allison and jacob have their reasons lily looked up at him her green eyes staring into his hazel ones i just thought i knew her well enough i thought she was the kind of person to stand up to voldemort and wouldntshe tell me if she wasntgoing to accept honestly she one of my oldest and dearest friends donti deserve an explanation james leaned and hugged lily as her cheeks began to flush with anger and tears began trickling down her cheeks she probably didntknow what to say lily i mean she sees you doing such big and great things she may feel a little i dontknow like she doesntdeserve to be in the order or maybe she still making up her mind it takes some people longer than other to make decisions but even peter has decided to join lily exclaimed with exasperation as she pulled away from james i dontmean to offend you or any of your friends james but honestly he had to scrape by surely if she knew peter joined she could realize she could too james shrugged i dontknow what to tell you lily you re just going to have to ask her yourself lily nodded as she put her tea on the table in front of them i suppose you re right she smiled weakly at james i sorry for being like this she then scooted closer to james and put her arms around him laying her head on his chest james put comforting arms around her and just stroked her deep red hair it alright lily it okay to be upset james said in a soothing tone he kissed the top of her head and lily took in the scent of him and the warmth of being so close lily awoke the next morning in james arms she was lying completely on top of him and she smiled slightly as she lifted her head and looked down at him sleeping there was a slight smile on his face and his glasses were tilted to the side her movement startled james into consciousness and he smiled at lily looking at him good morning lily he said quietly lily grinned and kissed the top of his head morning james turned his head and looked out the window the sun was just coming up and an orange glow melted through the white curtains lily james said finally yes could you move your legs slightly they re sort of in a very sensitive spot james said lily blushed as she noticed the painful expression he was trying to hide under a smile oh lily exclaimed as she jumped up sorry lily apologized turning a deep scarlet shade james laughed as he sat up she was so cute when she was embarrassed it alright he said as he pulled her into an embrace he leant in to kiss her but lily darted away morning breath she exclaimed james pouted i canthelp it if my breath stinks lily laughed it not you it me that the excuse they always give james smiled at lily words lily laughed again as she headed towards the kitchen ready to make breakfast for herself and james what would you like to eat lily asked french toast james exclaimed immediately before making his way to the bathroom lily fumbled through the kitchen and searched for a recipe book for french toast finally founding a muggle recipe she set out the ingredients and began to cook james returned started some tea and continually asked lily if she wanted any help unable to insist that she had everything under control after the fourth time lily set him to frying bacon it was only when charlotte clad in her white nightdress and looking completely worn out that it dawned on both lily and james what it probably looked like cooking breakfast together lovingly early in the morning good morning charlotte greeted with a slight smile as she glanced at the pair james was trying to look as innocent as possible and lily was blushing furiously morning cousin james replied with ease and a wide grin care for some french toast charlotte nodded and tension subsided james was able to bring ease to lily like no other person and she smiled as she sliced more pieces of french bread to put on the pan charlotte grinned at them both shook her head and grabbed the dailey prophet before taking a seat at the bar and beginning to read after a few moments she looked up hey isntallison prewett a friend of yours she asked lightly lily face immediately tensed yes why has there been an attack charlotte shook her head and smiled oh no no she has an article in the paper i forgot she wrote for the prophet she got an article on the front page lily asked intently charlotte shook her head so that her sleek black hair fell loosely from her ponytail no fourth but it sort of interesting lily reached for the paper may i see charlotte nodded yes but only because you re fixing my breakfast lily slapped her forehead i forgot to flip the toast she ran to the frying pan frantically only to see the golden side of the toast facing her and the sound of sizzling batter cooking in the pan james grinned at her well someone has to take charge when you get distracted honestly james grinned foolishly and lily punched him lightly before he reached for her and planted his lips on top of hers lily opened her mouth to receive him and couldnthelp grinning into him see my morning breath isntthat bad james said when they broke apart lily just laughed as she scanned the paper for allison article death eaters just how many are there by allison prewett in the light of what is happening many questions are popping into the heads of witches and wizards globally just how many death eaters are there how much support does he who must not be named have is it exaggerated many magical law enforcers are finding many the squib who cried werewolf scenarios the same people keep calling in with death eater attacks this has led many to believe that there is a significant less amount of death eaters circulating barty crouch a top ministry official is quoted in saying there cantpossibly be that much support we would know about it the constant frantic owls from ditzy witches and wizards whenever a cat jumps into their trash bins have simply over exaggerated the situation so people please use your sense the ministry would like everyone to know that they know approximately how many death eaters are out there and to not fret james watched lily as she read the article her facial expression went from one of excitement to one of curiosity to one of puzzlement and then finally her eyebrows were furrowed and her cheeks were tinged with red james knew that face she was angry what the matter he asked calmly as he put the now done toast on a plate allison article is completely nutters lily exclaimed in anguish as she looked up at james did she even know her friend anymore that didntsound like the allison prewett she knew at all i ve got to see allison i ll owl her right now she started to make her way to her room when james stopped her and pulled her into a tight hug lily wait let eat you can calm down and then you can write you may say something you ll regret just wait a few minutes lily looked up at james to see his dazzling hazel eyes full of concern and she smiled slightly all right i ll eat james smiled gratefully as he and lily walked back to the kitchen to see charlotte already eating lily then ate as quickly as possible while still being polite she dabbed her mouth with her napkin and then hurried to her room to write allison a note she was going to get some sense into allison if it was the last thing she did much thanks to reviewers
