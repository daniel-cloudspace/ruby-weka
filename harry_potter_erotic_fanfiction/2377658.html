 hp life after hogwarts chapter 11 the deal hermione found that dani wasntin the mood to sleep so she got her settled in her baby sling let her happily gum on the teether while her sisters settled back to dreamland looks like our dani wishes to stay with us for the time being she smiled at harry looks to me like she wants to cuddle with her mum harry glanced over at her and grinned as he double checked on ally and mia before they left the nursery harry about what i said earlier she started to apologize but he leaned over and kissed her silent i stressed out over this latest situation that we have to deal with i never left the manor i just decided to brood in the shadows for a while so i heard everything that you told mum he growled softly against her mouth kissing her again dani was being squished and wasnthappy about it no squish dani harry grinned down at their daughter and then bent down to kiss her on the nose sorry munchkin daddy just loves kissing your mummy and mummy loves it when your daddy kisses her hermione sighed happily kay buts no squish dani dani gave them both a look got it munchkin no squishing princess dani harry chuckled you re right she does have some of me in her doesntshe hermione smirked as they walked down the staircase yes sweetheart she has an ample part of each of us harry nodded daddy and the others are in the study dromi was sitting on the sofa in the common room and henry was setting up a projector screen you two okay now henry arched a brow at the two of them yeah we re back on track now harry nodded that good wills is in the kitchen getting snacks we re gonna watch home movies henry went back to setting up the hd projector and hooking that up with the dvd player where rory rory getting tended to by mum and gran dromi cuddled mage and ginger on her lap crooks and pepper were curled on their pillow by the fire and the pups were snoozing on the luvsac are you sure that it a good idea to sit and watch home movies relax ducky it was her idea wills came back in with a tray loaded with snacks she doesntmind that she cantsee the screen because she already seen it before he set the tray down on the coffee table the two of you are wanted in the study so i will take this little munchkin and watch her while you face the lions in your den wills was dying to cuddle one of the girls for a while she a might grouchy tonight because she cutting her first tooth so i dontreally know if she wants to leave me or not hermione didntwant to hurt wills feelings but she didntwish to be away from her daughter either she partial to her mum at the moment that why she in the sling harry also didntwish to hurt his feelings either dani recognized her uncle by his smile and gentle blue eyes but she still wanted her mummy want mama she stared up at him all the while gumming on the teether did you just hear that wills stared at henry and dromi then down at dani she wants her mummy henry nodded she wants hermione and no one else right now like i said it the reason why she in the sling harry smirked that a new one usually she only chats like that with harry and hermione dromi was sorting through a stack of dvd s well our dani is always trying to out do herself and her father hermione cooed down at her daughter arentyou munchkin i promise that you ll be able to watch them while you re on leave but right now her sisters are settled in the nursery and dani wants her mama harry placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder he can watch them on the screen rory was standing in the archway it a good thing that i know this place by heart there was no way that i was gonna be stuck in bed for the rest of the evening so i left mum and gran while they were in the sitting room discussing next weekend you excelled in the training when we had to do things blindfolded so i ve no doubt that you ll be able to go about your day as usual harry walked over and hugged his sister yes well i didntknow that it was gonna come in handy someday she hugged him back you really do need to learn when to not take things so literally hermione is new at this parenting thing and so are you so try to give each other a little slack okay yeah okay i ll try and work on that but now that your sight impaired you have to learn to rely on others to help you harry lectured right back at her touch baby brat i ll work on that she grinned your presence is requested in the study stephen growled from behind them harry could tell that his gramps wasnttoo pleased about his strategy to deal with the asian dark wizards he had this you aren t going to convince me look in his cool violet blue eyes you have to be nice to us hermione has dani harry pointed to the nine week old in the sling that was settled across hermione chest let them watch dani while we have our chat you must have missed what she said a minute ago she wants her mummy right now wills walked over to where rory stephen and harry were standing dani is nine weeks old she canttalk yet try another more believable excuse stephen narrowed his eyes at him he means that she spoke her wishes in our minds not aloud like we re speaking now hermione walked over to join them she teething and she wants me so the three of us are a package deal like i said we have dani so you have to be nice to us harry smirked i heard her now let go stephen grumbled enjoy the home movies harry put his arm around hermione and led her out of the room but not before addressing the others we have to listen while they use civilized words to tell us how insane our plan is oh dontworry baby brother we plan to enjoy catching up on what we ve missed wills grinned harry calmly walked into the study sat down on the couch and settled hermione in his arms we re ready to hear your reasons why you dontthink our plan will work but seeing as dani is currently attached to hermione you have to be nice to us son it not like you to use innocents as a shield so why start now with your daughter james frowned she not a shield dad harry narrowed his eyes at his father dani wishes to be with her mum it as simple as that your plan is insanity times ten we do not hire assassins and place them on a monthly retainer it just not done assassins are dark wizards and should be treated as such i see no reason why that should change stephen sat down across from them my plan is brilliant they didntchoose sides during the voldemort conflict and remained neutral they only perform dark deeds when someone comes up with the fee that they demand for their services if we provide said fee for them on a monthly basis then none of our at large dark wizards witches or deatheaters can hire them to come after us it is just simple logic they dontwish to tangle with harry or any of you and this is a way for them to avoid that hermione spelled out her plan for them kitten it a bit more complex than that i ve tangled with one who was sent after uncle albus and they arentnice by any means of the word i seriously doubt if they re law abiding citizens either i do know that when defeated they will take their own lives xian rai was a formidable opponent he didntlike being bested and used the same device on me it didntreally hinder my fighting seeing as i good at fighting with my eyes blindfolded and i bested him i was about to stun him and drag him off to headquarters but he took out his sword and ran himself through instead the strange thing was that there wasntall that much blood his body turned into lightning like energy and then he was just gone james was pacing in front of the fireplace i with dad hiring these blokes really isnta good idea the time for assassins has ended it is a different era now so hermione idea does have some merit to it if you try to take them into custody you would be sending countless aurors to certain doom where as many of them are ordinary wizards one is not chen finally spoke merlin appeared in the study and sat down next to harry there is no way i going to miss this he locked eyes with chen go on old friend it not like you have any choice anymore i am aware of that merlin chen eyes narrowed to slits as he growled at him there is no need for you to gloat look at it this way you have done what most of us never achieved you managed to live among them without any incidents your generations are just as grand as mine are only one of mine took the dark path but then that was a mistake brought on by morgana evil scheme it just that one of yours craved power more than he did his heritage and turned it into a profitable business for a few generations merlin knew that chen would rather sacrifice a limb than admit that he had failed with some of his clan there is hope for his son even if it wasntso for his father xian betrayed all that he was by becoming what i despised i shed no tears that he ended his life fighting who was at the time my finest student kane may be able to change his ways but the others will not chen sighed even kane will not like being leashed but he has honor and will not break the code of honor that he cherishes more than his own life now wait just a minute are you saying that you re harry stared at chen in disbelief and then at merlin who nodded all of this time when you ve growled about his ancient ancestor raden it been him all along unreal no wonder you have endless energy endless knowledge did you honestly think that i would allow just anyone to train you regardless of stephen wishes or even your father s he only trains a handful of students every generation and only those that he has watched as they have grown merlin conjured a plushy unicorn for dani to cuddle our mission no matter how we may clash with one another is the same we both wish for magic and the traditions that go along with it be taught to those who show promise so that they can one day teach the next generation and so forth i ve always been taught to do as i ve been told and i ve carried that line of thinking with me during any kind of training with any of you i ve never sat down and thought about your reasons for training any of us harry was seeing two of his most respected mentors in a new light i humbled that you thought any of us worthy of such an honor you saw potential in all of our rule breaking and during draco dark times when most would ve just thought us rebels and him as the dark seed of his father i saw a leader who was doing everything that he could to survive and who was willing to risk or even sacrifice his life in order to make sure that his friends and the ones he loved were safe you have done so since you were eleven you protected hermione at the tender age of less than a year from who you knew instinctively was a bad person during a play date while your parents were distracted you showed promise from birth and never once did you disappoint any of us chen perched himself on the edge of the sofa and looked at the two of them hermione was also very gifted and once you were reunited with her there was nothing that you couldntaccomplish she gave you the confidence or guidance that you needed where as ronald provided the balance between the two of you draco has never been happy and was always in fear of what his father would do to him if he did not fall in line he did not mind the spoils of being a malfoy but he did mind the consequences ginny helped things along as well after his father died and he saw how his mother truly felt about him a part of him knew that there had to be something better and took a leap of faith the result of all of this is who all of you are today i honored that you had all that confidence in us because half the time we were just barely getting out of our dodgy situations by our skins harry couldntbelieve what he was hearing he had a flash of memory where when he was very small in a playpen with hermione and making a bad man with silver hair and grey eyes fly back on his rump and that was just with a wave of his pudgy little fist he had scared hermione and it had angered him a lot the man was lucius malfoy by the way i shook my tiny fist at him for scaring hermione and that sent him flying several feet onto his arse dad was there almost instantly but there was a loud bang noise and lucius was gone harry explained what he remembered to them he was trying to take you away i didntwish it to happen so i started crying to get everyone to come hermione also remembered that day when they were little i was nearly two so i knew that he wasntsupposed to be there and that our parents would come when i started crying lucius was trying to kidnap harry and you both botched the plan just like a team even then james shook his head in astonishment i heard the sound of someone disapparating but i didntcatch who it was harry is mine and i didntwish to share him with another person let alone have some bad man take him away hermione growled i was older and had to protect him but he was more than capable of protecting the two of us and i always will be but a little back up never hurts harry kissed her on the top of her head your plan is viable and they are aware that your wealth has no bounds kane is the youngest of them but also the strongest therefore he leads and they follow i will send them the request by ancient traditional means and he will answer in no more than a day time it is time that the ancient one came out of seclusion and this is a good cause to sanction chen vanished from the room i ll be watching if you need me merlin vanished peace is worth any number of galleons harry locked eyes with both his father and then his grandfather yes but is that what they want and how long will a deal like this last stephen frowned if they falter i ll take them down myself with draco and logan as my backup either way peace is going to prevail you promised me that you wouldnttake any missions until the girls were older hermione tipped up her chin so that she could glare at him i expect you to keep that promise i intend to keep my promise but it a given that eventually i gonna have to go back to work and that means missions every once and a while just like you re gonna want to continue your healer training under lucy guidance harry reminded her the girls need me they come first before my career hermione countered coolly no one is saying otherwise sweetheart eventually we re gonna be able to have longer periods or certain days when either you or i can go to work while the other is watching the girls you know that way we share equally in the responsibility harry tamped down his frustration over this latest change of heart on hermione part we can easily raise our kids and continue on with our dreams it is possible you know time out you two you can discuss this again when the girls are a year and walking on their own james knew that their bantering was pointless so he decided to end their tiff for them before anyone said anything that they regretted for the second time that evening james is right the girls are two months old and neither of you need to get into this right now oh before i forget when you do return to active duty your dad and uncle sirius will be the new co heads of the uk auror division we moved that division and the hit wizard from the magical law enforcement squad stephen proudly announced james promotion we now have a separate police force to handle the minor cases of law breaking and turned the other into a more modern section of keeping the peace dad i only agreed to think about it i ll need to run it by lily first before i agree to anything james hadntwished for harry to know about this yet the last thing he wanted was to go rounds with his son it would have to be under mine and padfoot terms and our schedule revolves around our families you know on the other hand raising the girls would be just as rewarding there also my writing and being hbp will keep me busy harry wasntthe least bit thrilled that his father was gonna be his boss i can focus on my quidditch career as well i told you he wasntgonna go for this james glared at his father he has no say in the matter you and sirius are as qualified as maxwell and harley the council asked me to appoint two hit wizards to head up the uk aurora division i as minister of magic chose the two of you stephen ignored harry remarks on the matter as well as his glares not to be rude about this or anything but doesntthat make the two of them deskbound you re grounding them from active duty and making them figure heads are you not hermione arched a brow at stephen the two of them earned this promotion and it what the new division needs sirius and james were an unbeatable team and they accomplished more in a few years than many do in their entire careers stephen wasntpleased with either of their attitudes towards his decision to promote james yeah gramps we ve heard all about how dad and uncle sirius are legends and everything forgive me if i having some problems thinking of my father who is already able to order me about as my new boss harry voice just oozed with sarcasm there wouldntbe much downtime now would there seeing as we both live in sanctuary he changed his tune when he saw the way his father was glaring at him and added hastily it would just take some getting used to is all that i saying what harry is trying to say and blundering badly is that he has no doubt that both dad and uncle sirius are more than qualified for the position but he fears that they might take advantage of all that power over him hermione tried her best to defuse the situation before james and harry went rounds with each other thereby making his life a lot more challenging than he would like junior actually having to listen to me and follow my orders is one of the perks that make this promotion choice but i still have to talk to lily about it she ll no doubt give her approval after i fill her in on junior attitude towards the whole idea james walked over and glared down at his son i see dad point entirely now you really do need someone who can rein you in and make you obey the chain of command the council specifically requested two wizards who could check the new rookies if they go off on their own accord as has been one in particulars custom since arriving at hogwarts for his first year my response to them was who better than his uncle and my son his father stephen thought that harry attitude needed a little adjusting so he chose brutal honesty and let him know how the council was feeling towards him they unanimously agreed to my solution you see many are still feeling guilt over unjustly throwing sirius in azkaban and they see this as a way to make amends for that grievous error in judgment if that how they feel then the next time some omni powerful jerk rears its ugly head the council can tangle with it harry couldntbelieve the audacity of the council and tamped down the urge to go tell them where they could go in person in case any of them or you needs reminding then i ll go over my reasons for being such a rule breaker during my time in school i was being hunted by voldemort and was trying my damnedest to survive no you know what screw them and screw you i quit harry thought he was gonna have the last laugh but he was sorely mistaken i ll just focus on writing books raising my family being hbp and my quidditch career you cantquit son you really do need to read everything before signing your signature on anything this is our world version of the armed forces only it no retirement until you re unable to perform your duties james smirked when harry started to swear in parseltounge you are obviously in perfect mental and physical health i afraid that isntan option for you harry james do not swear in front of dani hermione glared up at him i told you that you needed to read the contract but no you were too psyched up after having passed your trials and signed them right there on the spot dada that not nice bad dada dani opened her eyes to glare up at her father well i ll be so she talking to everyone using her mind now stephen chuckled so it seems and this one knows what daddy is saying james was highly amused by this turn of events sorry princess but daddy felt cornered and forgot himself for a minute there harry apologized to his daughter and then decided that enough was enough the conversation was over here the deal and there is no negotiation i remain free until all three of my girls are walking potty trained and well into speaking their first sentences now if you ll excuse us hermione and i are gonna get something to eat that said they were gone at this rate it gonna be before the girls turn one and a half james conjured the two of them two shots of fire whiskey and handed one to his father uncle albus really wasntjoshing me when he said that harry was na ve in the customs by laws and the ways that we run our world stephen took the shot glass from his son evidently not but then he was trying to focus on staying alive and saving all of you from voldemort so we ll let that one slide james downed his drink i ll have to have anna rectify that she wants an excuse to spend more time with him stephen also downed his drink and then the two of them started to discuss a deal that would rectify the current situation with the wizards who were soon to arrive in answer to chen summons wills had just finished looking in on the girls when harry and hermione rejoined them in the common room so is everything alright now he looked over at them i just checked on the girls and they re still sleeping thanks big brother harry got hermione settled on the other couch you just relax here i gonna fix dani her bottle and get us some dinner he kissed hermione and then placed a kiss on dani head before leaving the room well they all looked over at hermione well what hermione yawned it had been a long day and she was tired what happened in the study henry rolled his eyes at her in exasperation c mon fess up inquiring minds wanna know oh that sorry canttell you about it you see it what is called need to know information seeing as dani was contently snoozing in her arms hermione closed her eyes and tried to relax katherine aurora was hurt i bloody well demand to know what to become of her attackers wills grumbled sorry my hands are tied this is wizarding world military business so i really canttell you anything she opened one eye to look at him what did you just say william brow furrowed even more and his eyes darkened to sapphire did you just say military oh honestly william you canttell me that after nearly two months at sandhurst that you still dontknow what chain of command is or need to know information the aurors hit wizards are our version of the military in fact once you sign your name on the contract you re basically theirs for a lifetime i mean that is until they deem you unable to do the job and then you can retire i would think that in rory case she d be allowed to retire as soon as you get out of the armed forces it only logical seeing as the two of you will have to focus on a royal wedding and the path that leads up to you both becoming king and queen of england she went back to trying to rest i read that on the contract but i thought it was just there to weed out the serious from the curious applicants rory found herself cuddled even closer by wills so did i but evidently our by laws and contracts only get overhauled every other century or so harry appeared beside hermione with a tray and set it down on the hassock yummy food hermione opened her eyes and smiled up at him i ll take her while you eat harry settled the sling around him so that she could eat some dinner thanks wolfe i famished anything for my princess harry blew her a kiss then looked down at dani still fast asleep now to fill all of you in on what i sure my angel wouldntdare divulge master chen is raden kane rai is his many great grandson and master chen only trains a handful of students every generation the plan is to pay them to not hurt people or break anymore wizarding laws if that doesntwork we do things the hard way master teacher is working on arranging a meeting with them now dad and uncle sirius are gonna head up the uk auror division i stuck in it for eternity the council sees me as too much of a loose cannon and dad and gramps are pretty much in complete agreement with them harry settled himself in one of the overstuffed recliners oh and hermione has decided to give up her dream of becoming a healer so that she can raise our kids i will focus on my career when they are walking potty trained and well into talking their first sentences hermione echoed his own declaration back at harry i still studying under mum grams and lucy so i can go for my certification then it a deal harry grinned that my mione she always keeps me on my toes mione you haventcalled her that since you were in diapers wills grinned oh really well in that case that what i ll call her from now on harry liked saying that more than he liked calling her by her full name it seemed more right somehow only my lion can call me that anyone else gets jinxed unless they happen to be toddlers and are learning how to speak hermione liked him calling her that it was as if they somehow had come full circle the monitor on the wall that was tuned into the nursery activated and alerted them that dani sisters were awake and fussing we ve got it wills and henry said at the same time i ve got three bottles already prepared so just bring them down here with all of us harry was beginning to feel drained and his injured limb was starting to sing at him by throbbing in pain the boys went off to see to their nieces you need your medicine and to get your arm treated dromi got up from the couch i kind of occupied at the moment so it gonna have to wait well you might be but i certainly am not you re not fooling me little brother i know that your arm is bothering you so just sit tight i will be right back dromi left the room to go get her healers bag and his medicine getting certified as a healer has really given dromi a power trip hasntit she just worried about you and you know it besides she mastered all of master chen healing techniques rory got up from the couch and within moments had dani still snoozing in her sling cuddled against her cuddling my niece is good medicine she went back to curl up on the couch love tant rory dani adored her aunt i get tooth i love you too munchkin yes i heard about your new tooth and i sorry that your mouth hurts rory cooed down at her she seems to like to chat now doesntshe she scolded harry in the study for swearing in parselmouth she told him that what he was saying wasntnice and then called him a bad dada hermione smirked she been quite the chatter box today dromi appeared next to the recliner that harry was sitting in take your potions like a good little brother and i ll give you an everlasting lolly she handed him various vials of potions to drink and he obediently drank them she produced an everlasting lolly for him and stuck it in his mouth there a good boy now lie still while i treat your arm you really are bossy you know that harry reluctantly tried to relax while she treated his arm will you relax i know what i doing dromi went about setting placing the needles on his wrist and arm little brother is a wuss when it comes to being treated when he gets hurt rory smirked i am not a wuss i just wary of needles but i trust my sister with my life so healing me with master teacher methods is he inhaled sharply when searing heat shot up his arm fine with me he gritted his teeth as the heat intensified even more what are you trying to do andromeda sear my lower arm off my body you tore the muscle this time so a different variety of herbs is needed in order to excel the healing in your arm dromi added another herb to the needles and that added more heat to the fire on his arm i was injured by a sore loser i didntcause this injury it was done deliberately to me i do not thrive on getting hurt harry closed his eyes and began to chant something under his breath anything to keep his mind off the searing heat occurring on his arm dada gots owie dani whimpered it okay princess daddy is getting his owie fixed just like your teether helped your teeth harry reassured his daughter tant romi make all better dani asked yes munchkin this will make your daddy all better but it takes time dromi smiled dani loves tant romi too dani liked her answer i love you too sweetie dromi adored her niece and it amazed her how much at two months that this little one understood hermione got up and went over to cuddle in harry lap its okay lion just focus on me and not on your arm she placed kisses all over his face i hungry dani whimpered and in less than a minute rory was holding the bottle in her hands now that what i call using your head henry had ally in his arms well do you really blame her wills had mia in his arms dromi is treating harry arm and hermione distracting harry i dontmind i love taking care of the girls rory was feeding dani her bottle ally and mia decided that it couldnthurt anything to bring their bottles to them so they followed dani lead they didnttry any of the other magic that dani did because their momma didntlike it when dani performed magic like that looks like these two are following their sister lead henry was also holding a bottle in his hand i think they know that this wontcause their mama to start panicking wills sat down next to rory so that he could feed mia her bottle the only thing that flusters my mione is when dani calls up a storm anything else is fine harry broke off the kiss so that he could talk with them that because it always ends up making her upset she doesntlike storms but her temper triggers them and she too young to control her magic hermione sighed so our other two have finally decided to spread their wings a bit have they well if it works for their sister then it good for them as well harry grinned i think they re wary of trying anything else because of how you reacted when dani did them i wasntready for her to do those things yet so my reaction was warranted hermione stuck her tongue at him nothing surprises you it like you expect them to do these things and it no big deal that not entirely true you telling the twins and hagrid that sure we ll take in fluffy surprised me i thought you were kidding when you told me but then i went outside and there he was downsized to about five feet high and wanting to play fetch harry playfully tweaked her on the nose he a big softy now that we know how to care for him and he a good guard dog he can sense visitors before they even arrive the pups adore him crooks and pepper like to nap on him and he doesntmind them or kids a bit hermione sang his praises i didntsee him out back wills frowned neither did i henry echoed that because mum dad and the twins adore him he resides comfortably on this gigantic pillow in their wing harry smirked i ll bring him in here if you want but he really is spoiled rotten now harry whistled for fluffy just think eight years ago you called him a thing or a monster and now you re saying he a couch potato henry chuckled fluffy came bounding into the common room his three heads were all awake and vying for instant attention eight years ago he was gigantic and grouchy now he smaller happy and well taken care of hermione called fluffy over to them come here big guy and i ll scratch your ears fluffy walked over and checked on his charges before going over and laying beside the recliner where fang is he with hagrid wills asked fang is with hagrid and olympe in france but they couldnttake fluffy with them so he ours now hermione scratched behind his ears and his foot happily thumped on the carpet yep he all ours harry laughed when fluffy licked him in the face all two hundred fifty pounds of him and he makes a really good baby watcher the twins are crawling everywhere now and he watches over them we haventgotten to that disk yet we have a whole disk of the twin antics with fluffy the pups and the cats rory settled dani back in the sling after burping her dromi shooed one of fluffy curious heads away from harry injured arm no you dontfluff this isntsomething you really want to sniff at harry narrowed his eyes when he felt a presence near the manor she carefully removed the needles and put them away i know that it wasntthat comfortable of a treatment but it really is good for your arm dromi misread his look as being upset with her fluffy went from playful to fierce in seconds and headed for the front doors crooks and pepper were awakened by something that they didntlike and went to investigate they also headed for the front doors the pups ears were flat and they were growling stay here harry got up from the recliner with hermione in his arms and then set her back down then in an instant he was in full auror attire harry what up with everyone dromi frowned why did you just suit up is there danger a foot wills frowned were you not expecting guests henry arched a brow at him i going with you hermione started to get up but harry was dead serious all of you stay here i mean it hermione stay put do as he says we have visitors to deal with james was standing in the archway also in full auror attire that we do a suited up stephen stood next to james we dontneed any of you under foot chen appeared next to him he no longer appeared frail nor was he a feeble old man he was now over six feet tall with flowing white hair and the same sea green eyes he was also as young looking as merlin and twice as lethal in his ancient wizarding attire under foot i not some defenseless woman hermione was not the least bit affected by this new version of master chen neither was rory and look what happened to her now all of you take the girls upstairs and stay there until we finish with our guests are they here now but master teachers summons was just sent a little bit ago hermione stared wide eyed at them master teacher is raden not some feeble old man and when the ancient one sends a summons they have no choice but to answer that summons with all do speed merlin was now standing on one side of harry this had better be good why the hell did the message say wear armor logan appeared in full auror attire oh bugger you sent the summons didntyou he saw that harry james and stephen were all suited up as well ginny is napping this had draco appeared also suited up for any situation and stopped in mid sentence no way ginny was right you really were raden all along he gaped at chen ginny saw me playing with lightning in front of a group of young ones during one of our days when lessons were over and we had time to spare hermione was castle bound at the time and by then had completed her lessons with me chen wasntsurprised that ginny had figured out his secret she was a very bright young lady dad what did you do send out the call to arms harry rolled his eyes at his father no but dad did he doesnttrust any of them and we dontknow how many are gonna answer that summons james growled what up sirius appeared geared up for battle are we going to war or something we re following through with junior and hermione plan it just a show of strength on our parts james felt good wearing the uniform again well then all of you civilians need to clear off sirius motioned to the others we ve got work to do i d like to have words with two of them rory growled i dontthink so all of you upstairs now james growled i going but only because i have to protect my babies hermione was not pleased with being treated like some helpless female she got up as did the others and left i thought she wanted to be a healer logan frowned she does but her and harry have always been a team and she isntloving being on the sidelines draco didntthink he would ever truly understand hermione fluffy barking was now down right fierce let focus on the situation and not on the mystery that is my wife harry stalked towards the front doors what with him tonight sirius frowned at james as they went after harry dad went all honest with him he knows how the council feels about his actions and about our promotion james sighed in frustration that and i kind of lost my temper with him and agreed with dad yeah that would do it sirius stared at fluffy in full guard mode he really miffed about something isnthe he doesntlike dark wizards logan and draco attempted to get fluffy away from the doors rad lady go guard hermione and the girls harry ordered the pups the pups raced up the stairs heel fluffy no one is going to harm anyone james got fluff under control good boy now sit over there so that we can open the doors fluffy sulkily obeyed his master and went to sit near the stairs he senses something familiar about them and it isnta happy memory either harry was now focused enough to understand why fluff was so upset something about a former owner everyone comes across their past eventually it inevitable in life merlin petted one of fluff massive heads dontyou fret about it boys you re our pups now and we aintabout to give you back to any former owner sirius patted another one of the heads damn right we aren t james conjured some fiery treats and tossed them at fluffy fluffy god i cantbelieve hagrid named him that hercules or titan yes but fluffy stephen was slowly running out of patience now that we ve reassured him can we please focus on the situation at hand that being our invited dark guests actually no big brother you can t but i can max appeared as did mac flamel i am minister of magic i happen to be your commander and chief you are minister of magic and this situation warrants extreme caution you are also king but you tend to forget that in your old age dontyou old man now go guard lily anna and the twins while we handle this max narrowed his eyes at stephen he does make a valid point grandpa you re much too important to risk on this situation i myself dontsee what uncle max is all riled up about harry sided with max besides it felt good to land a zinger on him for a change we re just gonna strike a deal with them not do battle you are the heir and just as important as he is the council would call for my head if anything happened to any of the royal family max was still sore over the fact that they intended to go through with this insane idea without him above all you and stephen are to be protected at all cost the young prince requested the meeting he has to stay stephen does not chen sensed that their guests were having a trying time even getting near sanctuary but the bickering was beginning to annoy him dad this is auror business you really do need to go but dontworry i ll fill you in with all the details james tried to keep from smirking when it looked like his father was going to blow his top at any minute fine i will let you handle this but remember i will be watching stephen vanished james turned to look at harry who was giving him a sheepish look and here you were all cheesed off because they didntcare about you anymore it seems to me that they want you kept in check for your own safety they worry too much harry shrugged his shoulders as if to say he really wasntworth all the worry all the time or that usually where he went trouble followed dontsweat it kid the council has had years of practice worrying about you and i doubt that it gonna change sirius smirked max didntyou send for lotus mac frowned yes mac i did but she currently on a mission tracking a high profile dark wizard and may not have received my summons yet dad arentlotus and rory really good friends you know how lotus reacts to someone hurting who she sees as family logan hissed in his father ear not to mention that a certain someone might not go for her full name i am well aware of that son but she is also well schooled on kane rai and his clan of assassins max growled lotus jun lei is one of my finest students and will arrive when she hears about katherine aurora injury and the young prince plan to make certain that it doesnthappen again chen was pleased that max had summoned lotus why master teacher i didntknow you cared a vision with eyes the color of jade a waist length silky mane of ebony black hair and exotic beauty walked out of the shadows greetings i am lotus jun lei chang it is an honor to meet all of you she bowed in respect to all of them and then focused on chen is aurora she will be fine lotus you may see her after we finish with the situation at hand chen stopped her from firing off a thousand questions about rory chang draco looked at the vision standing in the entryway i didntknow that cho had another sister harry had not been expecting this twist of fate i the eldest of three daughters i am nothing like cho she inherited some of the flaws in our gene pool lotus locked eyes with harry i see myself as trying to make up for everything that my ancestor caused so i focus on keeping the light in the world stronger than the dark no offence was intended i think ami is a wonderful girl so i just figure cho was tainted by morgana and leave it like that harry offered her his hand i harry by the way those two over there are i already know mac max master chen and logan i am also well aware who you draco your father and uncle are how could one not be of the wizarding world or friends with a princess of the royal family and not be aware of all of you lotus shook his hand and then turned her attention back to chen so this situation calls for the ancient one to be as he actually is are you certain that this insane idea is going to work kane and his followers might be neutral but they are mostly as dark as they come after the death of his father they took him from the gentle monks at the temple and raised him to be their leader he has no goodness or light left in him lotus wasntafraid to go toe to toe with chen the influence of your teachings no longer exists i am aware of that lotus but i will not allow them to continue on this path if peace is to truly flourish even they must fall in line the time of the light is now the dark times are over chen knew what he had to do and was not going to falter from his decision you still say this even if it means taking your only remaining grandson life or sentencing him to a lifetime at azkaban lotus locked eyes with him he all that you have left on this plain of existence can you truly do that he wonthave to harry now understood just what was at stake and was determined to make his plan work if he values his neck and i know he does all he has to do is draw a fee for doing nothing but obeying the rules now as for his minions after what they did to rory that completely up in the air aurora accepted the mission and was well aware of the risks mac was foolish to even think of invading their territory and should have known better aurora was a rookie and he was the seasoned professional his decision was jaded by his tendency for letting his eyes wander where they do not belong although i was not aware that it also included the opposite sex as well lotus narrowed her eyes at mac oi now that wasntnice chang i do not fancy men period rory sensed that they were in this huge compound so we went to investigate i know that i should ve thought better but rory such a natural at this that i thought it would be okay mac glared at lotus she is a rookie and it doesntmatter if she a natural dark wizard hunter or not you knew better and it went badly your bad judgment could have gotten either of you killed lotus was furious with him rory killed not bloody likely she too smart to let something like that happen we were fine except for the fact that i got curious about the gadget they tossed at our corner that when it went all badly she told me not to touch it and that when it blew up in our faces mac hated getting called out on the carpet by anyone let alone a fellow auror you can join us outside after you finish with your verbal sparing match harry opened the front doors and stepped outside he found that none of their guests had managed to outwit his security measures and were not yet on the property hmmm this is a might embarrassing i mean here i thought they would have at least managed the front gates by now he knew exactly where they were and called over to them did you honestly think that getting to my private sanctuary was going to be child play i mean really i spared no expense and took no chances when designing the security for my home not even the world greatest shadow warriors can bypass it harry walked up to the gates kane appeared on the other side of the front gates he was a mirror version of chen with jet black hair only there was a different aura about him and he had the audacity to wear a coat made from the hide of a yeti i impressed your highness though i had thought you would have noticed our presence as soon as we arrived he seemed highly amused oh that well we ve been trying to keep fluffy at bay and seeing as he happens to be a hellhound that isntreally an ease feat harry whistled and fluffy was instantly standing beside him titan kane arched a brow at him how did you happen upon your pet oh he used to belong to a member of the family but they moved to france so he all ours now we ve kind of downsized him a bit so that he can interact with everyone but he really is very much the same old fluffy i have to warn you though he really doesntfancy strangers harry patted fluff on one of his three heads where did your family member come across such an unusual beast kane found himself snarled at by three familiar menacing heads he got him from some greek chap that he met at a pub why so curious about my pet have you seen one before harry arched a brow at him it seems like fluff here thinks he seen you before you see i fresh out of flutes at the moment and even though we ve tamed his urges to tear people in half he still tends to hold grudges against people who have wronged him when i was a boy the temple that i lived in was guarded by a similar beast i was never harsh to him but my father friends were quite the opposite i certain that this cantbe the same creature after all what are the chances of that kane saw no reason to lie to harry and told him the truth james sirius max logan draco mac merlin lotus and chen joined them so i see that you chose not to have this meeting with me alone i brought along two of mine as well you will find that their misdeed did not go unpunished kahn shin do not hide in the shadows like cowards show yourselves he snarled the two in question appeared both had a patch on one of their eyes fluffy was not at all pleased to see them and was viciously snarling at them now harry conjured a dagger in his hand and used it to slice it across his palm pleased to make your acquaintance he held out his bloodied hand it the least i can do to you after what you did to my sister your sister should know better than to trespass where she does not belong khan growled my toy only temporarily blinds its victims when they are intelligent enough to know how to treat their eyes shin sneered you should have sent someone more experienced and not one of your crown jewels but it seems that intelligence in your hierarchy is sorely lacking kane eyes narrowed i am well aware of what happens when one shakes your hand and have no wish to be branded i trust that she has received the ancient ones healing one never knows if they will be branded it just the luck of the draw you see contrary to popular belief only the truly dark wizards can be marked draco is living proof of that we shook hands before we called it a truce and it didntmark him her husband the future king of england is tending to my sister and really wishes to divest the two of them of their heads harry focused on his palm and it sealed itself i dontallow weapons of any sort here at my home i wontresort to using my gift if you honor my wishes and divest yourself of all weapons big or small he got serious and to the point try and pull anything and i assure you i will show you how voldemort died we will see if you can survive the same fate or better yet i ll let fluffy get to know you all again i know that he recognizes all of you it a little trick that i do now seeing as i am the next merlin he isntthat foolish now are you kane rai lotus arched a brow at him it been a long time lotus blossom you ve changed i not the one who has changed and dontcall me lotus blossom only my family and friends call me that we all change lotus it just a matter of how and why we make the choices that we do in some cases one has no choice but to follow ones chosen path kane showed all of them that he was unarmed as were his men we knew the rules your highness none of us wish to incur yours merlin s or the ancient one wrath you asked for this meeting and we are honor bound to follow by your rules if you didntwish to incur my wrath then you would have known better than to show up wearing the fur of a yeti i happen to respect all creatures and having met a yeti tribe i know that these creatures are not prone to attack unless you threaten them the very fact that you seem to like to hunt ancient beasts is sickening to me harry narrowed his eyes at kane it a nasty habit of mine and i am trying to break it i find hunting these beasts a challenge and sometimes i get carried away and the hunt leads to the death of the creature otherwise i tend to collect them and bring them back to my home alive kane shrugged as he locked eyes with chen i was once raised to respect all creatures but then my father died and my views changed it wasntlike anyone else tried to raise me so like i told lotus things change in a flash he was dressed in a black sweater black jeans and black kid leather boots i have no problem adhering to your wishes one would not wish to dishonor themselves in front of the ancient one i was unaware of your birth your father after slaughtering them all disowned himself from his family there was no one to inform me that he had sired a son abandoned him at a temple and that xian men had taken you after he had died it wasntuntil you were nearly grown that i realized that xian had a son chen wasntafraid to admit that things had gone badly when it came to what had happened to kane then it is true you are my first grandfather i always thought the others were lying to me kane stared at chen in disbelief though it would explain my ability to do certain things lying to you kane you have sea blue green eyes and can manipulate electricity your lineage was obvious to the rest of us khan shook his head at him in exasperation then you must have known what was going to happen when the two of us finally met is it true that you kidnapped me from the temple you told me that they didntwish to take care of me anymore kane was not pleased you were told what you needed to hear in order to follow through with the path your father chose for you shin growled you were meant for greatness not to be raised by monks we carried out your father wishes and that is all that should matter to you greatness does not necessarily mean evil or turning to dark magic my family is living proof that you can achieve great things and not turn to the dark ways harry waited for the other two men to comply unless you wish me to change my mind about using avada kedavra on both your sorry hides i would suggest that you follow his lead and change into similar attire you see i immune to the any of the dark curses but you aren t harry pointed his wand at the two of them to show them that he was dead serious no one is immune to the dark curse you start off this meeting with a lie and demand too much of us kahn snarled at him that is dishonor your highness i dontlie harry growled go ahead hit me with ak if you wish it doesntaffect me at all you really are as fearless as they claim i have heard many things about you your highness and so far none of them have been lies kane was intrigued by harry boldness i must warn you my former mentors love to rise to the challenge they re free to try harry motioned to the gates with his hand and they opened i said i dontlie go ahead your irritated enough to use it properly that way you know that i mean what i say you are his father are you not kane frowned at james really what gave it away was it the fact that we re practically twins james drawled sarcastically you will allow this to happen to your first born son kane found it hard to believe that they would allow one of his men to use the curse of all curses on their prince do you not care about him junior holds the wizarding world record for surviving getting hit by the ak curse voldemort has hit him with it maybe a dozen times draco and hermione used it on him just before new years on new years eve he was hit twice more during the vanquishing of morgana and during the final month of his wife pregnancy hermione hit him 40 times in less than a month so i ve no problem with him challenging them to hit him again in order to prove his point you arentdealing with the norm when it comes to my son no you are dealing with the next merlin and chen finest student james was now deadly serious as to your other question yes i care about my son enough to give my life for him once and i would do it again in a heartbeat actually i believe he miscounted i hit him at least fifty times this past august once just after christmas and twice during the vanquishing of morgana hermione appeared wearing one of rory auror uniforms and i am about to do the same thing again for him even suggesting such a thing she didnteven give harry a chance to react and got him point blank in the chest avada kedavra harry remained standing completely unharmed and very displeased with his wife thank you for the demonstration hermione anne now back inside go tend to our daughters he stalked over to glare down at her our daughters are perfectly safe with wills henry rory and dromi watching over them this is my home and i have every right to meet any guest who you wish to invite here hermione stood her ground we are a team and that is never going to change not now and not ever if the two of you wish to enter my home then you will change what you are wearing she glared at kahn and shin and pointed her wand at them i dontthink that either of you can withstand the ak curse but i willing to see if you are i have heard many things about you as well once again none of them were lies kane was highly impressed with hermione please feel free to use whatever means you wish if my former mentors dontcomply in the next minute he bowed i am kane chen lee rai it is an honor to meet you kahn and shin did not wish to die and changed clothing in our culture the woman knows her place they grumbled hermione gave them both donkey ears and a tail for that remark speak when spoken to do you wish to visit our wizarding hospital as well or better yet there is a nice cell in azkaban waiting for you for harming rory you are in my territory now and believe me my soul mate is known for sending people to st mungo s i can easily meet with kane while they re trying to sort you out harry snarled at the two of them and i thought lotus had a hot temper kane had never seen anyone besides himself put his two former mentors in their places no one would even dare try for fear of facing their wrath i would suggest that the two of you remain quiet for the time being or there is no telling what the princess or prince will do to you it is clear that even i am outmatched against them so heed their warning he arched a brow at the two of them kahn and shin attempted to snarl something but only ended up braying like a mule crooks and pepper hissed and spat at kahn and shin i can assure you that all of you are not needed i did not come here with dishonorable intentions the ancient one summoned me i answered his summons feel free to return to your evening rituals it is clear that the two of them do not need any protection or assistance kane spoke to the rest of them lotus is free to stay you see we haventseen each other in a very long time the one standing next to her needs to go back and undergo more training crooks came right up to his feet as did pepper and stared up at him i see that you have two kneazles as you can see i am not as dark as my mentors so what i say is true he makes a valid point this is overkill and even fluffy is calming down now the other two arentgoing to try anything because hermione just jinxed them into mules kane impressed harry crooks tolerates you and that good enough for me sirius couldntbelieve that crooks was letting kane hold him or that pepper was slinking against his leg i not going anywhere you see me and james head up the wizarding world main auror division so i have to stay logan and draco on the other hand can go home this is our deal now max you can leave and take flamel with you dontworry mate we ll catch you up just like dad sirius loved the fact that he once again outranked max logan and draco decided that maybe that was the best strategy and left you two got the position and both your wives were all for it max frowned he had thought about going for the spot but it had already been filled and now he knew who his new superiors were it helped that they were family and his closest most trustworthy friends jenna was but i cantspeak for lil s if it keeps my flyboy from being bored out of his mind then of course i all for it lily appeared next to james lily we are in the middle of something here and i would really like it if you went back inside james found himself with a hot foot and gritted his teeth in pain or you can just stay here but this is auror business it has nothing to do with healers unless you wish to attempt to sort out twiddle dee and twiddle dumb over there he motioned to the mules that were now sporting a nasty case of the poxy jinx as well by merlin hermione what is it now a timed release jinx not exactly daddy i just added to the mix rory appeared next to lotus dani is not happy because she didntget to finish her sentence because dani appeared in her father arms impossible she is but an infant kane was taken aback by what he had just seen you no leave us dani glared up at her father no one is going to leave any of you ever we might leave for an hour or two but we are always going to come back there was no need for you to scare your uncles out of their minds by vanishing from the nursery that is advanced magic and you will not do that again until you ve mastered the basics by that i dontmean magic i mean crawling walking talking and eating solid foods is that understood young lady harry locked eyes with his daughter you could have hurt yourself and you dontwant that now do you danielle stephanie anastasia i sorry dani started to cry harry she only two months old that was a bit harsh dontyou think hermione went to take her but harry wasntgoing to let her coddle her actually no i dontthink i was she needs to know when she overstepped her bounds and this time she beyond spread her wings she needs to know that we are the boss not her and the sooner she learns that the less she will try something as dangerous as this again this wasntbringing a bottle pacifier or toy to her this was dangerous magic and will not be tolerated harry kept eye contact with dani i be good i promise dani whimpered i got scared i know but what you just did is mummy and daddy magic not for little girls harry cuddled her against his shoulder and soothingly patted her back i ll let dad and uncle sirius chat with you for awhile right now my daughter needs both hermione and i she comes first before anyone or anything all my girls do i see that i not needed good evening to all of you merlin vanished i see nothing wrong please tend to your infant kane could only imagine how much of a handful three of them that powerful was for them a thousands pardons for what my associates caused you to endure after harry and hermione vanished he turned his attention to rory oh cut the tripe rai you were just as much to blame as they were i know that you were observing the whole thing from the shadows it what you re known for lotus narrowed her eyes at him you excel at skulking about i ll admit chang that i good at blending into the shadows but i was not the one that threw that blinding sphere shin was i also surmised that any aurors that were skilled enough to enter my lair could damn well figure out what to touch and what not too i sorry if i gave the two of them that much credit he ignored lotus brewing temper and continued with his observation the princess was the only one intelligence and knew not to touch the pretty shinny sphere but her other rookie partner needs to go back for extensive training logan dumbledore draco pendragon or lotus would have been better choices to partner with her i take it that you chose that simpleton for a proper partner for her he arched a jet black brow at max after all you were the one in charge at the time were you not simpleton i ve been out of the academy for four years now and i graduated from there with top marks it was an error in judgment and nothing more than that a flushed faced mac snarled at him mac is well aware that he screwed up but he is far from a simpleton he was top of his class at the academy he was trying to impress my niece and it backfired badly resulting in her injury max was not about to take lip from kane i am humoring my nephew by allowing this deal to take place if it were up to me i would have the lot of you thrown in azkaban and be done with it you have broken nearly every by law in the book but then you did remain neutral during the second uprising of the dark lord so that and only that is keeping you from a nice cold cell in azkaban i have not been corrupted by my mentors and the fact that i can hold this cat and not have him claw my eyes out is proof of that i have yet to actually take a life i twenty five it been a slow time for us and certain individuals prevent us from doing our ancient profession we didntwish to get involved in what would have been our demise so we chose to remain neutral i will admit that my hobby isntexactly on the up an up but i was told that the monks that had raised me for the first five years of my life shunned me for who i was kane was still reeling from learning the truth about being chen many great grandson it kind of makes one bitter to the entire embrace life and treasure its teachings line of thinking maxwell takes offence when his authority is questioned mackenzie i would suggest that you return to your home as well chen dismissed mac that would be good seeing as wills wants to behead you as well rory frowned this guy is full of it but i leaving mac left in a huff lotus let them confer for a while i want you to meet my prince rory called over to her while you re at it you can meet the rest of the family i ll join you lily went over to join her daughter lotus chang meet my mother lily potter pendragon mum this is my very good friend lotus for the life of me i just cantimagine how cho came to be the way she was you and ami seem to be well rounded sane girls lily smiled at her sorry that was rude of me it a pleasure to meet you to be honest i dontthink anyone has been able to answer where cho went wrong but ami is coming along smashingly lotus smiled i ll be with rory if you need me she called over to max consider yourself on a well earned holiday enjoy your visit with rory or better yet be her shadow for the time being max thought that was a brilliant idea you can stay at sanctuary for as long as you like james grinned thank you for your most generous hospitality i can assure you that what happened to aurora will not happen again mac was careless and i am going to tear a stripe off him for it when next we meet lotus growled yes well what done is done now please come into the house lily ushered the two of them inside you are of course welcome inside as well but those two need to stay outside i sure that fluff will enjoy watching them for us wontyou big boy james patted fluff side fluff narrowed all six sets of his golden eyes and went over to stand watch over the mules in his territory donteven think of having them for a snack you know how eating humans gives you heartburn he chided his pet splendid now let all take this inside and discuss this in the study james and the others went inside while the two nervous mules brayed in protest chapter 12 change of heart i do not claim any of jkr characters only that i love being able to create my own kind of mischief with her beloved characters i do not claim any other things that are owned by other companies that i may mention once and a while in the stories although the original characters and ideas are mine and i loved creating them so please review if you wish but try not to flame me too badly cindra 2004 2008
