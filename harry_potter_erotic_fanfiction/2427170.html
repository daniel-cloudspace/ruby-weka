 a n i warn you of incoming randomness and please do not eat food or sip any drink whilst reading this story many readers are planning to sue me for getting their faces melted with coffee or choking on popcorn any out of character marauders and somewhat stereotypical personas is purely for comedic effect at least that my excuse so overall this is james and lily story from my warped mind disclaimer i own nothing except my sadistic humour obsessive lily disorder chapter 1 i bored complained sirius i want to do something and i want a million galleons james retorted but we canthave everything now can we the marauders moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had somehow manoeuvred themselves into the space of the broom closet none of them were gymnasts or skilled in the art of flexibility no matter how much sirius protested he d gotten into some very dirty and supple moves with a sexy hufflepuff under one of the great hall tables at breakfast ughh remus uttered with distaste did any of you have a bath he asked trying to block his nose with the odd position of his arm that was bent in such an unnatural way the four sixth year boys had cramped themselves in one of hogwarts number one snogging spots something they would most certainly not share with anyone ever of course it would probably emotionally scar them for the rest of their lives and maybe physically too with each others unusually sharp and pointy limbs the boys were in very close approximates of each other much too close peter your knee is getting dangerously near my groin area remus said uncomfortably i suggest you move it better do what the man says wormtail or moony might unleash his inner werewolf on you sirius warned him fidgeting as he tried making himself in a more comfortable position or in fact some sort of position of cosiness free of pain peter mumbled an apology to remus and then tried redirecting his leg to another position merlin wormtail now your leg is practically riding up my arse shhh james glared at his friends who were being in his opinion totally selfish he turned his gaze back on the gap of the door where he was spying for a particular someone outside it james was it really necessary for us to join you on this er observation remus couldntfind a right word to explain what on earth he was doing james squinted as he eyed the gap yes i needed the company well if you need the company then why wontyou let us ta ssshh wormtail james hushed him as you can tell only one of the marauders was there by choice the other three dragged along for moral support or more likely as groupies james grimaced as he felt one of peter wet sneezes splatter against his face remus for some odd reason started violently coughing all this due to sirius heavy cologne that was slowly suffocating them to death sirius are you trying to gag us all remus questioned his throat was scratchy from coughing sirius seemed thoroughly insulted i did have a date tonight he revealed bitterly but then prongs decided to drag me along to stalk evans i am not stalking evans really said sirius mockingly then explain to us why exactly we are in the broom closet james sighed and retold his explanation because i overheard evans talking to that prick derrick that she would go kiss him in the broom closet he spoke in very peeved tones so you decided to drag us to the broom closet and kiss us instead peter jumped to conclusions very much disgusted in return no sod off i just wanted to spy on her and stop whatever was going to happen james smiled evilly and cracked a knuckle remus backtracked to what james had said about accidentally listening on lily conversation with the ravenclaw you overheard said remus unconvinced elaborate alright so i was under the invisibility cloak and i eavesdropped bloody hell nosey moony remus smiled as he knew james never accidentally overheard conversations but was also a little insulted at being called nosey when james was practically one of the nosiest people he knew then he thought back to the part of james sentence mentioning the cloak wait a minute you used the cloak why didntyou just use it now to spy on lily james looked at remus blankly bugger he slammed his head on the broom closet door sirius found this all hysterically funny and laughed at james lack of common sense peter giggled silently along but couldntcontinue as a wad of sirius hair had entered his mouth due to their jam packed conditions you are a perfect example of why some species eat their young said sirius smugly flicking a strand of black hair out of his eyes unfortunately elbowing remus in the process ufftt groaned remus the elbow smacking him rudely in the cheek did you think of that witty comment all by yourself peter asked in awe er no i read it on the back of a hogsmeade chocolate bar wrapper well we re here now anyway so sod the cloak idea james ruffled his dark hair accidentally poking peter in the eye how long are we going to be in here sirius complained not that i dontlove pressing up to all of you but i ve got a reputation to keep you know a reputation that doesntinvolve hanging around with friends in enclosed spaces male friends especially are you saying you have female friends peter asked of course i do alright then name one err bellatrix she your cousin remus pointed out relations dontcount besides have you forgotten that you hate her guts and want a thestral to mow her down james reminded him just because i think she a bitch doesntmean she not my friend sirius argued i think you re all bitches but you re still my friends he poked each boy in the face my cheek smells of pie merlin knows where that finger has been remus said disgustedly as he wiped his face what your favourite flavour of pie peter asked the boys a slight dribble of drool slipping from the corner of his mouth at the mention of food i like apple pie said sirius i more of a cherry pie person myself peter revealed sirius nodded in understanding no i find peach pie stop talking we re not having this pie conversation again remus cut in sternly if somebody had asked remus to pick three people to be stuck in a closet with similar to the famous question of being stuck on an island lets just say he would choose more intellectual company what time is it asked james still focusing on the gap of door watching intently for any signs of the redheaded girl sirius rolled up his sleeve and made his way to look at the watch on his wrist but unexpectedly knocked remus wand which he had been holding as the only source of light in the claustrophobic room bugger remus cursed loudly they watched as the wand fell to the floor the light only displaying their feet wow wormtail sirius said in the darkness have your feet got bigger what size are you he gazed at peter shoes a nine peter answered come to think of it over the summer they have grown rather quickly well pete you know what they say about guys with big feet one of you pick up the bloody wand remus interjected the boys looked at each other inquisitively at least they thought they were looking at each other it was a bit hard to tell with no light i not picking it up i ve got james shoulders digging into me pete arms are stabbing me in the stomach and your hair is tickling my nose sirius told remus it rather soft what conditioner do you use remus ignored the question on tresses and looked at peter with pleading well he sincerely hoped it was peter can you get the wand peter remus did not like being in the dark in such a cramped space especially when sirius was breathing down his neck like a homicidal mad man occasionally making an evil snicker it was rather unnerving i vant to suck your bloood sirius murmured in what he thought was a transylvanian vampire accent right against his ear sirius you re hysterical ow you prat he clutched his neck which had suddenly been bitten by the so called vampire vampire boy laughed frenziedly when you ve stopped giving each other love bites james frowned at them both can one of you get the bloody wand i can feel something touching my leg he trailed off worriedly sorry apologized peter i was trying to loosen the belt on my trousers why james asked trying to move as far away from peter as possible which was about a millimetre and only ended up nudging up to sirius he abruptly moved away from him considering he could feel sharp pointy things pierce his neck stop it padfoot i dontwant to catch rabies james teased carry on wormtail i had too much food in the kitchens peter explained as he rubbed his stomach you know those house elves they just keep coming back for more james shook his head getting the wrong idea of that sentence dontsay it like that wormtail he advised what are you saying that you ate the house elves and they re giving you indigestion sirius laughed he made a sudden sound of disgust when peter produced a loud burp that nice that wasntjust a noisy belch it smelt too remus commented trying to gag himself with a bunch of sirius ebony hair oh no i can feel it coming out of the other end peter squeaked the others instinctively heard the sound of a groaning stomach in undeniable pain and tried to move as far away as possible from the ill boy oh god i dontthink this is worth it james muttered contemplating whether it was actually worth the wait for lily to turn up and save her day from the wise arse ravenlcaw derrick and suffer the consequences of peter eating more than the average wizard sirius mate the wand may only be showing the light shining at our feet but i can distinctively hear the sound of you scratching your crotch james said unsavourily he d heard the sound of sirius scratching his inappropriate place so many times that he knew the noise off by heart it was occasionally heard in their dormitory before they went to sleep resulting in many pillows hurled at sirius head peter for christ sake just pick up the wand james ordered i would but i seemed to be pinned against the wall by the blood sucking vampire no sirius argued making remus think he was about to protest that he was not barbaric or bloodthirsty you cantlet peter get the wand he ll have to bend over and then he might suddenly let one rip and his arse will probably explode can you imagine the mess we ll all be covered in buttocks peter buttocks that a risk i willing to take remus grumbled peter was about to obligingly bend down and reach for the wand no matter how much his stomach was wailing unrecognisable tunes and how ill he felt however sirius had swatted his hand to peter stomach in protest no pete sirius spoke with odd heroicness i ll do it the boys listened as they heard the rustling sound of sirius squirming and his limbs bending in odd positions oh god oh god remus mumbled dontbend down sirius don t he stopped and winced as sirius had indeed ignored his advice and bent down his arse sticking up against him oh bugger i would just like to mention that i will possibly be drowning myself in one of the baths or toilets of the prefect bathroom later choose the bath its cleaner sirius advised while he managed to grab the wand from the floor and squirm himself to some sort of standing position you wouldntwant to drown yourself in a toilet after snape pissed down it he handed the wand to remus though it looked a little bent uh started sirius noticing remus wary look i kind of stepped on it woops thanks remus replied ungratefully for stomping on my wand rubbing your arse up against me and suggesting an appropriate choice of committing suicide i did not stomp sirius asserted i merely trod i dontfeel so well mumbled peter trying to hold back the vomit that was trying to escape bloody hell james complained i am never taking you guys out again come to think of it wormtail i dontfeel so well either sirius spoke suddenly feeling ill and claustrophobic the room is spinning i suddenly feel faint he pressed a hand to his forehead is it me or is this closet getting smaller that not possible remus answered grimly his nose and face now flattened against a wall i cantbreathe sirius panted clutching his neck there no air in here man of course there air remus scolded him if there wasntair then we d be dead i feel like i dying moony you were fine until a second ago it some sudden illness protested sirius my neck moony it feels so tight at least yours wasntbitten into remus retorted putting a hand over his neck even feeling teeth marks look at that prongs sirius said grabbing the wand from remus and shining it over the boy neck it looks just like a hickey sirius winked and elbowed him exctiedly if anyone asks you got a little carried away with that hot blonde ravenclaw georgina i think her name is i have a feeling i will be wearing a scarf tomorrow but it summer screw the season she there james whispered delightedly spotting lily through the gap of the door he growled at the boy whose arm was wrapped tightly around her waist the boy named derrick was in james opinion tall and lanky his blonde spikey hair resembling a bleached headgehog this was why it was a surprise that lily even considered meeting with him she hated cruelty to animals derrick grabbed at the door handle of the broom closet turning the knob feverishly james smiled as derrick twisted the knob but couldntopen the door as james was holding the handle from the other side shit it locked derrick cursed it never locked he slammed his weight against the door confused to why it wouldntopen he wasntbeing the most sincere guy in the wizarding world his words blatantly suggesting that the broom closet was a regular spot he visited lily watched uncomfortably as derrick swore at the door oh it locked is it what a shame lily lied thankfully grateful that the door would not open she was thoroughly going off derrick by the passing seconds well i just remembered that i ve got homework to do so i ll be going lily abruptly stopped talking as derrick slammed his lips against hers with urgency she preferred soft kisses she was most definitely not getting them now screw the door derrick muttered sticking his tongue down lily throat much to her surprise i ll kill him james hissed about to make his appearance and beat the ravenclaw boy to a pulp however remus held him back james she isntgoing to be happy to find you spying on her in the broom closet he pointed out holding on to his shoulders james struggled against his grip ow sod off he exclaimed as sirius had swiftly grabbed a fistful of his hair to keep him from attacking the ravenclaw look at her she definitely not happy about being kissed by him he pointed out making his friends look through the gap of the door to watch lily and derrick smooching yeah that why she kissing him back peter replied uncertainly and james glared at him the four boys pressed their eight nosey eyes to the gap watching as derrick pressed lily against the corridor wall thoroughly examining the insides of lily mouth with his tongue the redhead didntseem to be complaining the sound of their kissing is making me gag sirius pulled a face shut up sirius snapped james anyway i bet you she thinking about me when she kissing him his tone laced with smugness his friends burst into mocking silent laughter but quickly stopped when the sound of james name was called from lily lips mmm james she moaned audibly into derrick mouth all the boys gaped including derrick who broke away from lily like he was singed by a game of exploding snap lily eyes widened at the name she d just moaned and pressed a hand to her gawking face what did you just say derrick demanded but he quickly swivelled round at the sound of cheering from the broom closet oh yeah she said my name my name james rooted triumphantly as he bounced up and down resembling sirius in his animagus form after being drugged with coffee predictably james jumping in the cramped closet was not a good idea as the rest of the marauders in the closet grimaced at his sudden loudness and jerking limbs james accidentally fell back his arm twisting and knocking against the door handle making the broom closet door swing open the four boys yelped as they fell out of the closet and on to the corridor floor at the surprised lily and derrick feet this is not good for my health remus mumbled sirius was currently laid on top of him like a tablecloth making no signs of moving anytime soon ugh a foursome derrick cast dirty looks at the boys peter as if on cue suddenly vomited from all that earlier intake of food all over derrick feet sirius examined derrick vomit covered shoes from the ground you have small shoes he commented merlin beard derrick was unsure whether to move now his shoes which were all squishy and covered in goodness knows that good one wormtail congratulated james as he lay on the floor he patted peter on the back gratefully which only made peter vomit more derrick yelped as the sick got dangerously near him again james turned his attention to lily who seemed paralysed with fear shock and disgust all at the same time potter she began looking wide eyed y you didnthear me say oh yes evans james cut in in his most seductive voice i did he tried to turn his gaze away from peter mushed breakfast to the beautifully startled red haired girl before him lily shook her head furiously no no no she argued stomping her feet i said your name because i was thinking of how much you aggravate me didntsound like that to me commented sirius groaning in pain as lily promptly kicked him in the stomach shut up black ow lily you realise when you hurt sirius who is currently on top of me you cause pain to me as well lily cringed sorry remus james took his opportunity to ask that oh so familiar question evans go out with me lily breathed of indignant anger i cannot believe you you arrogant little you stupid you you immature aargh she ended in frustration not able to get out her insults not feeling she could stand the sight of him any longer she stalked down the corridor away from him should i take that as a yes james called after her evans hey evans if you re trying to be funny by ignoring me i d just like to mention that it not funny really not funny mate she gone sirius pointed out as james was shouting to an empty corridor yeah i know james sighed i just like the sound of my own voice he turned his attention to derrick who wasntlooking amused as he stood in his smelly shoes alright derrick you can bugger off now ta ta with a rude scoff derrick stormed down the corridor grumbling back to his common room who would have thought the marauders were gay together derrick said loud enough for them to hear however on his graceful exit he slipped clumsily in his sick ridden shoes landing on the floor with a loud slam that echoed throughout the castle wormtail i love it when you re ill james patted him on the back in gratitude chapter 13 first i was afraid i was stupefied sirius please not the singing kept thinking i could blah blah blah dah nah dahnanana but then i spent so many nights blah blah blah doodoodoo dah na nah strong and i learned blah blah along oh not i i will survive oh as long as i know how to snog i know i ll stay alive i ve got all my tongue to give i ll use it as long as i live i ll survive i will survive hey hee oh for the love of merlin shut up lily screamed opening her eyes and discovering a dark roof over her and in her surroundings an odd sound of travelling in some sort of mode of transport where am i vaguely she remembered being knocked out by some large invisible weight she expected to be in the hospital wing right about now definitely not in the seats of an unknown enclosed space she was about to lift her head from the comfy pillow which she assumed was a cushion of some sort until she realised it was actually a lap or to be more specific the crotch of james potter who bloody singing james snapped finally awakening from his unconscious state his eyes widened when he discovered lily head placed delicately in his groin oh dear he had to stop those teenage hormones before he made himself out as an even more embarrassing perverted arse hullo he greeted her trying to control his male anatomy before it flung lily head a fair distance hi she blushed furiously she quickly lifted her head whilst trying to get in to a sitting position opposite him am i some sort of victim of a date rape i dontthink so james shook his head i dontremember any alcohol where are we their head turned around confusedly as they focused on where exactly they were situated they were sitting on the seats of what appeared to be a carriage which was plodding along slowly to hogsmeade passing the quidditch pitch isntthis one of the carriages that takes us up to the castle at the beginning of the year lily asked i think you may be right replied james he and lily moved their heads in unison to pop outside the window of the side of the carriage unfortunately colliding heads in the process ooow james rubbed his head through his peculiar tea cosy hat you d think with a hat like that your head would be protected from pain lily stated is your head made of concrete or something james cringed knowing lily painful bump was probably due to his rock solid snape hair you look first james offered holding on to his head as he backed up for lily to look outside the window no you go she replied modestly no you go i insist i insist more one of you bloody go a voice was heard from outside james and lily exchanged a disturbed look who was that queried lily probably the same guy who was singing was like a strangled hippogriff how dare you sirius yelled his head appearing upside down at the window looking oddly like a bat aaaaargh lily backed up against her seat startled and pale christ can i go one day without screaming james yelled clutching his chest i have the voice of an angel you bastard sirius hit james in the arm which was a pretty impressive thing to do upside down moony say hello remus head also appeared upside down for five seconds of waving before oddly disappearing again er sirius no matter how much i dontreally care for your well being i dontthink you should be upside down for that long lily observed him your head is turning many colours ah sirius squeaked turning a definite blue in the face we can stop i think the hippogriff needs a bathroom break anyway the hipogriff james said with dread lily shrieked as the carriage came to an abrupt halt making her suddenly fling across the seat opposite into james crotch yet once again her mouth made a muffled squeal as her head landed into james private area which was extremely painful for james to have a particular heavy object bash into his particular delicate area so forcefully glad you kiddies are awake so wha sirius stopped smirking in surpise as he had opened the carriage door and discovered james and lily in rather rude positions sorry am i interrupting something piss off james hissed sorry lily finally managed to remove her head from his now familiar area s not your fault james winced blame it on the unexpected breaking sorry about that remus apologized appearing at sirius side with a thoroughly displeased face the hippogriff a bit hard to handle sirius explained the hippogriff james echoed again what are you lily paused about to ask what exactly this carriage predicament was all about but then burst into laughter as she took in sirius and remus appearance what are you wearing remus scowled i d like to clarify that i did not agree to this ludicrous clothing he said raising his hand in protest sirius is the one who picked these ridiculous clothes i think we look rather becoming actually sirius said tilting his black top hat over one side of his face shooting them a seductive wink lily along with james who had recovered from his heart failure and pain in the male anatomy broke into more laughter what look were you going for lily tried to keep a straight face and act as if she were serious about knowing their opinions on fashion i mean what was your influence she bit on her tongue as she hid back a giggle taking in their rather smart black suits complete with top hats and what she could see from the corner of eye sirius twirling a walking cane well sirius formed a flattering laugh i thought we d try and go for the a arse look james finished for him exchanging a chuckle with lily remus turned a bright red and scowled i was going to say aristocrat actually sirius continued where peter james asked noticing his fourth comrade not to be present hospital wing he not a good flier remus shot james a look lily held a puzzled expression pettigrew was flying unnecessary topic sirius said loudly waving a dismissive hand er not that i dontlove your costumes lily smiled in amusement but what is with the carriage ahh glad you brought it up it was all james idea sirius patted his friend heartily on the back james gulped it was dontbe so modest sirius patted him on the back harder it was james ingenious idea to do this romantic gesture remus said in a clearly miffed tone mostly due to the clothes department of the plan he thought it would be simply amorous to take a utopian stroll in the carriage to hogsmeade and through the village not in those exact words obviously sirius said slightly confused by remus descriptive diction cos prongs probably doesnteven know what amorous means neither do you james pointed out amorous is a tiny creature composed of one cell only sirius replied matter of factly that an amoeba dimwit remus rolled his eyes sirius cringed easy mistake to make right lily tried to brush aside the boys neverending bantering so what exactly is controlling this thing not a hippogriff james repeated for the third time in a dreading knowing voice might as well introduce you to hippo sirius grinned i told you already dontcall the creature that sirius remus said sternly she might be offended and we do not want to offend her james and lily exchanged a wary look before popping their heads out of the window to the front of the carriage where a hippogriff stood proudly in a bad temper as reins had been attached to her like a horse she beautiful lily admired from afar basically because she had read that hippogriffs were dangerous and preferably wanted to keep her arms and legs attached to her body we found her in the forest sirius mentioned he looked a little taken aback that he had not received any type of praise congratulations well dones medals or even trophies for finding the magical creature i ve got a feeling i ll be flying on hippogriff when i older whatever sirius james made a whistling sound as he twirled his finger towards his head illustrating sirius blatant insanity and you named her hippo he said slowly she must feel honoured aw hippo loves me dontya sirius went up to the hippogriff without bowing which instantly made remus make a warning cry but hippo simply squawked making a soothing cooing sound as she was petted at the neck even creatures are attracted to you remus frowned as hippo rubbed her head playfully into sirius shoulder it rather horrifying jealous are ya moony sirius winked i ll give you loves and cuddles later he teased donteven joke about that um guys maybe we should get going james suggested they were attracting quite the attention james spotting a group of students approaching them whilst pointing at them from a distance away sure hippo done her bathroom break anyway sirius informed the boys peeped down at the ground immediately looking away as they spotted a large heap of what they guessed was hippogriff dung which had started to attract flies and cast a ghastly smell lily saw no point to contradict sirius so didntbother to even look you better feed her remus advised sirius revealed a bag which smelled of rotting and pulled out a dead rat without any signs of being appalled he tossed the rat to hippo who impressively caught it in the air and chomped it down with minimal chewing i not even going to ask lily said suddenly feeling sick in the stomach james looked a little worried glancing at the bag of rats you did check peter was in the hospital wing right of course we did sirius reassured them but then made a quite nervous cough afterwards and james thought maybe they hadntafter all lily watched on in bewilderment let get going then sirius said eagerly he jumped back on the driving seat of the carriage helping remus who had clear signs that he really really didntwant to get back on but would have to anyway james and lily started to get comfortable inside and decided to sit on the same seat instead of opposite ones so no more embarrassing my head your crotch situations would happen we better split before sirius started but was interrupted by an incoming scream sirius and remus turned round to discover professor mcgonagall speeding towards them from the main oak doors of hogwarts her wand raised threateningly as she held her robes higher above her feet so she could run mr black oh bollocks sirius cursed he pulled on the reins of hippo who had annoyingly chosen this moment to stand still as possible bugger mcgonagall coming james shrieked popping his head out the carriage window c mon padfoot get moving oh we re in so much trouble lily put her face in her hands dontworry lily james rubbed her arm reassuringly sirius will get all the blame oi sod you sirius appeared at the carriage window upside down again a heated frown upon his face sirius this isntthe time remus pulled him from the window and back in to the driver seat why isntthe hippogriff moving sirius pulled on the reins once more but hippo refused to move only squawked in bad temper apparently she hadntfinished resting come on hippo he tightened again on the reins come on love move for me please mr black mcgonagall scream came louder oh jesus james muttered in horror this exactly like this muggle film i saw where these kids are in these dark woods in one of those muggle cars and the car wontstar oh yeah sirius popped his head at the window again and the guy keeps turning that ignidi ig ig ignition lily guessed yes and the car still wont start were they out of petrol remus questioned sirius pulled an ugly face i dunno i dunno even know what petrol is anyway there this what exactly was wrong with the car why wasntit starting remus interrogated why were the kids alone in the dark woods did they have the wrong directions where exactly were they going you say kids but how old were they were there an adults you re ruining my story moony i do apologize sirius sighed and muttered the word butt munch which none of the others recognised as an everyday saying assuming the name as another one of his laughable made up insults anyway the kids are in the car and they can hear these pounding footsteps outside sirius knocked his hand on the carriage for a dramatic way of story telling and he turns the ignition thing but the car still wontstart and the monster moves closer in the darkness and he turns the key again and it comes closer and closer and closer then what happens lily whispered tensely the monster smashes through the window sirius created an explosive sound of a window smashing which sounded oddly like the emphasised word of pow and the monster grabs the kids by their necks and and what lily murmured clearly traumatized by the story it he paused dramatically eats them lily paled and started hyperventilating whilst james to fan her with his hands i sincerely doubt mcgonagall will eat us remus said grabbing sirius top hat to get his attention my top hat sirius cried removing his head from the window and scrambling his hands to reach the hat that remus was dangling away from him i will give it back when you stop getting distracted remus said no more muggle television give it back moony mr black mcgonagall screamed for the third time now barely feet away from them all of you get out of this carriage this second for goodness sake why wontthe hippogriff move remus complained he tried for himself to tighten on the reins of hippo but she stubbornly remained frozen even yawning in a bored fashion lily suddenly had an idea insult it what lily poked her head out of the window to look at sirius and remus they dontlike to be insulted remember i dontthink insulting hippo will help the situation lily lily groaned just try it maybe the hippogriff will move if you aggravate it like you re aggravating me sirius clutched his chest merlin that was harsh just do it padfoot james urged him but i dontwant to insult my lovely hippo sirius remus growled sending him a deadly glare you werewolves are so bossy sirius muttered to remus quietly fine he turned to hippo er he fumbled for a particular insult you dontneed to be picky padfoot any one will do ooo sirius made a noise of delight i got one hippo your mother is so fat the only thing that is attracted to her is gravity he burst into unrequited laughter not your mother insults you imbecile lily smacked her head but i ve got so many good ones sirius protested for example your mother is so fat she needs a map to find her own butt hehe remus glowered at him alright moony he turned back to hippo uh hippo this whole not moving thing is really boring you suck and er your feathers are all overlapping that was pathetic sirius james remarked and you re ugly sirius added hippo screeched indignantly and kicked back on her hind legs i think that hit the spot remus squeaked holding on the carriage for dear life as it nearly tipped over go hippo sirius called mightily the creature grinded her hooves to the ground and started galloping towards hosgmeade squawking and holding its head high come back here mcgonagall coughed as hippo left a cloud of dust behind her in such a fast getaway sorry canthear you minerva sirius shouted putting a hand to his ear talk to you later bye bye now lily pressed a hand to her mouth trying not to disgorge her last meal as the carriage moved isntthere some sort of speed control she gripped the carriage walls with her fingernails i dontthink hippogriffs are meant to pull along carriages james said feeling as if his face was pulled back from the amazing speed they probably dontlike it lily said which is why they arentused for pulling carriages a group of third years at two o clock remus warned keeping a look out for all obstacles which included people rocks and trees sirius quickly swerved right at remus news what are you doing you re going to bash right into them i not at good at time that why i wear a digital watch sirius shrieked dropping the reins and covering his eyes so he wouldntsee the destruction of hippo mowing down a group of hogwarts students dontclose your eyes you imbecile remus grabbed for the reins yeah that what she told me and then i said the third year paused as she chatted to her friends her back facing the oncoming carriage and deadly hippogriff coming her way i d believe that when i saw a hippogriff she laughed like that would ever happen er amber her friend pointed behind her at the sound of galloping and a tremendously loud squawk the girl turned around and screamed diving out of the way as the carriage nearly ran over her friends wailed their arms as they watched the wrathful creature pass blaring their lungs dry sorry ladies sirius apologized dontsue us bye the carriage zoomed away did you see that one of the girls asked gaping i know the girl named amber replied sirius black and remus lupin in top hats so hot back in the carriage james and lily squealed as it swerved to right pushing them both against a wall fatefully making lily stumble and fall onto james lap you re in my lap he stated not that i complaining or anything he noticed lily deadly raised eyebrows and smiled with mischief you re becoming rather familiar with my lap you know they both made another squeal as the carriage swerved to the right pushing them both against a wall this time making james fall on to lily s lap now you re in my lap lily said smiling at how the tables had turned what do you have to say about that potter she teased you fell headfirst into my crotch twice he reminded her lily smile disappeared touch she mumbled folding her arms watch the tree sirius remus said simply not making any elaborations because the obstacle was close and bold enough to see when sirius didntseem to be making any signs of turning remus started to worry tree at twelve o clock sirius still no signs of swerving sirius the tree alright keep your hair on he said making a tug on the reins and luckily scraping past the tree by inches but unfortunately thwacking remus with a tree branch and many many leaves after much hippogriff galloping they d finally entered the hogsmeade village with a very might entrance of screaming it seems we ve caught a lot of attention remus pulled down his top hat as much as he could over his face i really dontknow why sirius replied clueless uh james i ve really um enjoyed this romantic carriage journey lily said but i d appreciate if we got out of this thing i feel really nauseous that a shame i ve really enjoyed it james fibbed christ his head connected with the roof as the carriage bumped over something did we just run over someone dontworry sirius replied wontbe missed james looked horrified we ran over a bench james remus rectified james breathed a sigh of relief that right folks a salesman with a particular surname of fletcher stood next to his stall of stacked delicate plates of china he gestured to his merchandise and waved to the colourful sign that displayed the words your heart can break but not this plate these genuine plates ere the ginger haired man picked up a plate and displayed it next to his face with a cheesy smile are unbreakable wiv a special permanent charm inside the plates even if they re dropped and smashed to the floor the pieces instantly stick back together without y even lifting yer wand to mutter a fixing spell hmm a witch observed interested as she looked at a plate front and back and a special deal for only today five galleons for a complete set of twelve what a bargain i hear you say here you go he handed another set of plates to an eager customer as the galleons poured in who else would like to purchase this once in a life time offer he looked among the crowd how about you he pointed his finger at a woman the witch had only been passing the stall and was fully aware the crowd was looking at her er sorry she spoke unaware of the question tally ho hippo sirius shouted the carriage barging down the street and towards the crowd of onlooking plate purchasers oo that rhymed he noted with delight fletcher spotted hippo and waved his hands back and forth in distress no no not the plates he cried the crowd wailed fleeing as the carriage charged into the stall destroying every plate which smashed to the floor in minuscule pieces sorry sirius apologized dontsue us bye the carriage plodded along trampling over the broken plates and down along the street of hogsmeade where more people screamed about a hipogriff leaving its trails of dung in its wake oh dear that man stock is ruined a woman said dontworry the plates are unbreakable her partner reassured her with a grin a bag of the set of plates held proudly in his hand the crowd watched in anticipation as they waited for the plates to spring alive and repair themselves they did not fletcher laughed nervously oh well er who wants their money back en he asked the crowd everyone raised their hands well tough no refunds fletcher said before disapparating with a crack come back you theiving liar the scammed buyers shouted meanwhile the carriage was still hurtling through the street of hogsmeade hippo clearly not stopping anytime soon guys james thumped the roof with his hands can we make a stop somewhere please we ve been trying to make a stop for the last five minutes remus clarified bouncing in his seat as hippo ran over yet another hogsmeade bench well what are we going to do then lily questioned we ll have to jump it sirius said the others burst into laughter jump dontbe illogical remus said sirius kept a straight face there no other way mate hippo not going to stop so we ll just have to jump off the pavement is hard sirius remus pointed out although your head seems to be immune to heavy collisions i d like to keep the brain cells i have taken my life to produce i think padfoot got a point james said regretfully drooling ever so slightly when they passed honeydukes for the second time in two minutes hippo seemed to be circling the village for fun i getting hungry anyway you re risking your head being impaled into the ground because of food remus said indignantly james shrugged his shoulders sure lily laughed in disbelief no way am i jumping she shook her head at once no bloody way am i james she yelped as james picked her up by the waist and slung her over his shoulder what are you doing she kicked her legs manically potter she resolved back to use of his surname to get her anger across ah the surname thing wontwork on me only turns me on james clarified pushing open the carriage door he tried to block his ears as lily cursing shook through him see you outside padfoot he thumped on the roof again yep sirius rolled back his sleeves stretching to prepare himself for the hurling just jump and roll prongs it ll hurt less that sounds like the same guidelines for when you re on fire james said squirming as lily kicked him in the shin sirius addressed remus so come on then moony i am not jumping remus asserted firmly there is no way i am jumping off this carriage remus remus remus sirius sighed then quickly grabbed for remus top hat and pulled it down over his eyes what the i cantsee remus shrieked he tried to pull the top hat upwards but it was stuck over haf his face perfect sirius smirked what do you mean perf aah sirius picked remus up and hurled him over his shoulder with much struggling as remus was not particularly light as lily frame was christ moony what have you been eating lately sirius tried to stable himself as he nearly toppled over right on the count of three then james suggested he formed a steady breath out to calm his nerves as he watched the ground zoom past below him perhaps this wasntsuch a good idea okay sirius agreed one lily screamed as james jumped from the carriage and dived to the ground you cheater sirius shouted after him you re such a mork what a mork remus asked though still annoyed that he was currently carried by his so called friend who was also the reason for being temporarily blind it a concoction of moron and dork that rather clever i know well since i complimented you why dontwe not jump and nice try moony bugger sirius took a deep breath before hurling himself off the carriage and onto the pavement remus was even more frightened as he was blind and couldntsee what was going in the meantime james and lily lay very uncomfortably on the street finally making a stop after much revolving thanks for breaking my fall james lily said poking her elbows deliberately into his stomach she was on top of i thought you broke my fall he said with confusion no that why you re currently used as my cushion she gestured to her position on top of him but if you re on top of me who am i on top of he said in horror realising he was indeed lying on a particular lump lily pulled james to his feet both gasping as they spotted the crippled old witch they had landed on sorry miss james apologized er dontsue us lily rolled her eyes at the overused line that day i cantmove my legs the old biddy whispered um good for you bye james quickly grabbed lily hand and ran down the street towards where sirius and remus had painfully landed you know remus said in a strangled voice the person who forces the other to jump is normally the one to protect the other fall really sirius said with curiosity never heard of that he yawned slowly getting to his feet as he d been sitting on remus face you guys okay asked james oh i fine sirius just sat on my face that all remus responded dripping with sarcasm wiping his cheeks hippo gone sirius said in a hollow voice he wiped a tear from his eye as he watched the hippogriff stampede away the carriage bumping along with her i sure you ll have other opportunities to hump magical creatures sirius gave remus a chinese burn we ll see you guys later james told his friends i booked a table for me and lily at the new restaurant opened up lily beamed a smile of surprise at such news flattered that james had made such an effort what restaurant where is it sirius asked i not telling you you ll just follow us james said smirking bye he and lily waved as they strolled down the street surprisingly in close approximates of each other so what do we do now remus broke the silence watching the couple wander off spy on them under the cloak sirius revealed the invisibility cloak from the inside of his suit and shook it in front of remus disapproving face you stole james cloak again he really shouldnthide it in his underwear drawer sirius shook the cloak animatedly in front of him once more fine remus gave in but we re not wearing the top hats because they wontfit under it spoilsport muttered sirius what do you mean my name isnton the list james said glaring at the burly man who stood in smart robes holding a parchment on a clipboard tapping impatiently with his wand your name ainton the list mate the man repeated tapping the parchment of surnames no booking no entry he said simply check again will you james pleaded a table for two the name is potter p o t i know how to spell mate the man interrupted pushing up his glasses he glanced over the list and shook his head james tried to remain calm but i came here yesterday remember the guy with the dark messy hair he tried to trigger the man mind poking to his hair which was unfortunately covered by his tea cosy hat glasses you called me four eyes maybe if ya take yer hat off i might recognise you the man compromised james paled er i d rather not actually not wanting to show his snape hair in public please you dontwant to disappoint my date now do you he tilted his head towards the discomfited redhead beside him i know your type the man growled closing on him try and blab that your name is on the list when you arentbooked tryin to get yourself in a fancy restaurant with your fancy bird lily said a rather unsettled excuse me the rude man pointed his wand at them both get out of here before i hex you wow a date in the hog head lily finally broke the silence a few minutes later she glimpsed around the pub and sipped on her butterbeer brewing in a filthy glass how imaginative james reddened sorry about the restaurant mix up that guy at the door was a total mork lily gave him a blank look oh sorry he chuckled it one of sirius insults a combination of the insults moron and dork he explained that rather clever lily said with surprise dontmake him catch you saying that she smiled so do you come here often james eyes widened lily evans are you hitting on me she laughed no james she rolled her eyes i just asking if you always come to this pub the three broomsticks seems to be more popular a loud shout of and i told him he was an anal buccaneer came from a corner of the room followed by roars of laughter james bowed his head embarrassingly as lily raised an eyebrow there more er real people here i suppose different kinds of company if you catch my drift lily nodded understandingly and then made a grimace as a drunken wizard came over to their table and leaned over her you lookin for a good time the badly shaved young man licked his lips at her not with you she made clear do you come here often he began to slur leaning closer to lily but james had stood up and dragged him by the arm rolling his eyes sorry fletcher she with me he clarified pushing him on his away back to his table oh sorry james mate he apologized wiping the back of his mouth didntsee yer ere that because you re shit faced fletcher james laughed yes he pointed a finger very very shit faced lay off the whiskey mate james slapped his back before leaving him to wallow in his alcohol and self pity he went back over to lily shaking his head with a sheepish grin friend of yours she asked sleazy regular sorry bout that you can stop apologizing james she told him i just gonna get another drink she gestured to her empty glass and stood up walking over to the bar so how the date going james jumped out of his skin as sirius and remus revealed themselves behind his invisibilty cloak sirius gladly dragged up a chair for him and remus both sitting down whilst sirius took generous gulps of james firewhiskey great until you guys showed up james mumbled sirius scoffed no it hasn t we ve been under the cloak for ten minutes watching and the most exciting thing that has happened is fletchy hitting on lily you could cut the sexual tension between you and evans with a spork james frowned dontyou mean a knife spork is funnier to say dontyou think spork a combination of a spoon and fork remus finished yes we know james rolled his eyes sneaking a look back at the bar to check if lily had been molested by a drunken bum yet why dontyou guys go er follow snape or something he attempted to lure them away we did that sirius said flashback ooo look a shop sirius pointed skipping under the invisibility cloak yes remus responded slowly there are many shops in hogsmeade sirius ooo look a bird sirius pointed to the sky where a bird was flying overhead yes there are many birds in the wizarding world remus gritted through his teeth ooo look a snape remus looked up with mild interest at sirius mention that severus snape was a passing object the moody boy walked gloomily past the three broomsticks his head down as he hid behind his black hair um can we go in the opposite direction remus pleaded not wanting to be anywhere near snape since his exchange student from jamaica persona rhiana peenapul but we must find his nest and destroy the eggs sirius cried shaking remus by the shoulders end of flashback then what happened james asked not really paying attention as he kept his eyes on lily we followed him to many remus sighed many bookshops sirius poked his back a few times under the cloak he added sirius giggled and he bought a few potions and dark arts books then he went over to a hogsmeade bench and started wanking he did not do that padfoot remus interrupted disgusted by his imagination well he was breathing a bit too heavily in my opinion he always breathes like that it his big nose he has some sort of permanent asthma anyway lily coming back soon james mentioned hoping this would be a clear message to his friends to go away yes we better go sirius remus realized he pulled sirius by the ear but his bottom was glued to his seat but we haventseen you all day prongs sirius complained you saw me an hour ago well who keeps track of time these days eh james smacked his head against the table you are such a pain in my arse padfoot he mumbled against the wood i think he a pain in everyone arse actually remus corrected whistling and turning away as if he hadntsaid the remark well why dontwe let the arse speak for itself shall we james said there was confused silence sirius looked on blankly what do you oh james sounded delighted listen do you hear that the arse speaks now sirius finally got the joke and mumbled butt much can you please refrain from using my arse in this conversation remus asked politely no sirius folded his arms you cannot excuse your arse you can excuse the whole of your body like excusing yourself when you burp or fart but you cantexcuse one particular part of your body like an ear or in this case your arse remus scoffed was there some sort of logic behind that sentence because if there was i did not understand it james stroked his chin i wonder how many times the word arse has been used in this converation eight times remus answered automatically james nodded thoughtfully then brightened as lily joined the table again returning with her glass of butterbeer i see the guys have joined us lily noted as she sat down next to james they were just leaving james said after i finish my firewhiskey sirius added raising his glass for a toast well drink slow and safely james gritted through his teeth i wouldntwant you to choke or anything his eyes noticeably bulged so what were you guys talking about lily asked curiously arses sirius said nine times remus said counting lily raised her eyebrows arses she repeated ten what intellectual conversations you have lily said dryly her knee knocking against james and making him spill the entire contents of his butterbeer down his front and on remus right cheek i mean with subjects such as a dark wizard rising in the world politics and global warming you choose to talk about arses eleven you have one mighty fine arse by the way james purred in lily ear somehow finding a new confidence in himself because lily knee had touched his which could have been considered as an accident mrs potter he added there was complete and utter silence and everyone in the hog head seemed to stop what they were doing turning their heads to stare at james because of his albiet very stupid words er lily blushed furiously what did you just call me james whitened looking at his two friends across him who were not helping with their wide open mouths i said you had one mighty fine arse and then i just stopped talking he grabbed remus butterbeer and hit behind it which only magnified his fearful eyes in the curve of the glass purely horrified by his slip of the tongue right i just going to the bathroom lily squeaked jumping to her feet and hurrying off to the barman for directions mate sirius had another gulp of his firewhiskey and slammed it back on the table the alcohol affects only slightly effecting him you re ability to scare off women is he slurred pausing for the perfect words to describe that horrifying moment sodding unbelievable i hate you james slammed his head on the table again remus massaged his head why did you just call lily your future wife i dunno james groaned dramatically it slipped out of my mouth before i could process it in my brain butt munch sirius snickered into his glass i mean i can understand a female making the same mistake because women are stereotyped to having dreams of a big white wedding since they were a young age remus said in theory but you re a guy james hmm i noticed definite uncertainty in your voice then moony he feigned a glare at remus maybe i should go check on lily prongs remus sighed if you sit and wait eventually everything will sort out by itself it was clear he was hinting to james that he should just leave lily in the bathroom to compose herself for a moment not make everything worse like he always did yeah sure moony james patted him on the shoulder in barely seconds he d ran off towards the girls bathroom mork remus couldnthelp but mutter chapter 2 remus entered the common room wearing a highly bright and noticeable scarf to cover the highly bright and noticeable bite from sirius that marked his neck he ambled over to sirius who was looking highly sorrowful remus could tell by the dramatic cries he hollered unnecessarily every few seconds his cries seeming to be encouraging others to cry as well but in pain as their eardrums burst from his booming padfoot remus began warily tapping sirius on the shoulder what are you doing sirius turned around from sticking some sort of poster on the notice board and brightened at remus appearance lovely scarf moony really brings out your eyes sirius tugged on the scarf a little too hard causing remus to slightly choke then tickled his nose with it you scare me sometimes sirius remus scrunched his nose you look a little red your face is all blotchy and covered in rashes it this bloody scarf remus grunted scratching at the top of his neck i all itchy i think i allergic to the material moony he sighed you cantbe allergic to a scarf you berk he laughed with much gusto and remus rolled his eyes sirius took on an unusual deep face i have news of the grave my fellow marauder dontyou mean grave news whatever i have to tell you sirius paused dramatically prongs is missing remus blinked what prongs is missing he gone remus couldnthelp but chuckle why are you laughing this is not a humours matter sirius proclaimed sorry it was just funny the way you said it as if james was a lost pet but he is a lost pet exclaimed sirius we ve lost our pet stag we ve lost our prongsie why are you talking as if james is our child but he is our child sirius grabbed remus by the shoulders shaking him violently our little ridiculously messy haired four eyed freaky boy is out there lost in the world no food no water no shelter padfoot stop it i getting nauseous remus interrupted and sirius stopped waggling him what are you even talking about he canthave left hogwarts he probably just moping around the corridors after the whole broom closet incident you know lily was especially annoyed at him for interrupting her privacy and has been avoiding him ever since she moaned his name but i haventseen him all day canta padfoot be worried sirius gave no time for remus to answer we have to go find him i think he wants his privacy to have a face like a smacked arse but moony i ve already made posters what remus said dreadfully sirius stepped to one side revealing the notice board which had been advertising hogsmeade weekends and quidditch practice times but was now covered by a large poster bearing the words missing boy oh god remus muttered he examined the poster as sirius smiled proudly at his handiwork please find our lost james potter calls to the name of prongs he read aloud five foot something lanky with untamed hair infatuation with lily evans approach with caution he may be hysterical remus looked to the enormous picture below the writing what on earth is that it prongs sirius pointed to the moving picture of a baby sprawled out on a rug i nicked it out of the potters photo album i was going to use it for blackmail but this opportune moment arose are you sure that james remus asked warily examining at the picture the baby did have wild dark hair though that same baby was wearing a flowery dress remus wasntsure if james had mentioned if he had a sex change when he was an infant of course it is insisted sirius you know james has a fetish for dressing up in women clothes remember that one time he wore that red glittery dress the one with the tassels yes remus began disturbed by sirius accurate description but that was at his sixteenth birthday party he was not sober and you dared him to i always knew cross dressing started at a young age sirius replied not listening to a word he was saying remus turned his attention back to the poster reading the apparent reward money for james return one knut remus read aloud smiling slightly at the shrugging sirius that all prongs is worth one knut moony you know how poor i am sirius suddenly sneezed into his hand at this abrupt jerk a handful of galleons fell out of his sleeve and rolled across the floor remus raised an eyebrow that not mine sirius denied at this note a first year clambered over crawling on his knees to pick up the free money that was dropped to the floor oi you little bugger my galleons sirius stepped on the boy hand he turned back to remus with a fake smile okay remus was clearly unbalanced where peter oh wormtail i sent him out on a search party a what party they turned to the sound of a group entering the common room stepping through the portrait were what looked to be a hoard of small students most likely first years surrounded by peter who easily blended with the other tiny people peter led the group all students dressed in some sort of uniform of matching t shirts all the t shirts were decorated with the same baby picture of james in a frilly dress detailed with the words have you seen this boy padfoot remus sighed were the t shirts really necessary yes they were fun to make but i made them peter reminded him oh yeah wormtail and search party sirius addressed the group report back to me peter looked uncomfortable and did not answer hey you there sirius poked a goofy toothed boy with a twitching eye did you find james n no sir sirius gasped you didntfind him what am i paying you little brats for you re not paying us sir a blonde haired girl reminded him as she raised her hand oh yeah sirius remembered er what with the large nets asked remus picking a net on a long handle from one of the search party members the net looked big enough to catch a small dog and similar to what evil animal catchers carried he didntknow why the nets along with the ridiculous t shirts were necessary to find james who had probably just gone on a stroll of the hogwarts grounds okay then team sirius stood on a common room chair stumbling and falling off straight after he glared at the first years that had sniggered he climbed on the chair again and whistled to get their attention let go over the plan sirius produced a blue print of hogwarts castle with his wand well when i say blue print i mean a doodle of the school that sirius drew in herbology he conjured a pointer as he displayed his map to the party now we are here sirius explained pointing the stick to his doodle of the gryffindor common room regrettably aiming the pointer too hard as it ripped a hole through the page buggeration sirius no swearing in front of the younger students remus told him off this is bollocks you re talking out of your own arse you stupid wanker a black haired first year yelled arms crossed bored beyond relief the boys gaped at the girl hey sirius said jumping off the chair and walking up to her making remus think he was about to tell her off for such profanities you sirius started as he stared at the girl you speak good you speak very good he grinned widely as remus shook his head you can have a whistle sirius rewarded the girl handing the displeased first year with a whistle on a chain she looked at her prize and then looked at sirius then back at the prize then back at sirius what the hell am i supposed to do with this shove it up your arse suggested the girl i can take that whistle back off you y know sirius threatened the girl looked completely oblivious to sirius menacing manner you can use it if you find james and then blow on it and we ll come over he explained or i could just shove it up your butt the black haired girl suggested again alright missy i taking the whistle back sirius tried to grab for the toy but the girl determinedly held it in her hands back off it mine the girl screamed with odd possessiveness give it here sirius ordered gaping remus watched sirius wrestle the first year while peter looked on anxiously if this first year was so manic what about the others no wonder that bloke james ran away with a weird friend like you i dontblame him the girl laughed take that back the girl yelped as sirius grabbed at her pigtails for goodness sake sirius let go of her remus pulled back his friend who was wailing like a gorilla sirius gradually lessened his hysterical state and calmed down you re right moony this is a difficult time we all need to stay together sirius sniffed for james sake the first years all replied with an agreeing here here and peter even gave sirius a supportive hug remus looked at them all as if they d gone insane which they clearly had done now back to the map sirius climbed back on the chair getting out the pointer again we ve covered the points here and here he said now we will search this part of the castle going round in a clockwise direction meeting back at eighteen hundred hours and padfoot remus interrupted tiredly am i the only sane one here james has probably gone on a walk for some time alone just leave him sulk he probably just went to the astronomy tower oh god he might have gone for a walk off the astronomy tower sirius yelled hysterically no remus shook his head at once i didntmean search party carry on searching sirius ordered as he jumped off the chair and dragged the gagging remus painfully by the scarf moony and i have to go see you later wormtail sirius told peter as he pulled remus towards the exit of the common room sirius wait peter called after him sirius and a choking remus spun around what i was thinking would these t shirts look nicer in a midnight blue or maybe fuchsia peter asked as he modelled by spinning sirius stared at him blankly go with the fuchsia he replied then skipped out of the common room with poor remus in tow right sirius cringed so james wasntin the astronomy tower then no but those couple of seventh years snogging each others faces off were instead replied remus blatantly annoyed they were strolling down the corridor still on the search for their lost marauder sirius was still comically upset and remus was still itching frenziedly at his skin where could that baboon be sirius exhaled noisily moony stop a minute i need a piddle excuse me y know i need to er ease oneself sirius carried on what spend a penny he suggested hoping remus would understand but was clueless to any of the phrases remus looked at him vacantly i need a piss sirius said at last bugger shit arse where the nearest bathroom he crossed his legs remus couldnthelp but snigger at his friend in his position uh remus looked down the corridor all i can think of is the girls bathroom let go sirius said hurriedly and remus felt suffocated once more as he was pulled by the scarf and dragged down the corridor why do i have to go i dontneed the toilet we re not girls remus argued moaning as sirius pushed him into moaning myrtle bathroom sirius immediately ran into a cubicle leaving remus to stand awkwardly in the gloomy damp floored lavatory remus heard the sound of sirius sighing with satisfaction and the echo of tinkling of what he imagined was sirius relieving himself remus exhaled noisily his well know trait and walked over to one of the cracked spotted mirrors on the wall he groaned at his reflection a bold red face covered in rashes the only scarf he owned being the vibrant colour of red did not at all compliment his face remus pressed a hand to his neck intending to scratch from the irritating material i can hear you scratching moony stop it sirius called from inside one of the cubicles i wouldnthave to be scratching if you didntbite me aaaargh remus yelled as a girl reflection appeared in the mirror he clutched his chest recovering from the abrupt heart attack that had taken over him and faced the ghost myrtle with a seriously peeved face not another boy the ghost yelled floating towards remus and tugging on his scarf nice to see you too myrtle remus replied with a grim expression what everyone obsession with pulling the sodding scarf he shrieked i ve said merlin knows how many times no boys are supposed to be in here she told him off there already been that freaky boy in here all day dunking his head in the toilet all i want is some peace and quiet and all i can hear is him flushing what freaky boy sirius asked stepping out of the cubicle trouser fly boldly open ugh spat myrtle she shielded her eyes from sirius crotch and pointed to one of the cubicles where the tattered door was shut as their eyes curiously landed on the occupied cubicle they heard the sound of the toilet flushing flushing again then flushing once more someone got serious toilet problems sirius commented must have clogged it up right moony y know what i mean he chuckled and elbowed remus with a cheeky smile maybe they had too much at dinner and they re constipated or have diarrhoea and stop talking padfoot remus cut him off he walked towards the engaged cubicle with sirius obediently following his steps moaning myrtle floated above them making the sounds of a heartbeat to add to the tension stop that sirius rebuked her slowly remus pushed the door open and discovered a well known boy kneeling before a toilet james potter being in the girl bathroom was a little strange what was also strange was seeing the boy with his head down the toilet flushing the handle repeatedly as he was trying to drown himself in the loo water did i or did i not i say to try kill yourself with the toilet what did i say about snape peeing in it what did i bloody say sirius exclaimed like a furious parent remus tried a more sensitive approach what are you doing james leave me alone he replied glumly a face full of dirty water glasses included he flushed the handle of the toilet again water splashing against his face it not working i not dead why am i not dead oh yeah rub it in why dontyou myrtle shouted you boys all healthy and alive she flew off into her own cubicle with an angry wail right remus spoke again clearly unbalanced for a second time of today what depressing thoughts are you drowning yourself in literally s not fair james gurgled in the water this isntabout a girl that rhymes with the word monday is it sirius asked if you re talking about lily i d just like to mention that the words lily and monday do not rhyme together remus rectified yeah they do lil ly sirius said slowly mon day no wait bugger lily james groaned gurgling in the toilet water she hates me i tried talking to her in the common room she hates me what did you do remus questioned with worry i kind of asked her out again and all i told her was that i cursed derrick with boils and she flipped james explained his words echoing in the toilet bowl james you did both of the things she hates ask her out and curse someone i feel like my heart has been ripped out and put into one of those muggle inventions you know the one that makes those damn good milkshakes a blender remus offered yes one of those prongsie prongsie prongsie sirius sighed i have a plan james quickly removed his head from the toilet and turned to sirius who had raised his eyebrows suggestively also pointing to the imaginary light bulb that was hovering above his head due to the idea that he d thought of a plan james brightened a plan sirius confirmed helping james to his knees about to ruffle his hair but noticed it was soggy so decided against it you re waterlogged sirius mentioned to james dripping face you look like a drowned rat no offence to peter remus showed an obvious worried expression sirius what exactly is your scheme dontworry moony you know i d never put prongs and evans in much danger this did not calm remus however james looked quite delighted any plan to get lily was good in his eyes he would try anything to get his red haired beauty the boys made their way towards the exit of the bathroom startled by a first year entering in a hurry as she pushed past them on the verge of peeing her knickers sirius and remus recognized her belonging james search party for many reasons why exactly is that girl wearing a picture of my mother as a baby on her fuchsia colored t shirt james asked harshly pushed outside the bathroom by sirius and remus as they made their way back to gryffindor tower chapter 23 what the hell derrick cursed as the entire contents of his bag spilled across the floor he examined it and found it had been split open at the bottom bad luck had happened to him ever since dinner after he had reluctantly sipped some orange juice which felt oddly sour than usual he bent down picking up his belongings a group of second years in his corridor giggled at the sight of a pair of thongs on the floor they re not mine derrick said genuinely oblivious about the underwear for a start i hate the colour pink i mean i dontwear them altogether he kicked the underwear away and shot the chortling girls a glare i ve had bloody bad luck all day he complained to himself first getting that buggering sensation in my eye and the other burning sensation up my well there was something dodgy about that toilet roll then i thought my rectum had exploded because of that blood but madam pomfrey said there was nothing wrong he bent down again to pick up his charms book when he heard a loud ripping sound uh oh slowly feeling his backside he discovered his trousers had ripped at the bottom and were now exposing his ravenclaw boxers wand must find wand he hissed searching in pockets if he had his wand maybe he could prize the last of his dignity and fix his trousers his wand was gone it appeared the corridor was filling up with more students he quickly shoved the charms book in his bag not caring he was flashing many passing students with his underwear he glimpsed at the floor checking he d picked up everything and spotted his one and only quill rolling across the floor unfortunately all his other quills had broken that day that had been rather unlucky damn it he chased after it attempting to keep a hand on his bottom to cover his showing undergarments winding through the snickering students he tried to snatch for the quill but it only seemed to gain more speed what the hell is going on derrick cried no no crap he watched the quill spin until it came to a staircase and was now rolling down it still determined he kept a hand firmly covering his bottom and chased the quill down the steps he fell in the process aaargh staircases did not make comfortable slides derrick whimpered spread out like a starfish at the bottom of the steps help someone help me his body was numb but he somehow felt pain at the same time a lovely combination he watched fellow students completely ignore his presence at the bottom of the staircase climbing up the steps with ease he siezed a passing trouser leg but it belonged to a furious girl who cried pervert and kicked him in the gonads aaargh someone had mistaken derrick for a rug remus did not understand why sirius was dragging him there with so much urgency all he knew was that their destination was the room of requirement i dontlike going in there remus said tensely it very unnerving how the room moulds itself to your needs as if it is alive you overanalyze too much sirius stated the two stopped in their tracks once they got to the seventh floor opposite the tapestry of the barnabus the barmy grudgingly remus followed sirius pacing in his high heel shoes up and down the small stretch of wall three times until a new door appeared how does going in there get back at snape remus gestured to the room pulling at black strands of his wig i ll tell you inside moony sirius insisted opening the door and stuffing him inside the moment they stepped in the room they were met with a gigantic luxurious bed with walls covered in mirrors remus had to hold onto a mirror covered wall to stable him from his hyperventilating what on earth was going though your mind when you were concentrating what you needed he questioned shooting sirius a horrified look sirius didntlook so abashed and was admiring the room decor bit tackier than i expected he finally realised remus had asked him something oh they re just props moony props for what sirius rung out his ear and shot him a tired look not answering the question he pulled out the marauders map from his trouser pocket and opened up the flaps on the parchment until he found the seventh corridor they were on he followed snape moving dot he on his way here snape remus cried biting on his fingernails in agitation how does he know we re in here i sent him a note from you saying that you would meet him in here what why didntwe come in here to hide from him sirius snorted then much to remus wailing whipped off his school robe and pulled his shirt over his head remus averted his gaze from sirius pecks why did you suddenly remove clothing why why it makes it look more realistic sirius explained and remus had no idea what exactly was going to come across as more realistic but he could tell he wouldntlike it one bit quick moony get on the bed you want me to what sirius was getting impatient we re doing this get snape back remember doing what to get snape back and how does me getting on a bed for you facilitate in any way in getting revenge on snape moony get on the bed before i fart on your face at that remus shot on top of the bed sheets but scrambled as far away as he could against the headboard for safety his frantic eyes shot around at the many mirrors and rather fanciful bed drapes i dontlike this he said shrilly i dontlike this at all um moony sirius started fingers fidgeting in nerves snape has to catch you and me i mean rhiana you know doing it remus paled it doing it what it are you referring to you know no i dontknow and will you please put your shirt back on sirius rolled his eyes god knows what you d be like if i had my trousers off actually maybe i should take them off too to look more authentic he tugged on his belt but remus stopped him with a glare if you get any more naked i going to bite you sirius considered this hmm maybe snape would take it as kinky remus threw up his hands in frustration i getting out of here he went to climb off the bed but he froze when the door flung open snape stood at the doorway bugger remus cursed snape looked between rhiana sirius and the rather tacky bed with a crumbling expression rhiana what going on he demanded the scene was complete i sorry for doing this moony sirius whispered an apologetic look on his features sirius rarely looked sorry for anything and remus replied with a disturbed stare for doing whaaa he trailed off as sirius suddenly pushed him back on the bed and kissed him open widely waaaaah remus thought waaaaaah sirius also thought his tongue is rather bendy but back to what i was thinking a second ago waaaaaah after a few moments sirius tore away from remus who was very open mouthed at that precise moment to send snape a mischievous smile hi snivelly you just missed me and rhiana romping sex snape turned pale even more than his usual ghostly complexion a clear sign he believed the gryffindor especially after the vivid kiss he d been present to see the devastation the look of near tears across the slytherin face horrified the boys more than seeing something as haunting such as the dark mark good merlin thought sirius he has emotions how could you snape snarled at remus looking close to spitting on him turning on his heel he ran from the room his dark shadowy robes billowing behind him well sirius said a little stunned er i think our work is done right remus remained motionless completely stupefied his mouth still open from the same position when sirius lips had pulled off his he finally managed to find his voice but could only conjure the words well i never thought i d ever go that far for a prank sirius voice shook it never shook sirius studied remus dontyou have any other input on the situation he asked quite hysterically right sirius said well this has been fun snape face harhar har his har hars lacked energy he was very aware that he had just crossed a few friendship boundaries in the last two minutes i have to go now he announced hurriedly grabbing for his shirt and school robes he made for the exit i promised i d steal evans ring for prongs then i ll probably kiss a few nameless girls so i secure on my homosexuality remus quavered dontyou mean heterosexuality fuck yes that one buggering similar words he muttered to himself well uh ta ta he gave remus an awkward wave as he rushed out of the room of requirement lily wrapped her wet hair in a towel after having a late afternoon shower stepping outside of the dormitory bathroom in her bathrobes she heard the sound of rustling and hushed voices she looked around the dorm and found it empty no signs of her fellow dorm mates thinking she was just being paranoid she crossed the room and sat on her bed she immediately sat up again when there were audible squeaks which certainly didntbelong to the mattress nicole is that you lily asked swivelling her head round looking for her dorm mate to pop out behind a duvet cover and shout boo got ya april fools even though it not april and you totally cacked your knickers who there she asks when she got no answer realising she d looked around the room at only shoulder length she looked at ankle height and examined the floor a wad of black hair stuck out from under her bed oh my god shrieked lily she jumped back clutching her bathrobe tight around her body as it had been hanging quite slackly she grabbed for her wand in her pocket but realised it wouldntbe in the pocket of her bathrobes who under my bed who there you pervert she dug her feet under the bed and kicked whatever solid object was there ow ooow stop it woman lily made her own cry of ow as whoever was under her bed unexpectedly grabbed her foot and pulled on it aaargh she tumbled backwards and hit the floor with a slam feeling dizzy and disoriented she massaged the back of her head not seeing the two bodies under her bed roll from their shelter and get to their feet the ring grab the ring she heard a voice order this one another voice asked no that a sodding keyring the dodgy ring there were sounds of scrambling then a noise of glee got it woop de bloody do now let get out of here hey lily turned on her side still lying on the floor as she tried to get her eyesight in focus what are you taking get back here she finally managed to get on to her knees and spotted a flurry of school robes dash from the dormitory no they sodding didn t she said under her breath she struggled to her feet as she clutched painfully at her newfound headache she let her hands run through the clutter of her desk side table searching for it the ring was gone her towel had fallen out of her soaked hair as she d stormed across the dormitory in rage the second she got at the doorway she watched the bodies of the sirius and peter descend down the newly changed staircase which had been conveniently changed into a slide due to their manly genes i dontknow you how you got up here but you re going to pay she screamed pushing up the sleeves of her bathrobe in a threatening manner she was going to kill those idiots and that was only if derrick didntkill her first for losing that ring she was about to join the slide and chase after the thieve s but a voice stopped her from open doorway of another girls dormitory you re only wearing your bathrobe again lily she quickly stopped her foot which was in the middle of a step and detracted it thanks she told the girl gratefully effing clothes she mumbled taking a step backwards imagine if i had gone down the slide wearing only my bathrobe unfortunately she slipped on her soggy towel oh fu aaaargh she screeched sliding down the smooth staircase what do you mean you ve run out of pain relief potions madam pomfrey merely shrugged her shoulders completely baffled she looked through her potions cabinet again but gave derrick another grim nod that there were none in stock how can you not have pain relief potions he yelled using a hospital bed post to lean on he was currently sporting a limping leg and many bruises to his arms and face due to hogwarts hard staircases you re a healing witch you always have pain relief potions calm down the witch shushed him so he wouldntawaken other sick patients i might have a potion to get rid of those bruises after a couple of minutes of searching through the potions cabinet again madam pomfrey turned around with empty hands the witch shrugged her shoulders once more with an oh well never mind eh expression derrick was seething that bad luck isntit madam pomfrey said lightly derrick grunted all i can offer you is a bed to sleep here tonight i afraid derrick didnteven dignify her with an answer striding as humanly possible with a limp through the oak doors of the hospital wing and slamming them shut bollocks he swore somehow getting his school robe caught in the doors he pulled on the robe with all his might until he it eventually tore and he fell backwards coincidentally the fully dressed lily nearly tumbled in to him as she stormed down the corridor she was particular moody after the disaster of shooting into the fully packed common room wearing just her bathrobes and flashing a group of first years with too much upper skin she was planning to find sirius and peter following the trail of cookie crumbs down the corridors and her flowery bra she knew sirius had probably stolen for james are you alright lily asked watching derrick stumble to his feet she gasped when she took in his full appearance bloody hell derrick what happened to you she furrowed her brow at the dark bruises and wobbly leg your robes torn and your er trousers at the back you dontknow how glad i am to see you derrick said yanking her forward with great force so he could kiss her he needed a stress relief and lily was handily there to take minimal pain away she pulled away curtly derrick you re injured you should get some rest in the hospital wing oh that tart wonthelp me he referred to madam pomfrey let go he wrenched roughly at her hand go where lily asked her voice tense broom closet derrick replied as if the answer was simplest in the world lily felt her throat tighten but she let derrick drag her along the corridor anyway pulling her sleeve down over her bare hand what padfoot i need to be here alone james emphasised sirius did not understand but what are you going to do in here sirius waved a hand to the small surroundings of the broom closet jerk off or something i waiting for her the term of her would have sounded rough on any other person lips but they filled with so much compassion that it almost ran through you but sirius began again rather thwarted we can stick around if you want like last time padfoot come on remus cut in his practised tone of voice dominative but soothing with puppies like sirius black the earlier situation in the room of requirement had been completely erased from his mind under the frightening circumstances in fact it didnthappen nothing happened let him do this by himself remus added sirius was about to argue but bit his tongue we got the ring james eyes lit up you did yep sirius smiled peter scavenged the ring from his trouser pocket and handed it to sirius heavy bugger he commented sirius twirled the hoop around his finger a couple of times amused by the spinning and twinkling emerald jewel i wonder what it would like on my finger he slipped it on before any of the boys could protest sirius waved his fingers for all to see oooo look at me i minerva all of a sudden he grabbed remus arm and hooked it with his and this is my husband professor dumbledore alright you ve had your fun scatterbrains now unhook me remus said sirius stuck out his tongue but unhooked the poor soul and went to slip the ring off his finger good golly gosh the ring is stuck what sirius chortled so gullible he slid of the ring and put it in james palm thanks padfoot james was unsure how to show appreciation without coming across as what he thought was a clear homosexual so sent him a punch in the arm ow the thanks would have been enough sirius complained alright men he addressed remus and peter let go play some wizard chess the made their way down down the corridor you did say wizards chess and not wizard chest right remus asked uncertainly oh yeah moony i said let go play with a wizard chest jeez alright you donthave to be so melodramatic no seriously let go make snape chest hair turn pink except he probably doesnthave any because he no as manly as i and not to mention he a girl james rolled his eyes at such a conversation hearing his friends voices quieten as he shut the broom closet door this is when he realized he was right back where he started talk about going round in circles he muttered standing alone in the darkness of the broom closet was rather chilling this time he had none of his friends limbs sticking into his stomach or blinding him in the eye he was alone james wished he accepted padfoot invitation of staying with him he really wouldnthave minded if sirius cackled like a vampire and tried to groove bite marks into his neck he pulled out the marauders map from his pocket muttering the usual i solemnly swear and unfolded the flaps of parchment until he found his own dot tracing a finger down the same corridor and finding two more dots coming his way derrick and lily s he quickly pressed his eyes to the gap of the door derrick i really think you should get some rest in the hospital wing lily told him on the verge of pleading she tried desperately again to dug her jumper sleeve over the hand he had latched onto as he pulled her along derrick didntanswer and only stared ahead he finally took attention of lily once they were outside the door of the broom closet derrick swore he saw flashes of hazel orbs in the gap of the door but before he could ponder it they were gone roughly again he tugged lily hand as he grabbed for the door handle so much her hand became completely visible from her sleeve he saw her delicate fingers he saw her bare delicate finger lily knew she was in trouble from the second her hand came into view where the ring lily debated her answer she didntwant to get sirius and peter involved not only did telling derrick they had stolen the ring inevitably lead to fights but she was supposed to be detached from the marauders all together where is the ring his voice sounded harsher due to her twitchy silence why arentyou wearing the ring lily shrugged trying to keep the atmosphere as light as possible i must ve forgotten to put it on no you didn t derrick cut in tersely lily tried a different approach it was kind of tight on my finger she lied so i just he roared i told you to wear it at all times derrick lily began tensely and was nearly laughing at how he had reacted with so much fury i dontthink it really matters if i dontwear it for a bit stupid girl derrick fastened on to her wrist and she made cried out feeling her hand loose blood circulation you re hurting me she struggled against his fixed grip get off panicking she continued to wrestle away until she got so infuriated that she bit on to his hand like a hungry niffler aaaargh derrick cried in pain instinctively he hit lily with a strike across her face she quickly felt her legs crumble away from her as she fell to her knees panting heavily as she clutched her reddened cheek stupid mudblood he spat at her those were his last words before he was smacked in the side of the head by the flung open broom closet door of course james didntmind that derrick was now sporting a broken nose from such an impact what the derrick started clutching his face and pretty astonished by james sudden appearance where did the hell did you come from james turned to lily who was kneeling against the corridor wall with a look of shock i sorry he told her as a warning for what he was about to do next wands werentneeded now it was a fight of pride james brought back his fist and struck derrick already covered face with his hands derrick swore loudly and stumbled back at the force enraged he brought his hands down to his sides blood trickling down his features dripping over his teeth unexpectedly derrick came at james giving him a blow to the stomach james didntjustify him with a throbbing moan and instead grinded his teeth he made to punch derrick again but missed as the boy dodged out of the way giving him another forceful blow to the stomach it was if words were not needed every punch or shove meant something as if it were a secret language ringing in one another ear james had enough of the prancing about glancing over at lily trembling figure which got him even more heated and alert he pummelled derrick in the face and the boy faltered back again clearly unstable james was about to give him a punch to the stomach but derrick fell to the ground his unconscious body hitting the floor with an echo that rang down the corridor james immediately kneeled to lily side wrapping her arms around her quivering figure sshh lily it okay now he soothed her stroking her hair i donteven know why i crying she admitted wiping furiously at her streaming eyes after what had happened she was embarrassed because she was crying in front of james potter he hit you that twat hurt you he touched you james put her face in her hands and softly wiped her tears away stroking her throbbing cheek her green orbs only seemed to glisten more i shouldntbe crying he hits like a girl my sister petunia hits harder than he does and she looks like a horse she broke into hard sobbing right james almost chuckled at that he rubbed her back and heat slowly rose back in her warmth had gone when derrick had hit her leaving her cold and shivering lily found herself clinging on to him much more than she would admit she sniffed as her tears subsided and clutched the back of his robe i lub you james eyes bulged you lub me lily voice muffled against his chest my nose is all clogged up with snot so i cantspeak properly she mumbled that nice james commented on her nose clogging you still look gorgeous as ever he continued soothingly rubbing her back i lub you too he murmured close in her ear just as he was going to kiss her forehead lily moved her head upwards at the last second so their lips met in a deep kiss they smiled giddily at each other afterwards after a while of just sitting on the floor in each other arms lily stood up and helped james to his feet who was clutching sorely at his stomach you re hurt lily stated guilty james batted a hand trying to disguise the unbearable wince on his face it nothing he wheezed lily stroked warmly at his stomach and james felt undoubtedly better with another meaningful kiss from lily james felt his hand brushing tenderly with her fingers as she grasped his hand hey what are you james began aware that lily was pulling him somewhere she hushed him and gave her a warm smile with a gentle tug she drew james into the broom closet both stepping over derrick unconscious sprawled out body and enclosed them inside with a soft click of the door shutting the second the closet door fastened sirius whipped the invisibility cloak off him and his two friends oh that did not just happen sirius spoke with an arm on his hip completely baffled he gave a prod to derrick in the stomach to check if he wasntsome sort of an illusion announcing him as real as derrick made a comatose whimper of pain oh it did remus confirmed hmm sirius said suspiciously in one swift motion he turned the door handle of the broom closet and hurled it open the three watched their fourth comrade snog inside the enclosed space most avidly with the redhead obviously making up for lost time the boy heads twisted from one side to the other observing lily hands run through james wild hair whilst james caressed her cheek and leaned her against the broom closet wall they broke apart flushing but managed to shout a loud bugger off righto sirius said closing the door at once the boys stood in the corridor in silence so peter said conversationally so sirius echoed the duo looked at remus remus sighed so he repeated to the boys wishes peter knocked his fists together admiring the way it formed a small rapping sound sirius tapped his foot rhythmically against the floor obviously bored rigid remus fiddled with his clothing trailing his fingernails at the corner of his tattered robe want to go spy on them through the keyhole sirius asked no remus declined quite appalled sirius pouted why not because that would be disgusting and there no keyhole right you are pete sirius said and there no keyhole the next morning derrick felt his entire body ache he woke up and was faced with bed curtains realising he was somehow placed in his own dormitory though he had no recollection of even walking up the common room stairs to get there he sat up nasty images of what had happened with james and lily flashing through his mind in desperate need of the bathroom he flung open the nearest curtain of his bed waaah the entire dormitory was covered with bleached hedgehogs the end an the sequel to this story is called you give me heart palpitations click on my profile if it easier to find and thanks for reading papooses love you all nauseatingly chapter 3 the boys entered the common room and james shook his shaggy hair sprinkling sirius and remus with loo water thanks for the lovely perfume remus commented sarcastically james replied with a pat on the back looking confused something caught his eye on the notice board what the bloody hell james ran up to the board grimacing at the sight of the large poster displaying his mother as a baby in a dress he didntlike seeing early pictures of his mother due to a very embarrassing traumatic experience last time she showed him photos of her when she was seventeen his mum had smiled proudly as she shoved photos of her young self in his hands protesting how groovy she was asking disturbing questions of do you think i was cute and saying i was gorgeous wasnti your father couldntkeep his hands off me he was scarred for life along with the broom closet event a lot of confusing questions were going through james mind wondering how exactly this photo had gotten on the notice board in the first place only one name came to his brain padfoot you nutcase james exclaimed god i put up a missing poster for a friend and what do i get grief that because you put up a missing poster for a person who wasntmissing remus pointed out i am not lanky james suddenly burst out loud as he d just read the detailed information along with the photo sirius snorted grabbing one of james gangly arms and watching it flop after being dropped from shoulder height your arms remind me of runner beans great detail remus nodded james glared at them both i ll have you know that girls love my untamed hair he said slickly sirius and remus erupted into sniggers i suppose girls love the piece of chewing gum stuck in your tresses then remus questioned james looked confused reaching a hand to his hair but sirius had already beaten him to it oow sirius had clawed a hand to his head ripping a blob of chewing gum that had somehow managed to get wedged sirius had pulled a little too hard along with pulling out some of james hair in the process oh you twat james clutched what was left of his hair i can feel a bald patch dontworry mate haventyou seen that wizarding hair spray stuff its hair in a can you spray it and hair comes out its like whipped cream sirius said amazingly but with hair he added right james gave sirius an odd look i wonder how exactly gum got on my head in the first place he said with suspicion glaring at the culprit er the gum fairy sirius suggested james rolled his eyes turning back to the poster he ripped it off the notice board to his horror the same poster was underneath it he ripped the other identical poster off more to his horror the same poster laid underneath that one what the he muttered pulling off poster after poster of the same bloody poster eventually james hands were heaped full of the same photo of his mother as an infant how many posters did you stick up it a spell sirius explained it never ends oh great everyone thinks my mother is me that an odd sentence james commented are you a deluded how could you think my mother was me she wearing a dress for christ sake sirius will now explain his theory of your fetish for wearing women clothing remus predicted to james you have a fetish for wearing women clothing sirius said predictably the red dress james the one with the tassels what are you on about actually sirius remus jumped in he wouldntknow about wearing the dress because he was too hammered to remember sirius nodded understandingly whilst james remained confused abandoning ripping the never ending posters off the notice board he jumped on one of the common room couches reclining whilst looking at sirius who it would seem had a plan to get his red jellybean other wise known as lily evans so padfoot explain the plan i have many plans many great plans just like i have many great looks sirius grinned modelling his face at many angles to his friends cut to the chase sirius remus took a seat next to james well you know all girls love that sensitive guy bollocks right james frowned what exactly do you mean if you re talking about james potter being a sensitive guy then you are insane remus said james scowled at him no way sirius scoffed james remained scowling i talking about girls liking guys who are a bit girly and poof y who say poetry and stuff to them remus slightly glowered at sirius opinion of any male writing poetry obviously being girly and poof y however sirius did seem to have a surprisingly good starting plan well james it an opening remus said an idea springing to him you could write poetry to lily or recite poems to her she d love that i have some books i could give you no moony no sirius butted in james could never read or write poetry he can barely write his own name yes i can you spelt your name wrong in transfiguration laughed sirius you left out the letter r at the end of potter that was because i was writing my name and was on the letter e then you decided to knock me out with your shoe because you stole my quill can we get back to the subject remus cut in sirius looked blankly at him poetry he prompted oh yeah as i was saying before mr illiterate interrupted me james boldly stuck up a finger at this comment prongs could recite his own poetry to evans but we know he sucks arse at writing so a spell should help him along what kind of spell remus asked suspiciously already not at liking to the idea you know how all the greatest poems rhyme actually no remus argued some of the greatest poems dontrhyme yes they do sirius argued what about humpty dumpty that a nursery rhyme same thing sirius said dismissively anyway i know a spell to make whatever james says rhyme instant poetry out of that big gob of his james glowered at the description of having a big gob you cannot be serious remus frowned thinking the whole idea was completely absurd the word serious was a deadly word to use around sirius black sirius knew that saying the pun yes i am sirius right now would result in the slam to the back of the head by remus lupin sirius knew that remus would not sincerely like him saying this over used pun yes monseiur lupin i am sirius he grinned slap that was the sound of remus hand connecting with sirius skull dirty werewolf sirius said clutching his head that was uncalled for padfoot james said i not so sure about this spell sirius groaned exaggeratingly dontbe a girl i am not a girl james snapped in annoyance i just dontwant to be cursed by you i dontwant to end up with something sticking out of my arse again that was one time and you only had that shower head up your butt for two hours christ what spell did you intend to get in the first place remus asked i guessing you didntactually ask for a shower head to be stuck in that particular place i also guessing you didntwant anything remotely related to a shower head i asked for a cleaning spell james said bitterly rubbing a hand over his buttocks remembering the horrific moment sirius grimaced dontfeel yourself up in public prongs i cantbelieve you dragged me out of a toilet for this james said sullenly going back to his depressed state i going back to myrtle bathroom actually i think i ll go to the prefects it a lot cleaner and smells of lavender remus smirked but you dontknow the password you told me it yesterday bugger cursed remus james was about to storm from the couch and sulkily stomp away to continue drowning himself in a toilet this time a clean one but sirius had forced him to sit what are you james began but stopped when sirius pointed his wand at him sirius james began anxiously dontyou dare melodio sirius called a shining light streaming from his wand and shooting towards james mouth james gaped which wasntthe most sensible move if he didntwand the spell to go into him but nonetheless carried on gawking in shock the light swiftly shot into his mouth and down his oesophagus he gulped it down with a slight wince on his face as if he just swallowed a spoon of cod liver oil he panted whilst sirius and remus waited for a reaction oh my god what did you do james sang my brain all muddled and that tasted like poo he took a brief moment to take in the words he d just said before grimacing at the realization that he had just rhymed awfully bloody hell remus said under his breath say some more stuff prongs sirius egged him on my name is james potter i am a sex god my hair is erotic and i have a great bod he blurted out flowingly sirius jumped up and down in excitement say something about me your name is sirius black you are on crack your face is not in tack all you do is yack you re something i want to whack you have no ball sack okay that enough sirius snapped not liking his poem very much i dontlike this not at all all i see in my mind is rhyming couplets it driving me up the wall and i sound retarded speaking like this oh god help me out of this abyss remus and sirius laughed hysterically finding james demented sentences more and more amusing this isntfunny james was not at all pleased my hair is all gummy he commented rubbing his chewing gum mixed tresses remus and sirius cackled further you cantrhyme every single word there must be one word that you cantrhyme remus pondered aloud nope he can rhyme anything sirius informed say any word and he can do it yellow remus offered mellow james replied quickly banana drama freaky peaky underwear remus said triumphantly you re a pear james answered what that not a word that three words it a word if he says it quickly out of his mouth sirius argued what that makes no sense you can t look it evans sirius said pointing to the displeased lily walking down the staircase unfortunately coming towards them james eyes popped out of his head at her sudden appearance and tried to take on a casual pose involving leaning casually on a table lamp regrettably the lamp shade toppled over making james look like a clumsy arse which he was lily stormed over to james whilst sirius and remus watched in curiosity potter i she started as she folded her arms but stopped as she made a quick sniff in the air towards james you smell like a toilet she declared uh thanks very much i d eat you for lunch james rhymed remus shook his head tiredly as sirius gave james the encouraging thumbs up excuse me lily scowled not liking to be told she would make a great meal look potter she began madly i was trying to do my homework and some small midget in fuchsia came into my dorm asking me if i d seen you you which is apparently a missing person and a possible victim of homicide your lips are like plump leeches kiss me any day your cheeks look like peaches i d devour with no dismay what are you on lily thought james must be high on some new wizarding drug giving side affects of talking terribly in rhyme evans ever since you moaned my name i just cantget you off my brain lily immediately reddened at the mention of the broom closet incident i told you that were a slip of the tongue she gritted through her teeth a slip sirius joined in the conversation oh james jaaaaames he mimicked her kissing derrick swirling his tongue in the air shut up black he on crack james added not able to control his mouth with the ridiculous things he was saying i d have to agree with you there lily said reluctantly but that beside the point she poked james in the chest i dontwant members of your midget fan club storming into my dorm and disturbing me others do have homework to do unlike you who just sits on your pompous arse whilst black worships the ground you walk on lupin corrects your grammar and pettigrew gapes at your useless talent of catching a golden ball oh evans my darling your hate is simply charming you re just using reverse psychology no need for an apology oh go to hell potter lily screamed fed up with his sentences of nonsense this isntgoing so well sirius murmured to remus who sighed in response as if on signal the arrival of james search party through the portrait of the fat lady somehow made everything turn from bad to worse the fuchsia coloured squad of first years led by peter ambled into the common room their eyes suddenly landing on the missing person james potter as james comprehended when this new fashion trend had evolved and how much pain sirius would go through when he ripped out his intestines and strangled him with them the first years suddenly ran towards him nets rose highly in their hands aaarh james screamed as the herd of small students pushed him to the floor and trampled on him each party member raised their net far above the ground capturing his head he shrieked as he was blinded with netting peter james yelled annoyingly the apparent captain of catching james head and also the first to swing his net to james skull we caught him sir the first year with the twitching eye reported to sirius raising his hand with obedience the black haired girl awarded with the whistle blew on it unenthusiastically every two seconds i can see that sirius replied whilst he and remus looked on with twinges of smiles meanwhile lily laughed in hysterics hey a first year spoke up pointing at lily clutching her stomach with laughter at james expense she must have kidnapped him he suddenly concocted instantly lily stopped chortling what get her a small student ordered raising their fist in the air lily shrieked as the first years attacked her causing her head now to be covered in nets she lay on the floor toppled over by their sudden impact get off me she screamed trying to push the swarming small people away they were oddly like irritating flies you cantdo this i a prefect and i d like to shove this whistle up his arse the black haired first year replied pointing to sirius and swinging the whistle around with her finger but apparently i not allowed life a bitch isntit lily was about to snap back but a net whacking her in the mouth disrupted the action explanation to the nets james ordered but it wasntas intimidating with the fact that his head was currently smothered by something animal catchers carried or what will follow will be threats he threatened dangerously they are your search party remus explained organized by one sirius black i gone for two hours and you send a search team i d like to say i flattered but i think it just obscene and i not just referring he spoke to the shirts that are disturbing was it really two hours remus asked sirius thinking the period of james absence had seemed longer come to think of it i think i did see james two hours ago stealing evans lingerie from her dorm sirius realised so that where it went lily tried to shout but her voice was muffled by nets the fuchsia is rather blinding james commented reddening and trying to avoid the subject of lily undergarments as he squinted through the nets looking at the first years fashioned in their bold t shirts sirius you will get a hiding i sorry mate sirius chortled i just canttake you seriously when you rhyme james groaned in frustration tell me the reverse spell or you re going to hell can you actually guarantee that though sirius questioned do you have connections with the devil james gave him a glare that purely said i am the devil instead of voicing it knowing if he did then the warning would be undermined by a cheesy rhyme that would follow aargh get off me you little dwarves lily bawled not one of the wisest things to say if she wanted the first years to stand up from their current status of sitting on top of her so she wouldntescape i am a prefect she exclaimed again yeah yeah the ebony haired girl replied in boredom and i albus dumbledore she retorted i did not kidnap james bloody potter so remove your backsides before i tell professor mcgonagall the violent first years looked at sirius for a confirmation of getting off the girl oh sure you can get off her sirius said as if he d just spotted her in the room the group seemed disappointed but obediently stood up from sitting on lily most gratefully a chubby boy whose bottom was placed firmly on her cheek she finally lifted the dozens of nets that had been suffocating her and stood to her feet looking highly wrathful you re all insane she told the lot of them throwing the nets to sirius caught by surprise the nets knocked into him and he toppled over toppling into remus who then toppled into peter which then caused a chain reaction as many first years toppled over in the process lily gave james a dirty look and stomped up the common room staircase slamming her dormitory door shut can we go now a first year asked raising her hand politely as she yawned sure sirius replied his face currently head first into the common room floor of carpet you re all dismissed the first years cheered and removed their t shirts luckily wearing shirts underneath or the removing of clothing would turn into something disgustingly pornographic they threw their t shirts to peter whose face was suddenly bombarded with fuchsia the small students then retired to their dorms do you think we could sell those shirts at one of those muggle car boot sales sirius asked no i want to keep them peter said with eagerness sure you can wormtail the boys got to their feet peter hands full of t shirts and were about to make their way the common room stairs when an indignant shout was heard guys little help here james demanded head caught in the nets and helplessly rolling on the floor like a flobberworm or be prepared to be kicked in the rear did you hear something sirius formed a mock expression of curiosity for a second there i thought that guy willy shake a spear had walked into the room he laughed shakespeare remus corrected exasperatedly william shakespeare i dontcare about a guy who can shake his spear james yelled all i want is some help here he yelped as he rolled into a table and a stack of books knocked over and tumbled on his head he abruptly blacked out he did not shake his spear he oh never mind remus gave up they walked over to james and tried to uncover him under the mountains of butterfly like nets chapter 4 moony sirius ran over to remus who had been reading a book in peace until his friend jumped on him and his face was suddenly overwhelmed by a head of black hair and strangely fuchsia sirius was looking comically upset as he came up to remus peter at his side wearing the trendy t shirt displaying james mother what asked remus distractedly not taking his eyes off his book sirius sighed at him grabbed remus book from his lap and tossed it into the common room fire sirius cried remus watching as the pages of his book burned in the fireplace that the third book this week you have got to stop doing that i did it for your own good sirius replied remus was not at all grateful for his so called act of good will come on remus books dontteach you nothing peter said and sirius nodded along in agreement it not what in here peter pointed to his head which remus was guessing was empty it about what in here that matters he patted his chest supposedly indicating to his heart remus might have took him seriously if he d not hit his chest too hard which resulted in peter making a painful ow wormtail please stop wearing that shirt remus pleaded ever since he d worn it he d taken on a new persona non grata involving characteristics of a hippy and a permanent feeling of being high i swear pete has an obsession with james mum teased sirius poking him in the stomach i ll have you know that i dress better than the average wizard peter puffed out his chest would your example of an average wizard be sirius because sirius dresses like a clown remus mentioned i told you already the red shoes are trendy red is the new black sirius informed his friends oh god remus muttered purely horrified by the conversation he took a seat back on one of the common room chairs he hoped the chair would swiftly eat him up or drown him in the cushions anyways sirius went on to his true purpose to finding remus i have news of the grave grave news remus tried to correct yeah that the one sirius said well prongs is missing remus presumed how did you know remus sighed lucky guess have you seen him i think he might be upstairs in the dorm if not check the bathrooms remus recommended he still dejected about lily hating him so he may possibly be trying to kill himself again it becoming a daily habit i think we should be worried sirius said thoughtfully remus eyed him with suspicion sirius you didntsend out the search party again did you of course not he scoffed another hour and i will though remus rolled his eyes as sirius and peter exited up to the dormitories just as peter was about to push open the door to their dorm sirius stopped him five galleons prongs is smothering himself with a cushion sirius wagered five he drowning himself in a sink you are so going to lose sirius said shaking hands with peter to secure the deal prongs head is too big to fit in the sink he spoke matter of factly do you think we re bad friends for betting on which choice of suicide he currently doing peter asked no wormtail we re not bad friends sirius disagreed we re bad people peter was slightly confused by the answer but nonetheless entered the dormitory behind sirius they happily found james not so happily in a good mood he was presently trying to hang himself with a tie using the top curtain railing of his bed as the place to tie himself from bugger sirius and peter cursed in unison neither of us won the bet it was amazing how much they cared about james well being go away let me hang myself in peace james shooed them off as he stood on bed unsuccessfully trying to tie a knot in his choking instrument thank god that rhyming spell only lasted a day sirius said with relief prongs you stupid arse he marched up to james and tried to grab the tie from his hands it was a struggle and james was even using his teeth as a weapon to not give in ow sirius cried out as james mouth gnawed at his hand sirius finally managed to pulled the tie off james and put it in the one place he knew james would never go down his pants that was my only tie james said sullenly staring at the tie in its hidden place but then directed his gaze elsewhere because that hidden place was sirius crotch you re buying me a new one he informed not wanting the particular tie to be returned even after being washed james depressingly collapsed on his bed face down in his duvet not caring if he couldntbreathe come on i must have won the bet i was closer because he near pillows sirius said peter nodded and handed over his galleons are you okay prongs peter asked with odd kindness but his good nature was let down by the fact that he was looking at himself in the full length mirror of their dorm admiring his precious fuchsia shirt and body let see in the past two days evans caught me in broom closet and shouted at me then shouted at me for cursing derrick then shouted at me for speaking in rhyme then nearly shouted at me for it somehow being my fault for her head to be smothered with nets james glared at sirius fully but that time she didntshout because she was so angry so let see somehow your great plan padfoot has made everything worse define worse as if i d just walked into a pit of woodlice which is a bad enough misfortune then a swarm of bowtruckles have come along and started eating my woodlice ed flesh well you ve got to be really stupid to walk into a pit of woodlice sirius laughed i dunno see i know a few stupid people hey sirius cried realising who james was referring to seriously guys peter began trying to look at a particular body feature in the mirror which he seemed to prove very difficult does my bottom look big in this pete how can a shirt make your bottom look big you never know it might have one of those engorgement charms peter pointed out will you both just go away james pleaded let me wallow in my own self pity but if we did that we wouldntbe great friends now would we sirius said with a grin jumping on to james bed and somehow making james fling in the air and topple onto the floor arse james muttered exhaling noisily on the floor his new spot to wallow in self pity prongsie prongsie prongsie sirius sighed james immediately panicked oh no donttell me you ve got another plan i dontwant to hear it sirius james blocked his ears but this plan is really really good sirius protested jumping excitedly on james bed like a hyperactive six year old you ll break my mattress you pillock james yelled sirius carried on jumping as if it were a bouncy castle until his head connected with the ceiling then he decided to stop ow sirius muttered painfully anyway i have a great plan that involves a polyjuice potion he sang a polyjuice potion james repeated anxiously what are you a parrot jeez a polyjuice potion but they take at least a month to make james reminded him glad of this factor because this great plan of sirius would undoubtedly go wrong ahar sirius replied knowingly and made a signal to peter if you would reveal wormtail peter looked a bit annoyed from being interrupted his mirror examining but walked over to sirius bed anyway and pulled a cauldron of bubbling muddy potion from underneath it you ve been keeping a cauldron of polyjuice potion under your bed james exclaimed wincing at the sight of the disgusting liquid you dontwant to know what under my bed sirius replied mysteriously winking so how exactly will polyjuice potion make evans fall in love with me james enquired wormtail explain peter tried to remember the instructions sirius will use the potion to turn into you and then seduce evans what james spat in disbelief genius isntit sirius said like i always say if prongs cantget a job done then do it yourself you ve never said that peter pointed out since now sirius added are you insane james looked at sirius as if he d turned down the offer of free chocolate you re not turning into me no bloody way tough luck potter unexpectedly sirius jumped from the bed and onto james back he cried out loudly in pain what are you doing james yelled indignantly get off me sitting on him sirius twisted his arms behind his back and tied them up whilst james struggled tie his legs wormtail sirius commanded he swore as james wiggling headbutted his jaw stop moving i going to kill you two let go of me rape james shouted hoping it would get catch attention of some kind from outside their dorm and get him out of this horrific yet humorous situation not caring if he was getting the wrong sort peter howled in pain as james furious jerking feet smacked him in the nose help james carried on screaming rape ra sirius swiftly stuffed a sock in his mouth there we go he climbed off james and rubbed his hands together to signal a job well done james lay on the floor hands and legs tied and mouth blocked with a smelly sock that had belonged on the floor for the past six years muuuffttt fuuuccchh james mumbled mouth full of cotton prongs sirius shook his head disappointedly at james guessing whatever he d definitely not for young ears to hear no bad language in front of the children peter yelped as he quickly found himself deaf but then realised it was only because sirius hands were covering his ears right o sirius walked over to the cauldron that was placed on the floor it ready padfoot peter informed stirring the potion with his wand sirius brightened now all we need is the hair james promptly made unrecognisable noises of protest and shook his head in frenzy dontworry prongs all i need is a strand or two but we ll make it a clump just to be on the safe side sirius added to peter james formed a muffled yelp at this information and tried to roll across the floor as some form of escape but sirius had pounced on him again look prongs i ll do a countdown sirius put his foot on james back to prevent him from moving on the count of three i ll put out a hair james furiously shook his head in response of course sirius ignored him one he counted then swiftly thrust his hand forward and pulled out a fistful of hair james silently roared of agony clamping his teeth down on the sock currently choking him he glared at sirius for the shortened countdown he lied peter said in what he thought was a helpful tone james grumbled angrily and tried to get to his feet but only stumbled and fell back on the floor ah bless him sirius dropped the strands of hair in a glass of potion he d scooped up and the liquid turned a strange blue hmm matches your mood prongs he commented peter sniffed the mixture it smells foul he pointed out the obvious thanks for the encouragement sirius remarked kicking off his shoes and changing into some stolen clothes belonging to james well sirius began with odd anxiety examining the blue draught cheers he held the glass high peter sent him an uncertain smile of good luck sirius tilted his head and back and swallowed a gulp of the potion slamming the glass back down on the bedside table once finished oh boy sirius stumbled clutching his stomach that felt swimming with wriggling worms he felt his skin melting and bubbling on the surface peter and james eyes widened as they watched sirius transform before their eyes the boy groaned in pain as he felt himself become taller his face remodelling and hair shortening in length aargh sirius shrieked blinking deliberately on purpose i blind this of course was great exaggeration his sight slightly blurry and out of vision because his sight was no longer a sirius sight but now a james sight peter conjured up glasses using his wand and put them on sirius who sighed with relief ah so that what they re for sirius straightened the glasses on his nose james sent him an annoyed look of exasperation wow peter said under his breath staring at sirius who was now james identical twin sirius excitedly ran up to the full length mirror and observed his new body well you certainly have firmer buttocks than me sirius discovered feeling his new bottom james looked outraged so plan b of seducing evans has begun he did a famous james potter ruffle through his hair and grinned to the real james who was still muffling obscene insults at him i ll see you in an hour or two sirius told him patting him on the back but you never know it could be shorter it sometimes takes me seconds for a girl to fall at my feet he clicked his fingers peter chuckled to himself sirius charm was not that good or even good at all the new james grinned in anticipation and made his way towards the exit of the dorm um sirius peter asked stopping him what peter looked at him strangely still a little confused by the fact that there were two james in the room and that the james he was talking to was actually sirius black shouldntwe do something about prongs a glimmer of hope rose in the real james potter stomach for a second he thought that maybe this was some sort of joke and that his two supposed friends would release him oh yeah sirius realised scratching his chin let hide him in the bathroom james jaw somehow dropped although it was stuffed by a sock he whimpered as sirius and peter dragged him by the arms and legs and positioned him next to the thankfully flushed toilet they waved goodbye to him as they shut the door the second he was alone he tried again to stand up but that only lead to his head colliding painfully with the bathroom sink also knocking over a few toiletries and somehow getting him covered in toothpaste remus sat by the common room fire slowly nodding off although it was past midday on a sunday he had a lack of books to read as most of them had been set on fire by sirius so sat in boredom in the common room he sighed getting to his feet and intending to go up to the dorm to find out whether sirius and peter had found their lost marauder again however he saw james who was in fact sirius tumbling down the staircase with peter closely behind hello there sirius cried mightily running up to remus and punching him in the arm in a brotherly way remus never got the attitude of brotherly ways and clutched his arm in pain hello there remus replied uncertainly wondering why james was in such a good mood after being thoroughly depressed about lily lack of love towards him his eyes landed on peter who had found a pair of dark glasses wearing them to match his cool t shirt you re wearing them to protect your eyes from that bright shirt remus suggested peter gasped at him moony you are hilarious sirius punched him on the arm again ow what up with you james remus asked confusedly rubbing his shoulder for a few seconds sirius forgot that he was in fact james potter and how was now called james so daydreamed as he gazed at a few girls on the other side of the common room james sirius stared on blankly prongs remus repeated louder panicking peter elbowed sirius in the stomach and he snapped to attention huh oh yeah that me sirius laughed merrily he james potter peter added remus gave him an odd look yes peter i can see that sirius and peter feigned laughter whilst remus wondered if they d been smoking something illegal upstairs so i bet you re wondering where that handsome fellow sirius black is right sirius changed the subject remus frowned not really those exact words well he s er snogging that seventh year girl from ravenclaw marianne smith sirius explained heartily pleased for thinking up an excuse for his absence remus abruptly burst into laughter prongs you re kidding right sirius narrowed his eyes she hates him remember no she doesn t sirius argued yeah she does remus thought he was reminding james remember when she told us that she rather kiss a chimera than go anywhere padfoot mouth he laughed clutching his stomach oh yeah sirius said bitterly not liking the new details he d learned ha ha she in denial that one right remus cocked his head in confusion whatever you say prongs anyway sirius pulled peter by the arm and walked hurriedly towards the portrait must dash things to do where are you going remus enquired disappointed it seemed he wasntinvolved to seduce evans sirius winked no seriously where are you going sirius rolled his eyes is it so hard to hear that james potter is going to win over evans he asked him then repeated the question in his mind and realised that it did seem pretty unbelievable just as sirius and peter were about to step through the exit sirius quickly remembered a significant note dontgo upstairs moony sirius warned him remus raised his eyebrows in suspicion not that there anything dodgy up there but er just stay down here okay ta ta he waved he james potter peter added again pointing to sirius as he followed him through the portrait remus definitely believed his theory that they d smoked something illegal upstairs with a sigh he watched them leave the common room nevertheless he decided to follow his instincts ignore sirius advice and go up to the dorm anyway he ambled up the stairs pushed the door open and discovered the dorm to be empty and relatively normal their dorm was still ridiculously messy and still smelt oddly of chocolate shrugging his shoulders he walked over to his bed and tiredly collapsed onto it he yawned his eyes shut and hand clutching his neck all of a sudden rather thirsty sluggishly he reached over to the bedside table feeling a glass with his fingers and guessing it to be full of water putting it to his lips it was only until he opened his eyes swallowing the blue liquid that he realised it was not water what the he began in horror wincing at the taste of the liquid and aware that there were strands of hair falling out of his mouth he felt sudden uncontrollable churning in his stomach he staggered to his feet groaning in pain as he felt his skin bubbling which he never thought was humanly possible until now his limbs and face were sore and his clothes seemed to be shrinking or more correctly he was growing with the abrupt feeling of sickness he quickly ran to the dorm bathroom and opened the door in need of the toilet huh remus said confusedly my eyes his vision was suddenly blurred though he could make out a person lying on the bathroom floor he fumbled for his reading glasses in his pocket and put them on his sight still slightly obscured but enough to make out who the boy was laying in front of him james remus said in disbelief wondering why or even how james had managed to get himself tied up in the bathroom strangely covered in toothpaste when he d seen him minutes earlier leaving the common room with peter mufffhhh james mumbled with the sock in his mouth glaring at him and remus wondered what on earth he d done wrong to be glowered at now feeling marginally normal and no signs of being ill he glanced at the bathroom mirror and then turned back to james remus eyes then widened in realisation turning back to the mirror for a second look aaargh his reflection as james potter stared back at him chapter 5 oh merlin remus poked his james potter cheeks he now owned then ran a hand through his present dark messy hair no way he said under his breath untamed hair rrhhuh james mumbled from the corner signalling to remus to get his attention back on the real james potter with a sock in his mouth however remus attention was much elsewhere how could this have happened remus asked hysterically examining his arms and hands arms like runner beans as sirius poetically described rrhhuh james mumbled louder and more impatient he was choking on a filthy sock and covered in toothpaste overall not in the slight bit happy in his bewildered state remus bent down to his knees and untied james arms and legs feeling he would get gratitude from being rescued he was a little shocked to have the berserk james spring on him i gonna behead you sirius james exclaimed grabbing remus neck or oddly his own neck as remus now looked like him it was a strange feeling to be strangling himself yet he didntseemed to find himself stopping anytime soon what are you talking about remus yelled choking i not sirius i remus james was still not convinced assuming he was lying you said the word gonna which is grammatically incorrect use going to he rectified hoping james would see he was actually remus lupin at his words james quickly dropped his hands from his neck in realisation moony you drank the polyjuice potion too polyjuice potion remus repeated oh no he groaned now realising what he d drank from the bedside table this is ridiculous i saw you james i think leaving the common room with peter that must have been sirius james said bitterly kicking the sink in frustration which led to him howling in pain why did sirius even use the potion to turn into you in the first place remus found himself already answering the question himself lily that girl causes me all kinds of trouble james commented wiping toothpaste that somehow gotten onto his face so remus started slowly i you and sirius is also you shit james groaned slamming his head against the bathroom wall please donttell me there are three james potters currently in hogwarts is that what you want to hear not particularly james slammed his head against the wall every two seconds sounding like a regular drum beat then no remus lied there are not three james potters in school today although one has gone off to seduce lily he remembered james telling him in the common room moments before whilst two james potters are currently in this bathroom one contemplating therapy after this is over two contemplating therapy corrected james right remus pinched his unfamiliar james potter arm to try and wake himself from this horrifying nightmare unfortunately it wasnta dream and now remus only had bruises due to too hard finger pinching dontdo that to yourself i mean to me er james stopped puzzling himself by his words i ve had a disturbing morning he explained noticing remus odd look sirius felt his buttocks in front of me er i mean my buttocks well you know what i mean and now i talking to you who looks like me and i think i going insane you think you re going insane i you i thought i was drinking water and now i you and my trousers are too tight and my shirt is breaking my ribs hey you should find it honour to be james potter james said oddly cheerful considering the circumstances great now i hysterical he realised he shouldntbe feeling uplifting considering sirius black was walking around hogwarts in his body saying stuff in his body and doing stuff in his body we have to go find sirius james grabbed for his robe what remus paled james you cantgo running after sirius because he looks exactly like you what are people going to say if they see both of you at the same time everyone will go crazy i dontcare james said shortly look james remus tried to remain calm i ll come help you look for sirius but we have to wear some sort of disguises so we wontbe recognised okay stubbornly james remained silent and crossed his arms please james he begged you dontknow how strange it is to see myself look so pathetic james grumbled remus raised his eyebrows alright alright we ll wear your bloody disguises he gave in pulled along by the boy who looked like him towards sirius wooden chest beside his bed well this is mental james was now wearing a red sparkly dress with the tassels the exact dress he wore when he was hammered on his sixteenth party why this was his disguise so he would not be recognised why women clothing moony why why why we ll have more of a chance of not being identified remus explained uncomfortably lowering the skirt on waist he was not wearing a dress but more of a sophisticated number of a skirt and a flowery lace shirt but this is mental james repeated looking at his body in revulsion one because he was wearing a red dress and two because it seemed to suit him why does it appear as if i ve seen this dress before one word alcohol remus said simply repositioning the wig on his head he now owned black hair that cascaded past his shoulders and he did not like having long hair due to the fact that it kept irritating him by covering his eyes and also kept getting dangled around his neck he was certainly glad he was not a girl or sirius black why do i feel like you re enjoying this james asked bitterly he straightened the wig on his head light blonde wavy tresses that were a drastic colour change from his dark messy brown trust me cross dressing was not on my list of things to do today cross dressing was not on my list of things to do ever james retorted merlin knows why sirius owns all this fancy dress stuff he said with disgust you know sirius he protests his girlfriends thought the costumes were kinky remus examined a pair of tight leather trousers from arm length and tossed it back into the chest are we done now or do you want to put make up or condition your hair or something teased james remus pulled a face at him alright we can go i think we ve been disguised enough but you have to wear these he handed james horrid objects of torture high heel shoes no no no no james cried at once backing away he shielded his eyes as though the footwear would blind him i am not wearing those those things remus sighed in exasperation you cantwear those school shoes with that dress he pointed out thrusting the high heels towards him james batted his hand away since when have you become the bloody fashion consultant just put them on you re wasting time no way james shook his head they are practically towers on your feet they lift you at least five foot off the ground he complained i think you mean five inches besides you play quidditch you re used to heights remus smiled in satisfaction as james failed to find an excuse for his great quidditch abilities whatever james answered childishly i not wearing them so you can stick those heel high things up your arse you ll wear them remus threatened sounding oddly like a parent or you wontgo at all i am going and without wearing those bloody shoes no seriously you have to wear them because sirius took your school shoes what no he james started to argue then stared down at his bare feet bastard he grabbed the disgusting shoes from remus and swiftly put them on they re my new ones as well sirius burnt my last ones i had to walk around with holes in them for two sodding weeks okay then remus dusted off his girly clothes and put on a pair of flat sandals he found much to james annoyance let get this over with james flicked his blonde hair over his shoulder and walked unstably towards the exit of the dorm i think james has man boobs sirius decided examining his chest what do you think wormtail no comment replied peter watching sirius in james body clutching his chest was rather horrifying shouldntwe get back to the plan oh yeah sirius remembered they were walking along the corridor and had just passed the great hall and got momentarily distracted by the food now munching on fairy cakes right finding whatserface sirius said lips plastered with cake crumbs we ve checked the library and all those bookworm places let check the grounds peter moaned but it cold outside well you should have brought a jumper but it would have covered my shirt peter readjusted his dark glasses puffing out his chest right sirius shot peter an odd look let go outside he said again in the need of fresh air ow ow ow howled james stopping in the corridor and leaning against the wall for the twentieth time in the last ten minutes james and remus had gotten some curious looks as they walked around the castle students had simply thought they were girls visiting from another school that dressed very extravagantly with matching low male voices bloody girly shoes james lifted a leg up and rubbed his foot that was covered in blisters we have to keep moving or we ll never find sirius in time remus pressed dragging james by the arm james stumbled as he was balancing on one leg being literally pulled by himself he would never get used to be being ordered by someone that looked exactly like him i ve never felt like punching myself in the face until now james said under his breath i dontknow where on earth lily or sirius is we ll have to ask someone remus suggested as if on cue a passing seventh year slytherin walking down the corridor spotted them coking an eyebrow along with a cheeky smile the boy approached them hello there ladies the slytherin growled cornering james and remus against a wall james frowned at the stranger whilst remus smacked james on the arm for coming across as rude hello there remus greeted the boy politely changing his voice higher to match a girl s much too high that it sounded squeaky like a chipmunk hello james put in unenthusiastically remus glared at him ordering with his eyes to act more like a girl or they may be found out i mean james feigned a smile and fluttered his eyelashes twisting a strand of his fake blonde hair around his finger hi he said brightly too brightly then he nearly deafened the slytherin the nameless boy smiled more relaxed at james sudden attentiveness i ve never seen you two here before what your names my name re remus abruptly stopped when he realised he was just about to give his real name er re anna my name rhiana who your sister the boy asked figuring remus and james were related due to their exact faces ja remus quickly stepped on his foot before he made the same mistake of giving his boy name when he was posing as a girl ja melia it jamelia james grunted are you visiting from another school the slytherin asked with curiosity um yeah remus agreed uncertainly we re from beauxbatons he remembered the name of the school from a book he d read beauxbatons really james rolled his eyes no we re lying he replied dryly immediately remus burst into fake anxious laughter and forced james to join in ignore my sister remus squeaked she just shy james scowled folding his arms in a blatant mood so you re like from france the slytherin questioned james barked a laugh beauxbatons isntin france you tit remus exasperatingly shook his head in frustration i think you ll find it is the slytherin rectified shooting james an odd look ignore jamelia remus faked laughter once more we ve just been visiting the astronomy classroom she smelled too much of the fumes james sneered at the slytherin when he wasntlooking right so your accents they dontsound very french the boy noticed we re from scotland james blurted out remus gave him a bizarre look wondering what on earth possessed james to say that scotland but you donthave scottish accents we were brought up in england remus lied hesitantly then we moved to france james went on and went to beauxbatons remus finished wow the boy said in interest you ve certainly travelled a lot yes we know french james conjured with arrogance remus looked at him furiously for the ridiculous things he was making up if he was going to lie then at least make up something remotely believable i know french too the slytherin announced james and remus faces dropped in worry vous les deux regard tourdissant magnifiquement etes vous les deux seul the boys turned white neither of them knew what the hell he was rambling on about although they had a feeling he was flirting with them both wee james answered uncertainly remembering sirius telling him that either the word piss or wee was yes in french his lucky guess was right and the slytherin looked happy at his answer un baiser dans votre pays n est il pas une salutation de bonjour est ce que a vous ennuierait si je vous ai embrass les deux the slytherin asked winking er wee james repeated again wishing this conversation would be over very very soon the boy somehow brightened even more at his reply and leaned towards him and remus with pouted lips and closed eyes um we were looking for james potter remus yelled putting his hands in front of his face whilst james had frozen with horror and disgust at what the slytherin nearly did with his dirty mouth the boy swiftly opened his eyes and stopped closing towards them james potter he said disappointedly backing away from them yeah that gorgeous hunk james made a smug smile the one who got the balls to hit on someone in english the slytherin glared at him he tried for sixth years to do that with lily evans and has failed he glowered and james advanced forward so do you know where he is remus interrupted pushing james back the slytherin smiled at remus taking a shine to him and not to his blonde sister i think i saw him going to the lake with pettigrew the boy mentioned thanks we must get going remus said hurriedly dragging james by the arm he looked as if he might remove the high heel from his shoe and stab the boy in the head high heel more like high hell james muttered painfully stumbling as he ran down the corridor and towards the entrance of the school the slytherin watched them retreat down the corridor wearing a puzzled expression weird sisters french birds are strange he noted lily stood by the lake inches away from the water as she looked at her reflection her mind was distracted currently doodling initials of a certain j and p in the notebook she was holding loosely in her hand she had been daydreaming until a sudden shout startled her nearly making her fall in the water booo sirius yelled poking lily back to get an even more scaring effect aargh lily shouted holding onto the apparent james arm as she nearly stumbled into the water she pulled away from him once she d regained her balance recognizing the boy what are you doing here potter she asked uncomfortably shutting the notebook away from his suspicious eyes i ve been looking for you evans sirius growled with seductiveness lily frowned at the messy haired boy well i like to go to the lake to be alone she emphasized turning her attention to the squid splashing in the water no evans you misunderstand sirius spoke in a deep voice only making lily narrow her eyes i ve been looking for someone like you all my life the redhead reddened familiarly with anger will you shut up with your cheesy chat up lines why cantyou just be yourself dontdeny your love for me evans my love for you lily gaped at him i cantbelieve how arrogant you are she said in disbelief it unsettling all the things i do i do for you evans sirius said theatrically grabbing her hand furious than ever she snatched her hand away and hit him with her notebook get over yourself she said in between smacks sirius shielded his head pathetically c mon evans i do everything for you i make you dinner you have never made me a meal except for that frog spawn soup you gave me in the hospital wing once when i was ill sirius laughed that was great prank i did he said smugly of course sirius had been the culprit to change james bowl of chicken soup for a laugh sirius grew buck teeth after james found out i do your laundry sirius protested you stole my underwear lily yelled indignantly i needed a bra to fling stones at the birds sirius argued they were pooping on the windows lily cried out in frustration when will you ever grow up a six year old has more maturity than you posses but i clean your dishes you licked my plate of remains of gravy with your tongue she said distastefully sirius had to cringe admitting that the particular james potter moment of cleaning lily plates to get her germs was not one of james finest hours so what if james is a disgusting pig will you just go out with him so he will stop stalking you and interrupting my busy schedule with beautiful girls by thinking of multiple ways of ending his life why are you referring to yourself as a third person err sirius winced realizing he would have to go onto plan c of the many great plans of winning evans over quickly sirius signalled to peter who d been hiding behind a nearby bush peter nodded in understanding and revealed himself wailing as he ran up to lily what on earth is that noise she murmured wondering why she could hear a bloke deafening animal call she turned around and was greeted with peter pettigrew shrieking as he pushed her in the lake her body hit the water with an almighty splash ta wormtail sirius thanked him because there was an actual plan to lily being pushed in the water somehow putting lily in danger and james saving her would apparently make the red haired beauty fall in love with him in only idiot eyes lily was currently drowning in the lake oh my goodness a boy said from the edge of the water eyes widening as he saw lily wailing her arms and legs in panic a crowd of students had gathered by the lake now everyone becoming upset girls screaming unnecessarily people pretending they knew lily to get involved and gain sympathy from others dontworry i ll save you the boy yelled to lily throwing off his robes and intending to enter the lake sirius quickly stopped him oi get your own drowning girl the boy frowned confusedly at him but nonetheless backed off sirius pulled off his robes and graciously took his time whilst he undressed to save lily life er sirius maybe you should hurry up peter suggested pointing to the lake where lily was yelping her arms were waving in the air as she cried for help her head slowly going under alright dontget your knickers in a twist i coming sirius replied nonchalantly he made a run up and then dived into the water of the lake peter was unfortunately splashed from head to foot in the process my shirt peter fell over from the impact of the water sirius landed in the lake coughing for air as his head surfaced in the water he could make out lily by his side desperately trying to breathe as the water was climbing into her mouth and ears this was the moment when sirius realised that he couldntswim help he screamed pathetically using lily as some sort of float which didnthelp as he made lily head sink further under water help meeeee what going on down there remus asked as he and james wandered across the grounds gathered by the lake was a crowd of screaming students in complete chaos hey scuse me james asked a hysterical third year who was running back towards the school what going on the girl looked at her strangely wondering why she had such a low voice for a girl and what possessed her to wear such a hideous dress haventyou heard apparently some couple are trying to commit some love pact suicide by drowning themselves in the lake the girl said before running off james and remus wore the same horrified look sprinting off move let me through james commanded pushing past a swarm of second years who were pointing towards the water dontmake me stab your eyes out with my high heels he yelled threateningly the second years quickly made space for him to pass finally the boys managed to get themselves through the throng of people and gaped in horror to find sirius and lily submerged in the water remus looked to peter who was sitting on the ground deeply upset and mumbling something about his pink fuchsia t shirt being ruined help meee sirius was hollering i thought james potter could swim a girl asked her friend apparently not oh god lily james bawled in horror watching her struggle to keep her head above the water the fact that she was not screaming for help or at least screaming insults at james was
