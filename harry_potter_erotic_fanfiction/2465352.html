thirty back here see ya enid flounced off lily cruised around for about ten minutes when she found herself standing in front of a small quidditch store that she had never seen before lily pushed open the door and looked around at the small shop there were broomsticks on racks behind the desk quidditch magazines right by the door but what interested lily most was a stand in the corner of the store labeled quidditch personalized there were little figures of quidditch players which actually moved on tiny flying broomsticks and separate flying miniature brooms and even sets of quidditch balls and pitches lily was startled by a tap on the shoulder and she turned around to see an old man around fifty wearing inch thick glasses which creepily magnified his grey eyes can i help you miss the shop

staying for a second and confirming the pictures that show up of you and this james fellow lily nodded and followed him to the computer yes that me she said looking at a picture on the screen of her sitting and swinging on the swing beside the lake in the hogwarts grounds surrounded by her friends where do you get these she was now studying the picture of james beside her own he was pretending to duel sirius with his shoe and sirius was laughing and responding with a banana it was a truly character capturing image of the two jokers yes that james on the right good now come back at five to pick them up will you have a nice day and you can pay now lily said thank you and dug in her purse for the money enid was having less luck than lily in finding gifts for her friends james sirius peter and remus were easy dungbombs a book of hexes chocolate and quidditch magazines but what the hell was she supposed to get lily lydia and christine then enid spotted the shop that sirius and lydia had found last hogsmeade weekend ewww cutesy name enid thought wrinkling her nose just right for lydia as soon as she was in the shop enid spotted a really nice necklace it was a midnight blue stone set in a silver e frame on a silver chain enid was half way to the pay desk when she remembered who she was supposed to be shopping for christine who had been woken by the excitement in the common room that morning had gotten out of bed and followed lily and enid to hogsmeade then she had followed enid when she and lily had split up and was planning to bump into her by chance in honeydukes as soon as enid left the jewelry shop carrying lydia bracelets in a small bag christine who had been hiding behind a group of random third years all giving her funny looks shot into the shop and grabbed the necklace enid had been looking at a n the following would hardly have happened but this is pretend remember lydia am i supposed to feel bad for spying on your friends sirius asked as lydia ducked and pulled him around a corner waiting for christine to leave the shop no it for her own good i need to find her enid and lilys presents and it helps if they want what they get plus i need to find you a present and james and remus and peter geez what the heck do you want for christmas anyway i hate the person who came up with gift giving so what do you want i dunno see that why i hate it no one knows what they want but if given it they know exactly what they dontwant cruddy hypocritical people speaking of hypocrites what do you want for christmas sirius grinned at lydia i don t sirius you know i hate it when you re right which is like all the time so cantyou just pretend not to be a smart ass git for once i can be bribed sirius stroked his chin thoughtfully oh for god sake lydia turned from her spying and stood on her tip toes she pressed her lips against his and even allowed his tongue to enter her mouth a n i think this is one of the grossest things possible but hey to each their own now will you shut up and cooperate lydia sighed sirius looked rather stunned hey i was only talking nothing wrong with my cooperation come on she gone lydia had resumed her post and was now tugging on sirius shirt for him to follow in the store lydia looked around she sniffed the air and commented enid was here before christine her perfume is pine y and christine smell is fruit y so christine was probably picking up a present for enid what about this for christine sirius laughed and held up a puke green and hot pink feathered hat lydia stuck her tongue out at him and headed for the skirt section have you noticed that christine doesntwear skirts too often she should she has nice legs and i hate her for it i dunno i kinda like your legs sirius slipped his arm around her waist and rubbed her side lydia raised her eyebrows sirius bent slightly and kissed her sirius she whined as he kissed her neck i need to find presents for people and you doing that is just distracting me but it distracting you in a good way right sirius grinned looking adorable lydia poked his ribs and turned back to the skirt rack she found a tan knee length wrap around one which she concluded would be perfect for christine then she found a really sweet golden book pendant also for christine and a fuzzy purple scarf set with matching gloves for enid and was just inquiring into the price of a ring for lily when lily herself walked in blowing on her hands why lily what a nice surprise i never expected to see you here lydia smiled guiltily and shoved the ring behind her into sirius hands so that he could put it back on the shelf without lily noticing sure sure lydia listen i needed to ask you anyway what should i get for mum dad petunia you christine i got her a joke present but i need something serious peter and remus sirius butted in hopefully does this mean you got me james and enid presents already i hate you and enid and james so no lily smiled sarcastically but why do you hate james my ickwle buddy hasntdone anyfink to you silly lily sirius tilted his head to one side and look sweetly confused lily rolled her eyes and looked back to lydia for advice on presents we ll lydia considered dragging lily to the next aisle rings so sirius couldntoverhear them i need a present for sirius desperately and while you re there you might as well help me with my mum dad james remus and peter okay well why dontwe do a double present for remus and peter so like for each one you get a something and i get a something to go with your something get it yeah but what do you think remus would want a box of chocolates and then you could get him a box of every flavour beans okay original i think not but i have no better suggestions so let get him that and peter the same only different candy like lollipops and chocolate frogs lily turned to follow lydia back to sirius when something caught her eye it was a ring a guy silver ring there was a black celtic cross on it and lily thought it was the most attractive ring for guys duh that she had ever seen lydia wait look at this i have to buy this i know it a guy ring but i have to buy it sirius followed lydia to lily and inspected the ring hey you have something in common with if you say who i think you re going to say i will ram that pointy thing up your nose lily indicated a magical knitting needle menacingly james he would really love that ring ya know hint hint sirius smiled defiantly lily moved towards the needle but was distracted by christine popping up out of nowhere hey lily why arentyou meeting with enid half an hour is long over lily looked at her watch and said no it isn t what are you talking about i have five minutes before i half to meet up with her anyway lily gave christine a funny look before taking the ring to the store clerk i was trying to get her to leave so i can buy the ring for her seriously i ve been doing that all day and oh crap i shouldntbe telling you this so lily wait up christine hurried to the desk after lily sirius and lydia both exchanged amused looks where is she enid muttered to herself she was waiting for lily outside madam puddyfoot where they had agreed to meet but lily wasntthere yet where is who james popped up behind her wah oh james you re mean you know that and anyway i dontthink you want to know who enid said turning to face him why wouldnti james was being all na ve it lily oh james said and then remembering her tone the night before when he had said all that junk about other escorts and splitting up after their dance he tried to ask enid i want to ask you something has she ever is she enid understood what james wanted to know and told him with a few of her own theories mixed in she still crazy about you and you re still being a prick about it she hasntgone out with anyone and she thinks you hate her now which isnttrue is it you re like a mind reader it kind of creepy i think you re going to be the next cassandra kershista but thanks a n cassandra kershista is the hogwarts divination teacher great great great niece of cassandra the great enid i found this gorgeous guy ring and sirius was being all oh sorry i ll wait lily stopped dead in her tracks as she saw james no it alright lils geez this sounds like the part in the movie where i introduce you to james but since you already know him enid joked movie james was confused some muggles write stories in scripts and then film them which is recording people performing the scripts with costumes and roles i love movies you should really take muggle studies next year james lily explanation just confused james even more i agree enid giggled maybe they ll teach you who brad pitt is both she and lily erupted into fresh waves of laughter brad pitt sounds like a deodorant ha ha james lily said sarcastically he happens to be a talented actor and super hot hey guys what up christine bounced over then decided she didntwant to know seeing enid and lily giggling like mad let go arentyou supposed to meet everyone else at honeydukes like now ooooops enid and lily stopped giggling everyone met up in honeydukes and they wandered the streets of hogsmeade buying stuff when they passed shops that looked interesting it was four twenty when lily checked her watch and asked her friends to wait for her outside the three broomsticks then she ran all the way to the quidditch store and picked up her christmas presents from stanley who said thank you come again soon and merry christmas it was just four forty when lily arrived out of breath from all of the running outside the three broomsticks pub i have to go lily told her friends ball rehearsal k bye have fun oh i should go to d you mind james asked lily if he could go with her not at all remus she replied quite cheerfully the other marauders kept winking obviously at one another much to james and lily chagrin then remus answered not just yet thanks i ll be along in a few just have to buy a drink lily raised an eyebrow at remus as if she didntbelieve him and then gave him a pleading sort of stare as if expecting him to come to his senses and accompany them he didn t so she had no choice but to turn and start up the street with james they had turned the corner not speaking when lily laughed suddenly what james asked curiously oh nothing lily laughed again it stupid really no really what james wouldntdrop it so lily explained it just my friend adam from home he told me this load of junk which happens to be all he tells me about every time there is an awkward silence a gay baby is born i know it stupid but every time there an awkward silence i just start thinking gay baby gay baby gay baby and it just really makes me laugh course then it makes me homesick which isntso good but it starts out as something that makes me laugh which is the point really a n sorry i have nothing against gays lesbians hetero sexuals it is just something one of my friends told me and it seemed like it fit the moment no offence was meant by it oh james laughed i think i heard that somewhere too so it really makes you homesick yeah i guess dontyou ever get homesick no i guess not i mean my dads always at the ministry he works there my mums always out shopping or with her friends or organizing parties and my friends are all here well mainly i donthave any siblings the only things i have to miss are my room my pool and my library your pool you have a pool lily gaped and james nodded so she continued i ve always wanted a pool but my sister petunia cantswim so she doesntwant my parents to get one and of course they listen and library i would love to have a library i never took you for a library misser you always seemed more like a cindy crawford poster misser i like books i guess i mean i ll never read like you do but they re alright by my standards and cindy crawford d you mean lolita crawford and the walk up to the castle continued like that lily and james both seemed like they were enjoying themselves laughing talking then they reached the entrance hall to the castle professor mcgonagoll professor dumbledore the hufflepuffs and the head boy and girl were the only ones there mr potter miss evans how nice dumbledore smiled good naturedly at them we are just waiting for the ravenclaws the slytherins and the last griffindor now while you are here you might as well place your song choices with julia and randolph lily requested her song and then james asked randolph for a song catch me if i fall by the lost a wizarding band that doesntsound depressing at all lily teased him because he had spent a great deal of time telling her that usher was depressing because he was such a bad singer a n do not listen to james usher is hot and talented it a good song you ll like it was all james would say about it to which lily responded oh and i suppose you know this because i really predictable and you know everything about me james didnthave to answer this because everyone else had finally arrived and dumbledore chose that moment to command their attention at the ball your classmates and fellow wizarding schools will be down here watching as two by two you come down the staircase from the bottom of the stairs you will follow your head boy and girl into the great hall for a christmas dinner and that will be followed by dancing that is what we shall practice now starting from the stairs he gestured for everyone to climb the staircase and waited until they were all at the top to speak again now you start to descend when the pair in front of you is situated at the bottom of the staircase please begin the head boy and girl first julia walked to the edge of the staircase and placed her arm through randolph s they began to walk slowly down the middle of the staircase neither of them holding the railing then the next pair lined up and so on until james couldntstand it anymore come on either hurry it up or trip you bloody morons are you so damn thick that you cantfigure out how to walk down stairs james lily giggled shh they ll hear you well they might not because they must think the normal pace of talking and walking is in hyper speed cause they re going so slowly seriously it just a staircase it doesnttake a normal person that long to climb down a staircase oh and i suppose you would prefer it if we were all flying down lily smiled at her escort well maybe but these wankers are probably even slower on their broomsticks because their fat heads slow them down james grinned back at lily just do me a favour okay what dontlet me fall and if you can avoid it dontlet me make a fool of myself remember i haventdone this before evans just stick close to me from all these years of those stupid parties i and expert james grinned again and seeing that they were next offered lily his arm lily smiled and slid her arm through his her heart pulsing furiously james potter griffindor house quidditch captain and lily evans griffindor house prefect professor mcgonagoll voice rang out across the hall james steered lily towards the first step as she whispered to him chauvinists why is it always the guys name first james snorted and replied because we are obviously the superior sex lily pinched his hand and swore to stand on his toe in her heels he winced at the thought wonderful dumbledore clapped his hands as lily and james reached the bottom of the stairs my only suggestion for improvement is that you work harder to conceal your laughter dumbledore winked at them before turning to watch the next pair coming down the marble staircase there were three pairs left to go down the stairs two slytherins lucius malfoy and narcissa black remus and marrella both smiling nervously at one another and carter hall very good looking ravenclaw quidditch captain with kate orr his prefect girlfriend james and lily spent the rest of the rehearsal stepping on each other feet for fun when they were dancing flirting and making fun of the other pairs they were having such a good time that they completely forgot how uncomfortable they usually were around each other james over here sirius called it was seven o clock in the evening after the ball rehearsal and james and sirius had sneaked back to hogsmeade so that sirius could show james the necklace that lydia had spotted for lily that great james said picking up the necklace and examining it jesus i think it real gold the salesperson trotted over to them and said yes zir zat ise von of ze onle r ale gold pieces zat ve haf eet ise razere pricey as you engleesh might say i ll take it james said wincing at the french ness of the dude a n sorry to all of the french people because i cantwrite accents very well as you can see above no offence was meant author note see what i meant by can be offensive if taken the wrong way it all meant well anyway the next chapter is called quidditch and more shopping descriptive huh and i will post it when i reach around 27 reviews
