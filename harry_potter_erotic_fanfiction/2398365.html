 a few days later molly was sitting in her rocking chair reading a novel mol what molly looked up from her book as arthur walked into the living room the boys were outside playing in the snow and ginny was in her crib molly how would you feel about us having a muggle car a what a car a ford anglia to be exact how would you feel about having one why what would we do with a car she said her eyes narrowing in suspicion ummm well bill going to hogwarts in the fall and we need a way to get him to london and well we need some sort of transportation arthur first of all there the underground and the knight bus second why do i get the feeling there something you re not telling me because well now molly dontget upset i i i bought one you what she exclaimed raising her voice and practically swelling with anger i i i bought a car molly and you re just now deciding to tell me how long have you had it how did you pay for it you donteven know how to drive a car arthur by now she had abandoned her book and was standing in front of him hands on her hips i just got it today today yes arthur i dontknow what molly just listen for a minute i bought the car so i can take it apart to see how it works to see how it works how it works yeah its really brilliant how muggles get something like that to work i want to find out oh no not another muggle contraption that i have to hear you go on and on about molly please i bought the car secondhand and its really rusty it only cost a couple hundred galleons by the time everything was said and done a rust bucket for a couple hundred galleons arthur where did you get that kind of money i ve been saving for a while now and i took a class to learn how to drive it you took a class to learn how to drive a muggle vehicle and you ve been saving up pray tell where you were getting the money to save and when you had the time to take a class the money came from my paycheck i took the class as part of my training at the office your paycheck arthur we need that money the office why would they train you to drive a muggle car because someone in the department needs to know how to drive one in case someone decides to illegally enchant one molly i promise you wonthave to hear about it you wonteven have to mess with the paperwork that goes with it paperwork there paperwork involved well yes there the registration the plates and the insurance how are you going to pay for all of that arthur and what about the petrol to fuel the thing i ve got it all worked out you donthave to worry about a thing molly dear dontyou molly dear me arthur weasley i cantbelieve this i would have at least thought you would get my opinion before going out and buying a muggle car arthur how thick can you get did you think i wouldntbe upset or something honestly honey i didntknow what you would think or how you would react please can i keep it arthur if i hear one word about that car you re going to be sorry she had finally quieted down her throat was going dry from yelling so much yes dear and you cantput my name on any of the legal documents yes dear now go away i dontwant to see your face any longer yes dear arthur hung his head in shame and went outside towards his shed seeking refuge the children came in some time later and saw that their mother was upset they could tell because she slammed the dishes onto the table as she set it mummy are you mad at somebody fred asked curiously yes she answered not looking at her son who is it bill no it not bill charlie percy no me and george no fred i not mad and at you and george ron wait is it the baby no its not ron or the baby i know i know it daddy isntit he asked a wide smile spreading across his face yes daddy the one who is in trouble fred why dontyou go tell your father that dinner is ready yes mum though he was only three fred knew better than to argue with her especially if she was already mad at someone he ran outside to the shed while molly set about serving the other children she noticed that arthur was taking his time he didntcome in the house and sit down until after she began serving herself he avoided her gaze as he ate and when he had finished he went back to his shed deciding that she would deal with arthur later she got the children ready for bed and told them their bedtime story when she was sure that they were asleep and arthur still hadntreturned from his shed she decided to go out to the shed and see just exactly what arthur had bought the door to the shed was slightly ajar so she slipped in quietly when she took a look around she was surprised at the amount of muggle rubbish he had not that she really cared she had told him a long time ago that she didntcare if he had it as long as it was in his shed and she didnthave to see it or hear about it hello molly he ventured cautiously not really seeing why she was in his shed there you are arthur come to yell at me some more no i came to get a look at the car but you said i know what i said just show me what i agreed to let you keep huh then i ll go he sighed with relief thankful she didntcome to have another go at him he led her to the car a rusty old turquoise ford anglia i guess it not so bad arthur i like the color she complemented trying to find something to like about it well it needs some work but it shouldntbe hard to fix but as all i really bought it for was to see how it works i guess it doesntreally matter does it no i guess not arthur come on you need some sleep you have to go to work tomorrow you mean i actually still get to sleep with you tonight i donthave to sleep on the couch he said the corners of his mouth turning up at the prospect of still getting to sleep next to his wife even after their row no you donthave to sleep on the sofa you just dontget any kisses at this his face fell the couch was definitely looking better if he didntget any kisses from her what was the point of being able to stay in bed molly do i really have to go without a good night kiss he whined hoping she would take pity on him yes can i have one just one he begged he couldntgo without his good night kiss her kisses were his favorite part of the evening no puh leeze no she was beginning to get tired of his begging and she had half a mind to just tell him forget it he had to sleep on the sofa anyway if he was going to act like a baby just because she wouldntgive him a kiss pretty please with sugar on top no but mol i need my kiss you dontneed anything now quit begging she turned and left the shed and he continued trying to bargain with her all the way up to the house by the time they had changed into their pajamas and climbed into bed he was up to i ll clean the house for an entire month which she had laughed at he was doing good if he helped clean for a whole week arthur shut up or i may just put you on the sofa anyway but mol leeee fine you can have a kiss just one though molly decided it was better just to give him a kiss she was sick of his whining he closed his eyes and leaned towards her but before he could connect his lips with hers she placed a finger over his mouth no tongues though arthur what his eyes flew open at hearing these words you heard me no tongues if you stick your tongue in my mouth i going to bite it got it but molly that the best part well you either get a kiss with no tongues or no kiss at all fine i promise no tongue good and for the record i still angry with you you re only getting this kiss so i donthave to listen to you whine okay mol he closed his eyes again and kissed her quickly she rolled over and faced the wall as far away as possible from him and he rolled over to face the window he hated being in the doghouse arthur stumbled yawning and stretching downstairs to the kitchen in search of molly he had woken up and she wasntin bed when he got to the kitchen molly was bent over the stove removing a sheet of cookies she turned around spotted him and let out a startled noise causing the cookies to slide off the sheet he whipped out his wand gave it a quick flick and sent the cookies to rest on the counter arthur i didnthear you come down i didntknow you would be baking in the middle of the night i couldntsleep i know it hard to sleep after napping during the day isntit yes it doesnthelp that i had a bad day either arthur walked over to her and wrapped his arms around her waist drawing her close to him i know molly girl he leaned down and pressed a kiss to her neck she shuddered in his arms and wrapped her arms around his neck arthur she asked bringing a hand down to play with the belt of his bathrobe what mol would you like a cookie i sure would she handed him a cookie and took one for herself delicious mol thank you arthur now i say we go upstairs and try to get you to sleep he said grinning a little devilishly arthur what are you suggesting you know what maybe arthur you re a rascal you have to go to work tomorrow besides i too tired for that molly please if you haventnoticed i awake you re awake and the kids are asleep arthur mol we haventhad any private time in quite a while arthur you are something else let me put the cookies away and we ll go upstairs and just see how far we get she replied giving him a wide smile molly have you heard arthur asked coming into their hotel room where molly was relaxing after a day of touring the pyramids it was about a week into their vacation and molly was having a wonderful time heard what she asked looking up from the book she was reading arthur breathed an inaudible sigh of relief molly sirius black escaped what i got an owl from arnold peasgood you know an obliviator i asked him to keep me posted about things at the ministry anyway sirius black escaped from azkaban they ve taken everyone off of their usual jobs to to look for him but how no one ever escaped from azkaban before i know hopefully he ll be caught in a few days arthur should we cut our vacation short no i dontfancy returning to work in this mess and you re having a wonderful time my dear all right then where are you off to i going into town do you want to come no be back before dark hm yes dear and keep an eye on the children i dontknow where they ve got to yes molly he crossed the room and planted a tender kiss on her lips before leaving later on that night after molly had checked on the children she climbed into bed next to arthur who was waiting for her molly girl are you okay he asked noticing the concern on her features yes molly dontlie to me what are you worried about sirius black honey dontlet him ruin the rest of our vacation enjoy yourself you deserve this break arthur he a mass murderer shush everything will be all right i your knight remember yes i just being silly you re not being silly you re just forgetting that i not going to let anything happen to you or the kids now go to sleep i wonthave you cranky in the morning he replied wrapping his arms around her and kissing her temple she snuggled down into the warmth and protection of his arms pressing a kiss to his neck as she did so good night molly good night arthur she replied closing her eyes the vacation ended too quickly for molly but school would be starting soon for the younger children and arthur needed to go back to work as arthur didnthave a car anymore he arranged for the ministry to provide a couple to transport them to king cross from the leaky cauldron they had met up with harry and hermione earlier that day who were also staying at the leaky cauldron overnight as term started the next day arthur and molly were in the parlor area enjoying their time together without children present molly there something i need to tell you he broke the silence causing his wife to jump slightly what it about harry what about him well sirius black is after him i wanted to know if you would approve of me telling him arthur no he doesntneed that he has enough to worry about without worrying about a murderer being after him molly please it makes no sense not to tell him he started raising his voice harry got a right to know i ve tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating him like a child he thirteen years old and arthur the truth would terrify him she replied shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over him for heaven sake he happy not knowing i dontwant to make him miserable i want to put him on his guard he retorted you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves they ve ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry mustntdo that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus hadntpicked him up i prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found him but he not dead he fine so what the point molly they say sirius black is mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and that supposed to be impossible it been three weeks and no one seen hide nor hair of him and i dontcare what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet we re no nearer catching black than inventing self spelling wands the only thing we know for sure is what black after but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts we thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwarts but no one really sure that black after harry he banged his fist on the table before answering molly how many times do i have to tell you they didntreport it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that black been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words he at hogwarts he at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring you know who back to power black lost everything the night harry stopped you know who and he had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that well arthur you must do what you think is right but you re forgetting albus dumbledore i dontthink anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while dumbledore headmaster i suppose he knows all about this of course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he wasnthappy about it but he agreed not happy why shouldnthe be happy if they re there to catch black dumbledore isntfond of the azkaban guards he replied heavily nor am i if it comes to that but when you re dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those you d rather avoid if they save harry then i will never say another word against them he replied wearily it late molly we d better go up molly rose from her chair and arthur allowed her to lead the way to thier room he changed into his pajamas and decided to try his case one more time he slipped into the lavatory where molly was brushing her teeth molly honey if it was one of our children would you want them to know he asked gently placing his hands on her shoulders she shrugged and continued with her brushing take ron for example knowing what you know about ron would you want him to know yes i would want him to be careful she exclaimed after rinsing replace ron with harry do you still want him leaving without knowing no but arthur i letting you make the decision i not telling you what you should do it time for bed we ve got a busy day ahead of us she replied turning to leave the lavatory arthur however reached out and caught her arm drawing her close to him molly you re beautiful you know that he asked tracing a finger along her jawline she rolled her eyes and struggled against his grip molly weasley i love you with my entire heart i love you too arthur she replied wanting to go to bed he slipped his finger under her chin tilting her face up to his he closed his eyes and brought his lips down to meet hers when the kiss had broken off molly climbed into bed and arthur pulled her close watching over her until she had fallen asleep a n another chapter sorry for the delay but as you know i have weasley newlyweds and my april prank fic to work on as well i doing my best guys i really am fred george your o w l results have arrived and perce it looks like you ve got something also arthur said as he sorted the mail that errol had dropped in front of him handing each of his sons their respective letters before turning to the daily prophet arthur must you read that at the table molly asked as she began serving breakfast where and when do you propose i read it molly arthur asked scanning the front page molly disregarded the question arthur had been in a mood all morning mother father i got the job i report directly to mr crouch congratulations son when do you start i start on monday very good percy i proud of you molly said smiling fondly at her third son thanks mother well fred george how many o w l s did you get she asked turning her attention to the twins who had been unusually silent for most of the morning six fred answered looking very interested in his eggs six each great job molly said getting up to hug her sons no mum three each six george said struggling against his mother grip i sure you did your best arthur replied not noticing the look of scorn on his wife face molly sighed as much as she was disappointed with fred and george she knew that they probably had done their best at least to their standards she knew they were smart and if they tried they could get decent marks maybe not the best but decent marks at least after all she had been their teacher through their primary school years after breakfast molly set her family to their chores but after fighting with the twins for over an hour to clean their room properly she banished them to the garden while she cleaned it herself when she opened the door to their room she was shocked with the state of things granted arthur had been slightly sloppy when he had been younger she d seen the boy dormitory before the house elves cleaned gryffindor tower but this was ridiculous clothes were strewn everywhere several rolls of parchment littered the desk and several substances that she didntthink she wanted to know what they were littered the floor after casting several cleaning charms which put the room in a slightly less state of sloppiness she began tackling the mess the twins called a desk after sifting through several pieces of parchment that actually looked like summer holiday work she found a long list of items ranging from fake wands to trick sweets complete with prices with the heading of weasleys wizard wheezes wondering what in the world was weasleys wizard wheezes she pocketed the parchment and put the room in order she would talk to arthur about their children activities later on that evening after dinner molly held a conference with arthur in the kitchen while the children relaxed in front of the living room fire arthur what do you think they re up to she asked anxiously showing him the list who knows these look like joke shop items to me he replied scanning the list do you think it completely possible molly now dontlook at me like that his wife had a mulish look crossing her face and he knew he was in for it but he didntknow what for i ll look at you however i want to arthur weasley she replied her tone a little less than a growl molly please be reasonable we ll ask them about it it not fair to them if we jump to conclusions but arthur no buts fred george can we speak to you for a moment arthur said and in seconds his twin sons were seated at the table molly brandished the sheet of parchment she had found and the twins visibly squirmed under their mother gaze what is this fred george um well you see fred and i want to open a joke shop when we leave hogwarts molly eyes moved from one twin to the other as they spoke and she could barely contain her thoughts fred george why if you wanted you could get a decent job in the ministry mum we dontwant to work at the ministry we want to open a joke shop molly really this is their decision we are not sending you to hogwarts so you can earn three o w l s each at exam time we scrimp and save to pay for your robes and books but you canteven try to pass more than three exams mum really we do try well your marks certainly dontshow it mum do you have anymore of these order forms yes bring them here i expect better grades when your n e w t s come around yes mum the twins hurried up to their room and reluctantly brought down a large amount of parchment which molly threw into the fire a n another update and yes i promise that i working on weasley newlyweds an update should be ready in the near future for that fic anywho enjoy this update molly awoke early knowing it was going to be chaotic getting six children and their corresponding luggage to the station by eleven after showering quickly she woke her husband and set about waking the children while she was cooking breakfast amos diggory appeared in the fireplace and she about jumped a mile when she heard him ask for arthur that they needed him at the ministry arthur molly called up the staircase to her husband hoping he had already showered arthur urgent message from the ministry she looked up as arthur clattered down the stairs hurtling to the kitchen with his robes on back to front molly had begun anxiously rummaging through drawers looking for a quill i ve got a quill here somewhere she muttered blowing a stray hair out of her face meanwhile amos was talking a mile a minute trying to brief arthur on what was going on muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting so they went and called those what d you call ems please men arthur you ve got to get over there here molly said breathlessly as she shoved a piece of parchment a bottle of ink and a crumpled quill into arthur hands it a real stroke of luck i heard about it i had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls and i found the improper use of magic lot all setting off if rita skeeter gets hold of this one arthur what does mad eye say happened arthur asked preparing to take notes says he heard an intruder in his yard says he was creeping toward the house but was ambushed by his dustbins what did the dustbins do made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere as far as i can tell apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please men turned up arthur groaned and what about the intruder arthur you know mad eye someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night more likely there a very shell shocked cat wandering around somewhere covered in potato peelings but if the improper use of magic lot get their hands on mad eye he had it think of his record we ve got to get him off on something in your department what are exploding dustbins worth might be a caution arthur said still scribbling furiously mad eye didntuse his wand he didntattack anyone i ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window but they ll have a job proving it there arentany casualties all right i off arthur said as he left the kitchen sorry about this molly bothering you so early and everything but arthur the only one who can get mad eye off and mad eye supposed to be starting his new job today why he had to choose last night never mind amos molly said giving him a gentle smile sure you wonthave a bit of toast or anything before you go oh go on then amos replied and molly transferred a piece of toast from the freshly buttered stack to the fire poker and into amos mouth fanks molly looked up as amos disappeared hearing her husband calling hurried good byes to bill charlie percy and the girls within a minute he was back in the kitchen dragging a comb through his hair and she noticed that his robes were on properly i d better hurry you have a good term boys he said acknowledging the boys seated at the table as he fastened his cloak molly are you going to be all right taking the kids to king cross of course i will she replied turning towards him expectantly you just look after mad eye we ll be fine her husband disapparated leaving her with a slight frown on her face he had forgotten to kiss her good bye brushing it off as an honest mistake she fastened her own cloak to travel into town to call muggle taxis for transportation when she arrived back at the burrow a few hours later completely exhausted she was somewhat surprised to see her husband back he was relaxing in his armchair reading the daily prophet so she slipped behind him and rubbed his shoulders molly yes arthur sit on my lap please he replied folding up the paper and dropping it onto a side table more than happy to oblige molly lowered herself into the chair settling lightly in his lap you forgot about me this morning dear she said resting her head against his chest tucking her feet to her thighs arthur racked his brain for a moment he didntthink he had forgotten anything in his rush to help mad eye he closed his eyes as he remembered that he hadntkissed his wife good bye before he had rushed off knowing her feelings were probably hurt he wrapped his arms around her and lowered his head to gently kiss her forehead i sorry my love but i was in a hurry you re not upset with me i hope only a little nothing that cantbe fixed i glad to hear it he replied and he slipped a hand under her chin tilting her face so he could kiss her mouth you ll be proud of me arthur what do you mean molly i used the muggle telephone in town to call for taxis to take us to the station really everything went smoothly then it did dear good have bill and charlie left they went to the platform with you didntthey well yes but i didntcome straight home i stopped off in diagon alley for something i honestly dontknow molly did they tell you that they were leaving well they have to get back to work they ve probably left then i haventseen them since i arrived home and i believe percy wanted to get some time in at the ministry that child works far too hard what is so important that he needs to be there morning noon and night who knows he probably wants to make a good impression on crouch either that or he taking his work far too seriously isnthe and crouch the main people working on the security for the tournament yes they re double and triple checking to make sure that no student underage will be able to enter when did this come about no one told me about setting an age limit a few weeks ago i thought i d mentioned it to you you might have but it been absolutely chaotic around here lately i know you want to go upstairs and have a cuddle arthur it was just a suggestion we have the house to ourselves while percy working just a cuddle then if that what you want my dear arthur replied kissing her again and stroking the back of her head cuddling sounds nice right now no sex right if that what you want arthur repeated i not saying i dontwant it i just dontwant to rush into it want us to take our time if we do yes that it i suppose you ve got it my darling now shall we molly gave him a knowing smile and he allowed her to lead the way to their bedroom once there she pulled back the coverlet and slipped between the sheets patting his spot on the bed come on love i cantcuddle alone i coming i coming arthur replied crawling up to the head of the bed and slipping between the sheets as well when he had settled molly scooted closer to him resting her head on his pillow and a hand on his chest while he slipped an arm around her shoulders the house is so awfully quiet molly commented after a few moments of silence it is isntit i dontknow how you can stand it we re so used to this house bursting at the seams with children i dontknow how i do ever since ginny started school most of the day i lounge around listening to the wireless and getting fat on chocolate arthur chuckled it cantbe that bad can it i mean you still tidy up dontyou he asked beginning to stroke her hair and the back of her head i donthave to tidy up as often when it just the two of us as i do when we have the children home and it gets lonely after a while you could always go back to saint mungo couldntyou i could but i d have to take a refresher course and another exam because so much as changed over the last twenty or so years well why dontyou it d give you something to do while i at work i dontwant to go back to work arthur i enjoy being home when you get home and i really dontwant to relive the first year and a half of our marriage what was wrong with that nothing but dontyou remember that the only time we ever saw each other was in the mornings before work and maybe before bed every night frankly i somewhat surprised we even got pregnant with bill in the first place we hardly ever had time for shagging we shagged in the morning arthur pointed out that about the only time we did arthur our lives back then just about defeated the purpose of being married in the first place i sorry love maybe you could take up a hobby he suggested lightly he hadntknown how lonely his wife was with him at work and the kids at school arthur i already have a hobby knitting and crocheting i sorry you re lonely mollywobbles i wish there was something i could do could you maybe go down to part time i cantdo that i the head of my office and it just me and perkins oh she sighed heavily and buried her face against his shoulder arthur i ve been thinking about what promise you wontlaugh cross my heart i wish i was a grandmum at least then i d have children to look after even if all ours are practically grown we ll be grandparents eventually bill still young he ll find a nice young lady to marry i donthave any doubts about that arthur i just wish he was already married and providing us with grandchildren good i glad to hear that molly arthur slid his hand down his wife back pausing just above the slight curve of buttocks and he felt her jerk as he slipped his hand over and squeezed firmly arthur what are you doing nothing mol arthur she began in a warning tone what what do you think you are doing i told you nothing i not allowed to feel me up absolutely not arthur immediately removed his hand wondering what it was he had done to upset her mollywobbles are you on your cycle because usually you dontmind if i er touch you he asked carefully not wanting to set her off if she was molly gasped and rested a hand on her abdomen before answering actually arthur it is my time of the month i ve just been too busy to notice my cramps she whimpered as she finished beginning to feel the pain are you all right mol he asked knowing how uncomfortable she was i will be arthur could you check and see if i have pads and menstrual potion i cantremember the last time i shopped yes i will my dear where do i look pads are in the lavatory under the sink and the potion is in the pantry third shelf i ll check you relax arthur said climbing out of bed to do as she asked molly settled back against the pillows silently cursing herself for not remembering she looked up as arthur reentered the room i sorry darling but it looks like you re out of your supplies molly sighed heavily and cursed under her breath ginny she mumbled i ll have to have a talk with that girl what was that molly i didntquite catch that nothing dear you said something about gin that i did so what does any of this have to do with her does it matter i guess not but arthur the reason i donthave pads or the potion is gin what he asked his face contorting in confusion then a look of comprehension dawned on his face you mean that she gotten her period yes when how come no one told me she wrote me back in may asking for advice and sorry dear but most girls dontadvertise the fact that they ve gotten their period to their fathers or anyone else for that matter but i her father shouldnti be informed on when my little girl becomes a woman arthur can we drop the subject please yes dear good now i need you to go to the drugstore for me to pick up supplies why cantyou go molly closed her eyes fighting to keep her temper in check arthur weasley is it too much to ask you to run a simple errand for me she asked grinding her teeth arthur remained silent and she continued arthur i would go myself but my cramps are awful and believe me if i had known i was out i would have picked them up on my way home i know molly that was insensitive of me and i know it i ll go for you what is it that i need to get molly reached for a piece of parchment and a quill beginning to compose a list for him when she had finished she handed him the list there you are everything you need to know is on the list just get what it says and you ll be fine arthur glanced at the parchment in his hand and felt the tips of his ears grow very warm consider it done my love i ll be back in a bit he kissed her quickly pulled on his shoes and disapparated upon arriving in diagon alley arthur made his way to the drugstore before entering he looked down at the list in his hand as he stared at the familiar loopy handwriting he was becoming embarrassed about the items that he had been sent to purchase chocolate menstrual potion extra strength non drowsy please 2 24 pack sanitary pads 1 light 1 heavy he knew the chocolate and the potion would be easy enough but he had no idea how sanitary pads could be light and heavy taking a deep breath he entered the shop forcing himself to remember that he was doing this for his darling molly he found the chocolate and menstrual potion quickly but when he got to the feminine hygiene aisle he was lost there were several different brands all in brightly colored packaging and he had no idea what it was that molly wanted he glanced back down at the list molly had given him hoping it could help him as he didntwant to embarrass himself further by asking for assistance sir arthur turned towards the voice not realizing that anyone had walked up beside him hmmm sir you look lost would you like some help she asked kindly and arthur was grateful that he didn t have to ask er yeah i guess so may i see your list arthur gladly handed her the list thinking that he would be finished faster if he let her get the items she looked at the list and within moments she had pushed two of the brightly colored packages in his arms there you are those are what your wife wants er thanks he quickly paid for the items satisfied that he had completed his task and returned home he carried the sack upstairs to molly who kissed his cheek as he handed it to her after taking the potion and care of business molly climbed back into bed and patted arthur spot come on we can cuddle some more she said and arthur gladly slid next to his wife thank you for shopping for me arthur i know it was probably awkward for you anything for you my dear arthur said kissing her cheek arthur will you rub my back that potion works wonders on my cramps but it doesntdo anything about the backaches that come along with them of course molly girl why doesntit he asked slipping his hand down her back making small circles as he rubbed i dontknow but i half hope i was back at hogwarts so i could use madam pomfrey potion for cramps what so special about the one she uses arthur that stuff is the best i told ginny that she should go see madam pomfrey the potion she gives out is ten times better than the one i buy oh is that how you managed to get through lessons it is otherwise i would have been agony i ll bet i know the potion i bought is non drowsy but why dontyou take a nap you know that sounds like a good idea will you hold me until i fall asleep of course i always do i know shush rest i ll still be here when you wake up molly smiled at her husband before she rested her head against his shoulder and closed her eyes when he felt her breathing become soft and regular he kissed her forehead and began stroking her hair good morning molly girl arthur said greeting his wife with a good morning kiss to her cheek before taking his seat at the table percy leave for work already yes dear molly replied serving her husband before sitting down in the chair at his elbow gin sent a letter she commented reaching for a piece of parchment what does our young lady have to say he asked pouring himself a cup of tea here read for yourself molly said smiling as she handed over the letter dear mum and dad the triwizard tournament has officially begun fred and george tried to enter they were furious when professor dumbledore announced that the tournament would only be open to students that are of age anyway they made an aging potion to trick professor dumbledore age line around the goblet of fire they got across the line all right but while they were celebrating they were hurled from the circle and sprouted long white beards like professor dumbledore s oh and harry name somehow got into the goblet and he the fourth champion ron in a stink about the whole thing he thinks harry put his own name in the goblet but hermione and i know that he didn t there just no possible way he could have crossed the age line i ve got to go otherwise i ll be late for potions love you ginny typical fred and george arthur commented setting his daughter letter aside noticing his wife silence he reached for her hand what is it mollywobbles poor harry why does everything happen to him he ll be fine someone put his name in that goblet for a reason and he ll face the tasks ahead like a true gryffindor you think so i know so he gave her hand a gentle squeeze before he reached for the daily prophet but how could they have let him enter he much too young and the age limit molly baby you read gin letter he didntenter himself and the age limit is still in effect the only reason he competing is because of the binding magical contract that goes along with entering the tournament he ll be fine dumbledore will keep an eye on him he reassured her his thumb drawing circles on the back of her hand look here there an article about the tournament in the prophet he opened the paper to the appropriate page and set it on the table in front of his wife molly read the article silently although it was supposed to be about all the champions the article focused on harry what is it arthur asked noticing that his wife was becoming teary eyed listen to this love she picked up the paper and cleared her throat preparing to read aloud i suppose i get my strength from my parents i know they d be very proud of me if they could see me now yes sometimes at night i still cry about them i not ashamed to admit it i know nothing will hurt me during the tournament because they re watching over me he still cries about his parents oh bless him i never knew tears spilled down her face as she finished and arthur reached over to stroke her cheek he ll be fine mollywobbles he got ron and hermione to help him dontfret about him my dear but shush dumbledore will make sure nothing too terrible will happen to him you sure yes there a reason why he wanted mad eye at hogwarts this year i dontknow why but dumbledore has definitely got his reasons promise me you wontfret about him constantly arthur he may as well have come from my womb i think of him as a seventh son i know you do but he ll be all right in fact i think that traditionally the families of the champions are allowed to travel to the host school to watch the third task if you want me to i ll write to dumbledore and see if he would allow you to go you donthave to that arthur i ll write to him would you come with me maybe it would depend on my work schedule but i sure you ll find someone to take along arthur look at the time you re going to be late for work no i not he calmly replied taking his wife hand again yes you are it five to nine and you haventeven eaten yet who said i was going in to the office today he asked pulling her a little closer and whispering in her ear you re taking the day off yes my dear do you have a problem with that molly gasped as he first nibbled at her ear then nuzzled her neck i ll take that as a no he replied allowing one of his hands to travel down her front a arthur we cantdo this here not now and why not percy at work isnthe well yes but the kitchen arthur isntthat being a little wild yes i know but it nice and cozy right here why go back upstairs to the bed you just made but what you dontwant to revisit our youth a little when we first moved into this place we couldntkeep our hands off one another remember of course i remember i just thought that we re getting too old to fool around well no than why not molly remained silent she would be lying if she said that she didntwant him and it had been ages since they had fooled around someplace other than the bedroom i guess i donthave an answer to that question love she replied and arthur smiled before waving his wand to clear the breakfast dishes a n i think you can figure out what happens next but dontworry i haventgiven up completely on their love scenes for those of you actually dontcare if they re there or not anyway if you haventnoticed a new chapter is up in weasley newlyweds a n sorry for the delay i having an awful hard time fitting the attendence of the third task into this fic i think i ve rewritten it about four times and it was going to be in this chapter but it just doesntmesh with the contents of this so next chappie arthur dear molly asked peeking into the office that her husband shared with his assistant perkins arthur smiled as he looked up from the paperwork he was completing glad that the interruption was caused by his wife and not another colleague coming to increase his workload he put his quill down and made his way through the massive amount clutter that occupied his office before kissing her in greeting and to what do i owe this wonderful surprise he asked tapping her on the nose with his forefinger nothing in particular i just wondered if you wanted to go out to lunch with me if you re not too busy that is i never too busy for you but unfortunately i just came back from break and i cantgo to lunch for another few hours hon that all right then bill was meeting me anyway so we could work out the details of his staying with us before the third task and i thought i d ask you to join us thanks for asking m dear and maybe we can set up a lunch date for next week hmm he replied touching her cheek lightly as he brushed a stray hair out of her face i d like that arthur when are you free arthur turned back towards his desk ruffling through several pieces of parchment before finding what it was he was looking for an enchanted calendar that automatically updated itself to reflect any meetings ministry employees were to attend and important dates for the individual user let see here i ve got a meeting on tuesday and thursday of next week a raid scheduled for the afternoon on friday and an employee luncheon on monday he said scanning the calendar with his left index finger wednesday good do you have anything scheduled for

about one o clock at that little caf in diagon alley sounds good however you meet me here at quarter to and i ll escort you how does that sound mollywobbles sounds like a date to me she replied catching her bottom lip between her teeth as she smiled when she had turned to leave she finally realized what was different about her husband left hand he didnthave his wedding ring on arthur may i ask you why you are not wearing your wedding ring she asked glaring at him huh what he asked pausing in his journey through the clutter and turning to look back at his wife your wedding ring arthur where is it he looked at his left ring finger and sighed i must have forgot it this morning molly i sorry how do you forget to put on your wedding ring i dontknow but i didnteven notice that it wasntthere until now so you routinely forget your wedding band no i just i so used to wearing it if you re so used to wearing it you would have noticed it was gone look molly i sorry i left it on my bedside table i swear if it not there then you have my permission to hex me to kingdom come dear now i have to get back to work if i going to be home on time okay good bye see you tonight i love you i love you too mollywobbles he replied kissing her cheek before she disapparated after a lovely lunch with her eldest son molly returned home and decided to check out arthur story about his wedding ring she searched his bedside table in the drawer and on the floor around the bed and the table but she didntfind his ring frowning she decided to look in the loo on the counter around the sink to see if he had put in on when he got up but taken it off as he showered and shaved she sighed and shook her head at herself for thinking arthur hadnttold her the truth as she spotted his gold band on the sink next to his shaving gear pocketing the ring she headed downstairs to tidy up a bit and start on dinner arthur sighed as he pushed open the back door praying to merlin that molly had found his ring as he wasntin the mood to be shouted at by his wife all he wanted was dinner and a little bit of together time with her hello molly dear he said sliding his arms around his wife hello arthur molly replied turning around to kiss him lightly as she did so she removed his ring from her pocket and slid it onto his finger you found it i see he commented kissing her again i did though it wasntwhere you said it was where was it then on the sink next to your shaving gear oh so are you still contemplating punishment he asked giving her an apologetic smile no you were honest with me and you did truly forget it i forgive you is percy still at work he sighed heavily before answering her yes they took him in for questioning again today over the whole issue with barty so it just you and me for dinner then looks like it but i cantsay i mind the outcome stop it and sit down dinner about ready yes dear arthur replied sitting in his seat at the head of the table patiently waiting to be served so when is bill arriving for your trip to the third task he coming wednesday staying overnight and then we ll leave thursday morning are you sure you cantcome molly questioned sitting down at the table as she put arthur plate in front of him i sure you know i would like to molly girl but i ve got to work i ll still be here when you get back i not going anywhere i know dear i just enjoy traveling with you then we ll plan a vacation for just the two of us sometime in the near future love where would you like to go anywhere paris rome amsterdam it doesntreally matter okay we ll plan

fourth they ve grown up so fast haventthey they have and they ve grown into fine young gentlemen and dontforget our little lady of course and a fine young lady molly corrected smiling warmly at her husband percy came home when his parents were halfway through dinner and molly immediately excused herself from the table to serve her son his dinner hello mother father percy greeted settling himself in the seat across from his mother while she bustled about the kitchen preparing a plate for him good evening son arthur replied after he had swallowed his food did everything go all right with the questioning perce molly asked placing a plate in front of her son as she settled back in to her meal percy remained silent and she quickly decided not to press the issue she knew her son was probably stressed from the amount of work he had to accomplish as well as the constant badgering from his superiors and the prophet about crouch they basically told me that i could not judge the third task in mr crouch place the minister is going to replace him instead would you like to accompany bill and i to the task percy you re more than welcome to join us no thanks mother i probably should work i appreciate the thought percy replied before clearing up his dishes and heading to his room molly and arthur finished their meal in silence before retiring to the sitting room hand in hand arthur yes molly my dear would you like me to prepare you two some meals while i gone so all you have to do is reheat them no percy and i will be fine after all i did learn from the best he commented squeezing her hand gently mol hey mol molly hon wake up arthur said as he gently nudged her shoulder hmmm mol you have to wake up i ve been called in what at his last statement she sat up eyes widening it was his day off besides that he never got called into the office molly an emergency has come up at the office i have to go arthur what do you mean an emergency perkins flooed and asked if i can come in i dontknow what going on i hate to leave you here i know you dontfeel well but i have to go what makes you think i dontfeel well molly its ten o clock we went to bed around nine last night you never sleep that long besides you felt feverish when i got up well you re right are the boys up yes i told them to be good that you dontfeel well arthur do we have any pepperup potion left she always made sure she had some on hand in case the boys got sick but she hadnthad the chance to brew more and they had been running low i dontknow where would it be in the pantry third shelf from the bottom the same place i keep the potion ingredients i ll go check be right back as he left the room in search of the potion molly pulled the coverlet back over her sometime during the night she must have kicked it off merlin she thought as she pulled the coverlet closer around her i freezing molly here we re about out so you may want to brew some more arthur said as he handed the potion to her she gratefully took the potion from him and quickly drank it almost immediately she began to feel a little better though she knew she would have to take it easy for a few days for her sake and the baby s thank you when are you going to be home honestly molly i dontknow if i going to be later than five thirty six o clock i ll floo you if you need anything you know you can floo my mum or either of my brothers

try molly i cantgive you any guarantees i ll see you tonight love see you tonight he walked over to her gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and apparated to the office as molly was tired she immediately summoned her mother in law to help out she just didntfeel like refereeing the boys today and she didntwant to give them whatever it was she had especially ron mum weasley i really appreciate you coming to help me out today molly dear you know i dontmind i love spending time with the children besides your focus needs to be on yourself right now not the boys you need to take care of yourself especially for the baby sake now you just go back on upstairs take it easy and i ll care for the boys okay arthur said he would floo if he was going to be later than six o clock could you let me know yes dearie yes go on mum weasley hurriedly interrupted molly gave her mother in law a smile and went back upstairs to the bedroom in her bedroom molly occupied herself with knitting and reading with sleeping between she just wasntused to having a full day just to herself she managed to finish arthur scarf and got a head start on the christmas jumpers she made every year for her family occasionally one of the boys would check on her apparently on their grandmum orders and ask her if she needed anything around five mum weasley came up molly arthur flooed he not going to be home until late tonight would you like me to stay overnight no you can go after the boys have ate and gone to bed thank you again for coming to help it no problem what time do the boys usually go to bed well ron usually goes down right after dinner the twins around eight and the others around eight thirty okay then i ll put them down and then head home by the way i noticed you re about out of pepperup potion so i brewed a cauldron of it for you it in the pantry are you sure you ll be alright here by yourself yes thanks for brewing the potion i ll see you over easter then if all goes well mum weasley replied as she turned to go back downstairs about an hour afterward when she was sure mum weasley had left molly went downstairs to wait for arthur she put a pot of tea on knowing it was probably going to be a long night and curled up in arthur chair by the fireplace she didntknow what it was but every time he worked late she just couldntsleep at about a quarter to one in the morning she heard a small pop in the kitchen leaping from the chair she ran into the kitchen and threw her arms around him molly dear what are you still doing up you know i cantsleep when you re away looking into his eyes she saw sadness before she could ask him about it he broke in with molly honey something terrible has happened what she was frightened the last time he came home and said those words her parents had been killed of course she hadntreally cared then because they had disowned her when she had announced that she and arthur were getting married she was a prewett from a prestigious wizarding family and her parents thought she should have married for money not love and when she deliberately went against their wishes she was cast from the family molly there was another attack on who she said wondering why on earth he was telling her fabian and gideon at his words she drew a sharp intake of breath and bit her lip fabian and gideon were the only members of her family she had stayed in contact with they had accepted her wishes unlike her parents and she was very close to both of them as they were only a few years older than her and they had attended school together it was hard for her to believe that her brothers had been attacked what happened five death eaters showed up at their house they fought bravely but but what arthur are they alive she said frantically interrupting him looking into his wife eyes he knew she needed to hear it no matter how upsetting it was it was better she heard it from him instead of reading it in the daily prophet molly they re they re dead at this she burst into tears and buried her head into his chest she cried harder than she normally would have but her hormones were raging making her feel things more keenly why why arthur why molly i dontknow he knew the best thing for her was to let her cry he stood there holding her in his arms and rubbing her back he wished there was some way he could make it better he hated to see her cry but he knew that all he could do was let her know that he was there for her when she had calmed down a little he led her upstairs she crawled into bed wrapped her arms around him and found the well worn spot on his shoulder where she had cried many times he wrapped his arms more tightly around her wanting to give her comfort but he couldntfind the words finally she spoke arthur i so frightened she wiped the tears away frantically with one hand keeping her other arm firmly around him i know you are molly i wish there was some way i could lessen the fear but arthur i was very close to fabian and gideon next to you they were the most important people in my life i know molly i know he could feel his heart breaking for her no matter how hard they fought he who must not be named managed to screw everything up he thought bitterly arthur it seems like we fight so hard but everything just keeps getting worse sometimes i wonder if it ever going to end molly i know he said stroking her hair letting the curls run through his fingers while his other hand rubbed her back arthur the boys never really even got to know them why did they have to die now why molly i just as upset as you are fabian and gideon were good friends to me remember they were the only ones that thought i was good enough for their sister he said with a small grin molly smiled through her tears at that fabian and gideon had known early on about her and arthur in fact they were the ones who broke the news to her parents hoping they wouldntbe too upset with her decision arthur they were the last members of my family i the only prewett left now she had stopped trying to keep the tears from running down her face she just let them run off her face and onto his pajamas molly i wish there was a way i could comfort you but i dontknow how arthur you always wonder why i worry when you work late well this is why what arthur i afraid that i ll lose you i cantlose you i dontknow what i would do if i ever lost you i love you too much besides you re the only one who can comfort me molly i know everyday i worry about that arthur can you stay home tomorrow molly because i had to go in and work a double shift i have the next two days off and i promise you i wontleave your side feeling more than a little comforted she hugged him tighter and closed her eyes when he felt her soft steady breathing he allowed himself to be pulled into slumber a n i going to take my time getting through order of the phoenix as well as half blood prince so the chapters may only span across a week or so while they re at headquarters i dontknow yet but i not going to be rushing from one event to the next arthur weasley sighed heavily as he pushed open the back door to the burrow praying to merlin that molly was still at number 12 grimmauld place with sirius and the children she had become increasingly distant with him since percy had walked out on them a week before and as a result she had been spending her days helping sirius and remus decontaminate headquarters as no one had lived there for ten years except the house elf kreacher he hated being the cause of his wife anger and frustration but this time he had no control over the situation and he had no idea how to fix it even more depressing he thought was the fact that their twenty sixth wedding anniversary was two days away and he feared that they wouldntbe on speaking terms to celebrate the occasion hullo i home he said removing his shoes and hanging up his cloak he walked up beside his wife who was preparing dinner and noticed that ginny was helping her he bent down to kiss molly cheek but she turned away at the last moment leaving his lips to land in her hair he sighed again and turned to ginny placing a kiss to the top of her head and giving her shoulders a gentle squeeze how are you gin i good dad ginny replied wiping her hands on a dishtowel and turning around to give her father a hug fancy a game of chess i told mum i d help with dinner i sorry all right then maybe another time hmm arthur replied lightly chucking his daughter under her chin ginny nodded and returned to the tasks that molly had set her arthur retired to the sitting room to read the daily prophet he desperately wanted to be on speaking terms with his wife he was feeling rather lonely without her companionship and he wanted to comfort her help her nurse the broken heart she without a doubt had since percy had left them when molly announced that dinner was ready arthur trudged to the kitchen all he wanted was his caring loving molly back but he wasntquite sure how to go about gaining her forgiveness as he couldntmake his son come home to them he sent her small smiles across the dinner table as they ate but wasntrewarded with any in return when he had finished he excused himself put his dishes in the sink and headed up to his and molly bedroom feeling the effects of his wife cold shoulder treatment sink in dad arthur turned around halfway up the stairs to see which of his children was calling him he made a conscious effort to smile knowing it wouldnthelp matters if his children thought that they were the source of their father unhappiness what is it ron ginny told me you were looking for a chess companion this afternoon and well i was wondering could we play of course ron did you finish your supper yeah ron paused for a moment as if not quite sure how to continue the conversation with his father shifting his weight from foot to foot so uh i ll just go get my set then arthur let his son pass and headed to the den where his chessboard and men were kept by the time he had everything set up his youngest son had joined him arthur gestured for him to sit down and he did setting up his pieces as well arthur broke the silence between them after a few moments and offered ron a small smile as he made his move ron is there anything you d like to talk to me about ron didntanswer and they continued their game in silence and arthur jumped when ron said dad yes son what is it how old were you when you realized you liked mum his son question threw him slightly off guard and he felt the tips of his ears grow warm well i was about your age why do you ask i was just wondering ron grew silent again and arthur decided to continue on this train of thought is there someone you think you re beginning to like ron face turned as red as his hair and arthur guessed he had hit the true reason for the question he smiled and offered him a small piece of advice you know ron perfume for christmas might show her how you feel if you re embarrassed about admitting it verbally arthur said gently knowing his son embarrassment by the way its your move they continued their game in silence and arthur acted somewhat hurt when his son beat him spectacularly and he realized just how long it had been since he had played chess with one of his children and they were now better than he was he figured he d have to practice with molly while they were away at school after ron had exited the den arthur replaced his chess set and made his way toward the kitchen molly and ginny were chatting at the kitchen table so he decided to turn in for the night he pulled on a pair of pajama trousers and climbed into bed molly came up some time later and he offered her a small smile as she got ready for bed which she didntreturn mollywobbles what is it arthur she icily asked i want to know why you re pulling the ice witch routine with me he began because i feel like you re blaming me for something i didntdo didntdo arthur you let our son walk out on us and you couldntbe bothered to go after him is that what this is all about you re upset because i didntgo after him he asked getting out of bed to wrap his arms around her waist molly nodded and he hugged her tight resting his cheek against her hair i sorry mols but he is of age even if i did go after him there isntmuch i could do molly broke out of his embrace and turned her back on him are you saying that if i walked out on you after a fight you wouldntcome after me she asked and he heard disappointment in her voice of course i d go after you mollywobbles i love you he replied moving to put his arms around her again you obviously dontlove percy then she spat stepping out of his reach i do love percy i love you and i love our children he said running a hand through his hair you expect me to believe that you d come after me when you wouldntgo after your own flesh and blood even though he couldntsee her face he could tell she was on the verge of tears i not flesh and blood to you arthur i someone you chose and you want me to think you d come after me when you wonteven go after your own son molly i didntthink it d be wise to go after him i sorry i realize now that maybe i should have went after him molly didntsay anything in reply and he took a tentative step toward her is this also about the fact that i went to london why did you go to the leaky cauldron arthur if you werentgoing to go after percy you should have stayed here with me molly i sorry for everything for going to the leaky cauldron for yelling at him for not going after him he trailed off and wrapped her tightly in his arms burying his face in her hair i ll tell you what mollywobbles i ll get his new address from work tomorrow and you can go and see if you can talk some reason into him how does that sound she answered him with a passionate kiss to his lips and he knew he was forgiven he gladly returned her enthusiasm picking her up and carrying her to the bed arthur stop not tonight please molly managed to gasp out between her husband kisses and the feel of his hands roaming her curves arthur stopped and kissed her sweetly before lying on the bed beside her okay mollywobbles we donthave to he replied nuzzling her neck causing her to giggle i just glad we re back on speaking terms i was beginning to think we werentgoing to be talking to each other on our anniversary my goodness i d almost forgotten about that it the day after tomorrow isntit yes it is molly twenty six years has it really been that long arthur nodded and kissed her cheek how are things going at headquarters good she replied kissing him in return we ve finally got the kitchen and enough bedrooms cleaned and i was planning on relocating everyone tomorrow sounds wonderful mol so am i supposed to report to headquarters or our burrow tomorrow after work headquarters a comfortable silence fell between them occasionally broken by the sound of their lips pulling apart arthur molly whispered snuggling closer to her husband and tracing a finger over his bare chest hmm i just realized that for the first time on our anniversary we wontbe able to make love in our own bed does it really matter where we are mollywobbles as long as we re together and in the same bed does it matter i guess not but the bedroom i chose for us the whole house actually is rather gloomy she said sadly looking around at the soft blues and yellows that decorated their room maybe we ll find a reason to sneak away then and come back home for our anniversary shag love you deserve to be someplace you feel comfortable for our love making oh arthur dontworry about that right now it late shush go on to sleep my molly arthur replied pulling her closer to nestle against his chest i sorry for pulling the ice witch routine on you all week i was upset i know go on to sleep i love you arthur i love you too goodnight arthur replied pressing a kiss to the top of her head holding her a little tighter goodnight she whispered burying her face against him as she fell asleep the next day arthur whistled as he made his way to number 12 grimmauld place from the ministry he was looking forward to that night scheduled order meeting and the prospect of spending time with his wife now that they were back on speaking terms when he reached headquarters he knocked on the door like molly had told him to do and within seconds the door swung open revealing his wife hullo molly girl he said bending down to kiss her tenderly hello arthur how was your day it was okay he commented closing the door and pulling her close did you get percy address i did he handed her a small piece of parchment which she took and placed in her apron pocket then kissed him sweetly thank you dear you re welcome when is the meeting supposed to start as soon as albus gets here well mrs weasley arentyou going to show your husband to his temporary bedroom of course molly reached for his hand and entwined her fingers with his as she pulled him toward the stairs she pointed out who would be sleeping where as they made their way up and she stopped when they came to a room that had a queen size four poster bed and what looked like an attached lavatory this is where we ll sleep she commented squeezing his palm it cozy enough he said kissing her cheek sure it cozy enough i shush it ll be all right it only temporary i can live without our love nest until the children go back to school besides we can get away when we need to he replied offering her a small smile which she returned on their way back downstairs they made sure the children were in their bedrooms as it was decided they were not to know about the goings on in the order meetings when they reached the kitchen molly was relieved to see that professor dumbledore was there and ready for the meeting to start arthur guided her towards two empty chairs at the end of table pulling her chair out for her before settling in his own as the meeting progressed it was evident that molly was beginning to seriously worry about her family well being and arthur continued to gently squeeze her hand and offer her small grins when the meeting was finished a schedule had been prepared for future meetings as well as a guard duty schedule to protect a prophecy in the ministry it was quite clear molly didntapprove of only one member on guard duty at any given time but she agreed to do her part as long as she and arthur didnthave back to back duty molly arthur asked rolling over in bed wrapping his arm around her and finding her left hand and entwining their fingers later on in the evening after everyone had turned in hmm are you losing weight honey he whispered kissing the spot just below her ear why do you ask you didntseem to eat as much at dinner as you usually do and you re feeling thinner to me is there anything wrong with me losing weight molly please i know you arentcrazy about your figure but you ve never gone on a diet because you ve always assured me that you re not overweight that the extra inches around are your middle are just that inches and they re hard to get rid of because they re due to your pregnancies he trailed off for a moment kissing the back of her neck are you losing weight because of your worry when molly nodded he pulled her closer baby you cantbe losing weight because of all this it not something that temporary and if you continue to let yourself lose weight you re going to get sick and maybe wind up in st mungo s and i dontwant that to happen can you promise me that no matter what happens you ll keep yourself healthy arthur i have so much more to lose this time though i canthelp but worry i know that dear but you cantlet it get to you to where you re losing weight it not good for you i not asking you to quit worrying i asking you to take care of yourself can you do that i ll try but i just noticed this morning that i losing weight arthur that all i can ask of you dear i dontmind you being thinner i just dontwant you losing the weight for unhealthy reasons all right when she didntanswer he continued try not to let it get to you but when it does talk to someone me or remus or sirius or any of the order i ll try arthur but i cantmake any promises i know go on to sleep tomorrow our anniversary a small smile broke across arthur face and he squeezed her hand arthur about that what can we sneak back to the burrow for our shag i really dontfeel comfortable making love here we can and you know what we donteven have to confine it to the bedroom this year with the kids here it will just be you and me arthur shush i not going to say anymore you ll just have to be surprised i ve been thinking about how to make this year special molly didntreply but she cuddled closer pressing herself against him and arthur held her tight as she fell asleep a n well here it is ch 43 that been in the making for 2 months now enjoy molly double checked the address on the door in front of her against the address that arthur had given her and sighed heavily sure enough she had the correct address now all she had to do was get her son to see reason if it could be done as percy could be as stubborn as either her or his father when it came to his beliefs however he was her son and she wanted to welcome him back into the family fold despite the exchange of hurtful words that had taken place steeling herself she knocked politely and stepped back smoothing her dress nervously while she waited for her son to appear as the door opened molly inhaled deeply and offered percy a small smile which he didntreturn hello perce molly said brightly in an effort to keep the atmosphere between them light hearted what is it that you want mother percy asked in his usual pompous tone molly was slightly offended by the fact that her son her baby the individual she had carried in her womb for eight months that she had nurtured and protected with her life for seventeen years couldnteven be polite and say hullo before jumping to what it was she wanted from him percy ignatius is that any way to speak to your mother the person who raised you to be a polite young man percy remained silent and she felt guilty for reprimanding him as that wasnt the reason she was visiting him percy she continued in a small voice we want you to come home we miss you i told you all of you the night i left that i didntwant anything to do with traitors yes i know perce i not here to rehash the argument with you we all said hurtful things in the heat of the moment but your father and i are willing to reconcile with you if you are molly took a tentative step forward to embrace her son but to her complete and utter shock percy slammed the door causing tears to spring to her eyes she made her way back to headquarters fighting to keep her tears at bay as she navigated the streets she took out her handkerchief as she waited to gain admittance to number 12 grimmauld place and dabbed at her eyes molly what wrong remus asked noticing the weasley matriarch tears as he stepped aside to allow her to enter i went to try to reconcile with percy and he slammed the door in my face she said sadly allowing more tears to fall cheer up molly he ll come around eventually remus replied gently closing the door behind her and sealing its locks i know remus its just that percy always been a bit closer to my heart than the others not that i love him more i love all of my children equally its just that the events surrounding his birth made arthur and me all the more grateful to have another little one i understand arthur told me a bit about percy birth oh he didntmention anything to me but its all right it just hurts that he stormed out on us the way he did i sure it does but you need to give him some time you can t make him believe voldemort is back molly gave a small squeak of fright at hearing remus use the name but she offered him a small grin nonetheless grateful for his comforting words arthur was saying something about your anniversary this morning is it today oh yes it is twenty six years we ve been married and sometimes i dontknow where the time went i sure you ve had your hands full with raising your family we have i not even quite sure how we survived raising fred and george couldntleave those two unsupervised for more than five minutes most of the time remus chuckled a bit and smiled those two have a mind of their own dontthey they do molly replied chuckling as well however as much as i enjoying this little chat remus i think i going to go upstairs and rest a bit as i have no clue what arthur has planned for us tonight he said something about it being a surprise last night go on then i sure arthur would want you to be all rested up he would and knowing him he probably got something out of the ordinary planned she said moving to make her way up the stairs remus nodded and headed towards the kitchen leaving her standing in the hall sighing happily she made her way to hers and arthur bedroom and to her surprise she noticed a piece of parchment on her pillow she sat down on the edge of the bed and reached for the parchment unfolding it carefully my mollywobbles i have a wonderful evening planned for the two of us and i fairly certain that my surprise will put a bright smile on your beautiful face at five o clock this note will

for you there are four in all so have fun on your little hunt dearest i cantwait to see you and hold you in my arms all night long happy anniversary my love arthur when she had finished reading she felt a familiar tug behind her navel and smiled at arthur thoughtfulness at providing her with a portkey they couldntdisapparate from headquarters and arthur had never been a man who enjoyed seeing his wife covered in soot because of floo travel he thought it was something his beautiful molly never needed to contend with if he could help it moments later molly found herself in her bedroom at the burrow and the note fluttered to the floor as she hugged herself in excitement of not knowing what her husband had planned for their anniversary or where he was for that matter within minutes she had thought of the perfect outfit for the occasion her black halter style dress that left her shoulders bare exposed some of her cleavage had an exposed back and was cut to just above her knees she suppressed a girlish giggle as she pictured what arthur reaction would be to seeing her in that dress since she hadntworn something that exposed so much of her skin in public since before percy had been born however tonight was their night as a couple and she was going to dress up in something that made her feel extremely sexy even though just seeing the way arthur looked at her on a day to day basis let her know she was sexy at least in his eyes she sighed happily as she took out the dress stockings and her black pumps laying the outfit carefully on the bed before making her way to the lavatory planning on taking a long hot bath to relax her tired and sore muscles upon entering the lavatory for her bath she noticed another note on the sink next to arthur shaving gear while she drew the water for her bath she sat on the edge of the tub to read what else her husband had to say about their evening out my mollywobbles i see you ve found my second clue once you re finished here getting all dolled up and such not that you have to you re beautiful no matter what you re wearing make your way to hogwarts on the doors to the entrance hall will be my third clue with further instructions on where you will find me waiting i love you and have fun molly arthur molly turned off the tap as she finished reading and gathered her bathing supplies after putting a few rose scented bath beads into the tub she slid in allowing a soft moan of contentment to escape her throat as the hot water engulfed her body she half wished arthur were joining her as she enjoyed bathing with him but she figured there would be time enough for that later she soaked in the tub until the water became cold and her skin was clammy from the excessive exposure to moisture feeling much more relaxed and happy molly dried off and set to work on her hair until it was full and wavy just barely cascading over her shoulders and covering the back of her neck she slid her engagement and wedding rings back onto her finger and exited the lavatory to finish preparing for her evening out with the man and love of her life after she had dressed and applied just enough makeup to accentuate her features she clasped her necklace with the heart pendent around her neck and apparated to the outskirts of hogsmeade molly made her way to hogwarts as quickly as she could in her pumps eager to see her husband when she reached the doors to the castle her face broke into a wide smile when she saw the note that arthur had placed on the large doors my mollywobbles i see you ve made it here to hogwarts and in a few short minutes we ll be together to celebrate our anniversary but first i want you to go look under our favorite tree by the lake where my last clue is waiting for you as well as a small part of your anniversary gift to help you remember tonight i love you my darling arthur molly sighed as she made her way across the grounds to the beech tree she and arthur always sat under when they were in school to study or just reading one of their favorite novels she was surprised to see a medium sized stuffed lion under the tree and for a second she wondered why it was there but upon closer inspection the lion had the gryffindor crest embroidered on its hindquarters and it dawned on her that the lion was from arthur she picked it up before she looked at the trunk of the tree where arthur had put his fourth and final note to her my mollywobbles you re finished with your little hunt and i hope you like your gryffindor lion but i promise there more to come sweetheart i waiting for you in the gryffindor common room with a bouquet of lovely roses the password to get by the fat lady is snidget love i love you more than anything my queen arthur molly giggled girlishly as she quickly made her way back up to the castle hugging the lion close in delight when she reached the fat lady she said the password and gasped as the portrait swung open revealing her arthur standing in the shadows of flickering light as he had lit several candles to light the common room arthur offered his hand which she gladly took as he gently pulled her through the portrait hole hello ms molly arthur said bringing her hand to his lips and placing a soft kiss on the back of it molly averted her eyes for a moment having no clue as to why she was acting like a schoolgirl around the man that had shared her life for nearly thirty years hello arthur love she replied dropping the lion she had forgotten she was holding molly had to suppress a giggle as she locked eyes with her husband who was staring at her with a gaping mouth looking like a guppy as he opened and closed his mouth several times what is it dear she asked offering him a bright smile nothing you just look um spectacular yes spectacular arthur said forgetting about the roses he had intended to present to his wife as he raked his eyes over her body once more before pulling her close for a crushing kiss thank you you look right handsome yourself arthur molly commented after arthur had released her to take several gulps of air would you mind telling me what albus was thinking when he gave you the entire reign of hogwarts for at least a few hours he didntsay anything molly girl i just asked him if we could pay a visit relive some memories on our anniversary he knows he can trust two former prefects especially since one of them was head girl really well this was very thoughtful of you arthur of all places hogwarts was the place i was least expecting well mollywobbles i wanted to make it fun for you arthur said kissing her forehead say are you sure you re warm enough that dress looks like looks like what arthur dontyou like it of course i like it my dear its just i haventseen you in something so um er revealing in years arthur said blushing a bit as he glanced at her again looking straight at her spectacularly showcased breasts what i a wife and mother and i not allowed to dress in something sexy for my husband oh mollywobbles i didntmean it like that you look beautiful and you re always sexy to me he paused for a moment appraising her entire outfit before he spoke again stockings and all huh and i see you re wearing the pendant i gave you what ten years ago thirteen years ago dear and yes why wouldnti wear the jewelry you give me arthur shrugged and brushed a strand of hair away from her eyes tucking it behind her ear i think you re very talented in picking out jewelry for me arthur and i proud to wear it she said fingering the chain and the pendant with her left hand looking at the floor i know molly you do look beautiful he complimented again tilting her chin so he could look her in the eyes but you are warm enough yeah for the time being yes dear but if i get cold i ve got you haventi of course you do that one of my husbandly duties to keep you warm he said teasingly tapping her on the nose with his forefinger and placing a soft kiss on her lips but enough of the small talk hmm i ve got a lovely evening prepared for us so if you dontmind ms molly would you like to join me for a walk molly nodded and arthur offered her his arm which she gladly took leaning against him as he helped her back through the portrait hole arthur hmm this was very thoughtful of you bringing me to the place we met and fell in love molly commented snuggling a bit with her husband as they made their way through the castle towards the grounds well i wanted tonight to be romantic mollywobbles arthur said gently removing his arm from her grip to wrap it about her waist he blushed slightly as he realized that the dress his wife was wearing exposed her back what is it nothing molly girl i just didntrealize what that i wearing a dress with an exposed back well er um yes dear molly giggled and stopped walking stretching up to kiss her husband sweetly it all right arthur she whispered offering him a smile where exactly is it that you re taking me arthur hand began traveling up and down his wife bare back and it took him a minute to register that she had asked him a question oh well i ve got somewhat of a picnic set up outside love but we can just as easily have it inside if you think you ll be cold he answered his eyes raking across his wife very revealing dress again outside is fine you sure i dontwant you to freeze i sure now why dontyou quit your chattering and take me to our date mr weasley all right mol arthur replied kissing the top of his wife head as he pushed open the doors that led out to the grounds within a few minutes arthur had helped his wife get settled on the picnic blanket he had spread out near the lake and had settled himself dishing out the picnic food he had brought for their meal as well as the wine arthur when did you have the time to plan all this especially since you had to work today i found time mols and in fact i took today off so i could put the finishing touches on tonight he said pouring each of them a glass of wine and leaning over to kiss her i ll always find time to show you just how much i love you on our anniversary mollywobbles no matter how busy things get at home or with the order you re my wife and if i dontpay special attention to you when you deserve it not only will you feel neglected but i ll feel guilty for neglecting you molly wiped a tear away from her eye at hearing her husband say these words to her it always warmed her heart to know just how much arthur cared for her and how much thought he put into their nights out or the gifts that he gave her for all the little occasions you re very sweet arthur and i love you so much for it she said taking a sip of her wine and beginning to eat the meal of sandwiches potato salad and deviled eggs her husband had prepared i love you too my molly arthur replied digging into his meal as well i sorry it nothing fancy but you know i canttop your cooking molly blushed at her husband compliment averting her eyes for a moment dontapologize arthur i ve never wanted a fancy night out with my husband if i did i d have married malfoy once she realized what she had said after thinking over some of their other dates that had been a bit towards the fancy side she added although i have enjoyed the nights that we ve gone out together for dinner and dancing at some of the fancier restaurants arthur i know what you meant molly arthur said wiping his mouth with his napkin and reaching over to brush a stray lock of hair behind his wife ear he then allowed his hand to slip to the back of her neck tilting her head slightly so he could capture her lips with his meanwhile he fumbled in his pocket with his other hand withdrawing a small black box and he pulled back for a moment leaning to whisper in her ear keep your eyes closed mol he said opening the box and sliding the ring that was inside onto her right ring finger arthur what are you doing open your eyes molly girl she happily obliged glancing down at her hands as she was curious to what arthur had been doing arthur why do i need another ring she asked looking intently at the ring that was on her right ring finger mol that a mother ring he said gently grabbing her hand and kissing her finger it a ring with all the kid birthstones set in it in the order that they joined us molly looked carefully at the stones in the ring and sure enough in the order of oldest to youngest all her children birthstones were set into the ring in a perfect line she counted the stones and she saw that each of the twins had their own stone on her ring as well as that the others that had birthdays in the same month had separate stones as well it beautiful arthur she said admiring the way the gems contrasted with the silver of the band i ll wear it always with my wedding and engagement rings thank you you re very welcome my dear arthur replied placing a soft kiss on her lips before moving to whisper in her ear do you want to go back inside molly nodded and arthur stood up helping her up as well as they reentered the common room arthur spotted the lion and bouquet of roses that they had neglected and he gathered them up i believe these are yours ms molly arthur said handing his wife the roses i ll carry the lion for you he commented wrapping his arms about her shoulders are we going home then unless you want to stay here for our shag yes our own bed sounds nice how are we getting home portkey of course wouldntwant you to get all sooty now and i quite sure you dontwant to walk all the way back to hogsmeade just to apparate molly nodded at her husband logic and let out a gasp of surprise when she felt the tug behind her navel she and arthur arrived home moments later almost falling into a heap as they landed in their bedroom arthur immediately put the lion on her wardrobe and lay the roses on his dresser before pulling her close he placed a quick peck on the tip of her nose before lowering for another more heated kiss his hand caressing her cheek and gently tilting her head to the side to allow him to deepen the kiss molly moaned into his mouth kicking off her shoes as his hands began stroking up and down her bare back once again bringing her closer to his chest in a matter of moments he had set her gently on the bed and pushed up the hem of her dress to gain access to the garters that were holding her stockings up and he kissed his way down her legs as he removed her stockings massaging her thigh as he worked causing his wife to let out a stream of delicious noises when he had finished molly began working at his clothing as well while he continued to lavish her with kisses arthur go slower molly moaned becoming frustrated with the speed at which her husband was removing her clothing and his as well all right mol he replied latching onto her lips for a slow heated kiss as he moved so he was above her he conceded to his wife request kissing a slow trail down her front while his hand danced between her thighs teasing her clit through her panties causing her to arch her hips insistently he smiled as he paid close attention to her breasts rolling his tongue around her nipple and nipping lightly at her skin after an hour or so of teasing arthur trailed kisses along his wife jaw line before nibbling at her ear arthur molly said letting out a loud groan as her husband thrust deep inside her with his finger causing her to nearly lose all self control as his thumb brushed against her clitoris what he asked his voice husky with desire for her as her hand was clenched around his penis the only thing keeping him from entering her and finding release i love you i love you too mollywobbles he said his fingers still rubbing circles around her clit and he knew she was close to her orgasm are you ready for me when molly nodded and released him he positioned himself carefully at her opening and thrust into her as hard and as deep as he could manage as he began moving he rubbed furiously at her firm nub knowing she didntneed much more to get over the edge arthur nearly screamed as he came and it was only a few seconds later before molly was lost in her own climax when he had collapsed and rolled off to the side he drew her close merlin molly remind me why we couldntdo that at headquarters because i dontlike our room there oh yes that right but now i dontfeel like moving and we ve got to get back he said kissing her softly no we don t we can stay the night here and then go back early tomorrow molly said snuggling closer to her husband letting out a soft sigh you re right mol thank you now rest up you ve got guard duty tomorrow night dontyou yes and speaking of guard duty if you feel like i neglecting you because i exhausted say something all right i will arthur good night good night molly he replied kissing her forehead go on to sleep you re perfectly safe here molly smiled and rested her head against his shoulder feeling very content and happy as arthur drew the coverlet around them snugglebear molly asked coming into the kitchen at order headquarters slightly surprised to see her husband standing at the stove what is it mollywobbles arthur responded turning around at the sound of his wife voice i was just wondering why you werentin bed she replied slipping her arms around his waist resting her head against his chest his arms wrapped around her pulling her a bit closer to him i sorry i woke you didnti you left the bed cold dear he remained silent dropping a kiss to the top of her head what on your mind arthur hmm what i asked you what on your mind oh sorry molly girl i ve just been thinking about what nothing you should worry about ministry troubles he replied resting his chin on her head after pressing a kiss to her forehead what do you mean ministry troubles and nothing you should worry about mol its all right really i just feel like fudge is waiting for me to slip up because we re with dumbledore on the subject of you know who oh well sweetheart i sure you ll be fine you re very

children absolutely adore you and i love you as i do you molly girl its just that i d give each and every one of you the world if i could hush arthur i know however i love the life i have with you and you are quite a ways from being failure no matter what you think you are a wonderful father and the best husband a witch could hope for that must count more than what your status at the ministry does i know it does darling i guess that why i ve got you to remind me that i am a lucky man of course it is arthur now how about coming back up to bed and warming me up as you left me awful cold of course i will canthave my wife catching a cold now can i i should hope you wouldntlet me catch a cold dear husband of mine of course i wouldn t i hopeless at playing healer not entirely love you ve taken good care of us on a few occasions that we ve been sick if you say so mol come on we both have an early start in the morning he moved so he was standing next to her slipping his hand into hers weaving their fingers together lead the way arthur smiled bending down to kiss her cheek swiftly before he led the way up to their bedroom a n i know i know another short chapter with not much action and a whole lot of fluff but i quite sure the next chapter will be jam packed a n its finally done hope you like and now that school back in session i ve got more stress more stressmore writing so hopefully updates wontbe so long in coming enjoy as usual molly groaned loudly as her ears perked up at the sound of someone moving about her room opening her eyes she noticed it was still dark and rolled into her pillow before she heard someone muttering in a low voice arthur love is that you she called quietly wondering whom else would be in their room at this hour what mol arthur asked rolling over in the bed wrapping his arm about his wife waist um dear if you re in bed who in our room molly questioned gripping her husband arm as she cuddled closer i dontknow molly girl go back to sleep he said kissing her temple did you lock our door when you came to bed no dear i didn t kreacher she whispered nestling her head under his chin hmm ron told me kreacher wanders the house while we sleep oh molly remained silent listening to see if kreacher had left the room and breathed a sigh of relief when all she heard was silence are you okay mollywobbles arthur asked shifting slightly so her head was resting on his shoulder she nodded keeping her head in contact with his shoulder as she slipped her arms around him lock the door please arthur acknowledged his wife request sitting up in the bed and waving his wand to close and lock their door he pulled her close as he settled back into bed pressing a kiss to her brow thank you arthur not a problem my dear go on back to sleep molly obeyed nestling against her husband side as she closed her eyes arthur smiled a gentle smile at his wife as he pulled the blankets a little tighter around her and kissed the top of her head the following evening molly was cooking dinner when arthur arrived at headquarters looking flustered after ushering him into the kitchen and closing the curtains on mrs black she gave him a cup of tea what is it arthur she asked taking the seat next to him while the others filed in around the table harry in trouble with the ministry arthur replied taking a sip of tea what kind of trouble remus asked looking at arthur intently he used the patronus charm in the presence of his cousin and according to dumbledore he was attacked by dementors what are dementors doing in little whinging good question dumbledore reckons they were sent there by you know who anyway harry supposed to attend a disciplinary hearing on the 12th of august arthur said rubbing his hands over his face sending his glasses askew oh dear molly replied gripping her husband arm lightly while sirius excused himself from the group dumbledore said he d work something out as a means of removing harry from the dursleys to here within the next couple of days the room nodded and after a few minutes of silence molly spoke do you have to go back in no molly girl i was on my way home when dumbledore arrived at the ministry and told me what had happened he replied taking another sip of tea after patting his wife hand and straightening his glasses molly smiled glancing toward a corner of the room noticing something long thin and flesh colored arthur dear what that what what love that she said pointing towards the object in question arthur followed his wife line of eyesight cocking his head i dontknow what it is molly why do you ask i ve seen it in here a few times i was curious as to what it was he sighed knowing his wife was hinting to him that she wanted him to be the man of the house and investigate the others had dispersed after arthur had begun a conversation with his wife leaving the couple alone arthur crossed the room toward the object stooping to pick it up it a piece of rubber mols he said shaking his head and dropping it back to the floor then why does it extend towards the door she asked pointing out that not only did it extend to the door but it appeared to extend beyond it as well he sighed again knowing she was on the brink of fretting about the object until he took some course of action i dontknow dear would you like me to see where it goes she nodded following close behind as he opened the door and gasped as the rubber began moving encouraging them to follow in pursuit after several minutes of wandering around headquarters they arrived at the twins bedroom door exchanging a puzzled look as the object retreated inside there your answer molly its one of fred and george inventions he shrugged turning to go back downstairs molly was still curious as to what the object was and knocked softly on the twins door after her husband had retreated back down the stairs who is it mum could i come in and talk to you both for a minute molly answered placing her hand on the doorknob sure mum come in molly entered the room noticing that fred had hastily stuffed something into his pocket as she opened the door she sat down on the edge of george mattress folding her hands in her lap i was wondering what the object i found down in the kitchen a few minutes ago was oh it was nothing mum it was something george weasley now what is it she demanded glaring at her sons nothing mum honest then why did it move neither fred nor george answered the question but they shrugged and looked at the floor let me see it please fred dug into his pocket handing her the object continuing to look away after close examination molly came to the conclusion it was some sort of listening device and worded her next question carefully i ve seen this down in the kitchen during order meetings you know there a reason you children arentpresent why would this be there george opened his mouth to answer the question and fred elbowed his brother in the ribs you ve been listening in on the meetings haventyou yes mum hand all of them over now i dontappreciate you going against my orders mum we are of age i dontcare as long as you re living under the same roof as your father and i you will abide by my rules hand them over fred and george reluctantly emptied their pockets into their mother hands and after a few accio spells molly was confidant that she had all of the objects in her possession thank you boys if i ever see one of these things in that kitchen again while there an order meeting i will tan your behinds i brought you into this world i can just as easily take you back out of it yes mum she returned back downstairs joining her husband at the table arthur what molly she took a deep breath before answering not quite sure how to word her concern about an earlier comment he had made earlier when you were telling us about harry you referred to this place as home this isntour home arthur chuckled slipping an arm around her shoulders and pressing a kiss to the top of her head i know it isntour home in terms as the one where we ve lived our married lives and raised our children but its home for the moment she gave him a puzzled look cocking her head not quite sure she understood what i mean mollywobbles is that home is where my wife and children are and right now you guys are here that makes this place my home oh i never thought of it that way he just smiled kissing her sweetly i know mol i know a n well here you go your second update in less than 2 weeks arentyou proud of me lol enjoy molly sighed with relief when she a heard the front door of grimmauld place open and excused herself from the order meeting that was in progress knowing that it was the others with harry after ushering them inside she showed harry to the room he would share with ron once she was sure all the children were still in their rooms harry was settled and they werentattempting to eavesdrop on the order she returned to the kitchen sliding back into the empty chair next to her husband s arthur immediately gripped her hand again giving it a gentle squeeze did i miss anything she whispered resting her head against his shoulder nothing important mol arthur whispered back kissing the top of her head before diverting his attention from his wife back to what sirius was saying she nodded turning her attention to sirius as well when the meeting was over molly headed upstairs to inform the children that they could join everyone downstairs and on her way through she noticed a small number of dungbombs outside the kitchen door briefly wondering how they had gotten there the meeting over you can come down and have dinner now everyone dying to see you harry and who left all the dungbombs outside the kitchen door she asked surveying her youngest children as well as hermione and harry crookshanks said ginny unblushingly he loves playing with them oh molly said i thought it might have been kreacher he keeps doing odd things like that now dontforget to keep your voices down in the hall ginny your hands are filthy what have you been doing go and wash them before dinner please she then turned around to head downstairs with ginny on her heels and she checked to make sure that ginny ducked into the loo on the way and she say that tonks and remus were magically sealing the locks at the front door behind those who had left and immediately began to help once she arrived at the bottom of the stairs when she harry ron and hermione making their way down to dinner she met them at the bottom of the stairs we re eating down in the kitchen she whispered to the trio harry dear if you ll just tiptoe across the hall its through this door here crash tonks molly cried exasperatedly turning to look behind her i sorry wailed tonks who was lying flat on the floor it that stupid umbrella stand that the second time i ve tripped over her words were drowned by a horrible earsplitting bloodcurdling screech coming from the portrait of mrs black molly darted forward with remus to try and tug the curtains shut over the old woman but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever filth scum by products of dirt and vileness half breeds mutants freaks begone from this place how dare you befoul the house of my fathers as tonks apologized over and over again and dragged the huge heavy troll leg back off the floor molly abandoned her attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall stunning all the other portraits with her wand while sirius struck up a conversation with harry she headed into the kitchen somewhat surprised that the table hadntbeen cleared after the meeting she noticed that arthur and bill were quietly talking with their heads together at the end of the table she cleared her throat and half smiled when arthur looked around and jumped to his feet hurrying forward to greet harry and shake his hand vigorously harry said arthur good to see you journey all right harry bill called trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once mad eye didntmake you come via greenland then he tried said tonks striding over to help bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment oh no sorry here dear molly said knowing she sounded as exasperated as she felt she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand and she noticed that harry had been looking and had caught a glimpse of the parchment in the flash of light caused by her charm she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into bill heavily laden arms this sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she began unloading dinner plates she began the dinner preparations hardly listening to the conversation that was continuing around her when the scent of mundungus pipe invaded her nostrils she called out to him for the last time mundungus will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen especially not when we re about to eat ah said mundungus right sorry molly and if you want dinner before midnight i ll need a hand molly said addressing the room at large no you can stay where you are harry dear you ve had a long journey what can i do molly said tonks enthusiastically bounding forward molly hesitated feeling nervous about allowing tonks to help with dinner er no its all right tonks you have a rest too you ve done enough today no no i want to help said tonks brightly knocking over a chair as she hurried toward the dresser from which ginny was collecting cutlery it wasntlong before arthur was supervising a series of heavy knives that were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord while molly stirred a large cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates more goblets and food from the pantry when dinner was finished molly appointed fred and george the task of carrying the food over to the table fred george no just carry them she shrieked noticing that they had bewitched the cauldron of stew an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard complete with knife to hurtle through the air toward harry sirius and mundungus she held her breath as the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash spilling its contents everywhere and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed point down and quivering ominously exactly where sirius right hand had been seconds before for heaven sake screamed molly there wasa no need i ve had enough of this just because you re allowed to use magic now you donthave to whip your wands out for every tiny little thing we were just trying to save a bit of time said fred hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table sorry sirius mate didntmean to boys arthur said lifting the stew back into the middle of the table your mother right you re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you ve come of age none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble molly raged at the twins slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer on the table and spilling almost as much again bill didntfeel the need to apparate every few feet charlie didntcharm everything he met percy she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression was suddenly wooden let eat said bill quickly it looks wonderful molly said remus ladling stew onto a plate for her and handing it across the table molly gladly took her plate from him sitting down for a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food then molly turned to sirius and said i ve been meaning to tell you there something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room it keeps rattling and shaking of course it could just be a boggart but i thought we ought to ask alastor to have a look at it before we let it out whatever you like said sirius indifferently the curtains in there are full of doxies too molly went on i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow i look forward to it said sirius molly dropped the conversation with sirius turning her attention toward the intense discussion arthur was having with bill and remus about goblins they re not giving anything away yet bill was saying i still cantwork out whether they believe he back or not course they might prefer not to take sides at all keep out of it i sure they d never go to you know who said arthur shaking his head they ve suffered losses too remember that goblin family he murdered last time somewhere near nottingham i think it depends what they re offered said remus and i not talking about gold if they re offered freedoms we ve been denying them for centuries they re going to be tempted have you still not had any luck with ragnok bill he feeling pretty anti wizard at the moment said bill he hasntstopped raging about the bagman business he reckons the ministry did a cover up those goblins never got their gold from him you know a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of bill words causing molly to turn her head fred george ron and mundungus were rolling around in their seats and then choked mundungus tears running down his face and then if you ll believe it e says to me e says ere dung where didja get all them toads from cos some son of a bludger gone and nicked all mine and i says nicked all your toads will what next so you ll be wanting some more then and if you ll believe me lads the gormless gargoyle buys all is own toads back orf me for twice what e paid in the first place i dontthink we need to hear any more of your business dealings thank you very much mundungus said molly sharply as ron slumped forward onto the table howling with laughter beg pardon molly said mundungus at once wiping his eyes and winking at harry but you know will nicked em orf warty harris in the first place so i wasntreally doing nothing wrong i dontknow where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons said molly coldly fred and george buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer george was hiccupping before she got to her feet to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding she threw sirius a very nasty look once everyone had finished their pudding general conversation enveloped the table nearly time for bed i think said molly on a yawn not just yet molly said sirius pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at harry you know i surprised at you i thought the first thing you d do when you got here would be start asking questions about voldemort the atmosphere in the room changed rapidly where it had been sleepily relaxed it was now alert even tense a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of voldemort name remus who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking wary i did said harry indignantly i asked ron and hermione but they said we re not allowed in the order so and they re quite right said molly you re too young she was sitting bolt upright in her chair her fists clenched upon its arms and she didntfeel tired anymore since when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask questions asked sirius harry been trapped in that muggle house for a month he got the right to know what been happen hang on interrupted george loudly how come harry gets his questions answered said fred angrily we ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haventtold us a single stinking thing said george you re too young you re not in the order said fred in a high pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother s harry not even of age it not my fault you haventbeen told what the order doing said sirius calmly that your parents decision harry on the other hand it not down to you decide what good for harry said molly sharply you haventforgotten what dumbledore said i suppose which bit sirius asked politely but with an air as though readying himself for a fight the bit about not telling harry more than he needs to know said molly placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words i dontintend to tell him more than he needs to know molly said sirius but as he was the one who saw voldemort come back again there was a collective shudder around the table at the name he has more right than most to he not a member of the order of the phoenix said molly he only fifteen and and he dealt with as much as most in the order said sirius and more than some no one denying what he done said molly her voice rising her fists trembling on the arms of her chair but he still he not a child said sirius impatiently he not an adult either said molly feeling her cheeks become warm he not james sirius i perfectly clear on who he is thanks molly said sirius coldly i not sure you are said molly sometimes the way you talk about him its as though you think you ve got your best friend back what wrong with that said harry what wrong harry is that you are not your father however much you might look like him said molly her eyes still boring into sirius you are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it meaning i an irresponsible godfather demanded sirius his voice rising meaning you ve been known to act rashly sirius which is why dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and we ll leave my instructions from dumbledore out of this if you please said sirius loudly arthur said molly rounding on her husband arthur back me up arthur did not speak at once he took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes not looking at his wife only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say dumbledore knows the position has changed molly he accepts that harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters yes but there a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes personally said remus quietly looking away from sirius at last as molly turned quickly to him hopeful that she was finally about to get an ally i think it better that harry gets the facts not all the facts molly but the general picture from us rather than a garbled version from others molly knew he was referring to the listening devices she had confiscated from the twins and briefly wondered if she had succeeded in getting rid of all of them well said molly breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come well i can see i going to be overruled i ll just say this dumbledore must have his reasons for not wanting harry to know too much and speaking as someone who has got harry best interests at heart he not your son said sirius quietly he as good as said molly fiercely who else has he got he got me yes said molly curling her lip the thing is its been rather difficult for you to look after him while you ve been locked up in azkaban hasntit sirius started to rise from his chair molly you re not the only person at this table who cares about harry said remus sharply sirius sit down molly felt as if she was going to cry her lower lip was beginning to tremble while sirius sank slowly back into his chair i think harry ought to be allowed to have a say in this remus continued he old enough to decide for himself i want to know what been going on harry said at once very well said molly her voice cracking ginny ron hermione fred george i want you out of this kitchen now there was an instant uproar we re of age fred and george bellowed together if harry allowed why canti shouted ron mum i want to wailed ginny no shouted molly standing up feeling tears fill her eyes i absolutely forbid molly you cantstop fred and george said arthur wearily they are of age they re still at school but they re legally adults now said arthur in the same tired voice i oh all right then fred and george can stay but ron harry ll tell me and hermione everything you say anyway said ron hotly won t wontyou he added uncertainly meeting harry eyes course i will said harry and ron and hermione beamed fine shouted molly fine ginny bed molly rose and headed toward the stairs hearing her daughter rage and storm behind her molly then heard mrs black shrieks tart up again because of all the noise her daughter was making once she reached the room gin and hermione were sharing she sat down on the edge of the ginny bed watching as she went through her nightly routine mum you can go now i ll be good and stay up here ginny said slightly annoyed molly nodded and stood to leave i just though you d want to talk i don t all right good night molly left ginny room and headed toward the landing she still felt like she needed to cry but she knew she had to get back down to the kitchen before the others gave harry too much information she took several deep breaths as she made her way down the stairs calming herself down she reached the kitchen doorway staying in the shadows listening to the conversation in the kitchen he tricks jinxes and blackmails them he well practiced at operating in secrecy in any case gathering followers is only one thing he interested in he got other plans too plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed and he concentrating on them at the moment she heard sirius say what he after apart from followers harry asked swiftly stuff he can only get by stealth sirius said molly could just make out the puzzled look on harry face and sirius continued like a weapon something he didnthave last time when he was powerful before yes like what kind of weapon said harry something worse then avada kedavra molly spoke up after harry question before sirius answered it she was furious again and had crossed her arms when she had returned to the doorway that enough i want you in bed now all of you she added looking around at fred george ron and hermione you cantboss us fred began watch me molly snarled trembling slightly and looking at sirius you ve given them plenty of information anymore and you might just as well induct him into the order straightaway why not said harry quickly i ll join i want to join i want to fight no remus said the order is comprised only of overage wizards he continued wizards who have left school he added as fred and george opened their mouths there are dangers involved of which you can have no idea any of you i think molly right sirius we ve said enough sirius half shrugged but did not argue molly beckoned imperiously to her sons and hermione one by one they stood up and harry followed suit after making sure they went to bed without talking molly headed to her and arthur room and she was surprised to see him disrobing when she entered why didntyou back me up she asked sitting on the edge of the bed staring at his back arthur remained silent buttoning his pajama top arthur i would like an answer please he sighed turning around to look at her i was going to mol i swear after remus interrupted me though i thought it best to just keep my mouth shut i sorry molly nodded recalling the fight and agreeing with his reasoning i just want to protect them they shouldnthave to deal with this arthur sensed that the danger of a fight with his wife had passed and crossed the room to join her i know you do but fred and george are of age now and they dontwant our protection however much you may want to give it to them i know but ron and ginny harry and hermione as well are too young to know what you and the others told harry hush now mollywobbles they re growing up you cantprotect them forever even if you are their mother he engulfed her in a hug pressing a kiss to her forehead she sighed returning the embrace i not ready to let them go especially with you know who rising again arthur nodded understanding where his wife was coming from resting his cheek against the top of her head are you all right now love i saw those tears earlier i think so i was frustrated and upset no one supported my views i am sorry mol i was going to remus just didntlet me finish i know but you had me worried i back you up no matter what that you do molly girl for the record i ll always support you and back you up thank you dear she pressed a kiss to his cheek as she pulled away to get ready for bed herself as she stood up he held her back kissing her softly she held back a moan almost wishing they were at the burrow she quickly changed into her nightgown and climbed into bed on her side after she had gotten settled arthur followed suit pulling her into his arms and kissing her again pulling her closer to him i really wish you were comfortable here professor mcgonagall said it might be in our best interests to stay here during the school year as well while you were greeting harry do we have to arthur i want to go home the day the children leave for hogwarts shush i know i told her we d talk it over but that most likely we d be returning home molly smiled slipping her arms around him and giving him a gentle squeeze thank you you re welcome dear arthur replied kissing her quickly and squeezing her waist affectionately good night i love you love you too mollywobbles good night a n i believe this is one of my shorter chapters and i apologize about how slow this is going i was really hoping to be through book six before book seven came out but i wasntcounting on an english class that was going to burn me out of my writing ability in my spare time i trying and i promise next chapter is definitely going to be molly boggart and then things should start picking up a bit as always recognizable dialogue from the books isntmine it j k s enjoy except for an incident with mundungus and a batch of stolen cauldrons things were quiet around grimmauld place in the days leading up to harry hearing at the ministry molly had taken it upon herself to make sure that harry looked as presentable as possible and had pressed his clothes for the next day it had been decided at dinner that arthur would be responsible for taking harry to the hearing as well as bringing him back to grimmauld place once the hearing was over currently molly was pacing back and forth at the end of the bed having checked that arthur alarm had been set properly for the third time molly come to bed arthur stated finding it hard to concentrate on his book with his wife moving about the room when she didntacknowledge him he closed his book in frustration sighing as he dropped it on his bedside table loudly in an attempt to attract his wife attention what she asked annoyed with her husband display she turned around to look at him throwing him a scowl come to bed molly girl arthur repeated choosing not to acknowledge the look on her face as he turned over onto his side patting the empty space next to him on the bed please and quit worrying everything will turn out just fine with harry molly obliged settling into the comfort of his arms snuggling into his chest you think so arthur nodded pressing a kiss to the top of her head the law is in his favor and amelia bones is fair she ll hear him out molly remained silent nestling her head under her husband chin slipping her arms around him arthur gave her a gentle squeeze burying his face in her hair taking in her scent good night mol i love you molly returned his sentiment adjusting slightly to kiss him softly before returning to her original position and drifting off to sleep the next morning arthur awoke earlier than usual smiling down at his wife who had somehow slept through the buzzing of the alarm clock thus far he carefully maneuvered them around after shutting off the clock and tucked the covers firmly around molly once he had managed to get out of bed he then stumbled to the lavatory that was attached not only to his and molly room but remus as well after showering and dressing he noticed that molly was still sleeping so he leaned over her kissing her lips softly until she awoke what time is it arthur she asked groggily pulling the blankets closer to her body as she moved closer to him time for you to get up dear you overslept he replied tugging the blankets off of his wife why didntyou wake me up when you got up i figured i d let you sleep you dontget a chance to sleep in with all you do sweetheart he said reaching for her hand to pull his wife into a sitting position molly groaned loudly wanting to go back to sleep some days it was just too early arthur reached for her dressing robe holding it for her as she slipped her arms into it thank you is harry up i dontthink so i trust he ll be up in a little bit in the meantime molly dear are you awake enough to cook your husband some breakfast she nodded yawning widely as she led the way to the door and downstairs to the kitchen she and arthur were the first ones downstairs and molly had breakfast ready by the time remus sirius and tonks had trickled in harry stumbled in not long after arthur and the others had finished breakfast and had turned the conversation toward ministry affairs and rufus scrimgeour when harry entered the kitchen molly leapt to her feet pulling out her wand and hurrying to the fire m m morning harry yawned tonks sleep all right yeah said harry i ve b b been up all night she said with another shuddering yawn come and sit down she drew out a chair knocking over the one beside it in the process what do you want harry molly called porridge muffins kippers bacon and eggs toast just just toast thanks said harry molly immediately set to work on preparing harry breakfast placing a couple of pieces in front of him with marmalade before she sat down next to him and started fussing with his t shirt she tucked the label in and smoothed out the creases across his shoulders she had barely been paying attention to the conversation until tonks had said she wouldntbe able to do night duty the following evening i ll cover for you arthur said i okay i ve got a report to finish anyway molly inwardly sighed at that it meant that she d be sleeping alone again something she never looked forward to especially in this house she d have to talk to him about that later how are you feeling arthur continued turning to harry harry shrugged it ll all be over soon arthur said bracingly in a few hours time you ll be cleared harry remained silent and arthur continued the hearing on my floor in amelia bones office she head of the department of magical law enforcement and she s the one who ll be questioning you amelia bones is okay harry said tonks earnestly she fair she ll hear you out harry nodded dontlose your temper sirius said abruptly be polite and stick to the facts harry nodded again the law on your side said remus quietly even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life threatening situations at this point molly began to attack harry hair with wet comb pressing hard on the top of his head doesntit ever lie flat she asked desperately harry shook his head as arthur said i think we ll go now we re a bit early but i think you ll be better off there than hanging around here okay said harry dropping his toast and getting to his feet you ll be all right harry said tonks patting him on the arm good luck said remus i sure you ll be fine and if its not said sirius grimly i ll see to amelia bones for you harry smiled weakly and molly hugged him we ve all got our fingers crossed she said right well see you later then harry said before he followed arthur out of the kitchen after they left molly headed upstairs to shower half wanting to go back to bed instead when she finished showering she decided she would go back to bed considering that grimmauld place was mostly decontaminated anyway and the children as well as she needed a break she awoke to the sound of ron pounding on the door complaining that he was hungry and had gone with a pitiful breakfast because she had been sleeping in molly groaned loudly pulling the pillow over her head hoping her youngest son would give up and leave her alone for a little while longer as in maybe a few more hours when ron didntgo away she pulled herself out of bed quickly dressing before opening the door what is it ron i was trying to sleep she said irritably resisting the urge to smack him upside the head sorry mum i hungry i gathered as much but what wrong with allowing your mother to sleep in if you haventnoticed i didntwake you this morning yeah mum but i hungry its lunchtime molly sighed and gestured for him to go downstairs and she followed somewhat surprised to see that everyone else was in the kitchen as well and wondered why someone else couldnthave handled lunch no sooner than she had put the finishing touches on it harry and arthur returned announcing that harry had been cleared i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all everyone seems quite relieved though considering they all knew i d get off said harry smiling molly used her apron to wipe away the tears that had sprung to her eyes at the news that he had gotten off as fred george and ginny did a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off that enough settle down arthur shouted though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry what said sirius sharply he got off he got off he got off be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to fudge office together dumbledore ought to know absolutely said sirius we ll tell him dontworry well i d better get going there a vomiting toilet in bethnal green waiting for me molly i ll be late i covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner he got off he got off he got off that enough fred george ginny molly said as her husband left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast she said beginning to serve lunch to everyone she decided she d leave the children to talking amongst themselves and only butt in after ron had mentioned the possibility of dumbledore turning up that evening to celebrate with them i dontthink he ll be able to ron she said setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry he really busy at the moment he got off he got off he got off shut up molly roared as they were beginning to give her a headache after lunch she put the children back to work cleaning this time working in one of the bedrooms that wasntoccupied she figured they could handle it by themselves and left them alone for most of the afternoon still not finished she said poking her head into a cupboard after entering the bedroom to check up on them i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly d you know how much mold we ve got rid of since we arrived here you were so keen to help the order she said you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in besides i gave you break this morning if you hadntnoticed ron she added mentally nearly rolling her eyes at how much complaining she d heard today alone i feel like a house elf ron grumbled well now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps you ll be a bit more active in s p e w said hermione hopefully as molly turned to exit the room happy with her decision to give herself a partial day off molly yawned widely as she heard her youngest son begin to go on a tangent about the broom she had gotten him for being made prefect and smiled at the thought of a fourth prefect in the family she was proud of him but there was only so much broomstick and quidditch talk a woman could take in one night well i think i ll sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i dontwant this lot up too late all right night harry dear as she crossed the kitchen she took several deep breaths knowing that she would need her wits about her if she was going to tackle a boggart especially since she had been having nightmares about her loved ones recently she shook herself knowing she shouldntthink about that and pushed open the door to the drawing room gathering her gryffindor courage she took out her wand and opened the drawer to the writing desk as the boggart approached her it immediately turned into an image of a dead charlie and she quickly thought of one of ginny dresses and ginny long hair to make the image look funny riddikulus she shouted pointing her wand at the image her plan backfired however instead of a charlie with long hair and a dress the figure turned into ginny herself also as a dead figure she fought to hold back tears as she tried again but ginny figure turned into ron s without realizing it she had backed herself against the wall and she was sobbing freely mrs weasley molly barely recognized the voice as harry s but she didntturn towards him instead she focused on her task which was becoming more and more impossible with each crack the boggart changed into another one of her family members bill arthur the twins percy harry with each new figure sobs took her and she felt very helpless mrs weasley just get out of here let someone else what going on in here she recognized the voice as remus and she looked at him trying to keep from crying hysterically after he had banished the boggart she gulped as she broke into a storm of crying cradling her face in her hands molly remus said bleakly as he walked over to her molly don t the next thing she knew she was sobbing her heart out on his shoulder while he tried to calm her patting her head it was just a boggart molly just a stupid boggart i see them d d dead all the time all the t t time i d d dream about it d d donttell arthur molly managed to gasp up as she gulped and wiped her eyes frantically with her cuffs i d d dontwant him to know being silly she took the handkerchief remus offered her and blew her nose harry i so sorry what must you think of me she began shakily not quite sure how to handle the situation before her not even able to get rid of a boggart dontbe stupid harry said and she could tell he was trying to smile i just s s so worried she said feeling the tears begin to spill over again half the f f family in the order it ll b b be a miracle if we all come through this and p p percy not talking to us what if something d d dreadful happens and we had never m m made up and what going to happen if arthur and i get killed who g g going to look after ron and ginny molly that enough remus said firmly this isntlike last time the order are better prepared we ve got a head start we know what voldemort up to as remus said the name molly gave a little squeak of fright oh molly come on it about time you got used to hearing it look i cantpromise no one going to get hurt nobody can promise that but we re much better off than we were last time you werentin the order then you dontunderstand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one dontworry about percy sirius interjected he ll come round it a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole ministry going to be begging us to forgive them and i not sure i ll be accepting their apology he said rather bitterly molly looked up not having noticed that sirius had come into the room too and as for who going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died what do you think we d do let them starve remus asked and molly noticed a slight smile on his lips she returned the smile and continued to mop at her eyes being silly she muttered again and she made her way out of the drawing room and to hers and arthur bedroom after changing into her nightgown she climbed into bed to wait for her husband deciding that arthur needed to know her fears however irrational they may be are you all right pumpkin arthur asked coming into the room and noticing the slight puffiness around his wife eyes as if she had been crying earlier not exactly she answered looking down at the coverlet and wringing her hands nervously molly what ever it is you can tell me you know that there a reason why we ve made this marriage work for almost thirty years now he commented smiling slightly as he sat on the bed next to her and wrapping an arm about her shoulders when she remained silent arthur decided to press her for information did something happen with the boggart feeling her jump he guessed that he had hit on the right topic tell me he whispered placing a kiss to the top of her head molly took a deep breath closed her eyes and leaned against him before answering i just so scared i see you and the kids dead in my dreams arthur pulled her into a tight embrace and he heard her voice fill with tears i know darling i know we lost a lot during the first war but i will promise you i ll always be with you all right what do you mean arthur no one can promise shush i ll be with you whether here in the flesh or spiritually all right as long as you keep me here he placed a hand over her heart i ll be with you you hear me she nodded wiping away more tears as she leaned into his embrace arthur i dontthink i could live without you though you ve been there for me through every major event in my life molly he said gently slipping a hand under her chin what we have is amazing we ve been each other best friend and confidante and we ve built a strong love and marriage out of that relationship it not something that just going to go away it will still be there even if i gone okay look at the kids molly you ve always said that they look extremely like me especially the boys well they do they take after their father she said quietly shifting her eyes down again they ve got your mannerisms your sweetness your kindness they got all of that from you too my dear i see as much of you in those children as you see of me in them he stroked his thumb across her lips and then leaned down to kiss her softly you all better now love he asked stroking her hair with his long fingers molly nodded and arthur kissed her again before getting ready for bed himself when he climbed in next to her he slipped his arms around her holding her tightly and planted a kiss on her forehead before keeping watch over her until she had fallen into a peaceful sleep arthur whistled as he made his way up the lane that led to the back door of the burrow even though winter was approaching he still enjoyed apparating to a point just outside of ottery st catchpole and walking home when he entered the kitchen the smell of molly cooking immediately invaded his nostrils he removed his cloak and shoes before padding over to his wife catching her in a hug when she walked past to finish setting the table arthur what he asked drawing her close to him i trying to get dinner on the table and you re holding me up that s what well molly i order you to sit down and let me finish with the preparations no i ll do it you ve been at work all day you dontneed to do my job too i dontneed to but i want to sit molly obeyed settling in her chair at the table watching as her husband finished setting the table and served her before serving himself thank you arthur you re welcome molly girl it looks delicious he replied lifting his fork to dig in to the meal he knew his wife had slaved over as when it was just the two of them she tended to cook the muggle way if only so it d take longer after a few moments of silence arthur remembered the owl he had received from remus before he had come home molly we need to go to headquarters when we re finished for what dear mundungus overheard something in hogsmeade and remus thinks we should know about it as it deals with our children and the latest educational decree that was approved oh dear what are they up to now i ve no idea mols arthur i ve got duty tonight did you remember wha oh yes i did what time do you have to report eight i should be home before you re up again to go to work arthur nodded glancing at his watch well if you ve got to report at eight we d better get going and hear what remus has to say about the kids without a word molly stood and collected the dishes placing them in the sink will you wash these or should i put the charm on them now i ll wash them molly come on he held out her cloak for her draping it over her shoulders before he pulled his own back on apparate together or separately together i d rather not be alone for any length of time in that part of town all right he pulled her close to him and apparated to a secluded walkway about two blocks from grimmauld place all parts accounted for love he asked playfully knowing full well he hadntleft anything behind of him or his wife yes arthur stay close arthur nodded reaching for her hand and giving it a gentle squeeze before he set off at a brisk pace towards headquarters after they arrived and remus had ushered them inside they settled in the parlor along with sirius since there was no one around to eavesdrop on the conversation well as i told you in the owl i sent arthur mundungus was in the hog head on saturday and overheard harry ron and hermione conduct a meeting about forming a club to teach themselves defense against the dark arts as dolores umbridge is only teaching them out of the book and not allowing them apply what they ve learned he also said that several students were at the meeting as well and he cantbe sure but he thinks fred george and ginny were there as well the group isnta horrible idea actually except that the newest educational decree states that no organization society team group and club meant for students can not exist without dolores umbridge knowledge and you know she wontallow it are they going to continue with it anyway even if it illegal molly asked anxiously the last thing they needed was for their children to get expelled and thrown out of hogwarts in her opinion hogwarts was the only place that was truly safe i dontknow sirius was going to talk to them tonight remus replied nodding in sirus direction surely you aren t i ve told you its dangerous especially with that umbridge woman practically running the place now is it really worth your head to talk to harry arthur remained silent knowing he and molly would have a discussion about the matter later in private yes it is molly he my godson that may very well be but its not going to do you a lick of good if you wind up in azkaban again will it no but i careful now is there anything you want me to pass on to them yes actually i d tell them myself but i ve got duty tonight and i cantvery well send an owl without the fear of getting them in trouble if its intercepted tell ron that on no account whatsoever is he to take part in an illegal secret defense against the dark arts group he ll be expelled for sure and his future will be ruined there ll be plenty of time for him to learn how to defend himself later and that he is too young to worry about that right now i also advise harry and hermione not to proceed with the group even though i accept the fact i have no authority over either of them and i simply beg them to remember that i have their best interests at heart yes molly i ll make sure they get the message shouldntyou be at the ministry sirius asked briefly wondering why arthur had hardly spoken during the whole exchange though he figured molly talked more than enough for the both of them molly nodded standing arthur dontforget you said you d do the dishes and dontwait up for me she kissed him quickly and said her good byes before she left to relieve mad eye arthur you ve been awful quiet is something wrong remus asked once molly had left yeah i fine just stressed is all and wishing molly was staying home tonight oh any particular reason not really i just worry about how well she holding up through all of this i know she puts on a brave front for the children and to some extent me as well but she doesntneed to she may not need to but she a gryffindor just like you me and sirius arthur nodded and sighed i know doesntstop me from worrying about how well she holding up though especially since i ve seen her fall apart in the past she lost weight over this entire mess and i know it cantpossibly be healthy she ll be all right arthur she got you and the rest of us remus said patting arthur on the shoulder shouldntyou be getting back it wouldntbe to your advantage if you left the dishes undone would it arthur chuckled and shook his head no it wontbe i d better get going if i want to have a peaceful evening that woman wontlet me have it first thing in morning she ll wake me up the minute she gets home and let me have it then he stood excusing himself from the other two and heading home via the floo when he arrived he put the charm on the dishes and headed into the living room to catch up on some reading arthur dear wake up molly shook her husband gently shaking her head at the fact he hadntgone up to bed the night before and had fallen asleep in his chair hmm molly yes its molly wake up arthur she repeated marking his page in the book he had been reading and placing it on the side table what are you doing home i thought you were on duty arthur still hadntopened his eyes and molly held back a giggle he really was adorable i was you fell asleep waiting for me wake up and come up to bed with me i called in for you she replied leaning over and kissing his forehead you didnthave to do that molly girl i planned on working today he opened his eyes and pulled her closer kissing her briefly i know i didnthave to

eat breakfast and then we ll go up to bed and if you d like me to i ll give you a back rub arthur smiled kissing her forehead before he moved to stand up sounds good to me dear all clear last night yes last night was quite uneventful that good then molly i concerned about you you know arthur said almost surprising himself with his words why i fine dear i promise i know you re okay and i know you can hold your own in most cases i just worried about how you re holding up is all you probably didntrealize but i woke up two nights ago and heard you crying love molly bowed her head she had hoped her husband hadntcaught on to her nightmares things were bad enough without the miscarriage coming back to haunt her and the dreams of her finding her family dead certainly didnthelp either do you know why i have an inkling yes i know you ll never stop loving and missing the babies we lost all those years ago and i know you re having a hard time with the war again but you re not in this alone next time you have a nightmare or the miscarriage comes back wake me up how d you know that why i know my wife mollywobbles and i here for you all right you donthave to face your fears and your nightmares alone its my job to comfort you he gave her a firm hug burying his face in her hair that it is arthur thank you i do appreciate knowing that you know what been bothering me and that you re there for me when i need you of course i am now how about some breakfast and then we can catch up on some sleep together hmm molly smiled widely hugging him tightly sounds good to me just let me change into my pajamas all right arthur nodded kissing her head before releasing her and allowing her to go upstairs and change when she returned in her snowflake patterned fleece pajamas he gave her another hug and kiss comfortable yes any requests no i ll let you whip up whatever your little heart desires you know i eat anything that you do dear she said yawning as she made her way into the kitchen thank you i see you remembered to do the dishes as i asked of course i did molly you know i go to great lengths to avoid your wrath whenever possible she chuckled as she got out her frying pan and began preparing breakfast yes you do arthur another reason why i think you re positively adorable a n i just have to say one thing to all of my lovely readers i appreciate how popular this story has become even though it has been a work in progress for almost two years now thank you to all of you that have read this from the beginning and continue to stick with it as i am enjoying writing this beauty and some of you may or may not have noticed that my writing has improved over these last fifty or so chapters and over the course of writing the other stories that tie in with this story thank you again for being such loyal readers and i certainly do enjoy hearing your thoughts and reading your comments molly smiled at the owl arthur had written her which had arrived only moments before severus had requesting harry presence after nearly two weeks in the hospital he was finally able to come home just in time to see harry and the others off to hogwarts the next day she looked up when she heard a knock on the door and hurried to open it as she knew it was most likely arthur as he had insisted on escorting himself home in his owl after she greeted him with a quick kiss she led him in to see the children before they headed into the kitchen to share the news with harry severus and sirius cured arthur announced brightly to the kitchen at large completely cured molly and he froze along with the children on the threshold gazing at the scene in front of them which was also suspended in mid action both sirius and snape looking toward the door with their wands pointing into each other faces and harry immobile between them a hand stretched out to each of them trying to force them apart merlin beard arthur said the smile sliding of his face what going on here both sirius and snape lowered their wands and harry looked from one to the other each wore an expression of utmost contempt yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses snape pocketed his wand turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen passing the weasleys without comment when he reached the door he looked back six o clock monday evening potter he left and sirius glared after him his wand at his side but what been going on arthur asked again nothing arthur said sirius who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance just a friendly little chat between two old school friends with what looked like an enormous effort he smiled so you re cured that great news really great yes isntit molly asked leading her husband forward into a chair healer smethwyck worked his magic in the end found an antidote to whatever that snake got in its fangs and arthur learned his lesson about dabbling in muggle medicine haventyou dear she added rather menacingly yes molly dear arthur replied meekly later on that night molly was listening to the wireless in her and arthur room while arthur chatted with remus and sirius she held her breath as a slightly familiar tune drifted into the room one that had been playing quite frequently over the past couple of weeks as the first verse ended she felt the tears stinging the backs of her eyes even though she tried not to cry sunny days seem to hurt the most i wear the pain like a heavy coat i feel you everywhere i go i see your smile i see your face i hear you laughin in the rain i still cantbelieve you re gone it aintfair you died too young like the story that had just begun but death tore the pages all away god knows how i miss you all the hell that i ve been through just knowin no one could take your place an sometimes i wonder who d you be today she looked up as she heard the door to the room open revealing her husband as the next verse of the song started mollywobbles what wrong arthur asked wondering why his wife was crying he closed the door behind him shrugging out of his mackintosh as he listened to the rest of the song that was playing would you see the world would you chase your dreams settle down with a family i wonder what would you name your babies some days the sky so blue i feel like i can talk to you an i know it might sound crazy it aintfair you died too young like the story that had just begun but death tore the pages all away god knows how i miss you all the hell that i ve been through just knowin no one could take your place an sometimes i wonder who you d be today today today today today today today sunny days seem to hurt the most i wear the pain like a heavy coat the only thing that gives me hope is i know i ll see you again some day some day some day some day when the song ended molly brushed the tears off of her cheeks as she sobbed and looked up at her husband briefly before turning away and snapping off the wireless though she left his question unanswered mollywobbles look at me i home now and i all right talk to me sweetheart he tried again as he was worried about her he knew there was a reason behind her tears and he was bound and determined to find it when she still didntlook at him he crossed the room and joined her on the bed wrapping her in his arms and beginning to rub her back soothingly molly come on tell me what wrong she leaned into her husband hiccoughing slightly as she started to speak a arthur i i its just that they n n never really h had a c chance to have w what we h have who mollywobbles arthur asked gently having absolutely no clue as to whom she was talking about f f fabian a and g g gideon she said before dissolving into more sobs and pressing herself closer to her husband oh i should have known arthur thought dropping a kiss to the top of her head as he held tighter what got you thinking about them dearest he hoped his question didntsound rude under the circumstances but this was going to be the first night they would spend together since his attack and comforting his sobbing wife was not the way he wanted to spend it that song that was playing when you came in she stated simply taking some deep breaths to calm herself down it been playing quite frequently recently and every time it does i think of them and turn into a blubbering idiot you are not a blubbering idiot he insisted kissing her head again you re just emotional when it comes to them as you have every right to be there a few songs out there that get me teary eyed as well love he hoped he was being helpful and not condescending to her as it there was quite a fine line between insulting her and helping her molly smiled slightly at her husband words and she slipped her arms around him as well laying back in the bed and settling against the pillows really arthur allowed her to tug him down to the bed with her and he turned towards her once she was settled yes really he swiped his thumb across her cheek removing the tears that were located there as he captured her lips in a soft kiss merlin molly it so good to be back here with you i ve missed holding you at night she returned his kiss and stroked his cheek as well before she answered and i ve missed you too you know remus had to slip me sleeping draughts so i would sleep without you here he offered her a lopsided grin as remus had informed him earlier that during the first few days of his hospitalization molly had steadfastly refused to go to sleep without him with her you do need your sleep mol i glad he took care of you while i wasntable to instead of replying molly sighed contentedly pushing herself further into her husband embrace craving the warmth of his body she tucked her head under his chin only to pull away slightly when he broke the silence with another question mollywobbles what would you have done if i had died that night molly was surprised by his question and after thinking over it momentarily she responded quietly feeling a little embarrassed as to what her plans would have been if she had become a widow i would have started taking steps to return to the job at st mungo that i had before we got pregnant with bill and after moving into a flat give bill the house why would you move out of the burrow dearest he asked his thumb resuming its movement of stroking her cheek there no way i could stay in the burrow if you died arthur it full of too many memories and i d hardly sleep at all i d have to get out of there for the sake of my sanity aw mols really molly nodded reaching up to grasp the hand that was resting against her cheek really arthur i d get a job at st mungo working as an underling to a healer or something while i worked on brushing up my skills for that job i d probably work twelve hour shifts just to stay busy you cantbe much of a housewife when you re widow after all well mollywobbles i dontthink arthur started but he shut his mouth when his wife opened hers again and i d be upset that we didnteven make it to thirty years of marriage before you croaked honestly she paused for a moment before voicing her own question am i really that bad that you d want to check out before being married to me for thirty years arthur was taken aback by her question given that he hadntchosen to be bitten by a snake and hospitalized for two weeks but he knew an immediate response was necessary to calm his wife concerns no of course not mollywobbles i want to make it past thirty years with you sixty even when arthur paused molly realized what her first question implied and she elaborated though she accepted her husband answer i mean i know i can get bossy and demanding arthur and that i a temperamental nag but really you ve survived this long and besides you re too laid back for your own good yes molly i agree with you but really i wouldntchange anything about you if i had the chance i want every bit of your bossiness and your motherly nature that what it really is mollywobbles you know and i do love you for it arthur supplemented his statement with a firm kiss hoping it conveyed the honesty behind his words she sighed as they broke apart tracing a finger down his chest i sorry i went off on you like that i just so scared of losing you she said knowing she had caught her husband off guard with her little outburst i know that molly i promise you i ll do everything within my power to make sure i here for you throughout this war and i wontdo back to back guard duty anymore so i wontbe falling asleep while on duty like i was that night molly nodded loving him all the more for his sincerity with her thank you arthur i canttell you how scared i was when i got the owl from professor dumbledore i can only imagine how scared you were love if you need to you can tell me everything you remember about that night he squeezed the hand that was holding his gently hoping she would tell him so he could fully understand the way she had felt she adjusted so she could bury her face against his chest before she spoke clutching his pajama top in her fists merlin arthur when i saw your clock hand move to mortal peril i thought it was the end i thought i was going to lose you and all i could think of was that i should have insisted you stay home and get your rest even if you wouldnthave listened to me arthur nodded stroking her hair as she spoke and he kissed her forehead i probably wouldnthave mol go on i got dumbledore owl after your hand had moved to rest on hospital and i had to use every ounce of my willpower to stay at the burrow until st mungo contacted me but when they did i flooed over there as fast as i could i almost burst into tears while i was waiting to be allowed to sit with you and i remember thinking that twenty six years with you as my husband just isntenough arthur i want more tears were beginning to well up in her eyes again and she shook her head against his chest oh mollywobbles i want many more years with you as well dear i agree the past twenty six we ve had have been wonderful but not nearly enough he smiled slightly even though she couldntsee it due to the fact her head was buried against his chest when they took me back to see you i thought i was going to faint you were so pale i swear the bed sheets looked blue that how pale you were your hair seemed so out of place the only vibrant coloring in the room and when i held your hand it was so cold if i hadntheard from the healers that you were still alive i would have thought you were dead that how cold you were i so used to you feeling warm i wasntprepared for you to feel like you were an icicle the tears that were threatening in her eyes slid down her cheeks and she brushed them away i thought about prattling on after telling you that i came as soon i got the owl but i couldntthink of anything to say other than telling you how upset i was and that you arentsupposed to leave us yet that you need to be there for me and the boys and you need to be around to walk ginny down the aisle but i settled for maintaining a silent vigil and praying to whatever powers that were listening for you to make it and to wake up within the forty eight hour time period the healers gave you merlin molly i wish you didnthave to go through all of that but you know i love you and i wouldntever willingly leave you or put myself in danger i here though dearest and i want you to try and put those memories behind you i very much so alive and i promise you wontlose me because of some silly snake all right molly looked up at him tearfully and kissed his lips softly knowing he was trying to make her feel better i believe you arthur thank you you re quite welcome he cupped her face in both of his hands and kissed away her tears gently pushing her onto her back with him above her arthur what in merlin name are you doing she asked when he began to kiss her lips and began to touch her softly which left her yearning for something more sweetheart we ve just spent two weeks apart and i d very much so like to make love to you if you ll let me are you sure you re up to it she asked despite the fact her body was reacting to him and she had slipped her arms over his shoulders arthur merely nodded and lowered his head to her neck trailing kisses down to her collarbone while he reached to unbutton her pajamas a n the song doesntbelong to me and its kenny chesney who you d be today dear mum and dad is it all right if me and fleur come to the burrow for a few days i going to be quite busy over the next few weeks and i d feel better if she were there spending time with you mum we ve got an announcement to make to the family as well i know you haventofficially met her yet but please love bill molly smiled as she finished reading her eldest son letter pleased that he had finally found a young woman to perhaps settle down with bill had given them some details on his latest girl here and there but she and arthur hadntseen hide or hair of her yet according to bill she had been a triwizard champion and was now working for gringotts and bill had been tutoring her in english for the past year or so molly couldnthelp but smile at the prospect of having grandchildren soon though some small part of her was telling her that bill might decide to wait until after the war was over to start a family after scribbling a reply on a scrap piece of parchment telling him that it was perfectly fine to visit fred and george appeared in the kitchen near the door she sent errol on his way with her reply to bill and turned toward her twins hello mum fred greeted offering his mother a prize winning smile while george did the same hello boys what brings you home molly asked tucking bill owl into her apron pocket so arthur could read it later as well she had long forgiven them for dropping out of school early to open their joke shop as they had proved to be wonderful businessmen and they couldnthave made her prouder if they tried besides they had buttered her up ever since they opened the shop and she didnthave the heart to remain angry with them well we were wondering if we could use our old room for storage george stated before fred jumped in with temporarily of course what for molly asked placing her hands on her hips and narrowing her gaze slightly dontyou have enough storage area at the shop no mum we re running short with all of the supplies we ve been buying and all the products we have to keep on the shelves fred replied averting his own gaze away from molly molly thought over her sons request for a moment before giving them her approval after all she and arthur didntneed the extra space for anything and besides it would give fred and george an excuse to come home more frequently if they had essential items stored at the burrow i suppose but only temporarily and i wonthave boxes just thrown about in there you ll stack them properly so we can still use your beds as harry arriving this saturday and hermione is also coming sometime this week i just received an owl from bill telling me that he coming home for a few days with his latest girlfriend in tow yes mum fred answered disregarding his mother comments about houseguests mum i thought hermione was already here george added slightly confused she had to stay with her parents an extra week something to do with her extended family i think oh okay that all we wanted mum but we ll be around for dinner one of these days we promise all right i ll hold you to that boys she swiftly hugged the both of them and kissed their cheeks yes mum fred and george returned their mother hug and each of them kissed her cheek before they left after they had molly resolved to start dinner as if arthur was able to get out on time he d be home soon he had warned her after taking the promotion that he d be home less as with the promotion came more responsibility than his position in the misuse of muggle artifacts office due to the war it wasntsomething she was particularly looking forward to given that they had spent too much time apart the first time around though she knew that she and arthur would prevail no matter what the ministry threw at them this fact however didntstop her from worrying as she did know that long hours apart compounded with the stress and worry of the war would not make for a good combination this time around mostly due to the fact she no longer had children to take care of during the long days he spent at the office mum dad fleur and i are engaged bill announced after the family had sat down to dinner on thursday night arthur had clocked out early to be sure he was home on time as molly had insisted that he be there when their son made his announcement molly had been slightly suspicious of an engagement as the only other thing she could think that her son and his girlfriend would have to announce was a pregnancy and she was quite certain that her son wasntthe type to knock a girl up out of wedlock that wonderful bill molly said beaming at him while she reached for her husband hand lacing their fingers together under the table she gave arthur hand a gentle squeeze to prompt him to offer their son his congratulations as well hoping that this event would jumpstart her other sons into perhaps finding someone to settle down with after all hadntarthur always said that there nothing like a woman love to keep you grounded arthur squeezed his wife hand in return before he congratulated the couple as well congratulations bill fleur he said nodding in their direction and lifting his glass to them do you have a date set yet we re looking at next summer if you and mum can manage it bill replied tracing circles on his fianc hand under the table of course we can bill did you want to have the ceremony here molly received her answer from fleur who just nodded obviously a little intimidated of meeting her future husband parents the same day as their engagement announcement throughout the rest of the meal molly chatted up fleur about the wedding while arthur talked to bill the more molly talked to the young french woman though the more molly realized how much she wasntquite sure whether or not bill had made the right choice she d have to talk to arthur about it later if he was up to a conversation between the two of them arthur dear molly asked when she came back downstairs after making sure everyone was comfortable with the sleeping arrangements he was dozing in his armchair and she slipped across the sitting room to settle in his lap arthur awoke as soon as he felt the warm weight of his wife come to rest across his thighs he wrapped his arms around her and pressed a kiss to her forehead basking in the silence that surrounded them now that everyone else was in bed what is it what do you think of bill fianc e he was a bit surprised by his wife question but then again this was their first experience with marrying off one of their children he stroked her side while he thought wondering if she was looking for a specific answer fleur i think she a nice young woman and that bill made a good choice molly snorted at her husband response and folded her arms across her chest you really think so i think he could have done better i was hoping he d settle down with a nice english girl not a french veela molly arthur began in a slight warning tone to keep her from saying something she might regret later she only half veela and bill got a good head on his shoulders i highly doubt he marrying her because he under veela charms that very well may be true love however from what i gather she cantcook a lick and i willing to wager that before this union takes place bill is going to be begging me to teach her how to cook properly she paused for a moment pursing her lips i wontdo it arthur i refuse to teach that girl anything bill should have thought about her cooking skills before he asked her to marry him arthur shook his head as molly was getting too far ahead of herself he could already see several problems arising between his wife and their future daughter in law but he was smart enough to keep his mouth shut and not comment that will be your decision if he asks you dear but i wouldntgo assuming things molly allowed her husband words to sink in for a moment before she answered while she looped her arms around his neck i suppose you re right there no law that says i have to like her is there he offered her a slight smile and placed a soft peck on her cheek no i dontthink there is but you should at least try to get along with her for bill sake that and you shouldntjeopardize his happiness just because you dontlike his bride remember your parents didntlike your groom but that didntstop us from getting married she sighed and allowed her head to drop to his shoulder recognizing defeat yes that true and we turned out all right in the end didntwe she asked moving to kiss him lightly i promise i ll try not to be too grumpy about her but i cantoffer any guarantees i dontexpect you to dear arthur replied simply adjusting slightly before he replied to first comment i have to say that we did turn out all right my love we re still together arentwe he asked grateful to steer the conversation away from fleur and towards their relationship yes we are twenty seven years can you believe we ve been man and wife that long no i cantsay i can however i wouldntchange a minute of it molly nodded in agreement closing her eyes while she snuggled closer to his warmth she enjoyed the quiet time with him in the evening and as much as she knew they should probably head up to their own bed she was more than content to just rest in the comfort of arthur arms a few weeks later after arthur had returned to work molly was in the kitchen preparing dinner for that evening she heard the back door open and wheeled around to see who it was mumma it was percy who was red faced from the chilly november weather what is it perce mumma can i have a pet molly smiled at him however she didntknow if they could afford for percy to have a pet as they had had to buy a lot of new things for ginny what kind of pet love a rat i found one out by dad shed and he looks friendly molly thought it over for a moment a rat would be fairly easy for percy to take care of and he hardly ever asked for anything well bring him here so i can take a look at him perce okay mumma he dashed back outside and seconds later he re entered carrying a rat that looked rather shabby as though he had been on the run for quite some time molly carefully took the rat from him and placed him on the table she then set about thoroughly inspecting it making sure it didntcarry any sort of disease that could be spread to the other children when she was finished she looked up at percy smiling face and handed the rat back to him you can keep him perce what are you going to call him scabbers can i take him to my room and play with him yes and i ll have your father see if he can find a cage for him okay okay mum percy gave her a hug before running upstairs to play with his new pet that night when arthur arrived home from work she told him about the newest addition to the family molly do you think it was a good idea to give percy a pet five is a little young to have the responsibility of taking care of one arthur i told you percy found the rat besides percy is so careful and i sure he can handle it i not saying he can t it just just what i guess i wish you would have consulted me before telling percy he could keep it why we dontknow where that rat been if it has diseases or not merlin molly i could go on forever arthur do you honestly think i would allow our son to have a stray rat without looking at it first i checked scabbers over he perfectly healthy although he looks as if he been to hell and back but if you really want to go upstairs and tell percy he cantkeep it and break his poor little heart by all means go ahead i not going to stop you besides i recall a few short weeks ago you didntbother consulting me before bringing six pumpkins into this house for a halloween celebration okay molly i get it percy can keep scabbers have you got him a cage yet no i told percy i d have you see if you can find one well i dontknow about the finding part but i can definitely get him one just then percy came back downstairs carrying scabbers and seeing that his dad was home he walked over to arthur and held out the rat want to hold him daddy not right now son but if you come with me out to the shed i think we can get a cage for the little guy molly watched as arthur led the small boy out to the shed in search of a cage just when she turned to start dinner ginny woke up from her nap demanding to be fed and changed over dinner percy couldntquit talking about scabbers the other boys who had not yet heard the about percy pet immediately began protesting the fact that percy was five and if anyone got a pet at all it should be bill or charlie since they were older before the argument got too out of hand molly broke in and explained that percy had found scabbers and had asked her about keeping him first he would be keeping the rat but mum percy five i should be able to have a pet if he can bill had argued angrily bill if you had found him and brought him to me i would have let you keep him too now you five she pointed to bill charlie fred george and ron for good measure will leave percy rat alone understood with a series of garbled yes mums and a nod from ron the boys returned to their supper later that night after the children had gone to bed and ginny had been fed one last time molly and arthur discussed the day events interesting day eh love arthur asked as he climbed into bed next to her and wrapped an arm around her waist yes very interesting didntthink we would have an argument over a rat today that for sure arthur chuckled at this and kissed her on the cheek well it is to be expected though isntit out of six boys one of them was bound to find some sort of animal and want to keep it yeah they really are such dears though i cantbelieve we re going to be sending bill to hogwarts next fall i canteither it seems like just yesterday i was holding him in my arms for the first time and looking into his bright blue eyes arthur i believe that what i supposed to say but yes they do grow up way too fast before we know it ginny going to be going i know molly i bet she turns out to be a full fledged daddy girl though you know what arthur i think you re probably right you two have a special bond i can tell already really well she is my little princess and even though she cantwalk or talk yet she already got me wrapped around her finger molly snuggled closer to her husband as he finished his statement happy that arthur viewed his little girl that way she had been a little worried that ginny would be more of a tomboy than a girly girl with so many brothers but if arthur treated her like a princess maybe she would be more feminine after all
