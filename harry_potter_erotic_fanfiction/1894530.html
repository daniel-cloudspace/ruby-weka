 chapter eleven the last days of peace the remaining days of the week passed off happily and more importantly without event and soon the weekend descended upon the students of hogwarts by the time it had though the sixth years were subjected to quite rigorous counselling sessions and had already signed up for the required subjects harry had taken transfiguration defense against the dark arts charms potions eww ron said when he heard that at least i am free from snape tyranny this time around the subjects he would require for his auror training besides he had also enlisted for herbology on hermione advice since it would help him in his potions work and care of magical creatures mostly to express his support for hagrid ron on the other hand had taken up charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration and care of magical creatures he d said that he wouldntmind being a dragon trainer like charlie even though being a quidditch player was still on top of the list of his priorities hermione however to no one surprise was taking the maximum number of classes she had taken potions transfiguration charms defense against the dark arts arithmancy ancient runes herbology and care of magical creatures she told harry that all these eight classes were vital for her to become a healer when he heard about the number of classes hermione was going to take harry cautioned her be careful he told her we dontneed another fiasco like third year and dontforget about yourself or about me he added the last part to the sentence with a grin and a slight blush on the cheek hermione looked at harry and found herself nearly swooning at the way he was looking at her she felt as if she would melt into a puddle right then and there she went closer to harry and kissed him on the lips it was a chaste kiss but the sensations that it created were all the more breath taking for the both of them hermione pulled away making harry feel extremely unsatisfied and said i could never forget you harry even of i forgot myself that was almost too much for harry he quickly pulled her closer to himself and kissed her fully on the lips hungrily it felt so wonderful to harry as he revelled in the rich creamy taste of her lips just like strawberries and cream he thought just before hermione now overcoming her surprise at harry sudden kiss started kissing him back all rational thoughts fled from his mind as his blood drained towards south and harry revelled only in the sensations of pleasure that were being created harry ran his tongue along hermione bottom lip seeking entry she granted him that and their tongues clashed with each other as harry desperately sought to examine her tonsils his hands were now entwined in hermione bushy hair while hermione hands were now roaming freely up and down his back soon though it seemed to them only a few seconds had passed and they had to pull up for air but no sooner that both took the much needed breath than their lips met again almost violently and they sought to explore each other in every possible way without actually having to shed any of their garments aside off their own forms it had been very similar all throughout that week they were still the best of friends classmates who sat on the same desk and study partners but besides that they felt this strange physical attraction towards each other that they hadntexperienced before a transference of plain love from the level of friendship to that of liking and loving as more than a friend everyday they stayed together in the common room sometimes working sometimes chatting and lazing about they were most certainly always the last persons who stayed up in the common room up to late at night and that culminated more than once in snog sessions that they enjoyed on second thoughts who wouldn t ever since harry had spilled the contents of his heart to his best friends he had found great solace and some much needed comfort his friendship with ron had since grown deeper and much more meaningful as they realised they were privy to one of the most well kept and one of the most important secrets to concern the wizarding world during their time ron it seemed had finally realised that it was not he himself but harry who had got the wrong end of the stick throughout his entire life and that the fame and fortune he attracted was an obligation a burden rather than being a great asset to have ron was indeed relieved that harry had taken the news of him being appointed quidditch captain well and not at all like what he had expected of course he had expected harry to brood and be miserable about not being appointed himself since that is what he believed he would himself have done in the first place when he brought this up before harry later he just shrugged it off saying it alright mate for one i dontthink i have enough experience in strategising for quidditch all i can really do is just fly and catch the snitch for second and more importantly you have the most extensive knowledge of quidditch among every current student at hogwarts and are without doubt the best man for the job although ron did not say anything he felt gratified nonetheless they had both sat together a few times over the week with ginny whenever her schedule coincided and spoke extensively about the various moves and formations that could be tried out in the coming year they also went to lengths planning new strategies for their forthcoming games or as harry pointed out to hermione later he and ginny were just providing inputs from their perspectives while ron was the one doing the actual strategizing tryouts were another big issue since none of the four remaining places in the team two chasers and two beaters ron still did not consider their beaters from last year andrew kirke and jack sloper to be good enough to merit a direct selection especially taking their previous performances on matchdays into account harry and ginny wanted to give them another chance but ron was adamant it was finally decided that the tryouts be held on sunday afternoon ron had booked the quidditch pitch to that effect as well so all in all it was quite a relaxing first week at hogwarts at least the later part for the trio but he knew that all would change when classes began especially with such tough taskmasters as mcgonagall and snape it was saturday night everyone was back in their respective common rooms spending their time as they preferred to only two students were out and about at least the ones that belonged to gryffindor one was hermione granger who had taken up a place in the library for the moment and the other was harry potter who was going to the library itself to meet up with his girlfriend and convince her to relax and call it a night harry was coming from the direction of the entrance hall he would have normally walked the straight path to the library but the marauder showed the tiny dot named argus filch prowling the corridors in the same section of the castle not wanting to be caught roaming outside after curfew hours harry had taken the longer way around using his invisibility cloak and the marauder map as insurance against any possible encounter just as he entered the entrance hall his attention was caught by a partially open door directly across the hall from him harry vaguely remembered going to the classroom sometime the previous year it was just that he did not remember when and what for it seemed to him now as if an eternity spanned the gulf between that time and now the partially open door was casting a faint soft light right outside on the floor it could hardly be discerned in the light of the torches burning throughout the hall but years of quidditch had honed harry myopic eyes to sight quicker things unseen to the normal eye he went closer to the door and having at last decided in his mind his own course of action he shrug off his invisibility cloak and yanking the door fully open entered the classroom as he entered he remembered where he was and why he had been here the previous year not once but many times over this was classroom eleven and he had attended divination lessons in this classroom for the better part of last year sure enough a figure appeared to his right and spoke to him thus confirming his thoughts as to where he currently was harry had found himself in a scene imitating a forest clearing a centaur firenze who was also a divination teacher for those who took up the subject stood to harry right and spoke to him even as harry gazed at him harry potter firenze said it seems that the stars dictate that you must come here at this appointed hour harry noticed that the ceiling reflected the night sky outside as like the great hall stars were shining throughout for the moon still seemed young and had not waxed to its proper brightness so as to overshadow them harry nodded at firenze and said hello firenze firenze held out his hand to harry and they shook hands indeed firenze said i see the stars reflect the uncertainty of your mind there is much amiss in these lands much that needs to be banished and much that needs to be created the centaurs concern themselves only with the future in the process we ignore the present and the comings and goings in the world around us but already it seems to me that our quiet time in the forests is ending our time as a noble race who are neutral and take no sides in the affairs of wizards is ending it appears to me that the time has come when we must either fight in battle or perish or wait patiently for the darkness to overcome us even as we die either way there is no hope left for us but what it light prevails over the dark harry found himself asking do you still harbour such a hope to that do you think it is still possible firenze asked fixing harry in a piercing gaze the centaurs have been wrong before harry potter as i have undoubtedly told you before now there are many forces in the universe which can alter or change the course of centuries and we centaurs know nothing of them but already our ability to read the stars is fading the dark clouds our vision much in the same way as it happened to our master aeons ago masters harry said aloud voicing his thoughts it was indeed news to him since the centaurs always proclaimed themselves as free creatures who roamed the forests willingly indeed we are free firenze said but i meant masters not in the sense of ownership but more so in the sense of learning they taught us they helped us learn and now they have passed away he hung his head as if in sorrow as he said this we do not speak their names out of reverence for they are sacred and holy having reached a pinnacle that no one who came to this planet ever has reached yet maybe if the stars allow you will know more of them firenze paused a moment and then resumed the centaurs are an ancient race harry potter even more so that humans we have the experiences of centuries and the wisdom of millennia yet it is clear now that our power wanes either way irrespective of the outcome of this war we will dwindle and then fail altogether surely but slowly yet i do not fear that fate what i fear is the position that we will hold when we fail already i know of secret whisperings of reclaiming our rightful position in the world reclaiming our freedom to wander freely over all the free lands i fear treachery and i fear for the fate of my brothers harry took all this information in and then suddenly asked firenze firenze could you teach me to see firenze considered harry strange request for a moment and then replied you cannot teach anyone to see harry potter but if you want to know i d just advise you to close your eyes and concentrate you will see what it is destined for you to see the minds of centaurs and humans work differently harry potter we are not encumbered with the prejudices of your race even if both you and i look at the same object we will see different things so i cannot teach you to see goodbye now may the stars give us the opportunity of meeting again harry accepted this opportunity of breaking this meeting he exited the room and quickly went out into the entrance hall he leant against a wall and took a few deep breaths what did firenze try to imply he couldntfigure out for the world of him maybe hermione could help that brought him back to his original motive of wandering around the place after hours he quickly ran all the way up to the library covered from head to toe in his invisibility cloak just as he ran through a corridor adjacent to his destination he didntquite see where he was going and dashed into someone harry felt himself falling to the ground now with the someone on top of him he felt his face in soft curls that smelled like heaven to him he knew that smell that aroma and he knew the person to who it belonged to harry came hermione voice take that invisibility cloak off right now i can feel you but it feels weird not to be able to see you harry complied and took the cloak off his head hermione saw harry head before her now suspended in nothingness hermione could you just get off from over me please harry asked her his head being the only part of his body that was visible you are kind of preventing me from getting this cloak off myself hermione got up and brushed herself off even though there was no real need to the house elves did their work extremely well and there never was much dirt on the floor harry got up after her and removed the invisibility cloak off himself by the way what are you doing here after curfew hermione asked none too pleased and in a matter of fact tone that told harry that a scolding was coming his way you shouldntbe here you know yes harry said but i just wanted to escort my girlfriend back to her common room a very gallant and noble thought indeed mr potter hermione replied keeping her voice even despite the fact that she was quite please although i hate to point out that if you get caught you will lose gryffindor a load of points and not to mention get a month of detentions well harry said that would apply to you too you are out of your dorm after curfew as well hermione rolled her eyes at harry and said honestly harry how many times do i have to tell you i have received special permission from both professor mcgonagall and madam pince to use the library up to midnight madam pince has taught me the incantation to lock the library so that i could do so after my work is done harry grinned at her he just wanted to head her off of course he remembered that she had received the permission considering that she was without doubt the cleverest witch to come to hogwarts and now had the distinction of garnering the most owls by anyone in hogwarts history on top of all that harry remembered all this yet he just loved to see hermione mad he felt that it made her look cuter and more adorable than ever it made him feel like he wanted to snog her senseless right then and there harry said to her gently yes hermione i know that i just think it makes you look very cute when you are angry and it makes me want to do this to you and this and this as he said this harry nipped at her earlobe kissed her cheek and then her luscious pink lips lips that didntneed artificial make up to make them look lovely he nuzzled her neck gently hoping to evoke the response he did whenever he did that to her hermione nuzzled inaudibly at his actions but soon she regained her senses and pushed him away gently no harry she said reluctantly and not without a mischievous glint in her cinnamon eyes there will be a lot of time and a safer place for that later but it isntnow okay harry said with a bow you would better hold on to that promise milady for now i will be satisfied if you decided to take a walk with me around the lake what hermione asked disbelievingly but what if we get caught harry what then i dontthink the permission extends to that dontworry harry said with a self satisfied smirk on his lips we ll be invisible to them please hermione please he clasped his hands in front of his chest like a little child and pouted hermione looked at him for a moment and then let out a short lovely laugh to harry it was like the music of a flowing river cascading softly down a beautiful waterfall she told him all right but i will make you pay with hell harry if it gets us into any trouble harry grinned at her his emerald green eyes flickering with the joy of acceptance however small and insignificant that acceptance was harry quickly covered the both of them with the invisibility cloak and then taking care to see that it did so properly they made their way cautiously to the entrance hall as they passed through harry paused for a while and stared towards the direction of classroom eleven the door was now firmly shut and no light was filtering outside hermione felt him stopping and whispered what it harry nothing replied harry tell you later they carefully opened the castle doors enough only to let only the both of them to pass through they squeezed through and made their way carefully across to the lake still not revealing themselves lest someone might be watching from up in the castle finally once they were safely across to the far shore of the lake they took off the invisibility cloak and stuffed it into hermione bag harry carried it for her out of courtesy for the lady but he wasnttoo sure now if he had done the right thing seeing that the bag seemed to weigh at least twenty kilos they began walking around the lake it was quite a cold night much too cold for september anyways it felt more like november or late october above their heads the stars were shining down upon them casting a calm white light that didntquite reach the earth the sickle moon was dangling in this sky already leaning more towards the west suddenly a single streak ran through the sky its reflection palpable in the calm dark waters of the lake it was a shooting star harry look hermione squealed happily make a wish quickly now hermione i dontthink i believe in all this stuff harry protested neither do i but it doesntmake a difference now does it hermione replied the worse that can happen is nothing with that she closed her eyes and made her wish harry however didntmove his face assuming the stubbornness that could have made the rock of gibraltar feel proud he remembered the last time he wished for anything he remembered its aftermath he needed to remember no more hermione opened her eyes and looked at harry standing beside her and looking across the water a strange gleam palpable in his eyes she shivered a little partly because of the cold and partly because it was the first time she had seen this other side to harry something that she couldntdecipher in a state where she could not tell what he was thinking harry noticed this he had his cloak on but hermione didn t she still wore only a baggy green jumper and white trousers harry took off his cloak and offered it to her take this he said to her it will help in keeping you warmer no harry hermione protested it nothing just a bit chilly that all i ll be fine harry shook his head at her and slipped the cloak over her shoulders i couldntafford to see my only girl falling sick now could i hermione so you d better wear this hermione accepted and then asked arentyou cold already it too chilly for september harry laced her fingers through hers and replied if it grows too cold which i doubt it will i could always use a heating charm on myself couldnti after all i am a wizard you know hermione rolled her eyes at this quip anyways harry continued on a more serious note this time i like the cold better than heat or rain any day it makes me feel alive i feel as if the cold searches my very soul and gropes my heart trying to pierce me and in the process it tears away from me all my memories even my identity i begin to feel as if i am a newly born child again taking my first breath hermione held her breath she didntrealise that harry had so much conviction in his voice even as he said it she felt the images that he described appearing before her eyes and threatening to lull her into a trance and she haventeven looked into his eyes and she understood what he said why he said it she got up on tiptoe and softly kissed him so she said linking her arms with his what did you want to tell me about harry then told her everything of what firenze had said to him what do you reckon he meant harry asked her i cantfigure anything out i dontknow harry she replied thoughtfully i really dontknow i think both of us will need to give some more thought to all this to get through to his deeper meaning if there is any harry nodded at her now and said okay now that we have got lesser matters out of the way how about that little walk you promised me with with that both of them shared a very romantic midnight walk around the lake which was glimmering softly in the starlight as if a velvet sheen had been placed all over it it was a wonderful feeling indeed it seemed to the couple as they made their way back to the castle an hour later under the cover of harry invisibility cloak meanwhile unseen to either of them a voice spoke softly out of the shadows as he looked down upon their happy forms and so the healing begins do you think we should reprimand them albus they are breaking a few school rules here no minerva dumbledore replied his blue eyes lacking their twinkle and filled with sadness i think we should give them that allowance tonight the next day quidditch tryouts were held for the vacant positions on the gryffindor team harry ron and ginny had sat down together with seventh year katie bell their ex chaser who had decided to quit the house team to have more time to prepare for the newts she wanted to be a healer and needed the highest grades for the same she hadntbudged from the stand even though ron harry and ginny had tried to convince her otherwise even since she had announced her decision the four of them had drawn up some detailed series of tests that would sorely put to the test the aspirants strength stamina grit determination agility and other essential qualities once on the field the first job on hand was to group the interested parties into the positions they vied for since almost half of the team was undecided about thirty students appeared for the tryouts all ranging from second years to seventh years the tryouts began with a race that consisted of making five laps of the quidditch pitch clockwise and then pulling up to do an equal distance in the opposite direction harry ron and ginny stationed themselves at appropriate points to ensure that no one could cheat though the truth was they expected no one but the slytherins to cheat in such a situation it was more like they were trying to watch out for any accidents that might occur even in the preliminary test half of the candidates were eliminated the rest of the hopefuls who qualified for the next round were first called down to the ground for ron to explain to them all the basic rules of quidditch clearly such knowledge was indeed necessary to make them understand what they were supposed to do when they took to the air considering especially that many among them had muggle upbringing eventually the afternoon wore on as the hopefuls went through a series of rigorous tests ranging from dodging bludgers to executing certain basic moves that were asked of them they flew with the entire team as well to see how they would get into the formation at last the tryouts were over and the hopefuls were told to await the results which would be put up formally on the house notice board the same night as they met up in the changing rooms ron harry ginny sloper and kirke talked their way through the list of players who had appeared they had officially retained the latter two as beaters seeing that they had shown remarkable improvement over the off season they two chaser positions though were still up for grabs they finally decided on a fourth year selena howard as the second chaser the choice of the last chaser though was quite contentious with ron wanting seventh year homer butt to get the position while harry rooted for euan abercombie from second year finally ron gave in when harry pointed out that it was their duty to leave behind a strong quidditch team having some experience so as to continue their legacy of winning quidditch cups and that a young player like euan would be an asset for them in the years to come and besides harry added even if he makes a mistake i sure he ll learn quickly ron accepted this point of view and they quickly drew out the team sheet and then headed off to the common room for the night the next day dawned bright and clear a perfect day you might say for the students to just amble about but ambling about was clearly the last thing on their minds the sixth years especially started their regular classes from that day as harry hermione and ron went down to the great hall for breakfast professor mcgonagall was handing out their schedules harry saw that he had defense against the dark arts first up that day followed by care of magical creatures the afternoon session consisted of double potions with the slytherins i have one more class today hermione said as she looked into harry timetable just arithmancy before the lunch break guess i am full today but she really did look happy today harry guessed it was from the fact that they were going to start their classes today i only have two classes ron said cheerfully his mouth overstuffed with food first two of the day defense against the dark arts and then care of magical creatures so it was about fifteen minutes later that the gryffindors found themselves gathered outside the door to the defense against the dark arts classroom soon though the door to the classroom opened and they entered inside however as soon as they entered they regretted for spells started raining down upon them four of them collapsed on the ground hit by various spells a year worth of da training had helped them practise spells and put them to work in a controlled environment but they had rarely practised duelling before this only four stood harry ron hermione and neville harry was crouching on the ground hermione beneath him he had initially deflected the light directed at him with a protego shield and then taking hold of hermione had gotten her to the ground covering her with his own body neville was also on the floor beside ron who while going down had somehow caught neville and had dragged him to the floor as well all four of them now had their wands pointed in the directed from where the spells had been directed harry though had a very good idea as to who was behind all this sure enough professor elijah bickerstaff stood before them he ignored the ones who had passed through unscathed or at least un petrified he quietly went to those who had received his full body bind curse and brought them back to reality by muttering the counter curse the ones on the floor got up and rubbing their necks started muttering about teachers who attacked pupils for fun harry got up brushing his robes and holding out his hand for hermione to do the same out of the corner of his eye he saw ron and neville get up as well soon the class was seated at their normal places and not on the floor bickerstaff had been silent till now he opened his mouth to speak and all the murmurs in the class ceased to exist so you dontseem to have got the hang of watching out for the enemy have you i have no doubt that you can cast spells and a multitude of them at that but you still do not seem to have the ability to dodge your enemies reflexes will help he eyed harry and ron at this oh yes they will but more helpful is the knowledge of what the enemy is actually going to do rather than merely acting on instinct all of you will have to learn that and i daresay you will that why we are here now arentwe he eyed the class in a gay sort of a manner as if he did not really treat them as students but more so as his equals anyway we will be dealing with all that during the course of this year slowly maybe but definitely in a perfect manner for now can any one tell me what curse i used on all of you hermione hand shot up in the air to no one surprise bickerstaff said miss granger yes sir you used the multiplicity charm commonly known as the fountain charm and merged it with the total body bind curse indeed bickerstaff replied smiling ten points to gryffindor now can anyone tell me its use again it was hermione who replied sir the fountain charm is used to split the spell emitted by the wand into different channels each directed in a different direction it often used in a one to many duelling scenario however each individual thread is less potent than the effect of the spell when used in a single channel the potency often depends upon the magical strength and the skill of the wand who wields the wand very good miss granger bickerstaff said as hermione glowered ten more points to gryffindor i think since that was such an exact and a concise definition you would all want to write it down there was a flurry of activity as the sound of the scratching of quills filled the air and everyone scribbled out parchment full of notes during the course of the class bu the time the class ended they had been taught the basic incantation and the wand movement for the spell as they made to pack their bags bickerstaff said the multiplicity charm is the first of many advance spells you are going to be learning while it is the first it is not the hardest by a long mile and i would hence advise you to practise the spell before our next class a three foot long essay on the basics of spell combination to be submitted to me by next monday and so it began and so it continued even though it was their first week of classes the sixth years were already buried nose deep in their homework if ron thought that taking only four classes would exempt him from homework he was wrong over the week they were assigned two rolls of parchment on the theory behind the priori incantatem spell and the reasons why it was officially classified as a charm by flitwick mcgonagall was her usual self while not forgetting to add another couple of essays on top of the homework pile it was worse for harry with snape assigning homework that rivalled in quantity and difficulty the whole combination of all other subjects combined it was the worst for hermione who had arithmancy and runes on her platter as well but she was without doubt doing the best among them how could she not considering the belligerence and diligence with which she burned the midnight oil harry and ron found themselves with their hands really full with quidditch practice every alternate evening on top of all the homework hermione had indeed convinced them for the moment backing herself up with all the facts from years gone by that it would be better for their own sakes if they did their homework regularly although she was not quite sure how long this new found commitment would hold up harry was lately putting in regular hours at night sitting beside her and studying but she knew that the real motivation behind all this was the snogging that they did afterwards when everyone had retired to their dorms that thursday was very important to harry so much so that he had completed all his work beforehand and told ron that he wouldntbe turning up for quidditch practice it was 19th september and it was hermione birthday harry wanted the day to be very special for her it would not be the first time that they spent her birthday together but it certainly would be the first time that they were to spend it as a couple in the evening as the shadows lengthened and the sun cast an orange light all across the sky as it neared the end of its journey for the day harry took hermione to a secluded area near the far shore of the lake at first hermione didntknow why harry had brought her along here but as they stood next to the required spot she knew why she saw a wooded alcove there completely indiscernible from a distance of more than a couple of feet inside the entrance harry took her inside through a narrow gap in the trees and then placed a veiling charm on the place the result was that there was complete darkness hermione could feel harry touch but certainly could not see him suddenly she felt the pall of darkness lift up and an orange light filtered into the small clearing it was the light of the sun that filtered in through the trees that guarded the space hermione guessed that harry had cast the one way veiling charm whereby light and air from outside could enter the alcove and they could discern what was going on outside but at the moment what was happening outside was the last thing on her mind before her was one of the most breath taking sights she had even beheld and that was saying something since she had visited such beautiful countries as france italy austria switzerland and greece over the years with her parents that was indeed the irony of the situation after seeing many of the wondrous sights that those countries had to offer hermione was simply overcome by the simplicity of the sight before her the orange sunlight made it look as if the trees were basking in the light of a fire the stems gleamed and the leaves shone as if they were made from gold there was a typical coolness in the clearing and a mild breeze blew through it how it managed to penetrate the ring of trees hermione could never figure out but there was something extremely old world ish about this place it was as if she had stepped through the annals of time and entered a place long forgotten long untouched a place which hid many secrets and was privy to some of the most important events that might have occurred since time immortal beautiful isntit harry whispered in hermione ear with his hands around her waist pulling her body closer to his own with his chin reclining gently on her right shoulder hermione was speechless she merely nodded at him harry flicked his wand once at the empty grassy area before them and a table appeared it held a small chocolate cake with three world written simply in frosty white icing happy birthday hermione sixteen candles flickered merrily on top and soft music began to play in the background from somewhere happy birthday hermione my love harry said tears welled up in hermione eyes she had never expected such a wonderful gesture even from harry to think that he went to such great lengths for just wishing her a happy birthday overwhelmed her although the romantic part in her hoped that there was more to come harry took her hand and walked her to the table he handed her a knife and she cut the cake after they were done with it harry waved his wand again and the table cleared itself instead a dining table for two appeared laden with all kinds of delicacies every one of the platters filled with hermione favourites the light outside was already failing rapidly and as it did so hermione noticed that a few candles were now hovering in the air around the clearing keeping it properly lighted so shall we eat first harry asked hermione nodded in truth she was feeling ravenous apparently the fact that it is your birthday did not excuse you from the rigours of classes few words were spoken as they finished the wonderful dinner there were only frequent glances and smiles on their parts hermione wondered if harry done the cooking all by himself but then she reasoned that she could not really expect so much from him after all he had much the same schedule as her so how do you like this till now harry asked nervously running his hand through his hair as he did so it been wonderful harry hermione smiled at him i cantbelieve you did all this for me she reached across the table and covered harry hands with hers thank you she said tears of joy welling up in her eyes yet again really speaking hermione birthdays had always been quiet family affairs she didntreally have any friends in her pre hogwarts days with who she could share the joy of celebrating her birthdays it generally was her and her parents having a quiet celebration at hogwarts too her birthdays over the last six years were hectic to say in the least what with all the classes that had to be attended and the homework that needed to be done aside from a few birthday greetings from her close friends and their gifts the days were not exactly memorable not that she blamed anyone hermione herself was so logical and rational that it was her firm belief that a birthday was just another day in the grander scheme of things but what harry had done was different it might have been only a simple gesture but it touched hermione heart it reminded her of the birthdays that she had celebrated with her parents for her it was another testimonial as to how much harry loved her and cared for her harry though seemed happy and a tiny bit embarrassed at the same time by the praise he blushed red trying to hide his smile he said honestly hermione this is nothing anyway it was dobby who made most of the arrangements i just told him what to do but it is still the thought that counts harry hermione said and so thank you for what you have done for me with that she leaned into him and kissed him leaving harry to inhale the scent of chocolate cake that she had eaten mingled with her own taste the flavour of chocolate especially the chocolate that came from hermione lips aroused him greatly and he felt a wave of desire gush forth overcoming his entire form he kissed her in return and they engaged in one of the lengthiest snogging sessions they ever had even in the midst of all that they fell off their chairs and onto the grass with harry on top of hermione but they didntseem to notice it in the least they continued exploring each other passions lips inter locked tongues clashing bodies rubbing against each other and hands roaming all over neither harry nor hermione knew how they managed to restrain themselves any further or how they finally came to their senses two hours later it was already eleven at night by the time their bodies got exhausted even though their hearts and souls were yearning for more the clearing was now lighted by the dancing light of candles the soft light illuminated the features of hermione face harry could see her chocolate brown eyes gazing longingly at him come to think of it he wasnteven sure if her eyes were brown with each passing moment as their passion grew the lights flickered and flamed they cast a different light a different shadow on her features and her merry eyes seemed to take on a different hue a different shade of brown they got up from the grass and stood before each other harry put his hand into his pockets and fished out the treasure he had kept from hermione for the past month he knew it would eventually belong to her but he was waiting for the right moment for that to happen hermione saw harry draw a velvet covered box from his pocket he drew it up before her and opened it therein lay the gift he had bought for her from diagon alley it was a necklace a simple thin gold chain with a small diamond pendant embedded in it it was a simple necklace nothing too extravagant none too heavy something that hermione decided at once that she would like to wear for every remaining moment of her life harry put the necklace around her neck and waited expectantly for her to say something hermione took the pendant in her hand and said it beautiful harry but you really shouldnthave spent so much money it the least i could do for your birthday harry answered anything for you my love hermione got up on tiptoe and kissed harry even where they were standing they broke apart after a while to take in some much needed air they decided that they had lingered here long enough and would come here again later it was now time that they headed to the common room harry produced his invisibility cloak from underneath his robe and they proceeded on their way as they trudged along hermione reflected on the evening everything about it was so simple that she had almost feared at one point that it wasntreal even the birthday gift that harry gave her was simple expensive yes but simple nonetheless it didnthave any elaborate and large designs carved on it it was exquisitely simple somehow hermione felt that the evening marked an attempt to achieve something that had always eluded both harry and her a certain kind of simplicity in life an opportunity to be normal a chance to be away from the glaring focus of others an occasion when they could share their love with each other only each other without others hindering the same it was one of the most beautiful evenings in the life of hermione granger everything about it reflected harry love for her and she remembered it even until the end of her days author note well first of all sorry many times over for such a long delay in posting this chapter has been very very troubling to write and not in the least due to all the recurrent crashes i have been having over the past week i have had some eight ideas in mind regarding where to take this story and i had a lot of difficulty in choosing the most viable one this chapter includes several subtle hints to what is going to happen next especially with harry showing some interesting signs the next chapter has some action in it i would have given you the name but it would give away the whole content of the chapter so you will have to wait till next week to find out more about that i hope you liked this update i really worked hard on it i rewrote it about fifteen times before it ended in this form please drop in a word about how you felt the story is or anything related to this and let me know if i am getting better as a writer or not for those of you who read the survivor thank you very much i will be uploading the acknowledgement in a couple of days so long then bye chapter twelve mayhem at the ministry hermione birthday had now been a thing of a couple of days ago it was saturday and everyone was enjoying a nice late weekend breakfast in a few minutes owls started flying n through the rafters and the air was filled with the sound of flapping wings mail had arrived students who took the daily prophet opened the newspaper and gasped at the headline french minister of magic assassinated by death eaters the french minister of magic charles le tallec who arrived earlier in england last week to hold discussions with his english counterpart cornelius fudge especially regarding the internal situation in the english magical community was assassinated last night by a group of death eaters led by he who must not be named himself minister le tallec convoy was assailed at the official guest residence in london and the attack left 21 dead including the minister himself no eyewitnesses are reported to have survived and the attack was discovered by aurors who saw the dark mark hovering above the scene the area has been cordoned off and none but the authorized personnel are being allowed inside it must be noted that the french minister visit was a bid at allaying the fear that has got sparked in the worldwide magical community due to the news of the resurgence of he who must not be named and the reportedly increasing number of his followers french magical law enforcement authorities had advised the minister not to take up residence in england but that warning was unheeded and eventually culminated in the assassination in a statement issued earlier this morning minister of magic cornelius fudge who visited the scene of the attack said we condemn the assassination and the people responsible for the same and at the same time we are deeply regretful of minister le tallec untimely demise he was a fine leader and his assassination has caused a great loss for the worldwide magical community on being asked about actions the ministry plans to take against the guilty party he replied you know who is a very powerful wizard but we are sure he wontbe able to stand against the might of the ministry we have a whole team of aurors on this case and we are sure that we will catch him and bring him to justice soon now that he has resumed his anti social activities this latest lapse of intelligence and the assassination is seen as a grave threat to minister fudge standing in the ministry his image has taken a severe beating due to these events since it is reported that he had given a personal guarantee of the french minister safety even as the news of the assassination spread the warlocks have called an emergency meeting to deliberate on the fate of minister fudge it might indeed be before long that the magical community of england sees a new minister of magic in office hermione looked up from the newspaper her face pale and handed it over to harry by the time harry and ron were done reading the newspaper her face had assumed a thoughtful demeanour bloody hell ron exclaimed when he was done reading the report team of aurors to catch you know who if they can so much so as even give him a bruise somewhere i ll stop eating fudge had to say something ron hermione snapped otherwise he would have looked like a fool he looks more like a fool to me after he said this ron retorted everyone in their right mind knows that no one can kill or hurt you know who thanks for the show of confidence ron harry muttered bitterly under his breath the sound of loud discussions on the subject drifted from across the house tables ron face immediately took on an apologetic expression while hermione suddenly became all concerned the same patronising almost motherly look she wore on her countenance as she constantly looked after harry watching his back and looking out for him what the matter harry she asked nothing it nothing harry replied come off it mate ron said grinning wickedly at him you know you canthide anything from us and anyways i may not always agree with herm own ninny here but i know her well enough to see that she is usually always right about everything and everyone especially you mate harry sighed okay he said i was just wondering if voldemort had himself led the attack and killed the minister why then didnti feel it my scar didnteven hurt as it should have since he was clearly in a murderous mood i dunno mate ron said slowly evidently thinking as he spoke i think you should go to dumbledore with this harry seemed a bit sceptical about this but hermione backed ron on the matter yes harry she said let go and meet professor dumbledore anyway i think i can go on without studying this morning ron jaw fell to the ground at this proclamation and he made a face at hermione in mock surprise the trio shared a good laugh and for a moment it seemed that the tension prevalent in the wizarding world was non existent in their midst they made their way to professor dumbledore office and hermione was about to speak the password skiving snackboxes knowing the password to the headmaster office was a special privilege of the prefects when they were met by professor mcgonagall she walked briskly towards the trio and stopping in front of them said professor dumbledore predicted that you might try to meet him this morning but he is not here at the moment he told you though all three of you mind to meet him tonight at eight here itself i gather that you know the necessary password the three of them nodded and professor mcgonagall walked away leaving them a little dazed in her wake so shall we go then hermione asked harry and ron nodded they had nearly made their way to the next corridor when they collided with a host of other students coming from the opposite direction everyone fell down in a heap it transpired that the students were none other than the members of last year da harry ron hermione dean thomas exclaimed as they got up from the floor and dusted themselves we ve been looking for you since ages what is it dean ron asked impatiently in reality he had never gotten over the fact that he had once dated ginny and now tended to be a little short with his dorm mate even after they had called things off we were all wondering if we could re organise and start the da again lavender brown said a few more students are also interested in joining it this year like seamus over here justin finch fletchey spoke up they heard about it last year and are interested in joining now harry thought for a moment and then began i dontknow about this i mean last year that had umbridge wasntup to the mark but this year bickerstaff seems fine enough come on now harry ernie macmillan said this isntabout umbridge or bickerstaff the da wasnteven only about side stepping umbridge authority it was about readying ourselves to fight you know who and his death eaters you d said it yourself as it is their threat exists and so the da must too there was a general murmur of assent that ran through the group at this but harry still wasntso sure it was hermione who spoke up now harry i think ernie right there is definitely a strong point as to what he is saying i think we could make the da legal this year and even ask bickerstaff to help us out with this okay then harry said acknowledging everyone wishes i ll ask professor dumbledore for his permission but i think we should talk to bickerstaff first the group cheered at this proclamation seamus finnigan exclaimed there a good man mate ron clapped harry back happy about the latest decision on this note the group dispersed and ron harry and hermione made their way to the common room harry and ron really needed to get their homework done their mental exercise continued even after lunch eventually after three transfiguration assignments a couple of charms essays and half a dozen defense assignments he had let all these assignments pile up over the last few days of classes ron got tired and said that he could take no more not for the time being at least and he chose to go up to the dormitory to take a nap harry meanwhile had a considerably smaller backlog to start with and now only had to get the last remnant of his homework the last of snape potions essays out of the way it was about four in the afternoon when he finally finished the common room was generally empty except for hermione sitting by the fire the weather had seemingly warmed up and everyone was enjoying the weekend outdoors ha harry exclaimed happily as he put his books aside finally glad that he would be able to spend the rest of the evening as he wished away from the anxiety of completed assignments and homework deadlines however his exclamation had shaken hermione out of her reverie harry went up to her and sat on the floor his back resting in between her legs so she asked him done all the homework harry nodded tired she asked him once again you bet harry sighed i dontknow how i am going to hold up at quidditch practice tonight with all my muscles aching i didntknow that plain old studying was such an exhausting affair at least you completed it though hermione reasoned now you can enjoy the rest of the evening that exactly what i thought about all this harry said absentmindedly beginning to enjoy the sensations that were now being produced by hermione gently massaging his shouldered with her small hands i know she said reassuringly and continued rubbing his back gently making him revel in the feeling of her hands and making him moan lightly in the process how can such a light touch produce such an effect harry wondered to himself as another wave of pleasure passed over him as hermione began nuzzling his neck with her lips and tongue finally he detached himself from the carpet and from hermione and took the seat next to her it was more out of the fear that they would get washed away in their passion and someone might walk in on them hermione snuggled into harry so what were you thinking earlier harry asked her what when hermione asked appearing confused only just now when i was completing the potions assignment harry replied you had that expression on your face like you always do whenever you are trying to think hard about anything and way may that expression be hermione asked indignantly well it this trademark expression really harry explained your eyebrows are all scrunched up together your little nose is just a bit turned up like this your cheeks get this light pink tinge that i really adore and you bit your lip like this and it makes you look so cute that i could look at you forever he tried to show her but winced in pain as he bit his lip rather harder that he wanted to or should have hermione giggled at him and punched his arm lightly he winced in mock pain she snuggled further into him almost on his lap now so what were you thinking harry persisted with his question his hands playing with one of her curly locks her hair was another thing that fascinated harry about hermione together all her curls seemed untamed wild bushy unmanageable you name such terms that can be not so good attributes to anyone hair but individually her golden brown locks were so silky smooth and almost transparent not at all unlike a veil just about the killing hermione replied you know i ve read of le tallec more than once he was one of the most prominent supporters of equal rights to all magical creatures he implemented many such policies in france he was a liberal you know and for quite some time a resistance against him has been taking shape led by wizards and witches with pure blood mania guess it sort of figures why voldemort would want to kill him he is all for the purification of the wizarding race even though he keeps on pretending even unto himself that he is a pure blood all the time harry nodded but what doesntmake sense hermione continued slowly emphasizing every syllable that she uttered is that if voldemort was really behind this how could you not feel his hate does it mean that voldemort wasntactually behind this attack and his rise was seen by the resistance of doing their work without anyone knowing any better or does it mean that he blocked you from your mind that he strangulated your connection for some time i thought about it when the news appeared harry told her i have no idea maybe the latter case is the one we are looking for after all he is an expert leglimens and occlumens of course hermione said clapping her hand to her forehead that would explain a lot of things now wouldntit harry nodded hermione spoke now we should ask dumbledore about this he bound to know what happened harry replied believe me we will tonight but as it transpired they did not meet dumbledore that evening for as harry and ron were at quidditch practice harry received an owl from the headmaster himself harry i regret that i will not be able to meet you tonight as minerva might have informed you evidently some urgent business has sprung up that needs my immediate attention i know you have questions whose answers you eagerly await but please bear with this wait it will not go in vain and you will get the answers that you seek from me look to minerva for further instructions as to my return and i would suggest in the meanwhile that you seek miss granger help and practise a few elementary occlumency techniques hogwarts library has quite a few books on the subject sincerely albus dumbledore harry quietly pocketed the note and showed it to ron and hermione later that night what could it mean ron asked not knowing how to make head or tail of dumbledore cryptic words it means hermione said a look of understanding on her face that voldemort may be listening in on us at the moment with that she looked at harry he understood immediately while hermione ran off to the library to fetch few books on occlumency harry explained the meaning of their statements to ron who didntseem to have got them all three of them even ron stayed up till late that night trying to work out the basic mind relaxation techniques the elementary stages of occlumency and by the time they crawled up to their beds all were dead tired even hermione who was quite as used to burning the midnight oil as anyone could be the next day while at breakfast harry looked in the direction of the staff table trying to find a sign of the headmaster return he caught minerva mcgonagall eyes who seemed to know what he was trying to do she shook her head slightly and harry realised that dumbledore had not returned yet he did the same at lunch and at dinner and yet albus dumbledore had not returned evidently there was something going on that was keeping him busier than ever the subsequent week started off with defense against the dark arts class for the sixth years after the class was over harry approached bickerstaff and said professor yes mr potter bickerstaff inquired do you have any problem or are you in any difficulty neither sir harry replied actually sir last year we had this informal defense association and we were just wondering if we could re organise this year as well and maybe you could help us out with all the stuff and such why not mr potter bickerstaff said his dull blue eyes coming to life all of a sudden however i do have one suggestion though when harry exited the classroom finally he found himself surrounded by a host of da members so what did he say neville asked breathlessly did he allow it harry colin creevey asked i hope he said we could do it exclaimed parvati patil guys guys guys harry said exasperatedly there is no need to get hyped up he said it is okay he has no objection he even agreed to help the group there was a collective sigh from the group at this and they broke into a cheer harry however raised his hand to ask for silence and then said he only suggested one thing that this year we should call the da only the dark arts group or something so simple on those lines and not something so catchy as dumbledore army all of them broke into laughs at this as for harry his pleasant mood carried on throughout the day even when he lost a few points for gryffindor in snape class for no reason whatsoever it was now two weeks since the news of the assassination of the french minister of magic had reached hogwarts and the rest of the wizarding world for that matter there was no remarkable change on any new sequence of events that had taken place in the school classes were proving more exacting than ever especially with the increasingly complex magic that the sixth years had to deal with although the newts were nearly one year and nine months away it seemed to harry that their teachers were trying to cram in the whole of their newts curriculum into one single year however hermione promptly proved wrong this theory of his by giving him a whole list of all the things that they still had to learn in their remaining time at hogwarts ron had seconded his view his palette was a lot lighter than either harry or hermione but he was doing the worst job among them of keeping up with his work hermione often chided him saying that he could get his work done in the free periods he had but whether he just shrugged the advice off or was refraining from telling them something harry could not say definitely the only notable absentee at hogwarts during all this time at least to the trio was albus dumbledore the headmaster himself evidently the situation at the ministry was nothing short of mayhem the warlocks of the wizengamot which acted much like the parliament coupled with the high court were holding daily meetings to review the perilous situation and talks about impeaching fudge as the minister were definitely gaining ground a massive undercurrent against fudge was rapidly surfacing in the wizarding world ironically even the daily prophet the self proclaimed filter of all news among the english wizarding community could not keep itself immune from this trend and articles regarding fudge incompetence slowly began to resurface in the newspaper with periodic regularity according to the prophet dumbledore being the chief warlock of the wizengamot was having a tough time moderating the opinions of most of his colleagues in the organisation it seemed surprising to harry that dumbledore who himself never stood for the conventional was now providing a moderate voice and that too in support of fudge who had accused him last year of trying to overthrow him from his chair and even tried to arrest him for that albeit unsuccessfully he spoke about this view of his before ron and hermione one evening in the common room at this hermione told him dontworry about things that are not in your hand harry i daresay dumbledore has everything figured out and he knows what he is doing besides if you are really curious about this i will tell you what i think i believe that dumbledore wants to stop someone ruthless and unforgiving from assuming office fudge might be weak adamant and power hungry but at least he wont start a full fledged war the stakes are too high for that i believe that is what dumbledore thinks because if the war starts you will be left with no time to prepare yourself dontyou see this yet he is trying to buy you some time no ron objected dumbledore wouldntdo that he would never support fudge especially after last year oh ron hermione said exasperatedly you are so thick anyone would think you have a muggle background just wait and consider this can you think about certain words that could describe the situation today dunno ron said thinking really hard maybe tense and fearful anxious and a sense of foreboding exactly hermione said her eyes gleaming with the kind of light that they always glowed with whenever she succeeded in putting across a valid point of argument now you cantexpect all witches and wizards to take a rational stand in such a case what dumbledore is trying to do i think is to fist have the situation calm down and then decide on the future course of action considering that we dontknow yet of voldemort plans for the wizarding world i think we would be playing into his hands if we started openly attacking him we cannot afford this war not with the kind of support that we have at the moment that what i believe dumbledore wants either way i dontthink fudge has many days left in his office a most excellent deduction miss granger came a voice from behind them from towards the portrait hole which they had their backs against if it were not for the fact that this will have no immediate bearing on your school performance i would gladly have awarded you fifty points hermione and ron turned around in their seats to come face to face with albus dumbledore harry though didntturn around or make any movement since that voice had given him enough surprises to last a life time however he was undeniably curious after all it was the first time he had seen albus dumbledore actually make an appearance inside the gryffindor common room professor hermione said ron had his mouth hanging open in surprise while harry merely continued gazing into the fire he knew that dumbledore must have come here for a purpose and in good time it would be revealed what are you doing here hermione asked well actually i am here to see harry as with you and mr weasley here dumbledore said i did promise you that i daresay that it is nice to be back in the common room after so many years sort of brings out old memories to the fore from the time when i was a lad ron sniggered inwardly he could not imagine dumbledore as a young carefree lad dumbledore continued i would have met you a few days earlier as you three had no doubt intended me to do but unfortunately i did not take the subsequent events into account anyway i believe that you have something interesting to tell me hermione looked at harry and when he gave her an almost imperceptible nod she told dumbledore regarding their discussion about harry not having felt voldemort presence the night of the murder of the french minister well there is a very simple explanation to all that hermione dumbledore said he had addressed hermione using her first name for the first time harry blocked lord voldemort off unknowingly i am sure and without meaning to he used occlumency to protect himself from the vision but how ron interjected harry isntan occlumens he is still learning and at the time of the attack he hadnteven practised for months indeed dumbledore replied but you forget ron that sometimes a piece of magic performed unknowingly has far greater consequences that magic knowingly brought into force how harry kept lord voldemort out we might never know for it was without doubt magic at its deepest forged by the connection they share but the important thing is that voldemort is now aware of what happened about how harry did not get the vision he will now try even harder to break your defences harry and for that you need to learn occlumency once again we started harry on the mind relaxation techniques hermione informed dumbledore he has almost perfected them what hermione said was indeed true harry was having much more success in controlling his emotions than he previously did yes it is just as well dumbledore said you will be starting occlumency once again as per last year schedule harry mondays at six in the evening professor snape will be waiting for you in the dungeons to teach you and you will be going there under the excuse of having to attend remedial potions but why cantyou teach me harry asked speaking for the first time in this entire exchange why does it have to be snape still especially after last year even you told me that it was a mistake on your part not to teach me occlumency yes but in today context dumbledore replied patiently and looking gently at harry the most important thing is that you establish a sizeable command over occlumency irrespective of who it is that teaches you as such i ll confess to you that the affairs of the wizengamot are taking a toll on me and i ll be kept very busy indeed in the days to come why professor hermione asked what happening too much i am afraid dumbledore replied too much and things that we have no control over as for enumerating all the affairs i couldntdo that even if my life depended on it why dontyou trust us ron asked sounding a bit hurt indeed no ron dumbledore replied i dontthink that i could find three persons who i could trust more but the fact is that the affairs of the wizengamot will seem dull and dreary to your youth however i will venture to give you some information seeing as you already have deduced so much and considering that lack of information could indeed be deemed dangerous at the moment the wizengamot is merely entertaining the idea of impeaching cornelius fudge and appointing a new minister of magic in his stead yet i fear that soon that notion will transcend into something more dangerous i fear that the members of the wizengamot may decide to take on the administration of the ministry and the issues confronting it into their own hands in that case i afraid no one will be able to help us why hermione questioned i have heard that some of the most honest wizards and witches are members of the wizengamot and you are the chief warlock she added as if that settled the matter yes that maybe so dumbledore said but power can do strange things to people even lord voldemort was tom riddle once a gullible and honest boy but it was power that corrupted him that made him the greatest threat to the world that we live in the wizengamot has always been more than just the high court of appeal he continued it is the highest authority in the wizarding world an authority to which even the minister is subservient but till now we have always been passive onlookers true we have never felt the need to exercise our almost unlimited powers all the more reason why i fear to see the wizengamot abandon its passivity one thing is for sure dumbledore resumed a faraway look in his blue eyes we cannot risk open war in the current scenario if we declare war openly we will find ourselves standing all alone without the support of other magical communities till today we have only seen lord voldemort guerrilla tactics i cantimagine what will transpire in open war against him so why then are you defending fudge ron asked glad that they could get so much information out of the headmaster well i afraid that the daily prophet must share a blame for that dumbledore answered i have merely been trying to state that although cornelius is to bear the lion share of the blame for ignoring the return of lord voldemort other people who could have warned the world of the same are also responsible hence it is time that we stop the blame game and get down to business i am afraid the daily prophet rather misinterpreted my statements sir ron asked if fudge gets removed from office and the elections take place why dontyou stand for the minister post i am sure you will have ample support yes ron dumbledore said his eyes twinkling merrily i daresay that griselda marchbanks has many friends but i would never want to leave hogwarts now would i and besides there are many people who would be more interested in getting the job more so than i they sat there in silence for a moment and then dumbledore got up saying i ll better leave now i still have to go to london tomorrow good luck all three of you with that he went to the portrait hole and still maintaining his amazing poise and grace went out and disappeared from sight as he did so ron exclaimed that was an eye opener and make no mistake about that so it was that monday came in much the same fashion as it always did ignoring the rumblings of the outside world and vesting only a purely academic interest in the comings and goings of the outside world something that the daily prophet informed them about there was a shadow of apprehension yes but they seemed too remote like the white clouds high up in the sky incapable of bringing in a storm incapable of troubling the hearts and minds of living things over the past two weeks harry had received many inquiries from the da members regarding the time to hold the meetings but he had not yet had time to do so he had informed them though that the meetings would still be held in the room of requirement but as for the time they would have to pay close attention to the false galleons in their pockets he had yet to decide on the format of their exercise and had resolved to take up that matter with ron and hermione that night however at the moment it was six o clock in the evening and harry had an occlumency lesson to attend he walked down to the potions dungeon and to snape office partly in trepidation and partly with confidence trepidation because he did not know how vicious snape would be especially since his last occlumency lesson had involved harry getting more than a sizeable glimpse of snape worst memory and confidence because a couple of weeks worth of mind relaxation exercises with hermione had taught him to have better control over his emotions and his mind when he reached the potions master office and knocked at the door it opened noiselessly as usual giving him entry into the cold room as soon as harry entered the room the door shut by itself again and he found himself looking at the cold sneering gaze of severus snape harry did not see a pensieve anywhere perhaps snape had hidden it somewhere away from him as soon as the door closed snape got up from behind his desk and walked over in front of harry staring at him in the eye all the time harry looked back at him defiantly anger emotion defiance snape said slowly these are hindrances to the art of occlumency unless you make your mind immune from these these weaknesses shall i say you will never succeed in becoming an occlumens but sir harry said gritting his teeth to prevent his anger from seeping through into his words i have heard that emotions make us human surely you dontwant to imply something other wise that enough potter snape ordered i am not here to answer your questions i am doing this only out of a favour to you and a because of a request from the headmaster it is time now that we got on with the lesson snape raised his wand and barked potter be prepared harry tried to invoke one of the mind relaxation exercises that he had learnt with hermione help in the past few days it seemed to work up to some level it seemed to him as he could feel a barrier getting created between his mind and the force of the spell that emanated from snape wand after he had shouted leglimens but as a few seconds passed he felt the barrier vanishing he tried to concentrate harder on keeping up the barrier but as hard as he tried it was to no avail it was like holding sand in your grip the harder you tried to keep it there the quicker it leaked from your palm finally he felt a dozen or so memories flashing through his mind there was his summer at the dursleys the ice cream parlour at which he worked sirius falling through the veil his first real birthday party but suddenly all of it stopped and harry found himself lying in a heap on the ground occlumency is not something that can be enforced by the agitated mind potter snape said fingering his wand it is possibly the only branch of magic in which the concentration of wizard who performs this skill is of no use the strength to uphold the barrier must come from within your mind it is an involuntary strength or gesture in our normal lives but occlumency deals with bringing that skill under control and making it abide by your wishes for once snape was talking to him in a civil manner and was explaining to him the nuances of occlumency in a proper way harry guessed that the answer to this riddle was dumbledore he deduced that the headmaster had coerced snape to be more civil and considerate with harry at least during their occlumency lessons but these thoughts vanished from his mind as snape ordered him get up now potter i donthave all evening you know prepare yourself now but before harry even got up completely snape had performed the spell on him and harry mind was flooded with past memories but the once memory that beheld his attention fro the most part was that of him kissing hermione on the floor of the alcove by the lake on her birthday in a while he felt the spell being lifted off and he lay in a heap once again on the floor harry expected snape to make some scathing remark about him and hermione but to his surprise nothing of that sort came on the contrary snape expression was something harry had never seen before on the sallow face of his vindication however the look passed as soon as snape perceived harry looking at him he now sneered at harry as if he were exacting revenge for letting him see that expression potter is this all you ve got no wonder you failed to perceive the truth and rushed off like a fool to save your godfather as soon as he said this however snape truly regretted it harry potter was enraged he knew it his green eyes shone with fire and the heat of anger began radiating from his body in waves for a while severus snape was reminded of the vision of lord voldemort standing before him murder in his eyes but the vision soon passed as harry said to him sir i think it time you told me what to do next snape decided not to press the matter further he was suddenly afraid and he knew why he tried to regain his composure and said then get out of here potter i ll expect to see you again on thursday till then keep practising or it wontbe pleasant what i might punish you with for not practising harry took it as a dismissal order and gladly exited the slimy dungeons he was son angry with snape that he didnteven notice how tired he was till he reached the fat lady portrait exhaustion seemed to have caught up with him now by the time he climbed through the portrait hole and made his way to the corner by the fire where ron and hermione were sitting his head was spinning and his mind was rendered incapable of thinking so how did it go hermione put aside her books and turned her attention to harry okay i guess harry replied i think i did okay the first time created some sort of a barrier between snape and myself but the second time i could do nothing with that he narrated what had happened during the lesson although he omitted the part about snape remark regarding sirius about the memory of hermione and him kissing being revealed to snape and about his near blow up in the end dontworry harry hermione told harry it will be okay you ll learn fast enough i hope so harry said glumly he was glad that he hadntlost his control before snape earlier in the evening so what do you reckon we should do in the da this year harry asked after some time eliciting complete interest from ron and hermione dunno mate ron said you are going to be the one teaching us i would have thought that you would have all of it figured out in your mind i was thinking about sticking to last year pattern initially harry answered thoughtfully but ever time i thought about it i always remembered what happened back at the department of mysteries i think that along with new useful spells we also need to practise duelling even with odds like to two to one or even three to one that a good idea harry hermione said appreciatively ron however was more vocal in his appreciation he said good that a bloody brilliant idea mate but when are we going to meet what about saturday at four in the afternoon hermione suggested it a weekend so everyone would be free and we could have a go at it for a long time if we wanted to harry thought for a moment and then nodded yes that would be fine with that he changed the date and time on the fake galleon that he always carried in his pocket out of habit later that night at dinner harry found several of the da members coming over to him to confirm the date and venue of their meeting or waving at him from afar some of them wanted to bring new members along and harry gladly acquiesced to there request saying the more the merrier it was wednesday at breakfast the post arrived soon many of the students including hermione were daily subscribers to the daily prophet and they received a big surprise when they unfolded the paper and began reading it the headline was in bold letter as always but today it had been enchanted to sparkle in various colours as if to highlight the new item further the front page read cornelius fudge sacked as minister of magic according to inside sources from the ministry it had indeed been confirmed for the daily prophet that the incumbent minister of magic cornelius fudge has been sacked from his post the daily prophet had come across a formal wizengamot order that is to be made public sometime today that the decision has been finalised sources revealed that the wizengamot under the presidentship of chief warlock albus dumbledore met in london yesterday and took the decision this decision has been expected ever since the confirmation of the news that he who must not be named has returned and the subsequent assassination of french minister of magic charles le tallec by you know who in london the official release of the wizengamot meeting cites inefficiency incompetence and an excessive hunger for power as the reasons behind minister fudge sacking the wizengamot has now installed madam amelia bones head of the department of magical law enforcement as the acting minister of magic till such date as the elections for the new minister are held aspirants to the minister post have now begun planning their campaigns for the forthcoming elections madam bones has hitherto not announced any plan of wanting to contest the elections which as per wide belief are to be conducted under the shadow of the return of he who must not be named and his band of death eaters it must be reminded that cornelius fudge was elected the minister of magic the article went on about fudge political career and his past history of jobs as expected a lot of blame was placed on him for ignoring voldemort return and by the time the reporter had finished criticising fudge and concluded by writing that fudge was a mean selfish good for nothing old man who should never have been elected to the post in the first place ron took serious offence to this saying that it was apparently the daily prophet whose vocal support had swung the previous elections in fudge favour the whole of fudge eighty years of life had been torn to bits due to over analysing and six pages of the newspaper had been exhausted in the process well i guess that was expected hermione said in a low voice so that only harry and ron could hear her both boys nodded at this i just hope the new minister has the sense to listen to dumbledore and the order ron concluded as he continued with his breakfast harry meanwhile remained silent and thought to himself if only it were that simple ron author note well that the end of this chapter another one above 7000 words the next chapter will mark the reformation of the da an interesting encounter with someone you and i have grown to like and then dislike strongly in the course of the books revelations galore and a very strong conflict indeed thanks to all those who read the story and or reviewed this chapter is dedicated to all of you i will upload the next chapter in ten days time again till then see you all and have a very happy new year p s three cheers for our favourite writer i can hardly wait for 16th july now even though it seems so far away author note thanks to my beta eschiva for going through this and giving her feedback it really helped brush the chapter up nicely chapter thirteen mysteries and knowledge the news of fudge sacking brought much cheer amongst the hogwarts students everyone now knew of the lies that he had supplied the whole wizarding world with during the last one year and it appeared that the public opinion considered the ex minister as the real villain in the whole affair needless to say the hogwarts students reflected this as well a whole generation of wizards had grown up under the fear of lord voldemort shadow his name always lingered at the edge of every dark tale that could as a dark shadow something that could not be touched removed or cleansed they couldntever speak his name out aloud and to them his notoriety and ill fame was so great that they could never look up to him as anything but the ultimate bad guy now that the knowledge that voldemort was active again had become commonplace panic was indeed widespread the sacking of fudge was only a mild testimonial to the name other indications included regular hoaxes regarding death eater attacks and kidnappings fictitious sightings of the dark forces and paranoia galore in the mind of wizards and witches all across england yet hogwarts was still untouched by the insecure atmosphere at least on the surface the french minister assassination had driven the notion of grave danger finally into everyone minds but with the passage of time that terror was gradually fading and giving way to apprehension something that you found lying beneath the surface only if you scratched the top deep enough it was mid october and autumn was fast giving way to winter still even if it was the fag end of the season it brought some cheer to the student community since the weather was sunny and bright during the transition period a rarity in itself perfect conditions for spending outdoors you could see a host of students lazing around the lake or gathered near hagrid cabin or simply walking the grounds during those times everyone was trying to squeeze in as much time in warmth and sunshine as they possibly could and for the time being all thoughts of the imminent war in the outside world were conveniently put on the backburner the da i e the dark arts group as they now called themselves assembled that weekend for the first time in the ongoing year there were many new members who had shown interest in joining in all there were around forty students who had shown up in the room of requirement harry had earlier asked bickerstaff more clearly about the role he would like to play with the group at this bickerstaff replied saying since it a club it is the students who will have to do everything you must choose what you want to work on i will just be on the sidelines advising you and assisting you in matters where you might need my help still i would prefer if you gave me a short report as to what you might have done during a particular session only a few words spoken between the two of us regarding this would suffice harry ron and hermione were the first to arrive in the room of requirement that was indeed necessary since no one but harry knew what exactly were they supposed to do and so he had to summon the faculties of the room to conjure up the required arrangement as they entered the room harry remembered the last time he had been here and the strange cross roads at which he had found himself then when the door appeared and the three of them entered they found themselves in something which looked remarkably like a conference room about forty cozy looking chairs were arranged randomly around an empty central space in more or less a circular manner what are we going to do in here ron asked eyeing the arrangements it looks like the setting for a meeting not for a dark arts group well harry explained i thought we could just meet up and introduce the new members for today he had suddenly realized that most of the students who would come would expect to see some action and that was a thing he had not planned for at least not for today slowly the members and for the time being the non members began trickling in and soon all the chairs were filled not a single chair was empty and no other student came in afterwards it was as if the room knew exactly the number of students who would turn up when everyone settled themselves they all looked expectantly at harry who spoke up well hello everyone it nice seeing all of you here first of all i think i need to explain to all of you the reason for this arrangement here as it is ron here was most surprised on seeing what the room had conjured up and i daresay a few of you share the same reaction well i just thought that before we begin we should get acquainted with each other once again even if we already are friends i am harry potter sixth year as harry said this he heard a comment from zacharias smith as if we dontknow that well enough ron was about to say something harry replied coolly i dontbelieve that everyone in this room was in the da last year so i think we d better continue with the introductions soon everyone gave their instructions one by one and harry discovered the exact number of people in the group there were students ranging from third year to seventh year the most surprising new member though was blaise zabini a sixth year slytherin whom harry had never paid any special notice to but unknown quantity or not the presence of a slytherin in an anti dark arts group was certainly very surprising quite a few eyebrows were raised at him but taking harry lead everyone kept quiet after it was a club anyone was free to join another interesting presence although not unexpected was cho chang much to harry chagrin fortunately her friend marietta edgecombe the one who had spilled the da secret to umbridge last year had not accompanied her cho was looking on resolutely around her though as she made her introductions harry could see her gaze directed almost a bit too long on himself after everyone had made clear who they were and which year they belonged to harry spoke up once again well now that we all know who everybody is i think the first job on hand is to explain what we are going to do the da began as a means to upstage dolores umbridge authority at hogwarts but now that we are all cured of umbridgitis there were a few laughs and catcalls at this the da has become much more it is now a way of learning to fight the dark forces especially the ones that belong to lord voldemort and his band of death eaters we learnt a lot during last year regarding defending ourselves most of you know this i believe but i do not think many of you know how this knowledge saved the lives of six of us towards the end of last year at the end of last year there was a battle in the department of mysteries in the ministry of magic six of the da ron luna ginny neville hermione and i were trapped there by a dozen death eaters yet we survived in part due to our knowledge courage and trust for each other and for the remaining part due to luck and the valour of others who came to our rescue i cannot promise you that every one of you will be as lucky but we could at least try to arm ourselves as well as we can that why decided to resume the da activities this year as well to give ourselves some extra time to hone our defences we are going to practise hexes curses jinxes counter jinxes and all such spells and at the same time we are going to practice duelling as well i think all of you will agree with me when i say that this year we have got a very competent teacher i have talked to professor bickerstaff and he is more than willing to help us out i am sure that we will work hard this year and arm ourselves to defend ourselves and our loved ones that all i have to say for the moment with that harry sat back down on his chair silence lay on the group everyone clearly thinking of what harry had said finally justin finch fletchey said so when do we begin there is no point in keeping the meetings secret or in keeping the timings different for different meetings hermione opined indeed yes harry said so what do you say about every saturday afternoon so it wontaffect our classes or any other commitments and what about us who have joined anew a fourth year ravenclaw by the name dorace unsworth asked we will be working in groups this time till everyone come up to the same level harry replied then we can do all the things at a time there was a general murmur of assent at this so i guess that it for the moment harry finally said since we ve spent today session talking and such we could have a session here tomorrow afternoon with luck we might enlist bickerstaff support and start on duelling what do you reckon everyone agreed to this and began filing out of the room finally harry exited the room and closed the door behind him after which it vanished without a trace harry was about to catch up with ron and hermione when he heard a voice all to him from behind harry can i talk to you for a moment came the voice of cho chang the pretty ravenclaw whom harry had briefly and disastrously dated last year sure why not harry said standing beside ron and hermione and turning around to look at cho cho however did not look comfortable she eyed ron and hermione with distrust and finally said i was thinking of talking alone then i afraid we cannot do that harry said adamantly whatever you have to say you must say it in front of my friends as well no harry hermione spoke to him gently placing a light touch of her arms on his shoulder you go on we ll wait for you in the common room then seeing that he hadntmoved she said once again go on harry finally moved and accompanied cho to the end of the corridor where an unused classroom was located they entered and stood near the centre of the class looking at each other so harry how have you been cho asked all right i suppose harry replied formally there was a long pregnant pause after this the air seemed to be suspended with unresolved questions and the search for answers finally harry said look cho i know it will not feel very nice to hear this but i simply cannot keep up this fa ade so you d better tell me what you want to talk to me about and get this over with cho sighed and said harry i was just thinking thinking about you and me i was just wondering if there is any chance of us i mean you and me getting together again harry was rather stumped at this question hell he had known for some time now that cho had dated michael corner at the end of last year then why did she want him to patch things up with her still he knew the answer he wanted to give even though it might bring disappointment to her the only issue was how to say that to her finally harry opted for the pragmatic approach i am sorry cho harry said shaking his head slightly but you and i we are history i dontthink we can ever be together and there is clearly no way we can bring the impossible to see the light of the day a glint of clear sadness passed through cho eyes her face fell and her shoulders drooped but she managed to get hold of herself after a moment lapse and sighed she told harry it all right i understand with that she moved to go to her own common room but harry said quietly i am sorry cho but you need to understand i am not like cedric you know after a pause he resumed even as cho turned around tears welling up in her eyes what you are looking for is a shadow of cedric cho i afraid i cannot give you that i only saw him die and i never was one of the important people in his life cedric death might have been in part due to my fault but it wasntof my making harry could see the impact that these words had on cho she began shaking uncontrollably and sank down onto the floor against one of the desks it was a heart rending sight for harry who could never bear to see anyone sadness even though his own childhood was filled with horrors some of them forgotten by himself in truth it was this compassion that separated him from the rest and made him what he was the only beacon of hope for the wizarding world ordinarily harry might have said dontcry and tried to comfort cho but he did not do that this time cho had been crying all over the place last year but that was her mourning for what might have been instead of what was it was tonight that cho really mourned it was tonight that cho cried for cedric for who he was and not for who he might have been it went on for a long time harry didntknow for how long they stayed in that deserted classroom harry standing near the teacher desk and cho on the floor finally the sobbing subsided and cho got up her face a mess from all the crying harry offered her his handkerchief and she accepted gratefully you know cho said as she tried to calm herself down the evening before the third task cedric seemed so happy and it was then that he told me for the first time that he loved me and her voice started breaking again as she said and that was the only time he said that to me harry nodded and said i know cedric death hit you hard but it is time to move on i dontthink he would have wanted you to linger on his memories for long i sure that you will find someone else in your life who will love you as much and who you will grow to love cho nodded thank you harry the sincerity in her voice was unmistakeable i am sure that hermione is very glad she has you who love her so much she added with a slight smile i hope so harry said without thinking and then a moment later he caught up with what he had said wait a minute how do you know about hermione and me believe me harry cho said now looking far more composed than she had been i notice things dontworry just because one of my friends couldnthold a secret in her stomach doesntmeant that i cantdo so as well your secret will be safe with me harry smiled gratefully at her well i ll better get going then he said to cho ron and hermione must be waiting for me cho nodded bye harry i guess i ll be seeing you around school sure harry nodded and exited the classroom leaving cho behind in his wake her soul relieved from a burden she had been carrying for one year now when harry made his way back to the common room after his unexpected encounter with cho he found ron and hermione waiting there both were trying to get some work done but it was apparent from the way hermione was looking edgy that all was not perfect it had been a long day for harry not so much in terms of physical exhaustion but more so in terms of mental fatigue the whole day he had increasingly felt a growing pricking in his scar and even though he had tried to use his still limited occlumency skills to alleviate that feeling he had no success whatsoever harry was now approaching the onset of the night with trepidation and a sense of foreboding the fatigue that had set in was intensified by his encounter with cho now although he had half a mind to go to dumbledore office and inform him about the pricking in his scar but he decided against it for two reasons one it was only an irritating prick nothing overly painful and secondly something gave him the hard to explain feeling that the feel of his scar had nothing to do with voldemort he entered the common room and flung himself on the couch next to hermione already it was nine at night harry had missed dinner but he couldntcare less about it at present tired hermione asked him as he closed his eyes harry nodded you bet you wontbelieve what happened with cho ron noticed his two friends reactions at this hermione had stiffened visibly on hearing harry say what he had ron had this sneaking feeling that hermione was somewhere down the line suspecting harry of well the mildest way of saying this would be that hermione suspected harry of cheating on her ron couldntwait to hear more about this and put things right between them what happened ron asked and bent forward as if to catch harry words better well we went into an abandoned classroom harry said there she told me that she wanted to get together with me again what ron exclaimed so loudly that the rest of the already full common room turned around to try and figure out what was the cause of ron explosion hermione ron noticed had gone rigid ron shot everyone apologetic looks for the disturbance and as they returned back to their own work he directed his ire towards harry what and what did you say to her harry sensed the implied meaning of ron question and answered honestly just the truth i told her that there is no chance of it happening she seemed to have guessed though that hermione and i are together hermione relaxed visibly at this and a smile came to her lips even as it did a few tears escaped down her cheeks oh harry i am sorry hermione sobbed into harry shirt i thought you had gotten together with cho i thought you were shagging ron supplied the word and hermione sobs intensified but he firmly shut his mouth when harry gave him a wrathful glare honestly hermione harry said you didntthink i could do that i love you i d never leave you for any one that the truth ron made a vomiting gesture on hearing of this over flowing fluffiness and promptly earned himself another glare from harry i didntwant to believe it but i thought that you liked cho last year and went out with her and she is much better looking and harry knew that she was starting to babble and it would be exceedingly difficult for him to stop her and put his own point across if she was allowed to continue so he interrupted her and said hermione i think you are very beautiful i dontthink that any one can be like you i told you i love you and that means that i always want to be right here with you really hermione asked calm being restored to her troubled senses she had overheard lavender and parvati talking about harry and cho making up with each other and that they were now absent from dinner and locked together alone in an empty classroom on the seventh floor that had made her lose her appetite she had been pondering its truthfulness ever since they had come back from dinner and was trying to make up her mind regarding how to pose the question to harry even as he appeared in the common room now that hermione looked back at it she was quite embarrassed with herself she had been very silly there was no denying that fact harry would never cheat on her he loved her and she knew it i am sorry harry hermione said i shouldnthave suspected you like that alright apology accepted harry replied but next time you want to confirm or even waylay any suspicion of me just talk to me okay hermione nodded harry kissed her then and there and she kissed him back harry sank back into the back of the couch and unsuccessfully tried to stifle a huge yawn oh god am i tired hermione kissed him lightly on the lips and said go on then and try to get some sleep and before that remember to do the relaxation exercises alright yes mum harry grinned at her and after saying good night to ron who looked ready to really vomit he gave hermione a good night kiss it transcended into a semi passionate kiss that was disturbed only when a very green looking ron started looking here and there and whistling what harry asked breaking off from the kiss next time you do that mate please warn me you know it not very pleasant watching your friends engaged in a most passionate lip lock ron replied very eloquent ron hermione giggled and before you ask what eloquent means it means using expressive language i know what eloquence means ron began and harry could see that another bickering match was in the works he intervened by saying well before you plunge into a full fledged battle of words i will make my way to bed tell me who the winner was in the morning hermione looked apologetically at harry but seeing his bemused expression changed her own into a smile alright harry go on we ll tell you about my victory later on your victory ron exclaimed in your dreams indeed hermione retorted so you expect yourself to outdo me something you ve never done since when have you started living in fantasies ron alright alright ron gave up which harry thought was very mature of him you win hermione looked triumphant harry gave her another good night kiss the last one of that night and proceeded to walk upstairs when harry was gone ron and hermione turned back to their work but soon they realised that something was wrong they looked up to see that the whole common room had fallen eerily silent and everyone was staring at them especially at hermione hermione seemed a little queasy under the attention realising this ron looked to the nearest group all consisting of third years what he asked them bringing forth a hint of menace into his voice immediately they quailed and returned to their work others followed suit and so the common room was filled with chatter again what the matter with them they are all psychos ron asked hermione as the atmosphere in the room became normal ron honestly dontyou have anything grey in there hermione asked rolling her eyes and prodding ron on the forehead ow ron howled in pain what did you do that for haventyou realised it ron hermione said they saw harry and i kiss each other that means that that they all know you are together ron finished off and then suddenly started out laughing at the top of his lungs he shouted harry and hermione sitting on a tree k i s s i n g the whole common room heard this din and started laughing out aloud hermione looked positively murderous she hissed at ron ron if only there werentso many witnesses here i would have strangled you before you could say kissing ron however did not take her seriously and stuck his tongue out at her urghhh hermione exclaimed you and your childishness i dontthink i can take it anymore i am going to bed now with that she lifted her bags and books and walked off towards the girl dormitories ron grinned after her he was clearly the victor tonight half an hour later hermione was sitting on her bed cross legged indian style her books spread before her her mind intent on studying she heard her dormitory door open from beyond her bed curtains but ignored the sound but soon she found that she could no longer ignore the noise since her bed curtains were flung open and she found herself face to face with about ten gryffindor girls from seventh year to fourth year and led by her dorm mates parvati patil and lavender brown hermione parvati said you have been naughty haventyou why didntyou tell us of your relationship with harry before there isntanything to tell i mean harry and i we are together now that all hermione replied that all that all lavender brown screamed nearly causing hermione ear drums to split hermione you ve just taken the boy who lived out of the available list of boys and you say that all all the other girls in the room murmured sounds conveying the general assent okay so that it hermione retorted irritably but why then are you making me undergo this interrogation because hermione my dear came ginny voice from across the room as she entered the dorm and made her way to hermione bedside we are talking about the boy who lived here hermione and he is the boy whose life is always under scrutiny and nothing is ever hidden that why besides he doesntlook too bad either does he anyway we want to know how he is how he is hermione repeatedly faintly has everyone gone mad here i mean i have no idea what you are talking about hermione said a seventh year whose name hermione knew to be fiona wells you would only if you stopped hanging out so much with ron and harry and more with us girls okay enough words lavender said now tell me how is harry in the sack what hermione asked shocked by the forthrightness of the question now hermione donttell me you dontknow what i mean lavender said of course i know hermione started saying then tell us about it parvati interrupted there is nothing to tell then hermione replied harry and i have never had sex what all the girls around the bed except for ginny shrieked in surprise at this yes we have never gone beyond kissing hermione revealed so is he a good kisser a sixth year girl asked hermione blushed a little bit and said yeah i would definitely say so but hermione you have much to learn at the moment especially if you want harry to remain faithful to you lavender said nodding her head in an irritating all knowing fashion harry is not like that hermione began but it was now parvati who interrupted her this time around she said he might not be like that now but he will in a few days after all he is a male i dontbelieve you hermione said indeed you don t that why you have never had a boyfriend before now have you if only you had come to us for advice we would have done something for you lavender said that touched a sore nerve in hermione truth be told she was a little na ve about her own relationships even though she was a good judge of others relations she was very insecure about her relationship with harry even though she genuinely believed in him and his love for her it was like she feared that something or someone would emerge out of the blue and take him away from her you couldntreally blame her though since harry was in all reality her first boyfriend and only the second person with whom she had ever gone out are you telling the truth hermione asked starting to get lulled by parvati words hundred percent from my own experience and from that of many others before me parvati replied all the other girls nodded their heads vigorously at this ginny meanwhile looked nonplussed then what should i do hermione said hopefully well that why we are here now arentwe lavender said first thing we need to give you a makeover something so stunning that you will knock the wind out of harry something like you did during the yule ball but that will take hours hermione objected not if we help you ginny said so i suggest miss granger that you pack up your bags now and go to sleep immediately since you will have to get up early in the morning tomorrow for your makeover hermione did as she was told she went to bed that night wondering if what she had been old was true she went to bed that night wondering even in her sub conscious mind if harry would get bored being with her and leave he someday but she found that she could not sleep no matter what all of a sudden she remembered her birthday last month and that was what sent her into the land of dreams that night hermione woke up suddenly in the middle of the night she did not know why or how she opened her bed curtains and chanced a glance at the clock that was merrily ticking away on the side table it was five in the morning she felt thirsty and walked across the room to have a drink of water as she did so she felt the sudden urge to see harry at once she did not know why but the fact of the matter was that there was this inexplicable desire inside her to see him immediately she had gone ahead with her dorm mates plan of the makeover simply on the spur of the moment inside of her she knew especially with how forthright harry had been with her about his encounter with cho that she neednthave any fears regarding her relationship with harry but this urge it didntcome from her insecurities it came from an unknown fear of something that was going to happen as she took in gulps of water and looked out of the dorm window it showed the lake looking like a dark mirror of the starry sky overhead suddenly there was a bright blue light that lighted the night sky and dazzled hermione senses it was a wild light directed like an arrow unstopping in its speed unwavering in its flight it was like the herald of woe a crow that cawed of the impending storm a storm that was upon them she dropped her glass on the heavily carpeted floor and it fell with a dull thud and rolled away hitting one of the beds with a low clink but hermione heard none of this she was already flying down the staircase to her dorms through the common room and back up the conjugated stairs to the boys dormitories hermione flung the door open noiselessly and rushed over to harry bedside she drew aside the curtains of his four poster bed and looked down to where he slept what she saw made her feel dizzy with happiness and brought warm relief to her heart she sat down on the edge of harry bed as he slept peacefully his eyes closed hiding his captivating emerald green orbs from view hermione was sure that the blue streak was something to do with the ongoing conflict in the wizarding world even more disturbing she felt herself believe that this was all somehow related to harry it was almost as if she had been given a way to discover what was going on and she intended to do precisely that for now she felt the long hours of awakening catching up to her and she decided it was time to take a nap she contemplated going back to her own dorm but decided it would be too cumbersome so she decided to take up her quarters with harry for the night she snuggled into bed with harry and with a wave of his wand she closed the hangings around them and locked them shut so that no one could discover her presence there harry meanwhile was oblivious to all this as he felt strange dreams overpower his sub conscious mind these were a couple of visions that he was now used to having almost every night at least ever since he had begun to succeed to a limited extent at his attempts of relaxing his mind sometimes he saw a quaint little town possibly even a small village there was a house in there warm cosy large and comfortable harry never did see any more of this vision the second vision consisted of fair glades filled with flower laden trees a wonderful scent lingered in the air and the soft music of unseen voices enchanted the ears harry had no idea what these visions conveyed at the moment as an unknown dread crept into his heart he saw again the former vision then suddenly as hermione presence by his made itself felt the vision faded away and he lingered in a state of slumber dreams and visions nowhere near his mind even to his awakening when hermione woke up the next morning and opened her eyes she found her eyes dazzled by bright daylight it took her a minute to register where she was she looked around and saw harry awake and standing in front of a mirror tying to comb his hair which was sticking up in every imaginable direction harry saw hermione wake up and smiled at her even as he did so the mirror spoke out you d better smooth that hair of yours dear or it looks like a bird nest hermione stifled a giggle as harry rolled his eyes he came up and sat down by hermione who was now sitting upright against the headboard still cosily comforted by the sheets she really was looking very pretty in her nightclothes and bunched up among the sheets her hair still as bushy as ever but a certain freshness surrounding her about like an aura he went near her and kissed her softly so you are awake hermione was pleasantly surprised by the gesture she said yeah i guess so anyway what the time speaking of time harry replied it already ten and we have both missed breakfast the other guys were up and about long ago i was too scared to get up since they might have discovered you so i waited till everyone went down to breakfast why were you embarrassed by the thought of being caught in bed with me hermione teased him however hermione took this jest quite seriously he began explaining no hermione i could never think like that i swear it only that i thought you d still want to keep out relationship a secret and but seeing the laughter and mirth in her eyes he realised the truth harry looked sheepishly at her and sat down on the bed next to her hermione however looked more serious now she said there no point in hiding this anymore harry huh you are joking arentyou harry asked her for confirmation actually no she replied evidently you didntrealise that we did our goodnight kisses before the whole common room yesterday that abrupt huh harry asked smiling slightly hermione nodded so what do we do now she asked nothing harry replied behave like we feel i guess i canttell you how much i ve wanted to kiss you right in the great hall in front of all the people out there hermione giggled at this i didntknow you were such an exhibitionist harry she said well then shall we go down to the kitchens and have something to eat i positively starving harry exclaimed sure let meet in the common room in half an hour hermione said harry groaned that too long well seeing that you have tidied up and dressed yourself up while i still in my nightclothes that the minimum amount of time i going to take i still have to shower and dress you know hermione told him frankly are you sure you dontwant me to join you harry whispered seductively in her ear hermione felt a shiver run down her spine at this she never knew that a simple statement in that sexy voice could drive her lust to the point of craziness she restrained herself from jumping right then and there on harry and snogging him senseless and merely said some other time mr potter with that she got up and made to leave harry felt all his blood drain south so it was precisely fifty minutes later that hermione met harry down in the common room already it was eleven and both of them were feeling ravenous harry felt it was really good for them that the elves were always so eager to be worked since that meant they could get a good brunch in as hermione came down she did not see anyone else in the common room except for harry it was a very fine day indeed outside in all likelihood one of the last ones of the year and everyone was eager to catch the mild warmth of the sun while it lasted harry though seemed to be dozing off near the fireplace with his glasses dangling from one ear hermione looked down at her boyfriend napping figure with amusement she gently poked him on the shoulders and he woke up with a start wake up sleepyhead she said as he yawned widely and rubbed his eyes he still hadntnoticed the precarious position in which his glasses were perched he regained his sense of symmetry and direction and asked what took you so long i ve been waiting here for an hour now i can see that hermione remarked you seemed to be making a good job of it well i need my sleep now donti harry defended himself of course hermione said but i presumed that what you did last night well it never hurts to have some extra rest does it harry said hermione could have sworn that he had averted his eyes from hers as he said this but she decided not to push the matter further she knew that harry trusted her enough to tell her about what was bothering him once he figured it out himself so harry began any special reason why you surprised me today huh hermione questioned not understanding harry question well in truth understanding it but pretending not to i mean i went to sleep yesterday night all alone and today when i woke up i find you with me that was a pleasant surprise now harry explained to her i just couldntsleep well she said trying to process some quick thoughts inside her mind she did not want to reveal the truth to harry for she did not know half of it herself why harry raised her eyebrows well if you must know after you went upstairs yesterday and i realised that everyone now knew about us i went up to my dorm and with that hermione narrated her encounter with the host of girls and the promised makeover and suspected infidelity she managed to explain the part of wanting to escape the fate that awaited her in the morning with a bunch of giggling and swooning girls trying to tame her locks and getting her to look better while part of her the insecure part wanted to hold on to harry and make sure that he didntgo anywhere by the time she had finished explaining things hermione looked completely flummoxed harry considered this carefully it was completely unlike hermione to mince her words or beat around the bush at any time he had this sneaky feeling that there was something more to all this than met the eye his curiosity started to overflow as he considered asking her about his suspicions but the rational part of his mind reasoned against it saying that he must learn to respect her wishes if she didntwant to tell him something it was her decision and hers alone if she needed his help or opinion she would certainly tell him when the right time came it took both harry and hermione some time to register the fact that it was nearly time for lunch and neither of them had had a single morsel of food to eat in the last eighteen hours or so so they finally exited the gryffindor tower for the first time that day and made their way down to the great hall on the way they passed a few students all of whom shot either curious or envious looks at the both of them they were now walking with their hands laced together glad finally that they were free of care and worry about their loving gestures in front of others they entered the great hall only to find it about four fifths full as they neared the hall they could hear the chatter of voices drifting across the open doors but no sooner did they enter than the voices cease to exist everyone turned to look at them both their entwined hands did not escape notice either harry and hermione ignored this and took their seats opposite ron and ginny on the gryffindor table both were smirking knowingly and when they sat down ron asked a seemingly innocent question so harry where have you two been buzz off harry said more to dissipate the number of ears that were now directed from all parts of the hall towards them he knew that ron had asked this question to give him an opportunity to divert the stares and whispers that he and hermione were now attracting before lunch was over though parvati and lavender made their way to beside hermione and hissed at her hermione you missed our plans for today sorry parvati hermione replied but i dontthink i need a makeover why lavender asked quickly getting into her gossip mode glancing at harry she asked hermione did you see something that disappointed you oh for god sake get your heads off the gutter hermione said harry and i have talked of everything and i know what he feels about me and yes i dontneed any help from either of you or from anyone alright parvati said as they began walking off from the hall but if you need any semi professional help you know where to come hermione shrugged her shoulders and went back to her food the great hall slowly began emptying evidently harry and hermione were one of the last people to have appeared for lunch still one thing was clear they were indeed the last persons to exit the great hall especially considering the interruptions that they had to bear many students came over and congratulated them harry felt as if it was more like he and hermione had gotten engaged or maybe even married wait a minute where did that come from though on second thoughts harry did think that it wasntsuch a bad idea after all he blushed furiously every time anyone made a good natured yet sleazy remark about the state of their relationship hermione though was carrying out her part with lan at the moment harry really admired her composure meanwhile unnoticed to either of them there were quite a host of expressions on the faces of their teachers dumbledore eyes were twinkling as madly as ever while professor mcgonagall had her lips synced together in an almost imperceptible smile she seemed a bit beady eyed as well snape was his usual expressionless self turning up in nothing but the same dour expression that he always wore if there was anything he felt regarding all this or remembered seeing all this he didntshow it no wonder he was a fine occlumens harry and hermione were finally allowed to finish their respective meals and they were now starting back on their way to gryffindor tower ron had already left not before declaring though that he was leaving them alone but they should behave themselves the entire population of gryffindor in vicinity shared a good laugh at this no doubt to the embarrassment of once again harry and hermione they left the great hall students swarmed about them some returning to their houses some outside and some with the fifth years and the seventh years finding special mention in that group to the library just as harry was about to take the first step up the main stairs he found his way blocked by none other than draco malfoy and his cronies crabbe and goyle get out of the way malfoy harry said quietly malfoy however did not seem to hear it he said his voice at its taunting best so potter it is true then you finally got yourself a girlfriend get out of the way malfoy harry repeated his voice a lot colder than previously hermione could almost feel his irritation now so granger a bit rich for you isnthe after all i guess a half blood is better than a mudblood like you any day malfoy continued taunting harry began losing his temper now he didntreally mind it when malfoy taunted him but he didntwant him to utter even a single foul word against hermione tell me potter malfoy continued do you plan to produce filthy little brats here or after school i would suggest about doing it right now i will at least get us rid of her for a few months in fact i would have done it myself long ago but i could never really bring myself to touch a filthy ragged mudblood like her harry had known that he was nearing his breaking point but the last remark did it for malfoy hermione had tears now in her eyes and he could not bear to see those despite of all this she told harry let go harry please ignore him but harry did not budge he thrust his hand out at malfoy he didnteven bother with his wand his hand movement sent an invisible beam through to malfoy and he bent back over almost as if he were under the cruciatus curse writhing on the floor in pain seeing their leader fall crabbe and goyle tried to muscularly hit harry but another simple movement of his hand and they were frozen in their places meanwhile malfoy was suddenly transforming into well a ferret once again at least some of him was his head still was in its original form but his body had changed into that of a very large ferret how harry had performed such a complex transfiguration wandless even when he could not perform such a spell with his wand no one was able to tell harry lifted his hand once again and malfoy ferret like feet left the air defying all the laws of gravity and he was dangled upside down in the air harry potter came the indignant voice of professor mcgonagall she tried to restore malfoy back to his original form but she found that she could not break harry spell she said angrily again potter release mr malfoy at once she had to repeat her words once again but to no effect finally hermione who was standing there shocked at what was happening regained her senses and told harry please harry do as professor mcgonagall said please these words calmed harry down a little he let go his body which was all tensed up till now relaxed but the fire still burned and smouldered in his eyes and then a moment later it sparked up one last time and was extinguished leaving him there as harry potter the same old harry potter professor mcgonagall came over to harry and said mr potter that was that i just come with me to my office this instant i need to look up the proper punishment for this malfoy was lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs his form changed back to a more human one his hair shrouded his grey eyes as sweat gleaned on his blow even as harry followed mcgonagall and passed him he hissed bitterly i ll get back at you potter i ll make you pay you and that whorish mudblood of yours author note so i am back this chapter was quite difficult to write that i can tell you since it is one of those filler chapters where you are preparing the ground for the action ahead one thing that i can tell you is that the next seven to eight chapters are going to be non stop action as for the rest of the chapters i am almost sure that there are going to be 29 chapters in the story and i will be hoping to complete these chapters as soon as possible so here the beginning of the roller coaster now i am sorry about the delay in posting but i have had a very busy fortnight first of all i rushed off to the tsunami affected zone in india to volunteer with the relief work the situation was really really terrible and however much the truth is however much you help the people affected it transpires to be less than the aid required after i returned a week later i have had to face mid term exams in short i have hardly had space to breathe thanks and please review chapter seventeen isle amidst the storm lord voldemort turned to harry and hissed now potter tell me the truth silence invaded the entire surrounding there as voldemort looked into harry eyes and harry defiantly looked back into his it was the calm before all hell broke loose before harry could speak anything sounds of apparition resonated through the village harry saw order members apparating into hogsmeade right next to harry the sound of apparition revealed the figure of albus dumbledore voldemort eyes narrowed on seeing the new arrivals except that his face didntbetray any sign neither side made any move to start the battle it was as if both were waiting for the other to strike the first blow dumbledore was the first one who spoke he said it was an ingenious move tom attacking hogsmeade and diagon alley on the same day attack the enemy from both sides and stretch his resources isntit that one it was as if they were sitting back in a hogwarts classroom of fifty years ago and dumbledore was taking tom riddle class you made a mistake coming here dumbledore voldemort said you are outnumbered outnumbered yes tom dumbledore said but not outwitted for one i know that numbers donthold significance in a battle i dontthink you would have forgotten that lesson you know nothing dumbledore lord voldemort hissed and spat at the old headmaster i have moved on beyond your comprehension the basic moves of war still remain the same tom dumbledore responded you can only fashion them to your whims but you can never claim to make them you cannot take so great a claim and place it on one mind i hope you ve not forgotten the text the text was all false lord voldemort said all it was good for was to learn how to acquire power and now that i have got it i do not need it you cannot imagine what i can do with absolute power dumbledore responded neither do you for you do not have absolute power yourself you talk too much dumbledore even as you act too slowly voldemort said and with a lightning fast move shot a killing curse at harry but dumbledore was equally quick he used his own spell to push harry out of harm way if you have to get to harry you ll have to face me first dumbledore said why dumbledore why why is the boy so important lord voldemort said what does he mean to you that is for me to know and you to find out dumbledore replied grimly and then the duel began in right earnest voldemort shot a killing curse at dumbledore but with a flick of his wand dumbledore had it intercepted by a large rock which had rested nearby but was now shattered into a thousand pieces it seemed to harry that the fateful night at the ministry last june had now returned again since he could still see shades of that duel in the present one as if it were the latest instalment to an unresolved argument you cannot kill me dumbledore voldemort hissed as he shot another killing curse at the old headmaster i dontintend to tom as you should very well know by now dumbledore responded first you need to feel the pain and punishment destined for you before you die killing you would give you a respite from all that harry wondered vaguely for a moment at this statement but being in the middle of a full fledged battle he realized that he had no time to stop and think the exchange between dumbledore and voldemort proved to be the orders that both sides were waiting for almost like a catalyst to an explosion fighting erupted on both sides as spells were cast by all present the dementors swooped amongst the duellers targeting the order members harry realized that with dumbledore duelling voldemort and the remaining order members engaged in the peripheral battle the dementors were free to choose and then feast upon their prey he quickly moved out of the line of fire and shouted expecto patronum the patronus did its work as the order members became immune from the terror of the dementors they were now filled with greater zeal harry he found a voice shouting to his right get out of here he saw lupin telling him as he engaged himself in fierce combat get out of here now harry did as he was told and ducked and swooped from under the duellers avoiding them then he noticed a circle of death eaters battling a lone order member who was standing in their midst harry jumped into the fray and took out a couple of those death eaters he realized that order member in question was mad eye moody even with those two out moody still had a ring of death eaters surrounding him but true to his lunacy he seemed to be enjoying the duel not withstanding the fact that it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to hold his ground harry stunned a few more death eaters around moody so as to lighten the ex auror load but seeing him moody shouted potter what are you doing here this is no place for a kid harry was sure that he was seeing him through his magical eye which must be seeing out of the back of his head since moody back was turned to him harry had a good mind to tell moody that he wasnta kid and was also the first and only person to have begun fighting the death eaters here but moody was distracted by the challenge posed by another of the enemy suddenly though harry felt himself being rammed to the ground as a death eater fell over him harry was about to roll him over and get up when the cold voice of severus snape spoke up get out of here potter here a portkey that will transport you to hogwarts and dontlinger here the order is only waiting for your exit in the thick of the battle no one noticed this exchange harry scrambled onto his feet the portkey safely kept in his pocket and made his way towards the refuge of honeydukes he knew it could prove potentially dangerous to use the portkey in the midst of battle since you never know who might latch on to you soon harry left behind the thick of the battle and neared his destination but he suddenly saw a shock of brown hair in front of him he knew who it was it was hermione she was duelling with a death eater and was doing okay but suddenly she tripped heavily against a stone and fell to the ground the death eater now in complete control directed his wand at his fallen opponent and fired the killing curse at her but suddenly he found the curse being blocked by a barrel which in turn shattered on being hit with the sell harry had seen hermione dilemma and come to her rescue he took the onus of the duel upon himself even as hermione tried to get up finally he succeeded in stunning his opponent and rushed to her side she was sitting on the ground clutching a very painful ankle harry i think i think my ankle is broken she told him dontworry he said let me help you out of here harry two voices called out to him from nearby harry looked around to see ron and luna running towards them a dementor tried to intercept their path but harry patronus took care of it ron luna harry said as they came i thought i told you to go back to hogwarts that you did luna answered but we didntpromise we would i really sorry mate ron began i should really have listened to but harry cut him off look guys he said this isntthe place to talk there is a battle going on for god sake let get out of here how can we do that luna asked hermione cannot walk can she dontbe silly harry said we are going to use a portkey he fished out the portkey that snape had given him from his pocket and the four of them placed their fingers on it the portkey was a broken wooden spoon it ll activate any second now harry said suddenly harry felt something coming at him from behind he turned his neck around to see a stunner being directed at him suddenly it hit him and the last thing he knew before losing consciousness was a jerk behind his navel am i dead harry asked into the air to no one in particular he opened his eyes to find himself in a very well lighted room bright sunlight reflected from all the walls and the ceiling of course you arentdead came a vaguely familiar voice from his right harry scrambled for his glasses a hand offered them to him and instantly even as he wore them the world came back into focus he looked to his right to the owner of the hand and his eyes very nearly dropped out of their sockets as he nearly fainted at who he saw dad he croaked james potter nodded harry looked around himself he was lying in a large bed in a brightly ventilated bedroom wardrobes and shelves lined the walls the wallpaper showed the posters of an unfamiliar quidditch team named the rochedale rovers the players were waving about at harry as he watched them intently to his right there was a chair on which sat james potter dad harry exclaimed again disbelieving his own eyes james nodded once again there was a hint of a smile at the corner of his lips and amusement in his voice but but this cannot be you you died harry stammered indeed i did james replied getting up from his chair and walking to a nearby window i am still dead he said as he looked out then am i dead harry asked no i already said you re not dead james replied then how how are you here harry asked getting up from the bed and joining his father at the window it looked out onto a large beautiful garden outside sprawling lawns great tall trees and beautiful flowers from primroses to bluebells to violets could be seen from the first floor window where they were standing at it just an illusion harry james explained i dontknow how it came to be or in what form all i know is that i found a shadow of myself getting called back from the realm of the dead to the realm of your mind i just an echo of my real form it is just an illusion harry heard the door to the room creak open and looked around standing in the doorway was his mother harry looked at her and once again realized that why so many people who had known her were quick to tell harry the fact that he had her eyes because lily eyes were the most expressive features of her pretty face as he now saw on her smiling countenance well you are finally awake then she said lovingly her eyes sparkling at her son mum harry said his eyes widening at the sight of her alive and walking yes of course lily said dontyou recognize me when you see me but you were are you alive or is this another illusion harry asked everything is an illusion here harry lily explained this is the realm of your mind and you are trapped in it how this illusion began weaving yourself into its web we do not know but this is the world as you want it to be as you envision it that why you are seeing us here because you are inside your own mind held as a prisoner hermione looked at the prostrate form of harry lying before her tears sprang up in her eyes as she noticed him lying peacefully on a bed in the hospital wing madam pomfrey was hustling and bustling all around him giving him a thorough check up so as to determine the source of his current predicament the four of them harry hermione ron and luna had landed in front of the entrance hall three of them had landed properly but harry landing had been a different matter altogether his limp body had slammed firmly into the ground they had rushed over to harry to find him unconscious guessing correctly that he had somehow been stunned hermione enervated him but to no effect this really surprised her she checked for a pulse and discovered a faint throbbing of harry veins in order we ve to get him to madam pomfrey hermione told ron and luna and conjured up a stretcher for him she had tried to keep her worry from creeping into her voice but she knew she had failed her friends appeared equally worried for harry safety they stretchred him to the hospital wing ginny was there in the entrance hall as was neville and they rushed to help the three of them once in the hospital wing even as ron told madam pomfrey about what had happened the nurse began hastily examining harry after she finished with the check up she informed them i ve never seen anything like this my entire life he has a high fever running almost as if he is delusional and under some spell did you perhaps happen to see if he was struck by a spell or not hermione looked at ron he shook his head at madam pomfrey and said no but it was neville who spoke up timidly this time he got a spell from you know who but it didntseem to make any difference to him the others stared at this revelation if the spell did make any difference i dontknow how madam pomfrey said grimly this looks beyond my skill to heal madam pomfrey ginny spoke is harry going to be all right the nurse didntreply instead she said i ll keep him here mr weasley please go and see if the headmaster has arrived bring him here immediately if he has then she proceeded to repair the break in hermione ankle which hermione ironically didntnotice ron nodded and went outside he rushed to the entrance hall and onto the grounds some students had informed him that there was a group gathered near hagrid hut twilight had set in stars had begun to appear smoke could be seen spiralling into the sky from the direction of hogsmeade village as a dark shadow rather like a pillar but ron attention was at the moment directed towards the direction of hagrid hut where about thirty wizards and witched were currently congregated just as he had been informed ron rushed in the middle and straight to dumbledore who was looking as calm as ever professor harry he is in the hospital wing unconscious madam pomfrey asked for you she cantsee what wrong voices broke out in the group at this but dumbledore didntheed them immediately he made his way towards the castle the group meanwhile looked on after them worried ron and dumbledore reached the hospital wing dumbledore immediately rushed to harry side he took his hand in his own and felt his forehead it was still burning hot professor what happened to him hermione asked dumbledore didntreply all the teens along with madam pomfrey looked on as the headmaster continued to feel at harry palm and his forehead he was uttering something under his breath but it made no effect whatsoever on harry the headmaster face looked graver by the second as if what he learned deeply disquieted him professor what the matter hermione asked again her voice tearful is he going to be alright dumbledore didntreply it was ron who spoke up angrily this time why dontyou answer her dammit why but dumbledore merely raised a hand in ron direction signifying the need for silence they watched on as the headmaster continued his examination at last he looked up and sighed he said to madam pomfrey poppy remember you must not use any magic whatsoever on him none and do not allow anyone else to do so dontworry about his fever it just an effect of the turmoil within his mind but remember no magic professor what happened to him ron asked dumbledore in a strained voice i dontknow for sure dumbledore replied all i can say for now is that his mind is in great turmoil and only harry himself can find a way to get himself out of this none of us can help him he took one last look at harry and said to ron luna and hermione come now it time for the dinner to begin i have to address the whole school before that i want to stay here hermione said definitively still looking at harry her voice devoid of any emotion she had felt hope balloon in her heart when she had seen dumbledore come in but even that had faded as dumbledore failed to cure harry her heart sank and she was languishing in the depths of despair now as she held harry hand in her own palm and caressed it with soft smooth touches madam pomfrey moved as if to dissuade her but dumbledore shook his head at her he said you d better come with us as well poppy i want the entire school to be in the great hall when i brief them of everything they moved out of the hospital wing at this dumbledore closed the doors softly behind them as they exited the ward hermione though didntnotice this she remained as she was and merely continued looking at harry please harry if you are listening she said silently feeling that his thoughts would reach him i love you very much and cantbear to be separated from you please come back harry please come back for me please do she got up from her seat and kissed his burning forehead she then went back to sitting beside him waiting over him and stayed as such the whole night when madam pomfrey came back she didntsay anything to her but after giving harry another check up she retired to her office it was only the next morning that hermione moved when madam pomfrey woke her up and told her to go to gryffindor tower and then her classes dumbledore walked into the great hall it was filled with all the students hogwarts played home to yet it lacked the usual cheer and merrymaking news of the attack had reached all corners of the school by now what with many of the older students actually bearing witness to the dementor attack rumours too had begun to take roots and it was now the headmaster task to dissipate them and to tell them the truth dumbledore went up to the staff table and stood before the entire school looking at all the eager and frightened faces of the audience he began alas it is my duty to inform all of you about the grievous events of today today lord voldemort there was a gasp at this throughout the great hall shook the very edifice upon which the existence of our world is based today the dark lord showed us the extent of his power you must have gotten the news of what happened at hogsmeade from the first hand accounts of many of our own number hogsmeade is no more now all the landmarks that once marked the village have now been razed to the ground the three broomsticks hog head zonko s honeydukes even the shrieking shack all the signs of the merry times that all of us had at some time or the other in the village have now been decimated about seventy people have lost their souls to the dementors many more have been hurt both in terms of physical hurt and the loss of family friends homes and possessions yet they have escaped with the most precious thing their lives and while those remain intact hope will never fade but besides hogsmeade there was also an attack on one of our most beloved places diagon alley the alley was attacked in much the same fashion at hogsmeade yet it suffered less damage in part due to the timely intervention of aurors these attacks on two of the most well known locations in our world have shown us what difficult times we face evil has not only risen but has now surrounded us like a dark cloud in such times it is only the strength of our minds that can help us fight it they say the mind is in its own place and can by itself make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven we have the power but we only need to find where it lies to use it justly lastly i must mention the role of one person in all these matters harry potter i have no doubt that most of you have seen or heard of what he did today at hogsmeade for those of you who have not i will tell you harry potter took it upon himself the onus of warding off the attack on hogsmeade and saving the people trapped in there he did so successfully and having done that he showed the kind of courage and strength that make us proud of being gifted with the powers of wizards and witches the very thing that embodies the ideals of this school he faced death eaters thwarted them and stood up to lord voldemort once again had it not been for him our losses at hogsmeade would have been much greater and many of us sitting at the moment in the great hall would have instead found themselves bereft of their lives and their souls he had a choice before him to choose his own safety or that of the others and he chose the just path no doubt you may be wondering where he is at the moment why he is conspicuously absent tonight the reason is that harry bravery did not come without a price at the moment he is in the hospital wing fighting another great battle possibly the greatest and most important battle he has ever fought that against his own mind so let us pray tonight that harry is given the power and the strength to protect his mind let us pray that he wins this battle and comes out of it even stronger as a hero who all of us have every reason to honour dumbledore raised his goblet and most of the students with the exception of many of the slytherins followed suit dumbledore sat down in his chair and sighed severus snape was sitting next to him tonight he said headmaster the dark lord calls dumbledore nodded snape got up and walked out of the great hall dumbledore stayed on a few more minutes before he too got up and left the students of hogwarts didntpay notice to this they were too busy talking about all that had happened and was said in the last twelve hours dumbledore walked to his office lost in his thought he entered and was immediately faced by professor elijah bickerstaff i didntsee you in the great hall tonight elijah dumbledore said bickerstaff observed dumbledore closely he felt as if the years had caught up finally with dumbledore the cloak of infinite energy and enthusiasm that he wrapped around himself all the time was gone he looked an old and broke man whose last gamble seemed to have failed miserably you look terrible he commented yes dumbledore said sighing much sorrow has befallen me tonight your brother aberfroth bickerstaff enquired mildly yes and that is not the least of my worries dumbledore said aberfroth lived a full life even though i did never quite understand him myself he did that well he made mistakes and enjoyed them it just that i would never wish such a death at the hands of a dementor to anyone where is he now bickerstaff asked at headquarters dumbledore replied as still as a stone as dead as a stump isntthere any way to bickerstaff began you know quite well there isntany at least not one that is known dumbledore replied what about potter bickerstaff asked i heard he has not awoken yet you heard right dumbledore answered he still unconscious any ideas as to what might have happened bickerstaff asked many dumbledore replied but none based on concrete proof kingsley told me that the ministry is contemplating giving a posthumous order of merlin to the boy already bickerstaff informed the headmaster dumbledore responded they are being ludicrous he is not dead will he be bickerstaff asked dumbledore pursed up his lips and turned to look out of the window it was dark outside not a star to be seen he thought can he stay alive after this bickerstaff rephrased his question is there any hope for him i dontknow dumbledore said i have sensed great anguish and query in his mind there is great turmoil in the end it is going to be the strength of his mind that going to determine if he passes this test or not this is exclusively the test to verify the steel of his mind he is ready isnthe bickerstaff queried if he gets through this he will be dumbledore replied bickerstaff smiled inwardly that all i wanted to know he said and got up to leave but before going he gave away a few last words of advice aberfroth died in a war dumbledore i hope you remember that i do dumbledore replied but that doesntchange the fact that he was my brother or that this war is of my making bickerstaff shook his head lightly not having got dumbledore meaning and quietly exited the office leaving dumbledore immersed in his thoughts how many are going to fall victim to this war dumbledore thought how much longer shall i have to endure this eternal torment only so long as you are capable of came the reply it was the day after halloween the daily prophet had been full of reports about the attack on diagon alley and hogsmeade which was expected harry hadntwoken up yet it was eight in the evening and hermione was sitting at harry bedside professor dumbledore had allowed her to be with him in the hospital wing except for the time of her classes and up to ten in the evening so here she was sting near him reading and keeping up with her school work yet not failing to let him be subconsciously aware of her presence harry had had a stream of visitors tonight all the da members had been here at some point of time or the other as also all those who harry had helped save at hogsmeade many of the younger gryffindors had also visited him everyone had asked how he was and hermione had answered with the same words there was no change in his condition from the previous day hermione heard the doors of the hospital wing open she presumed it was madam pomfrey the school nurse along with many other healers across britain had been summoned to st mungo urgently taking into consideration the number of injuries both minor and grievous that had occurred hermione even while not lifting her eyes off the book she was studying with one eye on the lookout for harry at the same time was mildly surprised that madam pomfrey had returned so quickly the sound of footsteps followed it was definitely more than one person she looked up to see malfoy goyle and crabbe walking towards harry bed what do you want malfoy hermione asked in a warning tone as they neared nothing with you mudblood malfoy spat back rudely anyway it not with you that i ve business tonight it with your dear potter malfoy ran his finger along harry forehead and then remarked nasty business with the fever isntit hermione flung malfoy hand away and shouted keep away from him malfoy immediately she found her arms being pinned backwards by goyle hermione tried to struggle but goyle had her firmly caught malfoy walked around the bed and stood before her his faces inches from her own hermione found the sight of his evil sneering face most repulsive malfoy sneered donttry to bite off more than you can chew mudblood anyways i was just here to give potter a message form the dark lord now since he is half dead i ll tell you what it is you can convey it to him in whichever way you will if he does wake up tell him it is not the dark lord spells that have waned it potter own defence the dark lord is all powerful potter can run but he can never hope to hide is that all that you have been told to say page boy hermione taunted steel glinting in her eyes draco slapped her across the face dontdare insult me mudblood he sneered or you ll find yourself in big trouble he turned away but then turned back again regaining his oily manner he inched closer to her his body almost touched hers he said softly on the other hand you might decide to give me something he looked at her body as he said this and started running his fingers up her arms and i ll give you something back in return something you want something like potter awakening hermione did not react with her words instead she shoved her knee hard in between malfoy legs there was heavy contact and the strike at a very sensitive spot meant that he hunched over in great pain howling and cursing at the same time goyle tried to twist her arm further but she stepped heavily on his feet he let go of her and started jumping about the place in pain of his throbbing foot he almost brought about an earthquake in his wake crabbe made a jump at hermione but she dodged him instead he struck a bottle containing some potion it fell to the floor and broke and the potion splattered all over on goyle robes which caught fire immediately now the witless baboon had to think about his burning robes aside from his throbbing feet before any of the three could get her again hermione took her wand from harry bedside table and pointed it right in malfoy face what were you saying again she asked malfoy felt a bead of sweat running down his eyebrows now will you go or shall i make you hermione threatened she saw that ron and neville were now standing in the doorway staring open mouthed at what was going on hermione glared at malfoy and his cronies they staggered to their feet and rushed out of the ward malfoy was still holding his painfully throbbing crotch ron and neville followed the slytherins departure with amused looks on their faces did we miss anything ron asked hermione replied not much what happened to them and why was malfoy holding his ron trailed off as they neared harry bed it seemed he d just realized hermione presence as that of a girl i kicked him there hermione answered nonchalantly oh my god hermione i dontknow how to say this but it really hurts down there ron said neville nodded in agreement even for malfoy that must hold true then i glad to know that hermione said and sat back in her chair whoa there ron exclaimed he must have done something serious he did hermione affirmed he delivered for harry a threat from voldemort he didn t ron exclaimed angrily though not before he and neville had flinched at the dark lord name hermione nodded he did what ron exclaimed looking ready to murder i ll kill that treacherous bastard calm down ron hermione said rolling her eyes you re being melodramatic ron glared at her but sat down nonetheless beside harry bed neville had already taken a seat madam pomfrey not here yet ron enquired he had been to quidditch practice earlier the entire gryffindor team except for harry had been on the pitch hermione shook her head in reply to his question you know he said dumbledore gave us permission to postpone the game against slytherin if harry isntfit till then he has asked the hufflepuffs to play them instead hermione nodded glumly harry would like hearing that when he wakes up hermione said looking at harry his closed eyes conveying a calm peaceful appearance you know neville said speaking up for the first time in a quiet voice i never really knew how much courage harry possessed till yesterday neville ron said we still dontreally know what happened after everyone was rescued everyone except you tell us what happened ron let him be hermione chided ron mildly she had noticed that neville had been refraining from broaching the subject it okay hermione neville interjected it isntas if it were a complete disaster and with that he began narrating but he hadntspoken more than a few words when the door opened yet again and luna and ginny walked in both were looking slightly harassed by the burden of studies that was being heaped on them the sextet that had fought once together in the department of mysteries had assembled and was complete once again how is harry now ginny asked as they came up and drew more chairs around his bed he does look peaceful doesnthe even though hermione was deeply worried by harry slipping into a coma like this she couldntdeny that what ginny had just said was true he looked like a baby relaxed and relieved from all his burdens yet hermione knew from what dumbledore had said that it was only a fa ade lots was going on inside his mind something that no one from outside could see ron chided ginny ginny keep quiet and let neville speak neville started speaking once again he spoke of how the people of hogsmeade were rescued and they were assailed by death eaters later he came to the part where harry challenged voldemort and faced him how he bargained neville life for the prophecy when he reached the part ron shot a glance at hermione she looked quite pale as he ended neville said i dontthink i can ever forget his face i ve never felt so frightened in my entire life i mean all those dementors there and i still felt like they could never compare in terror to him hermione regarded neville sympathetically ginny was looking at him strangely the five of them talked quietly among themselves about the goings on in the wizarding world at nine i e the time for curfew ron luna ginny and neville said their good byes to hermione and went to gryffindor tower hermione though chose to stay there beside harry till madam pomfrey returned after the others went hermione went back to her study but she could not concentrate a rarity in itself somehow neville words regarding lord voldemort still rand in her ears she leant forward and took harry hand into her own you re really brave harry she said softly show that courage once more now and please come back to me as hermione left the hospital wing that night after madam pomfrey arrival she was making her way back to gryffindor tower she had this weird feeling that something was wrong somewhere that she had missed something along the way suddenly it hit her she ran to the headmaster office at full speed and without bothering to knock entered his office directly dumbledore directed his attention towards her from behind his desk it was that spell wasntit hermione said her voice shaking in anger that spell caused it you know and yet you have not done anything the spell has no counter hermione dumbledore said calmly as she heard these words hermione heart sank once again she asked what does it do it makes the victim a prisoner of his own mind dumbledore explained he begins to live and dwell in an illusion that his mind dictates the illusion is normally so wonderful that the victim chooses to stay in it instead of freeing himself unless the victim himself breaks the shackles he forever remains a prisoner of his own mind has anyone succeeded in recovering hermione asked dreading the answer dumbledore shook his head will harry be okay she asked seeking the assurance that she so desperately needed i have no doubt he will dumbledore answered after all he proven history wrong before the headmaster voice was most sincere hermione shoulders drooped she said i sorry professor for disturbing you like this dontbe dumbledore said but i think it is time for you to go straight back to gryffindor tower hermione nodded and left the office without a word author note dearie me cough that was another big one with the million dollar question being where is harry dontworry cough cough cough it will be revealed in the next chapter visions of the dead thanks for all the reviews you have given to this story please stick with me till the end and yes enjoy reading cough p s i really do have a bad viral fever cough at the moment i hope it passes over like a cloud and i can get back to serious writing soon cough cough chapter nineteen back where he belongs harry stood in the centre of the room and scanned his peripheries it was his room in his home once again everything was as he would have liked it to be just like his room back in the potter summer home in australia harry had found out more about that home the day before i e the day when they had begun their long tiring journey back to england by airplane apparently it was at lily insistence that they were flying home instead of simply taking a trans continental portkey or using any other similar magical means of transport it was on that fight that james informed harry that he had visited the same house back in australia as a baby we bought it your mother and i james had informed him just before your birth in fact we lived there for quite some time to elude voldemort then why did we go back to england harry had asked distances only delay the inevitable james had answered we barely escaped an attack on the house there that when we came back to england and started thinking about the fidelius charm clearly you remembered something about the house albeit at the back of your mind the flight was very comfortable it was a british airways jet resembling those which harry remembered seeing on the dursley television it was also the first time that he had flown in an airplane in his life albeit in an illusion still harry didntimagine it to be much different in reality he decided that he preferred his own firebolt to the airplane any day the calm quiet air conditioned confines of the aircraft made for a very comfortable journey but it lacked the excitement the energy the thrills and the high adrenaline rush that soaring high on a broomstick brought about after finally reaching the house where they lived harry had spent the first few minutes scanning his house no his home he found everything to his utmost liking a thing he marked sub consciously in his mind again it was a proper home filled with warmth cosiness and love and completely opposite to the snobbish cleanliness and spotlessness of number 4 privet drive harry had almost felt his jetlag being taken away by the warmth of his home now twenty four hours hence he was in his bedroom lying down on bed looking up at the ceiling it was later afternoon and the rays of the setting sun illuminated the ceiling and painted it a most dazzlingly bright and brilliant red a shade that danced merrily and willingly where it fell creating the illusion of a single hue swallowing all colours and imparting its own feature to those fading colours harry got up and walked over to his work desk he scanned the table and saw there among other things a photo album the same one hagrid had given him never wondering once how it came by there even though this world was markedly different to the one he lived in harry picked it up and started leafing through it the old photos were there still but new ones had been added towards the end photos that spoke of harry life in this universe his journey from infancy to youth under the watchful and caring guidance of his parents he finished looking through the album and found that twilight had fallen yet harry made no move to switch on the light or the like he didntwant to drive the darkness away for now at the moment with the non existence of voldemort it didntseem so threatening and forbidding on the contrary it seemed like the ideal companion for introspective thoughts harry had often wondered about how his life might have been had his parents lived if he had lived in their loving care but now that he had his wish albeit in an illusion he didntknow what to think he was happy but there was still an empty space in his heart something conspicuously related to what lily had told him it spoke of something missing it spoke of something not being right it spoke of everything being unreal the thought that reality could never be so perfect constantly nagged and haunted him harry took up the photo album again and opened it as he had countless number of times before he didntgo to the more recent photos that existed in this world he lingered only on the ones he knew of and had earlier seen all the happy faces of the people in those photos sirius his parents and so many other nameless people stared back at him but harry found no solace in those photos no comfort come to think of it he didntknow now if the fact that his parents were dead affected him it wasntthat he didntlove them anymore it wasntthat he was not elated at having met them in flesh and blood it wasntas if he wasnthappy knowing more about them but it was again like what his mother had told him it would be his parents were an enigma he never could crack over the years as harry had grown more and more accustomed and proud to being called a living image of his father he also had felt himself becoming increasingly inclined towards fulfilling that assessment that desire had subsided on seeing his father with snape last year but it had never fully gone away but now that he had met james he realized that there was no way he could be like him he was different from him subtly different he might be a potter as well but he also had lily blood flowing through his veins after having met both of them now harry was beginning to realize that his parents were individuals as well not just his parents he contained them within himself but making himself an exact image of them wasntwhat they would ever have wanted today harry also knew all about how his parents died he had seen everything yet he felt so very empty there was grief yes but it was more understated what was more palpable was a sense of questioning the universal question why constantly bugged him he wanted to know the reasons for why the past panned out so and only then would he grieve for the ones he loves yet who he never knew harry now felt another presence in the room he looked across to the doorway to see his parents standing there looking at him on seeing him divert his attention towards themselves they entered the room and walked across to harry lily sat at the foot of the bed while james took a nearby chair everyone remained silent for a while as if each person was willing the others to break the silence finally harry spoke i ve been thinking i want to go back both james and lily nodded grimly lily he noticed had tears in her eyes even though she was trying her best to blink them back she told him that is a very wise decision dumbledore once told me harry said when i was looking into the mirror of erised and trying to lose myself in both of your images that it does not do to dwell in dreams i understand what he meant by that now but before trying to leave i ve only got one question for you why did you choose to die i dontknow james replied but i couldntstay there and watch you getting marked or killed in front of my own eyes i promised myself when i heard of the prophecy that i would protect you as long as i lived just watching you and holding you in my arms just loving you gave me the courage to do precisely that voldemort told me there was no need for you to die harry said turning to his mother why then you ll realize yourself harry when you become a parent lily said someday you ll realize yourself on that day at that moment you ll understand why i dontsee that moment coming harry said simply dontgive yourself less credit than you deserve harry lily said but i i just dontsee any hope in this battle harry countered do you know harry what remus reaction was when we told him about our discovery of his fear of the moon james asked he told us that there was no hope for his cure he told us to stop being his friends now that the truth was out lest he hurt us he told us that he was doomed to lead a life of loneliness and being regarded as an outcast do you know what we told him harry shook his head he didntraise his eyes to meet james we said as i am saying the same thing to you now james spoke with a tinge of nostalgia in his voice there is always hope i saw him duel you just before you just before you harry could not bring himself to say the word died you could not face up to him how can you expect me to do that because you re not like me james answered you are stronger more powerful and more humble even at your age you arenta rash person i dontthink sirius would agree on that harry said grimly trying to hold the overpowering flow of emotions that he was feeling behind the dams that he had erected within his mind even then the waters threatened to breach the divide and flow across sirius loss was a loss to everyone who knew him james said i wonttry to comfort you on that because i not the right person to do that you will always miss sirius but is that a reason to wallow in self pity i feel really guilty harry said finally after a silence i haventthought about sirius for a long time what with all that been going on with one thing following another it seems an insult to his memory that his godson doesntremember him you re talking harry james told him as if you never met sirius take a breather harry just go easy on yourself i ve some direct contacts up there he jabbed his finger towards the ceiling indicating the heavens and i know for sure that sirius is not too happy seeing you like this he winked his eyes at harry as he lifted his head to take a look at james harry offered him a watery sort of a smile i sorry he said finally i know i shouldnthave said all this but it just that i miss him so much and there are so many questions that i wanted answers to but were left unanswered after he died everywhere everything seems to hold his memory i couldn t he shook his head again as he broke off then remember those things and why they re associated with sirius lily said that the only way you can honour sirius memory and celebrate his life you know harry said giving a brighter smile this time i wonder if you re right hermione dumbledore they ve always given me advice i didntlike and ultimately proved to be right i wonder if that isntthe case with you there you go james said that much better harry nodded sleep now harry lily told him you never know what the morning might bring sleep all your doubts away for tomorrow you must wake to a new dawn a dawn of hope and justice no harry said not yet i just want to ask dad one more thing i may not be able to ask it again why did you hate snape so much why do you hate draco malfoy so much harry james asked in return malfoy is different he is a git and a death eater to boot harry said but snape is well he is a bit different from malfoy for one he working for us he on our side i dontthink it is much different james mused there are more similarities in both the cases than you know harry still as far as my mutual loathing of snape is concerned i not too proud of that i must admit that he is a slimy git and a foul person on the whole but it didntwarrant that sort of a treatment why dontyou tell him the truth james lily said no james said looking at lily disapprovingly come on it not going to hurt he big enough to know lily argued and anyway it was all a comedy of misconceptions wasntit james still didntlook too intent on telling harry whatever lily was asking him to tell so lily herself took up the onus and told harry your dad always hated snape but it positively turned into loathing from our third year why harry asked because he was a sneaky slimy git who hung around the worst sort of pure blood maniacs and slytherin royalty i ve ever seen and when not doing that he always used to sneak around us trying to get us caught for trouble and because lily chimed in as soon as james made it apparent that he wasntgoing to continue he entertained the thought from third to sixth years that snape loved me and that i reciprocated his feelings what harry almost choked he thought snape loved you that abominable it is lily agreed that what i told him after he spoke about what he thought evidently that was why his loathing of snape reached its crest during sixth year well i was a teenager then for heaven sake james said looking sheepish and trying to defend himself at the same time you do get the weirdest of thoughts and notions at that age i don t harry said simply that because your friends are sensible and arentonly concerned with how to pull off the next big prank on anyone and everyone imaginable they even managed to pull off one on dumbledore during our sixth year lily told harry what harry exclaimed he couldntimagine a scene where dumbledore suddenly was hung upside down from the ceiling or a statue or a suit of armour was dropped on top of his head that was our finest moment james proclaimed emphatically the last bow of the marauders the last bow harry raised his eyebrows yeah james replied your mum and i discovered our feelings for each other immediately after that it was she who caught us in the act of pranking on dumbledore before the whole great hall lucky to say i worked my charm and prevented her from telling on us you worked your charm lily said rolling her eyes i just did not want my new found boyfriend to be portrayed as a rule breaker although everyone knew he was precisely that she whispered conspiratorially to harry couldntmess with my chances of being appointed head girl could i anyway i made him promise after that not to do his audacious stuff again harry grinned but his face became serious again when he asked where does snape figure in all this after all this happened i realized that my initial reason for loathing snape was unfounded james answered needless to say i d found more and stronger reasons to hate him till them we never declared truce never are you proud of that harry asked his eyes fixed upon his father s trying to wrest an answer something that could ease his mind as to the nature of what he had seen in snape pensieve no james said i think i might have over reacted but then i was young and had not a care in the world you also happened to be a big headed prat whose boots were too big for his own feet lily suggested brightly right james nodded agreeing but that doesntexcuse you dad harry said james looked most uncomfortable at this but it was now lily who said look harry your dad isntproud of what he did but you have to realize that every person makes mistakes in his life everyone your dad i and even you we arentexceptions to this rule but if we let the past interfere with our present and future we d end up making the same mistakes again and again would that be wise snape hasntforgotten his end of the past harry argued but james seemed to regain a bit of his swagger as he said yeah but that why snape is the greasy haired lousy slimeball that he is james lily gave her husband a glare but harry simply grinned and said i guess you re right after all okay now that it settled lily said i d advise to turn in for the night we ll see what tomorrow may bring good night harry said as he watched his parents exit his room and close the door behind him and now what i need harry said to himself is to find a way to get out of here even as thoughts of leaving the delusional world took root and grew in harry mind he found himself drifting off as if he was slowly sinking into a state of slumber he saw hermione sitting by him patiently reading something time and time again her eyes left the text to take a sad glance in his own direction harry could feel the melancholy in her eyes and the fear behind the veil of sadness every time his eyes made contact with hers yet it seemed as though she wasntaware of his gaze of his sight harry himself seemed to be lying down as it felt to him from the way he was oriented there was the light of candles above him floating in mid air he looked past them and saw the ceiling he knew that ceiling the criss crossing cavernous architecture of ornately carved beams it was the hospital wing of hogwarts his cognizance of it a consequence of his innumerable trips to this wing of hogwarts castle his gaze drifted back to hermione she d now abandoned the book and was again looking at him she took his hand into her own and harry felt a calm pervade him at that touch he so desperately wanted to touch her to squeeze her hand back to re assure her and take away her fears even though he himself wasntaware of what they were but he somehow couldntbring himself to make that movement of a single spasm of his body he was all paralysed fixed in a particular place he could move neither limb nor lid suddenly the vision faded harry eyes flew open and he returned to his own delusional state he got up hurriedly only to find that there was no hermione no hospital wing nothing whatsoever it was just the room he supposed he should call his own his earlier thoughts were now pushed to a remote corner of his mind and the room looked bare lifeless and unwelcoming all at once as if an invisible barrier had been breached as if the very foundation stone of the building had been shaken and cast down the ground began to shake and the entire room the entire house seemed to collapse around harry the structure of beams and columns came crashing sown heavily harry watched silently as the fictitious walls of his self imposed illusion collapsed around him everything faded and all harry remembered was falling into a great deep dark abyss from where there was no return is he awake yet are you sure he moved a voice broke into harry thoughts as he regained his consciousness i sure ron another voice spoke i saw him move he was trying to say something harry mind slowly got back to its normal state of functioning he realized that he knew those voices yes he knew them well his eyes fluttered open only to see the concerned faces of ron hermione neville and madam pomfrey hovering over him but that was pretty much the only thing he glimpsed since his sight was obscured by a multitude of bushy brown hair as hermione shrieked in joy and threw herself on her prostrate form hermione let him breathe for god sake ron told her strongly even as madam pomfrey shrieked miss granger disturbing a patient like that i thought you had more sense hermione seemed to realize what she had just done and she detached herself from harry slowly even as she looked considerably abashed as she stood up harry seemed to be pained by something on the right side and he winced visibly madam pomfrey immediately noticed this and she rushed over to harry side to give him a thorough check up she found that harry was physically quite okay except for a few bruises here and there and an especially large one on the right side of his torso other than that he seemed to be fine except for a palpable weakness in his manner as madam pomfrey did her work harry said to hermione thanks for the welcome hermione hermione looked apologetic while ron merely guffawed at the pronouncement he said she completely mental harry she is mr weasley madam pomfrey turned to ron and chided this is a hospital wing not your quidditch pitch if neither you nor miss granger can control yourselves i suggest you leave immediately no madam pomfrey harry protested these were the first words that he spoke since he opened his eyes let them stay ron and hermione beamed at him however the only thing that harry noticed was that the concern reflected in hermione eyes seemed to have lessened considerably as madam pomfrey asked harry to turn to the other side he caught neville eyes neville was just sitting there quietly upon seeing harry he gave him a reassuring smile and harry smiled back at him it seemed that neville understated reaction lent some sanity that offset ron and hermione excited reactions finally madam pomfrey was done she told neville as if she thought that the other two healthy students in the room werentin a state to follow her instructions keep a watch on mr potter here mr longbottom i shall go and inform the headmaster about him neville nodded while madam pomfrey bustled out of the room and out of the hospital wing doors which she took care to shut behind her even though harry felt weak his mind didntseem to have been addled unnecessarily on the contrary it seemed to him that his mind had become sharper more capable of focus and concentration than before it struck him really odd that madam pomfrey should leave the hospital wing to just inform dumbledore at a time when she had a patient to take care of he wondered why she had not used the floo to get a hold of dumbledore something was going on he knew it it was as if he could smell it but harry thoughts were interrupted by hermione sitting on the side of his bed and asking him how are you feeling harry she took his hand into her own and gave it a squeeze harry was relieved that hermione was the first one to ask her a question here she knew him the best and was sensible enough to bring up any question about what he had done for all these days later ron he knew had he asked the first question would definitely have plunged headlong into the very question he didntwant to answer yes harry knew he d been unconscious and in the hospital wing for some time now how he knew he had no idea but even the looks on his friends faces attested to the fact that his feeling was true how long have i been unconscious harry asked to all three of them in general two months ron said we thought we had lost you neville said in a low voice but dumbledore kept us going on and hoping he told us that you would return after your work was complete harry nodded he had some problem remembering things right now so he let them be it was as if his mind had been shaken up completely and all its contents shuffled up down left and right in any direction imaginable he didnthave any problem processing his thoughts it was his memory that was giving him problems maybe i ve amnesia he thought will have to talk to dumbledore about all this how are you feeling harry hermione asked still looking slightly worried okay i guess harry said trying to sit up against the headboard just a bit sore on the right side you are going to be okay arentyou ron asked harry nodded i hope so he said by this time madam pomfrey came in and told harry friends the headmaster has asked all of you to depart now to gryffindor tower since mr potter seems to have woken up all right and he needs his rest tonight the headmaster would like to talk to you in his office though before you return but hermione opened her mouth to argue otherwise but madam pomfrey was not one to listen she said i already gave you more liberty at the headmaster request by allowing to stay here all these nights now go hermione looked defeated but she knelt down and kissed harry on the cheek good night harry she said good night harry neville said as well ron was also about to say the same and return but harry stopped him ron harry said a word mate mr potter you need your rest madam pomfrey looked scandalous that her order should be defied within her hospital wing please madam pomfrey harry pleaded his case it wontbe long i promise i just want to talk privately with ron hermione looked questioningly at them but didntsay anything she and neville left the ward while ron stayed back harry said ron i wanted to ask you how hermione has been she isntlooking too good ron gave a low whistle and replied not too good well harry you should have seen her she has been a complete wreck she hasntbeen eating anything she has been crying all the time and she has been working herself harder than ever one day she just collapsed in the common room fainted she was here in the hospital wing for a week and madam pomfrey advised her to take it easy but she has been just over working herself if she doesntstop i will bet she would have just gone mad soon if you hadntcome back today no harry she has been hit very badly by all this you will have to make it up to her i will i promise harry said as they made to walk out of the classroom he stopped suddenly and putting his hand on ron shoulder said ron thanks mate thanks for telling me what i wanted to know ron grinned at him anytime mate anytime he said but then his grin faded and he said are you sure you are okay harry you like you ve been crushed under a mountain or something no harry said now that i here i think i ll be alright what happened mate ron whispered as if it were a question he didntdare to ask what really happened to you i ve never heard of someone just go off into a deep coma like that and just wake up after two months i dontknow what happened harry said i dontremember ron raised his eyebrows i dontknow how to say this harry said maybe it the weakness or something else i think i could do with some rest right now ron nodded and said good night mate it good to have to back thanks ron harry said i glad to be back harry looked to his side he had heard a movement there and more importantly he d sensed a presence immediately wary he put on his glasses from beside his bedside table and put them on trying to find a clear light that could pierce the darkness it was a couple of hours past midnight harry had tried to sleep but couldntdo so his mind was too full of thoughts he was too confused every time he tried to jog his memory of what had happened during the last two months his thoughts became muddled and he became increasingly frustrated dumbledore had come down to meet harry after his friends had left harry still remembered that conversation how are you feeling harry dumbledore had asked all right i guess harry replied just a little sore anything else the old wizard asked his eyes seemingly piercing harry very soul no harry had started actually yes it my memory i cantseem to remember anything from the past two months i seem to know some things that i didntknow i knew but every time i try to remember what happened after the hogsmeade attack my mind just becomes blank dumbledore nodded his eyes twinkling i wouldntworry about it if i were you he had said you deserve a rest now try to go easy on yourself you ll soon find that it will speed your recovery but what about trying to remember harry had asked you dontbelieve that i can go around everywhere not knowing what i might have been up to for the last two months do you patience harry dumbledore had advised you ll remember everything slowly but surely just donttry to ask too much of yourself you seem to have undergone the most tiring and the most stringent of experiences i d advise you to rest and try to regain your lost energy before you decide to return to the school daily activities i daresay you ll need all the energy you can muster where is my wand harry had asked he d found he was not in possession of his wand ever since he woke up it safe dumbledore had answered and in my possession it my sincere belief that you should not use magic for the next week or so neither should any magic be used upon you your magical reserves are at an all time low at this point of time and i dontwant you to suffer from any possible ill effects of using magic as it is in your condition it becomes too tiring to cast even the simplest levitating spell do you understand harry had just nodded dumbledore had said then i ll leave you now we ll talk later and with that he d departed from the hospital wing leaving harry more unsatisfied than ever he hadntbeen able to rest as dumbledore had suggested he should it was too cumbersome he felt like there was an invisible barrier within his mind that blocked anything and everything he tried to do his mind was working overtime thinking processing never once ceasing its actions it had never been so active before and harry didntquite know how to deal with it all of a sudden before his very eyes he saw hermione appear out of thin air she had his own invisibility cloak in her hand hermione harry exclaimed you gave me a big fright sorry harry she said looking contrite i just wanted to see you i took the invisibility cloak from your dorm i ll return it to you dontworry about it hermione harry said i dontthink there is anything i own which i ll not want to share with you except of course the burden of the prophecy and enmity with the dark lord hermione looked stricken at this mere jest harry this is not funny she said i dontlike what you said sorry then harry said sincerely anyway help me here will you if i lie anymore i think i ll go mad seeing only this ceiling hermione helped prop harry against the pillows so that he was now sitting upright on the bed against the headboard she herself took a seat beside him so what are you doing here in the middle of the night harry asked her i told you i came to see you hermione answered but i thought you d be asleep so did i harry said i mean you should be in your dorm right now if anyone catches you very well hermione said and got up i ll go then if you do not want me to disturb you as she turned around to go harry grabbed her by the hand and said i didntmean i dontwant you here sit down please hermione i missed you so much that i cantbe near you enough hermione sat back down and gently took hold of her hand harry simply looked at her you ve changed harry yes you have changed quite a bit hermione told him sighing as she said so no i haven t i am still the old harry potter who is madly in love with his best friend and the cleverest witch around hermione granger so you see nothing has changed harry protested it the way you are behaving harry it the way you are taming your temper already you would have been frustrated at no one telling you about all the news and everything else but you arentshowing even a small bit of that trait it the way you are caring about me no harry you ve obviously changed whatever you say but i still care about you i still love you i am not saying that you don t it just that you are well how should i put this it seems you have undoubtedly gained some powers i feel it in your gaze i feel in your smile if i did harry said i dontremember a thing where have you been harry hermione asked and dontgive me that shit about being here in the hospital wing i know better than that where did your mind wander all this while i dontknow harry replied as i said i dontremember a thing i feel like i ve got this barrier inside of my mind that is preventing me from accessing my own memories how hermione asked i dontthink we should talk about me right now harry said dumbledore told me not to think about it he said that everything would sort itself out hermione nodded she trusted dumbledore as she trusted harry there would be a reason as to why the old headmaster had given harry that particular advice she looked at her boyfriend the one she loved there seemed to her to be a light around him an aura it was this aura that sparked off her curiosity harry looked at her closely as they stood near each other two months of sorrow and unparalleled hard work had undoubtedly taken a toll on her but she still looked incredibly beautiful to him harry shuddered at the thought of how sexy she looked as they looked at each other harry felt the sense of longing growing within him he desperately wanted to say something to her and so his mouth formed a few words for him hermione ron told me that you haventbeen all that well no believe me i ve been fine dontworry about me she replied but she was also pleased that he had asked about her even though it wasntonly about a few hours since he had woken up you should learn to take care of yourself you know even though i might always be around you really should you should show the world that you are hermione granger not just harry potter girlfriend and love interest you are becoming self conceited you know that harry potter hermione said as she playfully nudged him in the ribs however her laughter turned to self reproach when she saw harry wincing at the nudge harry i sorry i really really sorry she said over and over again tears welling up in her eyes it okay hermione harry said i just a little bit sore that all i knew you always would be extraordinary harry hermione said what with your history the prophecy and all that and i had imagined that you would stop thinking about me or our friends after that you would stop taking interest in these matters and would deem them too trivial a part of me feared that such a happening would take you away from me but here you are having already reached that stage and yet you still care for me but that is a good thing isntit yes and that is why i fear it i hate this but i think i am getting too much dependent on you your absence really crushed me harry and this was only for two months i just hate to think what would have happen if we cannot be together i am scared of this harry hermione look at me he said and she looked into those emerald green eyes that she had come to adore the very effect of looking straight at them was intoxicating harry continued hermione i dontknow how this is going to end i dontknow if i am going to survive but i promise you one thing that i will always be there for you to help you to protect you to comfort you and to make you smile i promise you that you can always count on me to be there by your side in all times and i promise you all this because i love you i have always loved you and i promise you that i will always love you not only in this life but also in death and even beyond that harry saw tears glistening in hermione eyes as he listened to him saying all these wonderful things suddenly she could take it no more she broke down and began crying into harry chest saying oh harry i am sorry you needntbe hermione harry consoled her i understand how you are feeling you dontneed to feel sorry with that harry drew her near him she was wearing an almost see through pink nightdress that clung to her body in all the right places and made her look extremely seductive it was clear that she intended to either seduce him or that she had decided to visit him in the greatest hurry harry bet on the latter even though he would have liked the first option equally harry could barely contain his longing as he saw her in that form to him she was a goddess whom he had to protect nurture and love he grinned sheepishly at her and took her soft hands gently into his own he began kissing her first softly but then more passionately she responded and soon their lips were locked together as one their bodies sent waves as their lips made contact they made low moaning sounds full of pleasure as they experienced each other for the first time in days suddenly harry felt another sharp stab of pain in his right side this brought him to his senses just before they lost control harry pulled back and said hermione we need to stop here as much as i love you i dontthink we can continue i dontthink we are ready yet besides i dontthink i quite in shape hermione giggled she looked slightly disappointed but she understood she wanted him and he wanted her it had been clear from the very first time when they had confessed their love to each other it had been their decision to refrain from doing anything that they might have had to regret later on and it was necessary that they stick to that they pulled away from each other and hermione got up dontgo harry said stay her tonight the whole night hermione said softly harry are you okay harry nodded and said i just need some rest hermione seemed to understand she used her wand to enlarge the bed slightly and snuggled in close to harry making sure to hold him on his pain free side he still clutched her hand tightly as if he was afraid to let her go she lay down beside him and asked harry do you need something he did not reply at once but after some time said i want to rest hermione i want to drop down and sleep like i once might have without dreams to haunt me and without potions to help me be peaceful i want to rest normally once hermione as he said so a tear trickled down his cheek and hermione felt her heart reach out to her boyfriend she pulled him closer to herself and said gently sleep harry i am here i wontlet anything happen her words seemed to calm him down and he soon settled into a deep dreamless slumber feeling so protected for the first time in years he slept peacefully that night nestled against her warm body it was the first time he had slept so peacefully since his fourth year author note so there you have it the next chapter i hope you like it there are a lot of questions raised in this chapter of which more than a few will be answered in the next one entitled the ancient secret of war on another parallel track i ve started my own fanfiction group on yahoo it an open invitation to anyone and everyone if they want to join it named mordorianarmy the url is http groups thanks for reading bye for now chapter twenty one scent of treachery he is awake a high pitched voice said to harry obviously trembling in fear awake very interesting harry said all he could see was darkness and a silvery shiny mirror of some sort it was filled with mist that harry eyes could not penetrate though the voice was clearly coming from within the mirror itself you ve done well my apprentice harry said you shall be duly rewarded when you meet me harry suddenly found himself awake again as someone was trying to shake him out of his dream he looked up to see neville trying to wake him up neville harry exclaimed he put on his glasses and looked across to the wall clock on the other side of the ward it was still early afternoon and the sunlight filtered through the windows lighting the ward with variegated hues and even succeeding to some extent in lessening the heavy winter chill it seemed to harry that the light near the windows was even brighter and he guessed that it was the sunlight getting reflected by the snow it was now his fourth day in the hospital wing and had been told earlier that it was the first time the sun had peeked through the snow laden clouds in the past very many days harry are you okay neville asked anxiously and stuttering a lot i thought you were having a fit or something so i woke you up harry smiled at the question and sat up in his bed he had been allowed to walk around within the ward but had tired himself soon he was getting better by the minute but he hadntyet regained his full physical strength harry said a lot of people have asked me that question in the past few days i fine just a dream really nothing big harry didntvoice his feeling to neville that it was a vision not just any regular dream so how come you re not in class at the moment harry asked i free for the day now neville said actually hermione told me to check on you since she has arithmancy at this time she couldntcome over at lunch since she had a meeting with mcgonagall honestly i ve told her i not a baby who needs looking after harry said rolling his eyes while neville gave a grin where is ron harry asked after a moment of silence he said something about having a headache neville answered ginny really cross with him tells me he been working the entire quidditch team like mad especially with the next match coming up harry nodded his absence had resulted in a complete overhaul of the quidditch cup schedule with help from professor mcgonagall ron had managed to postpone gryffindor first two games the first game now was to be against slytherin the next week and the one against hufflepuff three weeks later the finale against ravenclaw was to be held at the normal time on the weekend after the easter break harry neville broke in into harry ponderings can i ask you something harry nodded what did the prophecy say neville asked again harry was shocked he hadntexpected neville to ask this i afraid i cantanswer that neville i dontthink you re supposed to know he said saying the thing that came first into his mind donttell me what i supposed to know or do i ve had a lifetime of that neville spoke indignantly and harry marvelled at the harsh tone of his voice i was there with you when you took the prophecy i had it in my hands before it slipped and broke in front of my own eyes you bargained and bought my safety from you know who during the hogsmeade attack by using it as insurance and still you say that i not supposed to know it something that only a few people know about harry reasoned voldemort wants it desperately he ll never hear it from me neville assured harry well then it appears that i must tell you after all it concerns you closely also harry began ignoring the look of surprise on neville face it says that the one who has the power to vanquish voldemort was born nearly fifteen and a half years ago towards the end of july with his parents having opposed and escaped him thrice it says that voldemort would mark this child as an equal and the child would have power that the dark lord does not know of either of these two bearers of the prophecy can live while the other survives one must die at the hand of the other and who is that child neville asked holding a breath harry replied dumbledore told me that the prophecy could have equally applied to either you or me both our parents worked against voldemort and escaped him on three occasions however the attack on my parents home their murder and the existence of this scar means that i was the one who was marked so that means you are the only one who can defeat you know who neville squeaked fear palpable in his voice looks that way harry concurred i must either kill him or be killed myself there is no other path how did it come to be like this neville asked to no one in particular it was all a choice voldemort made while choosing one of us harry said i guess he saw a mirror of something like himself in me a half blood and all that stuff well it is now futile to think over all this what is done is done it my fate now and my burden i would not wish this fate upon anyone least of all on one of my friends you ve got enough on your plate to be going on with how do you manage to stand up to him harry how neville whispered the question after many moments of internal debate i always thought that the death eaters were the most dangerous wizards every time i see my parents and the state they are in i get the same thought over and over again but he he was different more terrible than i had ever imagined we can fight death eaters we can drive away the pall of dread that the dementors cast by using a patronus but no one could ever harm him nothing could ever work against him that was what i felt when i saw him that is still how i feel how do you stand up to such evil because of the knowledge that i must harry said sometimes fear makes things appear bigger and more frightening than they really are try and overcome that fear and half you battle will be won for starters try saying his name it really helps as dumbledore told me once fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself i sorry you have to suffer this neville said dontbe harry responded it not your fault not mine not anyone else s it voldemort fault i only wish i d known all these things that i now know beforehand that way i wouldnthave gone into the ministry last year nor would i ve taken all of you with me sirius wouldnthave gone to save us then and he d still be alive now i didntknow sirius black was on our side neville said i sorry you lost him harry nodded i mean at least i know where my parents are even if they dontrecognize me i can meet them when i want but you cannot do that there was a faraway look in neville eyes it was the first time harry heard him really talk of his parents neville continued you know i sometimes wish that they were dead i love them and that why i cantbear to see them in the state they are in almost as if they are neither living nor dead almost as if they feel nothing at least if they die i d know that they are free from all bonds i d feel sure that they are alive again that they are free to feel again even if it is in another world cantthe healers do anything harry asked the healers tried everything in their power neville replied gran told me it was six long years before they gave up now they ve even stopped hoping for a miracle there is always hope harry said i ve realized that yes i have there was a brief silence in which both the boys lost themselves in their own respective trains of thought it was neville who spoke first i want to help you harry but i dontknow how i can do that just try being a friend through all times it was not harry who had replied it was professor dumbledore striding across the length of the ward to where harry and neville were seated his blue eyes were twinkling once again behind his glasses and harry was sure he could see pride reflected on his face as he walked he repeated just try being friends through all times you ll find it the biggest help we might have dark times ahead but camaraderie and friendship can help us survive professor dumbledore neville exclaimed surprised at the sudden appearance dontbother with the name neville i know who i am he said and coming over he placed a hand on the young man shoulder i ve known your parents for a long time and i for one am confident that whether they realize it or not they are very proud of you and so is your grandmother after you told her about the department of mysteries incident over the summer she wrote in saying how she felt that her wish of seeing you as an auror like your father is going to come true but she asked me not to tell you lest it should make you shall we say vain and arrogant so donttell her i told you what she told me not to tell you neville went a little red at the lavish praise heaped on him by the greatest wizard in the world harry however paid no heed to this for his mind was enraptured by a similar statement he d heard someone else close to his heart say we re proud of who you ve become harry even if we had the chance to raise you ourselves we would have wanted you to be exactly like this well harry neville got up and said in the process regaining harry attention i ll get going now see you later harry returned the words yeah neville bye neville walked out of the ward and harry was left alone with dumbledore the old wizard observed you ve many loyal friends harry i dontknow why though harry replied with half a grin i dontknow what they se in me still i not complaining they are here for me always only i dontknow what i can give them in return friendship is not about giving and taking that what you d call business dumbledore explained it is the realization that there are things more important than pure logic your friends love you they stick by you because they want to they help you in all circumstances because they know the real you i hope so harry said i just wish i wasntso dangerous to be around you are not dangerous harry dumbledore said you are perilous yes not in the least due to the powers of the white wizard that you now possess but that not different from many other things in the world dontremind me of that harry said dully i still dontknow whether to believe all you said or not i dontfeel any different from inside i dontfeel a change then we ll wait till such time when you begin to do that dumbledore said for now at this he delved into the pockets of his robe and brought out a wand which harry immediately recognized here your wand you re free to leave the hospital wing and perform magic if you desire only dontdo that magic in the corridors or mr filch will no doubt have some things to say to me he gave harry a twinkle of his eyes harry grinned and took his wand he cast a levitating charm on the neighbouring bed and it rose up in the air very impressive dumbledore observed smiling and one more thing before i go harry i d very much like you to take up extra lessons in transfiguration occlumency duelling and everything else that will help you prepare i had been meaning to ask you ever since the beginning of the year but you could say that i was waiting for this moment you knew this would happen harry asked i had a feeling it would dumbledore replied cryptically and yes of course i hoped now i must be off i ve to tell poppy that you are ready now to leave her care i daresay she ll insist upon giving you another thorough check up before letting you do that might i also add that she has grown rather fond of having you here in her care harry did not dare figure out what the last remark had meant he saw dumbledore get up and walk away all of a sudden he asked the old professor the question that was now foremost in his mind sir is there no hope for neville parents dumbledore paused and slowly turned around harry could see sorrow being reflected in his eyes what do you think dumbledore asked in return what do you feel harry looked lost at the question and could merely shrug his shoulders dumbledore carried on i think it is as you told neville there is always hope miracles do occur in our lives every day that we pass on this planet every bit of joy that we feel every bit of sorrow everything is a miracle in its own right so knowing that miracles do exist you could always hope for more couldntyou harry walked out of the hospital wing later that evening accompanied by hermione as professor dumbledore had predicted madam pomfrey did indeed give harry another head to toe examination before she let him leave as they walked harry bumped right into watch out potter where you re going draco malfoy spat you wouldntwant me to hex you into a coma for two months again would you i sure the people who look up to you as their saviour from the dark lord would want that to happen now would they malfoy added the last part with an all knowing smirk harry was too lost in thought owing to malfoy last statement to attempt to retaliate he stood there thinking even after the slytherin had passed hermione gently touched him on the shoulder he knows harry spoke in a barely audible whisper as if to himself who harry hermione asked and what malfoy he knows harry said and if he does then so does then so does voldemort hermione we must go see dumbledore immediately hermione nodded and they set off at once harry reached the gargoyle which immediately leapt aside on receiving the password harry didntknock but barged in directly does voldemort know of the prophecy dumbledore looked up at harry he had a questioning look on his face malfoy knows i sure then that voldemort knows too harry said dumbledore nodded i sure then that we ll get the news soon enough why dontboth of you sit down and make yourself comfortable it might prove to be a long wait are we waiting for someone harry asked not bothering to comply to the suggestion yes dumbledore replied harry sank back into a nearby chair will anybody tell me what is going on here at the moment hermione asked harry knew that simply not knowing what was going on must be driving her crazy he looked towards dumbledore and hope he d answer that question i afraid you will have to answer it yourself harry dumbledore said i am as much in the dark as hermione is harry began i told neville about the prophecy earlier today from what malfoy said to me outside the hospital wing i think he overheard us somehow and now knows the prophecy i ve no doubt he would have informed his father first up and he and he in turn would have informed voldemort hermione completed the sentence but couldntdraco be lying taking a shot in the dark maybe harry shook his head i dontthink so harry said i felt it in his look in his demeanour he knows it for sure you seem to have assumed that mr malfoy is working for voldemort dumbledore observed of course he is harry replied heatedly his is a clan of death eaters they are all evil dontbe childish in your judgement harry dumbledore said calmly your hate for mr malfoy seems to be clouding your judgement feel what you ve seen you ll reach the conclusion soon enough and i daresay your conclusion then will be much different from your current conclusion and what may you have concluded harry asked not bothering to hide the sarcasm in his voice dumbledore answered however as if he d not felt harry implied words that mr malfoy is not the spy here this worries me the most harry more than any news i ve heard over some time now i sure you are correct in your assumption that voldemort knows of the prophecy now but it cannot be through mr malfoy so how does he know who is the spy in our midst you might be ignoring the obvious in letting go of malfoy professor hermione said quietly think rationally hermione dumbledore said i daresay that you of all people should know how unlikely the obvious can be so i advise both of you for now wait who are we waiting for harry asked the headmaster severus dumbledore replied simply he was called away earlier in the evening voldemort has summoned his followers something is moving what is professor snape doing there hermione asked dumbledore didntreply hermione didntknow about snape past i asked what professor snape is doing with voldemort hermione repeated her question he been our spy hasnthe it was harry who spoke intently looking at dumbledore who was seated serenely behind his desk harry did now know where he was getting this information from it was like someone or something was supplying him with the required information he been our spy for the last sixteen years and he still is yes he is dumbledore said tiredly withdrawing himself from harry gaze that all you can know or all you need to know for now there is no point in asking me for more information the last remark seemed to be meant exclusively for harry but hermione began it was apparent that she was in the dark and did not like it at all it seemed to her that she was witnessing the contest of two wills of harry and professor dumbledore hermione knew that professor dumbledore was much more powerful and wiser not in the least because he was older but it was strangely apparent that it was harry who was winning the duel of their wills no hermione again it was harry who spoke dumbledore was still maintaining an impassive silence it something between professor dumbledore and professor snape professor dumbledore is right we should not ask him for further information on this a wise suggestion harry professor dumbledore seemed to agree as the twinkle came back into his eye now hermione if you dontmind could you please call professor bickerstaff here by the looks of it it seemed to harry that hermione did mind but it was also apparent that she did not want to say no to dumbledore either so she nodded and giving harry a curious look exited the headmaster office as soon as she went out dumbledore said to harry you ve much to learn harry you might have won the contest tonight but your real enemies in the war will be much tougher to break what are you talking about harry asked bewildered i talking about how you read my thoughts accurately dumbledore said i did what harry exclaimed not quite believing his ears you read my thoughts regarding professor snape dumbledore explained it was evidently an involuntary form of leglimens since you did not realize it yourself it must be one of the new traits you are beginning to develop but you ll be required to hone your skills further i felt malfoy emotions today when i met him harry said i could feel the anger he feels for me and the loathing it was quite similar for neville i could almost visualize the questions he had in his mind even before he asked them yes that is a natural progression the first step towards being a successful leglimens dumbledore said you ve begun feeling others emotions and the intensity of their thoughts with proper training you will be able to sift through them and decipher the precise meaning of those thoughts and emotions who will train me harry asked i will dumbledore answered without hesitation he got up and walked around to where harry was standing he placed a hand on the young man shoulder and said sincerely i dontknow if i ve told you this harry old age seems to weaken the memory somewhat but i will do all that is there in my power to help you fulfil the prophecy you ve always done that harry responded always and i dontintend to stop now dumbledore said smiling his eyes seemed a little moist so what do you want to train me in harry asked after a while advanced transfiguration a bit of duelling and self defence dumbledore answered but most importantly mind control and wandless wizardry we ll decide on other things later as and when your abilities manifest themselves if you are ready we could start next weekend after your quidditch match i daresay mr weasley will want to work his seeker very hard before that harry nodded why did you call professor bickerstaff he asked elijah is a very wise man and a very capable wizard as i have no doubt you think yourself dumbledore answered he been an integral part of our entire decision making in the order i wanted to inform him of severus situation what about professor mcgonagall harry asked have you told her i ll tell her when the time comes dumbledore answered harry didntargue he knew dumbledore always had his reasons after a while harry spoke you know i get this feeling that you sent hermione to fetch professor bickerstaff because you wanted to talk to me alone what makes you think that dumbledore asked his eyes twinkling merrily i told you harry said i got this feeling well you are correct to some extent he said although i did want to talk things over with elijah as well let try something harry dumbledore said why dontyou come over here by the window harry did as was asked of him now look out from over here dumbledore said from over his shoulder his hands motioning towards the dark outside the window can you see anything harry strained his eyes he saw nothing no he shook his head try concentrating on the thoughts of one person someone you ve met dumbledore suggested harry tried concentrating on the first person who came to his mind sirius as if on cue dumbledore said that person needs to be alive harry nodded and concentrated on the image of lupin slowly he felt his vision get obscured by a certain fuzziness he concentrated harder which meant that the mist before his eyes cleared he could now see a warm room with fire lit in the grate there was a table near the fire and on it was seated lupin harry sucked in his breath as he saw how real it looked he tried to concentrate further to take a closer look at what the last surviving marauder was doing but to no avail no sooner did he try to do it than the mist began closing in again and his sight of lupin began slipping from his gaze as if he was trying to hold fine grains of sand in his grip which slipped at a faster rate the more he tried to hold them there finally his eyes perceived the darkness of the night again good dumbledore said may i know who you tried to see remus harry said only for a few moments though it was all blurred and quick i couldntunderstand a thing very few can dumbledore said it is very difficult nigh impossible to maintain a telepathic vision but even glimpses of what you can see and who you can see can help you immensely in many cases now why dontyou try to focus on another person someone who doesntquite elicit the same feelings in you as remus does harry thoughts immediately turned to snape after all the potions master was the reason that he had to endure this wait in the headmaster office he tried concentrating but to no avail snape seemed to have lost himself somewhere beyond the extent of harry gaze harry realized the futility of his efforts and changed his choice of person he concentrated his mind on the snake like image of lord voldemort face nothing happened at the beginning then suddenly harry found himself getting sucked into a void his scar started burning like it so rarely had something like he had experienced that fateful night in the department of mysteries when voldemort had tried to possess him he was merged in body and soul into the coils of a snake like creature harry almost forgot who he was what he was where he was he had lost all his sense of orientation he was under the power of a creature with many coils twisting coiling and uncoiling the many folds of its skin however this time around he felt no pain only a sense of shock at the sudden occurrence he tried to wrest his mind away from the creature as he felt himself enclosed by a certain barrier almost as if he were being somehow trapped finally the grip of those coils loosened and harry could feel the fresh air and the life within him again chapter three with hermione are they okay are my parents okay hermione repeated her question to dumbledore who wore the same sad and tired look that he had on his countenance when he informed mr and mrs diggory of their son death why are you not saying anything i am asking you if my parents are okay hermione reiterated her question once again and this time harry felt her getting angry at dumbledore finally dumbledore turned around went to a nearby window and looking out said no they are not but they will be harry did not get what dumbledore meant by the looks of it neither did hermione professor what does that mean harry asked him what this means is that miss granger parents are alive but they are still in a very critical condition dumbledore replied hermione started sobbing at this harry rushed over to her and put his arms around her she wouldnthave to go through this ordeal alone however she appeared to regain her composure a bit later she told dumbledore i want to see them dumbledore nodded he said very well please follow me now your parents are admitted to the nearby muggle hospital we reckoned that we had to keep them away from the magical world as much as possible harry and hermione left the house behind dumbledore just before they left the house dumbledore changed his attire he looked like an overgrown hippy from the 1960s harry thought he looked really odd dressed in muggle clothes honestly if the situation hadnt been so serious he d have laughed out aloud but with the situation that they were in harry did not react to this change of appearance the hospital was just a couple of blocks away from hermione home they went upto the intensive care unit where her parents were battling for their life hermione was allowed to enter the room but harry could only watch from the outside what he saw made his heart leap into his mouth hermione parents were clearly badly injured they were heavily bandaged up and were clearly bleeding in many places after watching them for some time harry went back and sat down beside dumbledore in the waiting area hermione stayed with her parents for about two to three hours harry got up every fifteen minutes and checked on her from outside he could only see her sitting beside them and looking at them with a lost expression on her face some time later harry saw remus lupin come into the waiting area he approached the seats where harry and dumbledore were seated and began talking to dumbledore in low voices harry could not hear what they were talking about but whatever it was it did seem to be extremely important after they had their talk dumbledore and lupin walked over from the corner where they had been standing and came up to harry and hermione lupin shook harry hand and hugged hermione harry saw her burying her face in lupin shoulders as she began to cry again finally dumbledore broke the silence and said i think that it is advisable for us to leave the hospital now remus will be here and nymphadora tonks will be here soon they will attend to miss granger parents here and of course if they need you you will be available at your home hermione didnttake in this suggestion very well she protested they are my parents they are lying their injured in a critical state how can you expect me to leave them like that miss granger began dumbledore i have no illusion that you are very much shocked and pained at what has happened i am also aware that no one among us has the right to be here at this moment than you but you need to understand that you need some rest as does harry here and secondly and more importantly you need to realize that our objective at this moment is to keep your parents safe and i dontthink that with you two here that objective can be fulfilled hermione nodded she got up and went to take a last look at her parents before going home she came back about ten minutes later she and harry then made their way to her house alongwith dumbledore they entered the house and sat themselves down in the living room harry was sitting there quietly staring into the floor hermione sat down beside him and had taken her head in her hands dumbledore cleared his throat and said i would ordinarily have asked both of you to go to bed but taking into consideration the events of the past twelve hours i am willing to anwer your questions first after a short pause he added and i daresay there will be many neither hermione nor harry spoke during the silence that followed harry kept quiet because he did not know whether he should intefere in this matter on the other hand hermione kept quiet because she simply did not know where to begin finally she put all her queries into one question as she said professor tell me everything about the attack harry was considerably startled by this statement it was more like a command than a request it was clearly a case of hermione exercising her right to the requested information harry also noted the use of me instead of us he took this as a sign of her wanting to talk to dumbledore alone so he started to get up however dumbledore motioned him to remain seated miss granger he began what i am about to say will be difficult for you to accept however since you have asked me this question and i have chosen to answer it i must give you the truth for i don not believe and have never done so since i recognized good and evil in the argument that the truth should be screened and censored in order to reduce the impact it might have on the listener truth is dangerous oh yes more than any other thing in this world and so it must be treated with caution but with the circumstances that we are currently engaged in i believe that the truth in general is most desirable since any lie will surely result in someone weaving a web of deceit around us the question that you have asked is very complex because if i were to explain to you everything i believe we would still be sitting here till tomorrow yet i will give you the relevant information ever since harry was born lord voldemort has been trying to kill him this is because they are connected by a magical bond that is beyond the comprehension of all wizardkind and yet is as concrete as a scratch made on glass which cannot be removed unless the glass itself is shattered to pieces but dontask me about the connection dontask me why or how for that is not for me to answer maybe someday you will know the answer when the person who has the right to reply does so as he said the last part dumbledore looked at harry but what has all this got to do with the enmity between voldemort and harry hermione interjected oh everything dumbledore replied i believe that the only reason which motivated this attack was the fact that lord voldemort wanted to attack harry not physically but through the mind so he chose to hurt harry where his weakness lies in his friends he chose to hurt your parents so that he could hurt harry i dontunderstand hermione began but dumbledore interrupted her by saying i think things would be clearer if we heard what lord voldemort himself has to say but how asked hermione harry i think you can open your letter now dumbledore told harry harry swallowed in the tense atmosphere he had forgotten about the letter that lay in his pocket he retrieved it slowly and saw that on the back of the envelope there was a seal in the form of a skeleton and a serpent the dark mark of lord voldemort harry noticed the seal for the first time and understood how dumbledore knew whom the letter was from he opened the letter read it once and handed it over to hermione who in turn handed it over to dumbledore with trembling hands the letter read harry potter you have just seen a taste of the terror that i lord voldemort can inflict upon you and your loved ones you think you are brave and can face me you think you can escape me but can you help the ones you love the ones who you call your friends and their families escape from me treat this as a warning today those mudbloods were injured but tomorrow they may die serve this as a reminder that none can stand against my power none not you not your friends and not even that muggle loving headmaster of yours as he read the letter dumbledore let out a false chuckle ah tom riddle always so polite so what does this mean hermione asked dumbledore a certain incident that occurred about one and a half months ago has forced lord voldemort to do some introspection he replied i am of course talking of the way five students entered the department of mysteries and managed to escape a dozen or so death eaters without knowing about the surprise attacks or about the place they were in this incident forced lord voldemort to reason out why harry potter has thus far eluded him even though his plans were ingenious and seemingly foolproof it gnaws his mind he has ordered a fresh reign of terror but in his own mind doubt has begun to take shape all his thought is bent upon harry what happened the night he tried to kill him as a child how he eluded him so far what happened in the atrium when he tried to possess harry all these questions hound him however he has realized one thing that harry has unknown strength in him which meant that he escaped with his life in scenarios where he should have got nothing but death after all how has a boy been able to escape him four times while most fully grown powerful wizards he targeted couldntescape him even once and amid his musings he has i believe begun to look at harry as a formidable enemy he overestimates you harry and i think that is what we should take advantage of but what does this have to do with the attack harry asked dumbledore replied during his musings lord voldemort concluded and i daresay that his conjecture is partly correct that your friends are your greatest source of strength and motivation now that your godfather is dead he realizes that the only persons whom he could hold for a ransom against you are your friends and their families that is why the death eaters attacked miss granger parents here had it not been for your birthday party even the weasleys could have been in a similar position what do you mean harry reacted sharply to this revelation this brings us to the actual attack miss granger your parents were supposed to go to little whinging to pick you up werentthey hermione nodded but said nothing dumbledore however continued the death eaters did not even remotely expect anything like a party being thrown for harry they had been watching your family movements for sometime now and had concluded that the best time to attack you three would be in the evening after your parents came back home however that day your parents arrived early only to find nine hooded and cloaked figures waiting for them the cover of the death eaters had been blown they were left with two choices they could either attack your parents now or could go back to their master and face his wrath they chose the former course and your parents found themselves at the receiving end of the death eaters curses they were standing there defenseless writhing in pain while the cowards were enjoying the pain that they were inflicting harry had never seen dumbledore use such words before he was undoubtedly enraged by this attack on the defenseless grangers hermione however didntknow dumbledore as well as harry did and so she didntseem to notice she asked him her eyes wide with fear the cruciatus curse dumbledore nodded yes i believe they intended to do to them what they had done to the longbottoms years ago they wanted to use your parents as living reminders of the terror that lord voldemort is they knew harry would have to react then somehow or the other but then how can you say that they are going to be all right hermione asked him she had started sobbing again when dumbledore told them of the death eaters intended plans fortunately replied dumbledore we received information of the attack within moments we had been monitoring your home since the last year as soon as information reached us of the attack certain members of the order including myself kingsley shacklebolt arthur weasley mungdungus fletcher and elephias dodge confronted the death eaters and rescued your parents they were on the receiving end for about a couple of minutes before we arrived and i believe we should be thankful for that a few moments and who knows what could have happened but professor exclaimed harry voldemort used the cruciatus curse on me the year before last and i recollect no other ill after it was removed that is because dumbledore slowly replied you tried to use your mind to resist it you see it is all here in your head magic is all about the mind if you believe you can do something you will be able to do it it seems that in the case of your parents miss granger they accepted the pain and forced their mind to be overcome by it in all practical respect they co operated with the spell which only increased their predicament as a result it seems that their mind is still in that stupor that they had imposed upon themselves that is why their condition is critical we have got to bring them out of their stupor within the next three days otherwise i fear there might be irreversible damage hermione gave a sob at this harry listened to her and his heart sank what kind of a friend am i i bring nothing but pain to those who are close to me he thought dumbledore seemed to have read his thoughts since he said no harry do not blame yourself for all this this is not your fault we are at war here and i believe these are the first injuries that we have had to suffer in this war hermione nodded blinking back her tears she said yes harry there is no point in blaming you personally i dontconsider you responsible for any of this if there is someone responsible it is voldemort and i am sure he will pay for all this someday he will her eyes flashed angrily as she said this she turned to dumbledore and said sir but what are we going to do now dumbledore replied i think it is best if harry stays here with you for the rest of your summer with your permission of course like i said we have to make use of the uncertainties that cloud lord voldemort mind with the state he is in i dontthink he will attack you harry not yet he is planning something that we can be sure about but it isntsomething that he will carry out this month that is for sure so we can safely say that anyone who is with you is also safe that is why i think that you should stay here harry both harry and hermione nodded dumbledore continued but there are a few precautions that you must take miss granger you must not leave the house alone you must always be accompanied by harry wherever you go when your parents return home we will review the arrangement and decide upon the next course of action till then this is all we can do and yes both of you you will not leave this house after dark wherever you have to go you must go while it is light and that includes the hospital both harry and hermione understood they remained silent signifying that they accepted the arrangements that dumbledore had suggested then hermione looked at dumbledore her eyes tearful sir do you think my parents will be okay i have full faith dumbledore replied they have almost healed completely in the body and we are trying our best to heal their mind we administered a potion earlier in the evening and by our reckoning they should wake up in two days but remember this it is important that they accept this as a part of their memories and go on to live their life as normally as possible if that does not happen we can never predict what can occur hermione nodded dumbledore words gave her some hope his words were like the ray of light that peeks through behind a storm cloud just after rains cease to fall down dumbledore looked at both of them kindly and said i think both of you should have some rest now it is five thirty already and two three hours of rest would hold you in good stead you can visit the hospital immediately after you wake and freshen up but before that i would advise you to eat something all this waiting and anxiety it isnteasy but you ought to ensure that your body holds up to all this i can conjure up some food for you if you like no said hermione getting up i think i will fix us something from the kitchen with that she went to the kitchen harry understood that she wanted to be alone for a while after hermione went harry noticed that dumbledore was looking at him with the same penetrating gaze which he had seen on his headmaster countenance a number of times on previous occasions at last dumbledore looked up and said harry i think you should tell miss granger about the prophecy she has the right to know especially since all this has happened no said harry i dontthink i will tell her she will be even more terrified then and then she ll tell ron he remembered what dumbledore had said about the burrow being attacked professor you said that the burrow was attacked yes harry replied dumbledore the death eaters had originally planned to attack both places at once but fortunately they were not successful the order members succeeded in thwarting the attack on the burrow in the process six out of the fifteen death eaters there were caught even here four out of the nine were caught i interrogated them myself that is why i know all that i told you about so they are in azkaban now harry asked no dumbledore replied the ministry is aware of the revolt of the dementors so the death eaters have been kept in anti apparition cells in a secret place what the ministry going to do with them i think they can do nothing cornelius things that the return of lord voldemort does not quite mean what his power meant once but i believe he is wrong this time lord voldemort is even more powerful than before since he has become wiser with his earlier experiences he had lots of time in hiding oh yes he analysed all he d done and drew out new plans although he still hasntgot the greatest prize that is you he still is a very potent force unfortunately cornelius and i still do not see eye to eye in this matter the ministry is still not preparing for lord voldemort assault as it should be dumbledore shook his head out of dejection as he said this harry could see why he was disappointed it was indeed different to fight lord voldemort with the backing of the ministry of magic rather than fighting as the order of the phoenix alone harry sighed and said he needed to get this off his chest professor what do you think will happen in the future dumbledore looked at him and said we dontknow we cantworry too much about the future harry it is only our time that we should be concerned with okay it is prudent to give your future generation a better life but that is only possible when your own life improves that is why i do not think that we should worry about what is waiting for us out there but i feel so small and powerless and knowing that the fate of the wizarding world lies in my hands makes me feel all the more weak just look at what happened to hermione parents i mean i cannot even protect my friends then how am i supposed to rid the wizarding world of its greatest menace harry asked i do not know the answer to that harry said dumbledore there was pity and sympathy in his eyes as he spoke but one thing that i know is that it is all here in your head magic is all about the mind harry you just have to believe in yourself if you believe in what you do anything and everything is possible you just have to sincerely believe and work hard for what achieving what you want remember harry even the smallest person can change the history of the world and you are not small neither are you weak you are the strongest and bravest person i have even known to survive the things that you had had to go through since your birth and still be who you are requires great strength harry and that is why you are a strong person because you make your choices not on the basis of the power you may get but on the basis of what you think is good and what you think is evil you have often chosen the difficult path and that is why you have become who you are that is why you have given us a chance to hope that we will be freed from this evil remember this harry you can defeat him not because the prophecy says so but because you have the strength you have been given this chance of destroying evil from our world yes evil will re emerge someday in some other form but that is not our job to deal with all we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us the prophecy was made for you harry which means that you are the one who has been given this chance and know this harry this task would never have been appointed to you if you didnthave the strength as he finished speaking dumbledore looked kindly at harry and finally said remember harry it is all to do with mind the first step to gaining strength is to master your thoughts and establish full control over your mind believe that you can do this and i am sure you will win with that dumbledore got up and patting harry on the back made his way towards the door he put his hand on the doorknob turned and said i will get going now remember what i told you in case you need anything you can contact remus or nymphadora they are there in the hospital he nodded at harry and then with a swish of his cloak he was gone leaving harry feeling better than he had done for the last twelve hours harry suddenly woke up suddenly it must have been around twelve the next night he and hermione had spent the entire day at the hospital as soon as it was dark lupin escorted them back to hermione home where they had just sat together hermione had cried a lot while harry had tried to comfort her as he woke up harry remembered he had just had another nightmare her had seen hermione lying tied up on the floor of a dungeon and crying he could also see lord voldemort kneeling over her his wand pointed at her his face in a serpent like contortion undoubtedly happy with all the torturing he could do when he woke up harry vision was all dark and groggy since the lights were out and he did not have his glasses on he suddenly heard the door open someone else was in the room and harry instinctively reached for his wand lying on the bedside table however his sense caught up with him as his fingers left the wand and went on to the torch that was lying beside it lumos he muttered in good humour as he switched on the torch he was hardly feeling humoured though and the torch bulb flared up casting its light around and revealing hermione harry cried out aloud what are you doing in here hermione was standing near the foot of the bed shaking visibly she was scared no it would be an understatement she felt positively terrified harry threw aside his covers and not caring that he was clad only in his boxers he walked upto her and put his arm around her then he led her by her hand to the bed sat her down and switched on the lights tears were glistening in her eyes he took her hands in his own and caressed them softly what the matter hermione why are you crying he asked his voice full of concern hermione started crying as she said harry i dontknow what to do i dontknow whom to trust i mean with mum and dad both in hospital after the attack i just dontknow anything the doctor says they are going to be fine but when is that going to be i am scared harry more than i have been my entire life i want to be strong but i dont know if i can be i am worried sick harry is that all harry asked her yes that pretty much sums it all up who looking after your parents at the hospital now dumbledore and lupin are there dumbledore seems to have taken all the responsibility on himself he told they will be there to look after them in case they need something hermione shook her head as she said this it was apparent that she did not believe such a thing would happen harry felt his own guilt conscience resurface but he knew he had much more important things to do he had to console her comfort her like she had tried to do after sirius death he ignored the guilt that was swelling in the pit of his stomach and said herm come here come on now give me a hug he motioned hermione towards himself and spread his arms out so that she could embrace him she came upto him and he gave her a big hug she was dressed in a thin blue nightdown and her hair was loose and flying all around even as she sobbed against his chest he felt nervous you know hermione this is making me real nervous harry said after sometime they had not yet broken the hug what hermione asked him harry replied with a tongue in cheek answer well you know i am sitting before a beautiful witch who happens to be my best friend bare chested and without an ounce of clothing on my body except my boxers to his relief hermione laughed her laughter was like music to his ears just like harry potter she said always the one to say the right thing to make one happy harry leaned against her and kissed her softly on the cheek he told her you know hermione you are beautiful and i hate to see you crying even as he said it harry regretted opening his mouth she looked stunned for a second but soon tears came welling into her eyes her hazel eyes were hidden behind a veil of water and she took her head in her hands and started sobbing harry seemed to be at a loss regarding what to do then he decided to take the straight approach he put her arm gently around hermione and spoke softly i know it has been difficult for you herm but you need to know that we are all there for you to help you get through this and it is not going to be long either is it your parents will be healthy again in some days and everything will return to normal but why did it have to happen to me then noticing the pained expression on harry face she said quickly i didntmean that harry stopped her and said you know herm at the party while cutting the cake when you told me to make a wish i wished that all my friends and their families remained safe i wished that the factors that have made my life the hell that it is should never affect any of you but then like all of my wishes this wish too was not fulfilled now it was hermione turn to play the role of comforting harry she said dontblame yourself harry it not your fault it just that i dontunderstand everything was perfect till yesterday afternoon and now my whole world is turned upside down i dont know how to react to all this i dontthink i am strong enough to deal with all this harry squeezed her hand and said listen to me now hermione you dontneed to react to everything all the time you dontneed to be strong all the time sometimes you can afford to be yourself after all you are also a human being you have your own fads and foibles you too feel the need to cry sometimes you feel the need to laugh sometimes in those times you have to let yourself go you must cast aside all aspersions in these times and do what you want to do you cannot just go around bottling up all your emotions hermione now looked at him as if he had grown right before him ignoring her gaze harry continued you can trust me herm you can trust all of the order you can trust us to help you and to be with you when you need us if you do that your worries will be greatly reduced you just need to try you need to accept what has happened take it in your own stride and continue to live your life the way you have after all this is not likely to have caused any lasting damage it was now harry turn to look uncomfortable though hermione was staring at him with the same piercing gaze that made the object cower under the gaze she looked up at him and said slowly and quietly but that could also apply to you the way you have dealt with sirius death it seems that it is easier to say these things than to do them actually that was a different matter harry stuttered unconvincingly but no hermione i dontthink i can talk about that not yet not with all that has happened harry interrupted her before she could complete her sentence an extended period of silence followed this they were both sitting side by side on the bed but no one was talking hermione was looking at the floor and harry was staring at the doorway at long last hermione broke the silence and asked harry can i ask you for something well okay can i sleep with you here tonight she asked him harry felt his heart skip a beat what was hermione speaking of was she really hermione what was she playing at hermione read the incredulous expression on his face and said quickly no i dontmean anything like that it just that i feel scared to be alone whenever i close my eyes i see mum and dad bloodied and bandaged and lying in the hospital harry understood what she was trying to tell him perhaps better than anyone else could he smiled at her very well you can just lie down here beside me she lay down and he put his arm around her her head resting on his shoulders hoping to make her more comfortable she snuggled right into him and harry felt her locks tingling his ribs she closed her eyes and said thank you harry soon hermione felt the warmth that emanated from his body and she felt secure and protected just before she fell asleep she muttered i love you harry immediately after that she fell asleep leaving harry with very complicated thoughts about what his best friend had just said what you can expect next will hermione parents recover fully what did hermione imply when she said that she loved harry will this affect their friendship all this and much more in the next chapter meet the parents author note phew that was difficult i had to explain just about everything in this chapter and also insert the philosophical part but i believe i enjoyed myself greatly before finishing i must remind you that i am going to be away for the next seven days i promise that i will update the story with chapter 4 by june 17th till then read on and review author note it isntreally in my style to start off with author note but it is necessary here i have decide here to attach chapter eight and chapter seven together since they share the same flow of events so i am modifying this chapter besides the visit to weasley wizarding wheezes will also be chronicled but that update might take upto thursday hope you enjoy this and dontforget to review chapter seven getting back to normal harry wanted to inform the order of emmeline vance murder immediately he tried to get up from the floor where he had involuntarily ended up sometime during the vision but he found that he could not do so he was tired no that wasntthe right word he was exhausted before he could try to get up one more time or call out to someone or even think about what he had to do he found himself dropping back to bed and passing into a deep dreamless slumber harry did not hear as two hurried pair of feet entered the room and knelt down beside him he did not know that those two persons were lupin and hermione he did not hear lupin cast the mobilicorpus charm on him and transfer him to the bed he did not feel hermione touch as she grasped his hand and willed him to wake up he was trapped in dreamland only his dreams were all filled with an unknown emptiness it was nearly an hour before lupin and hermione succeeded in waking harry up he looked around with a dazed look on his face as he tried to ascertain what was happening suddenly the vision that he had earlier in the night came to harry mind he got up quickly and said in a hoarse voice voldemort voldemort killed her who harry lupin asked him with a concerned look on his face emmeline emmeline vance what are you sure lupin asked him again harry nodded lupin looked at him for a brief second while he decided what to do he said i will just inform the order about this you two try to get some rest with that he went out of the door and disappeared downstairs they could hear some sounds coming as if a conversation was going on after some time lupin came back up only to see harry sleeping in his bed while hermione sat beside him seeing lupin hermione got up and asked what happened i informed the headquarters about what harry just said he replied they are going over to check on emmeline what if this is true hermione asked with fear in her eyes i dontknow i cantthink about this lupin replied with his brows furrowed i mean i dontthink even dumbledore counted on voldemort springing to action so quickly i think this may mean that the war is now days away from beginning what do you mean the war hermione asked him again that what all of us have been engaged in the last year or so no lupin said that was just a prelude i think i am sure that the real war is going to start now and not just with unexplained disappearances or massacres or things like that i think maybe voldemort has decided to come out openly in that case we have to be careful hermione said worry clouding her hazel eyes yes lupin said we always have to be careful but i think you dontneed to worry about this just yet all of you will be safe at hogwarts you know it is the safest place there is and the last place you would expect voldemort to attack hermione continued from where lupin had left off and hence probably the place we should expect him to attack first now now hermione lupin said i know you are worried but that no need to become paranoid like moody i think you just need some rest i would advise you to go back to your room and get some sleep hermione nodded as lupin turned and made his way back downstairs into the living room she knew he would stay there the entire night keeping vigil trying to listen out for anything that might be out of the normal hermione considered going back to her room but she decided against it she went to where harry was sleeping and snuggled into the bed along with him just as she entered the bed harry rolled about onto his side and pulled her in tightly against him the last thought that she had in mind before she fell asleep was how warm harry body felt against hers ron rolled about in his bed that night thinking about what had happened earlier at hermione house he was carrying out an impromptu synopsis of all that was going on in his head normally it was not in his nature to analyse anything those things were best left for hermione but now at this time he couldnthelp it he was confused and that was saying a lot considering that prefect duties quidditch practice homework and all such things always confused him at school but as he lay in his bed staring at the ceiling and thinking out everything ron didntwant to think about all that all that he thought about was what was going on what was happening how did things end up like this he had no idea but he had resolved to find that out before the night was over ron thought about all that he had shared with harry and hermione over the past five years these years had been the best of his life as far as he could remember he had not been like harry who had never had friends or shared his feeling with anyone in the ten years before he had come to hogwarts he had not even been lonely as the only child of his parents like hermione was he had a perfect childhood lots of siblings loving parents and a very happy family indeed but somehow the last five years they were different he could not explain it maybe it was because he had grown out of the shadows of his brothers and found for himself that niche he had always sought maybe it was because he got two of the best friends that anyone could ever dream of in his life maybe it was because his friends accepted him for what he was instead of ranting about the legacy that his elder brothers had left for him to try and emulate whatever be the reason ron was sure that he could not imagine his life without the presence of either harry or hermione that brought him back to the present question how did things get to this ron knew that he should be happy today especially after what had happened after he had come back to grimmauld place his hogwarts letter had come that day and ron found that he had received 9 owls okay so that was only half of what hermione had got and even three less than the number harry had managed to secure but at least his performance was far better than the three owls secured by the twins but more than the exam results he was flattered by another note that accompanied the envelope it read dear mr weasley we are pleased to inform you that you have been appointed quidditch captain for gryffindor house for this year we hope that you will take serious regard of your responsibilities as gryffindor quidditch captain team trials will start in the second week of term we hope that you can take your quidditch team to new heights after this appointment sincerely yours minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ron had never stopped to wonder why he had been appointed quidditch captain instead of harry after all he had been on the team for only one year and harry had been on the team ever since his first year at hogwarts and was the youngest player to play for a hogwarts quidditch team in hundred years he had only taken in this news with glee as he gloated on the fact that he had been made captain ahead of harry just like he had been made a prefect last year this gave him more fuel to add to the fire that was raging inside of him as he thought of the argument they had earlier in the morning however that night all these seemingly small things caught up with him he was thinking thinking as he had never thought before he wondered why hermione had chosen harry over him especially since harry never had shown any interest in her at least not in public then maybe there was something in the name harry potter or the title the boy who lived that added charisma to his persona ron couldntunderstand even though he was brought up in such a large family even he couldntdeny that emotions were something that he did not understand and sensitivity was something that could not be associated with him but he still tried his best to fathom the current situation he was shocked at what he had said to harry at what he had done to hermione he was ashamed of what he had done but somewhere in his mind some unknown feeling he put it down to his own pride prevented him from admitting it he thought about it and concluded that it was his feeling that he was better than harry but then he obviously was he had been made a prefect when harry hadn t he had been made quidditch captain when harry hadn t in fact as far as he could remember every time when the choice was between him and harry he had been chosen as the one except by hermione which confused him even more than ever in the end ron resolved to mend his friendship with his two best friends he realized that his life at hogwarts wouldntbe worth it if he did not have them in his life and then maybe things would not work out between the two of them and he might still have a chance to win hermione back with that thought he saw a flicker of hope in the surrounding darkness and drifted off to sleep the next few days passed in a pleasant blur for harry that morning he had woken up to a handful of curly light brown hair in his face hermione face was inches from his own as she slept soundly never once getting disturbed in her sleep harry had watched her for a long time with the dazed and blissful look of watching an angel and truth be told she did look like an angel especially since all her innocence and raw beauty came to the fore as she slept with a peaceful and contented expression on her face her parents were getting better with every passing moment she had a boyfriend who happened to be her best friend who cared for her a lot and who undoubtedly was the love of her life she had scored eighteen owls things were definitely starting to look up for her hermione had taken to snuggling into bed with harry each night they did not have a physical relationship not yet although both of them would have admitted that such an occurrence was impossible in the circumstances that prevailed however despite all this both of them had silently agreed not to make a move until they were ready until both of them were ready harry for his part was still not sure if he loved hermione completely in that way and even if he did he didntwant to leave her with something as unforgettable as this knowing very well that there may soon be a time when he may be dead at the present he was satisfied with the way their relationship was evolving slowly based on trust and understanding and not just a sudden upsurge of hormones he had come to look at hermione in a different light over the last few days ordinarily she would ve been one to control her feelings and put on a brave face in the wake of everything that had happened but now she was more open to him she laughed and she cried especially when ron was mentioned she was still scared of him harry thought she was more easy going than usual and although everything did not stop her from studying and all the hermione stuff that she did harry had to admit that she had somehow changed into a more relaxed and secure person a person who he was in all probability beginning to love more than as a friend as far as hermione was concerned being the sensible person that she was she had decided long back to wait until her marriage even if that meant waiting for years together for her to be physically intimate with someone it was one of her unspoken principles that she wanted to be with one person all her life and no other she had wanted her first experience to be special she had wanted it to be both emotionally and physically satisfying and although she was sure she loved harry and that he was the only one for her she felt that she was not ready to take that big step which would change her life for ever at least not for the time being their daily routine was pretty much the same hermione would visit her parents in the hospital they were well and good but the muggle doctor still insisted that they stay since he wanted to find out the reasons for this miracle discovery harry would always accompany her often he would just sit in the waiting area giving hermione the time she needed to be alone with her parents however these times were not much because bob and julia granger were always careful to include him in whatever they did with hermione harry believed it was partly because of pity but he was still grateful for what they did harry found hermione parents very interesting and endearing his father bob loved to joke and laugh aloud meanwhile her mother julia was a bit more serious yet he could tell that she loved a good laugh as well they had this quality of making anyone feel like one of them and harry was really glad for that however one thing did startle him quite a bit whenever harry had met bob and julia grangers they came across as nervous and timid persons to him but he could see now that it was in all probability due to a fear of the magical world days started to pass like this and soon it was only a week before harry and hermione had to return to hogwarts harry was glad that he was with hermione all this time with everything that was going on he believed that if it were not for his relationship with hermione which was better than it had ever been and every day made it more wonderful still it would have been for the fact that she had ensured that harry too like her completed the school work well before time she had even ordered some extra books regarding careers and was searching through them for something appropriate for her and harry for the most part while she worked on all this harry would watch her fascinated at her dedication and concentration he had begun loving the way she bit her lip as she turned pages of the book and the way her eyebrows contracted as she thought about something she d read it was the evening before the big day when hermione parents would finally be discharged from hospital nick had jokingly told harry the day before that he had to administer a co operating potion to the doctor in charge of the grangers treatment so as to get him to let go of them hermione was poring over a certain book regarding healers she had since the last two days begun to pay more attention to the healing profession than all others harry was looking at her dreamily suddenly hermione looked up and saw harry gazing at her what she asked suddenly self conscious and wondering if there was something wrong with her appearance nothing harry began but then with a smile on his face continued it just that you are you are so beautiful yes he said it he had wanted to say that so much for the last week or so and he had finally said it you re just flattering me hermione said with a blush looking down into the floor no harry replied it true you re beautiful after that both went back to what they were doing earlier after some time harry asked what are you going to take up when we get back to hogwarts hermione looked up and said i am beginning to think quite a lot about pursuing healing i have read this book and a few more and i think it really appeals to me you know saving people lives watching the joy on their faces when they come to know that their loved ones are safe besides when i didntknow about being a witch i always imagined being a doctor when i grew up so i think its magical counterpart is not going to be that bad either harry leant closer to her as he tried to get a proper view of the page that she had been reading he said doesntit require a three year course after hogwarts yes she replied i even talked to nick about this yesterday and he gave me some insider stuff on all that they teach he said that the classes are conducted at st mungo s and he also told me some things about the potions and spells that are taught i daresay that i think i will be able to manage all this you can manage anything harry said with a sincerity in his voice that made hermione blush bright pink anyway the time required after hogwarts is the same as that for an auror so that means that both of us will have to study for three years after hogwarts that is of course if you still want to be an auror hermione said yes i still want to and then after the owls i am glad that i will be able to be one he said i wonder though what ron will take up as soon as he said this he wished that he hadn t at the mention of ron name hermione expression became impassive and she went back to the book that she was reading nothing was said between them for the rest of the time they were in the room harry sighed the only dampener on their spirit over the holidays had been the state of their friendship with ron harry was still enraged over the way ron had treated hermione as for hermione she felt scared of ron she felt scared of the way he d reacted she still needed some time to recover from the shock and in the meantime both she and harry made conscious efforts not to let their conversations or memories veer onto anything connected remotely to ron it was really difficult since ron was a part of both of them and as such occasional slip ups did occur which usually resulted in silence hermione knew that running away like this from the problem wasnta solution but for the first time in her life she was happy to just ignore an impending issue that night as they were downstairs for dinner tonks was with them harry asked tonks do you think dumbledore will give his permission to visit diagon alley tonks said mildly why she was still preoccupied with her food well harry began i needed to buy some things there tonks looked up from her plate and said like like robes parchment potions equipment quills ink and yes i have to take some money out from my gringotts vault as well harry said rolling his eyes honestly tonks the way you talk anyone would believe that i was a nine year old sorry harry tonks said sheepishly but you know it is my job to ask they assigned me to look after both of you for no reason anyway i dontthink your visit to diagon alley will be a problem with dumbledore after all what can go wrong with a streetful of wizards to look after you anyway when do you want to go i think day after tomorrow will be good tomorrow if you can manage it harry replied and hermione tonks asked hermione looked at tonks as she said her name will you be going too i think i will hermione replied my parents wontbe able to this year so obviously i will need to visit gringotts okay then tonks said i will ask dumbledore i dontthink it will be a problem but for now i think we should return to our food with that she began ploughing all the food in her plate into her mouth not unlike the way ron usually did harry and hermione rolled their eyes at her and went back to their own food albeit in a far more civilized manner after dinner tonks asked them what they were going to do harry wanted to sleep but hermione insisted that they should complete the last remnants of their holiday work that night itself it was a nasty potions essay on safeguards to be taken while brewing advanced potions snape had set this essay saying that he wanted a roll of parchment from each student irrespective of whether they would be admitted to the newt classes for potions since he did not want anyone foolishness or ignorance dent his reputation as a teacher neville had positively squeaked at this declaration although his fear of snape had considerably diminished since the owls and the events at the department of mysteries the venom that snape had packed into the remark was enough to make him the old neville one more time while hermione were poring over wizard guide to advanced potions written by jeremy wizardsmith later that night to find some suitable material for the essay harry looked up from another book that he was reading and said hermione huh came the reply i was just wondering harry began since we will both be going to diagon alley together if we could make it a date hermione looked up from the book that she was reading and stared at harry after a moment her face broke into this big wide smile and she said it a date harry and with that harry felt his heart rising within his chest clearly he was starting to fall for hermione harry and hermione made ready to go to diagon alley the day after next tonks had informed them of dumbledore permission for the visit personally harry couldnthave cared less for himself his trust for dumbledore had received a major setback even since sirius death he had decided to visit diagon alley by himself irrespective of whether dumbledore agreed or not however he couldntdeny that the ancient wizard permission made him feel a whole lot better especially now that hermione was coming along it was against such a backdrop that harry and hermione flooed from a shop nearby to the leaky cauldron it was the same fireplace that ron had used a few weeks earlier they were told that it was owned by a wizard who had ethically decided to renounce magic hermione had snorted at this saying that if it was indeed the case why on earth had he still maintained a floo connection still harry was glad that there was a way to reach diagon alley within a short time although he hated travelling by floo powder harry couldntdeny that it was the only way he could spend the maximum possible time in diagon alley with hermione lupin accompanied them to the shop and watched them go harry was personally glad to see lupin even though he looked a bit worn out he had been especially worried about his old teacher and friend during the past few days since a full moon had just passed harry was the first to step into the fire and was afterwards followed by hermione he took a handful of floo powder and fortunately shouted out the name of the leaky cauldron clearly he was greeted at the other end by the toothy grin of tom the landlord of the inn hello there harry are you alright tom asked as he helped harry on to his feet harry had never mastered the art of travelling by floo powder and this time was no exception either as he found himself on the floor instead of on his feet got the message from dumbledore yesterday told me to look out for both of you you know both you and miss granger tom continued with a hint of pride in his voice which clearly stemmed from the personal request made to him by the greatest wizard alive so as to ensure the protection of the boy who lived harry however was not impressed but he was interrupted in his musings and fortunately saved from further talk by tom at that precise moment as the fireplace burst into life once more and hermione stepped through smoothly and elegantly into the confines of the leaky cauldron harry couldntadmire her more even though she still didntlike flying which harry thought was a hell lot easier than this she travelled by floo powder as if she had done that all her life trust hermione to do make difficult things easy and easy things difficult harry thought with a light smile lingering at the corners of his mouth welcome miss granger long time no see tom greeted her as if he had just met a very old friend this was starting to really affect harry nerves but relief came over him when tom said well must go back to the pub now great business today cantafford to wait a moment longer i think you two should hurry up as well you donthave all day you know dumbledore told to send you back before seven with that he left both harry and hermione alone they walked towards the opening to the secret wizarding marketplace harry tapped the wall three times with his wand and the bricks parted revealing before them the entrance to diagon alley diagon alley was just as harry remembered a streetful of wizards where you want to go everywhere and anywhere as sirius had told him last year when they had had a chance to speak of lighter matters for once harry tried desperately not to think about all that he offered his hand to hermione who laced her fingers through his and they made their way up the crooked street towards a white building shining in the distance it was the gringotts wizard bank both harry and hermione passed the goblins at the entrance without second thoughts or looks for that matter and made their way back to one of the counters while harry was accompanied by a goblin his name was griphook harry remembered him as the one who had taken him to his vault for the first time but griphook did not show any sign of recognition meanwhile hermione was exchanging muggle money into galleons and sickles it was indeed fortunate that gringotts didntworry about underage wizards carrying out their transactions otherwise it would have been a bother for both of them half an hour later harry stood outside gringotts waiting for hermione who had told him to wait outside for a moment since this had happened at the time they were passing by the watchgoblin at the entrance harry had a sneaking suspicion about what she was going to do after about two minutes hermione came skipping down the steps seemingly very happy what she asked as harry stood there looking critically at her his brows furrowed hermione he replied please tell me that whatever you did back there was not concerned with spew it isntspew it is s p e w society for promotion of elfish welfare she argued yeah yeah but at least you could change the name harry said in a resigned tone dontspeak like ron she said without thinking and immediately after realizing that she had mentioned ron her face quickly fell and she became grim a similar change came over harry countenance although he knew how much ron was a part of their lives he wasntready to forgive him for what he d done to hermione not yet however he soon regained his composure come now for our date and i pay for everything he said and taking her hand led the way hermione gave him a watery sort of a smile and followed still things did get better and more enjoyable as the day passed their first stop was madam malkin robes for all occasions harry had to buy some new robes as did hermione hermione modelled the designs for him how do i look she asked as she stood before him wearing the newest design wonderful harry replied his gaze fixed on her face instead of on her robes harry hermione said disapprovingly each time i ve asked you for your opinion you ve said wonderful and nothing else you are not even looking what there to look harry said dreamily you look wonderful in whatever you wear boys hermione gave an exasperated sigh as she said this loudly shaking her head however she could not help but feel pleased as she walked back towards the changing area excuse me it men harry called out after her oh yeah i forgot men hermione rolled her eyes to herself as she shouted back twenty minutes later it was harry turn as madam malkin herself took up his case he had just fallen asleep wondering why women took so long to pick out a simple robe for the school when he had been woken by a very amused looking hermione hermione then had a long discussion with madam malkin regarding how she wanted harry robes to be made harry of course was completely oblivious to all that was being discussed now the elderly witch was pinning the measuring robe accordingly i didntknow you were so deep into fashion harry said ow he winced one of the pins had just pricked him in the midriff sorry madam malkin said apologetically but sternly however i must admit mr potter that it would indeed be a great help if you stopped moving and stood still for a moment this ll take only a minute and i dontthink i need to tell a sixteen year old wizard that hermione burst into laughter as she heard this while harry stood still he had turned a bright crimson at being chided at by the elderly witch so you didntanswer my question harry said as he sat down beside hermione waiting for his robes to be made ready what she asked absentmindedly as she pored over the catalogue of dress robes of various designs i d asked you since when have you had such an interest in fashion he said hermione looked up from the catalogue to see his emerald green eyes dancing merrily as they looked at her she replied just because i dontflaunt something doesntmean that i donthave a healthy interest in it it only the first time that i have used my knowledge though you know drawbacks of having a completely clueless boyfriend harry rolled his eyes at her and was about to retort when a witch came out and handed over their packages harry paid for both of them at least he tried to but hermione insisted on paying for her robes herself no you don t she said this is my uniform so harry contented himself with passing on the money she handed him over to the witch on the cash counter that meant he would have to think of something else to give her as a gift you know i think we should pay a visit to fred and george shop now harry said as they made their way from madam malkin shop after all i am still their financial backer you know no i d rather not go hermione said firmly why harry inquired i heard they have gone for every possible protection charm to protect their establishment ginny told me personally at mrs figg s many things can happen hermione replied knowing fred and george she trailed off as she visibly shuddered i dontknow why you are so afraid of those two harry teased her they are our friends after all yes they are hermione said and i not afraid of them i am just i just am worried of what they might be up to but you ve always succeeded in controlling them remember last year in the common room only too well hermione replied but that was different that was back at hogwarts there i had the option of threatening them with telling mrs weasley she knows now and i do not have that luxury anymore and harry asked looking on amused and willing her to continue at the same time remember what they did at the party hermione continued who do you think was their number one target with the ghost lines neville harry replied not knowing where she was getting to yes hermione said but the thing is i sort of manipulated neville so that he d be the target and not me donttell me harry groaned how could you i was just a little scared she said i think they are still trying to pull off some pranks on me she added the last part with a nervous twinge to her voice hey harry complained and i thought you were a gryffindor i am it just that she began uncertainly not willing to meet his eyes no you re obviously not he said otherwise you wouldntbe chickening out on this hell you re just going to meet your friends and you go on ranting about them trying to get back at you fine she snapped but let just make it the last and the shortest stop bravo harry tried to control his laughter at the sight of an unnerved hermione that my girl but mind well potter she threatened him if i get even one prank pulled up on me you will have to pay for it harry grinned at her and going close to her whispered in her ear anytime miss granger anytime thereafter hermione dragged harry to flourish and blotts it was probably the first time that hermione had ever been recognised before the famous harry potter the owner of the shop had personally come forward to attend to their needs or to hermione needs to be more precise hermione bought book after book and harry just followed her around she had told him that these were books that she would not be able to find at hogwarts they dealt with very advanced healing finally while she was busy with the billing harry eyes saw it a dark grey coloured book with seemingly yellow pages he went near it and took it in his hands it read in thin golden letters the ancient secret of war harry did not know why he wanted that book so badly it was as if something unknown inside him was telling him to do so he had never so much as bought another book for what hermione would call light reading that of course if you could discount the quidditch magazines and manuals he had or the defense books he was given by lupin last christmas he thought of telling hermione but decided against it he went out and told her can you please wait a minute she nodded and promptly went off to scan another part of the bookstore harry turned to the store owner and asked mr greenwitch may i help you mr harry was stunned did this man not know his name to harry it was a welcome relief that somebody in the wizarding world did not recognise him then he remembered that it had been three years since he d last appeared in the book store and hence maybe the owner did not recognise him potter harry replied ah yes now i remember thought i d seen you before his eyes lingered upon the edge of harry bangs where he hid his famous scar mr greenwitch i was just wondering whether you could help me with something sure mr potter actually i want to buy this book harry said bringing up the book from underneath his armpit but i want it delivered by evening post today to hermione address think you can manage that mr greenwitch nodded he said you want it to be sent to miss granger no harry replied i want it in my name you are staying with miss granger i suppose mr greenwitch asked it was harry turn to nod this time well i daresay that can be managed anyways we have to send some new books to the same address tonight he said no no harry shook his head i want this book to be sent separately you know what i mean he looked meaningfully at the store owner he nodded he took the package from harry and kept it on the table he looked once at the book and said you know mr potter i know every book that we keep here at flourish and blotts and your choice to me is indeed a strange one this is an ancient bookstore started by my grandfather and although i must admit i ve never opened this text i know that this has been here ever since the store was opened but no one has ever bought it before are you really sure then that you want to buy it yes please harry said testily making sure that he conveyed his desire not to answer any more questions that might be directed at him very well then mr greenwitch replied will you be paying for this in advance or upon delivery now please harry replied hermione can i say something harry asked as they exited flourish and blotts harry was now holding the huge packages that contained hermione books she nodded at his question next time we go out he said please try not to leave me alone hermione blushed she muttered sorry about that harry but you know when i walk into a bookstore she trailed off and harry picked up from where she d left when you walk into a bookstore you cannot stop yourself from running to the nearest shelf and scanning through all those heavy volumes yeah i know harry said as hermione rolled her eyes at him so what do you say about lunch harry asked her i must say i starving with all this stuff that you ve made me carry stuff i made you carry hermione said faintly and shook her head in disbelief it wouldntbe so if you didntinsist upon being so chivalrous stuff i made you carry honestly she rolled her eyes at harry they continued their good natured banter as they made their way back to the leaky cauldron for lunch once there harry was met with great relief as tom agreed to keep their packages safe till such time when they were to return to the granger home after lunch harry and hermione went back to diagon alley it was a warm afternoon and harry was thankful that he had chosen to wear plain muggle clothing instead of normal wizarding clothes admittedly it did grow stifling hot underneath those heavy layers of robes even as they walked into the apothecary for replenishing their potions supply they ran into neville who was hurrying off somewhere oi neville harry cried out as neville literally ran right into him watch where you are going sorry harry neville apologised by the way nice to see you you too hermione neville smiled at them both it was quite clear that he had changed a bit ever since they had last met at hogwarts to harry it seemed that he was a lot more relaxed and cheerful than usual although that did not mean an extrovertly confident guy by any means hermione how are your parents neville asked her fine they ll be home in a couple of days she replied so what are you doing here harry asked neville and how is your grandmother harry ron and hermione had grown very close with ginny luna and neville ever since the night in the department of mysteries the adventures that they had shared and the chaos that they survived had firmly cemented their friendship i just came to buy some dung beetles and unicorn hair neville replied my gran told me to bring some when i go home tonight what isntshe here hermione asked absentmindedly spilling some of the powdered asphodel that she was examining closely the store owner however saw this and cleaned it up with a wave of his wand no neville replied actually i ve taken a summer job at fred and george s neville tried not to look too embarrassed as he said this and harry suspected that there was something more going on than that met the eye well i ll get going then neville said as he paid his bill shall i tell everyone the twins that you too will be coming over soon yeah harry replied ignoring hermione rather pleading expression tell them we ll be there in about an hour or so what he asked as neville departed and hermione held his gaze you could have made an excuse she said a hint of accusation in her voice hermione harry said exasperatedly you promised fine she snapped at him no words were spoken as they silently paid the bill and left the apothecary chapter eight hogwarts at long last about an hour and a half later harry and hermione made their way towards number 92 diagon alley they had spent the better part of their time wandering about various stores in the alley they had visited the stationer s and quality quidditch supplies which was harry personal favourite they had even visited a wizarding departmental store which was named wizard mart not very original harry thought he had heard a few mentions of wal mart on television during his times with the dursleys and the name of this store was only too clearly influenced by that maybe it run by a muggle born he thought hermione had to buy material for her well project for s p e w harry still hadnttold her that all the hats and socks she d made last year were now the exclusive property of dobby at the wizard mart hermione also forced harry to buy a shaving machine for himself you really should buy that she d said your appearance looks nearly hideous in all that she was only too clearly referring to the visible portions of facial hair on harry but it wontwork at hogwarts it looks like it is electronic harry reasoned he knew that uncle vernon had a similar machine although he rarely used it no it works on magic you have to hold it in your wand hand and it uses a very small portion of your magical powers to work itself she explained how do you know harry had asked curiously it written on this manual she had said rolling her eyes harry could really be dumb sometimes now after all their purchases had been made they were on their way to weasleys wizarding wheezes they reached the store and looked at it from the outside it seemed normal enough they stepped inside and even as they heard a bell going off somewhere the world seemed to turn upside down and harry was finding himself hanging down from the floor and looking down at the ceiling if it hadntbeen for the fact that he had encountered a similar situation albeit in a far more tense situation during the third task of the triwizard tournament he d very well have shrieked just in the way hermione had by his calculations they had been hanging upside down like that for about a minute and harry was beginning to start thinking of a way to cure them of this dilemma when he felt the world righting itself and he landed on the ground on his feet he heard the same thing happen to hermione by his side harry looked around everywhere as he reached the ground the whole store was painted bright red all the shelves the walls the billing counter everything so much so that it was almost hurtful to the eyes and above all this suspended from the ceiling was a huge blue banner that proclaimed in fiery yellow letter we come to turn your world upside down weasleys wizarding wheezes we help you paint the whole town red to top it all off there was a photo of each of the twins on either corner of the banner of course if you were an outsider you could hardly tell who was who yet since harry knew the two pranksters well he had an idea as to what was the answer to that harry noticed that the store was almost jam packed it was filled with children of all ages and even some young adults however harry eyes nearly fell open out of their sockets not unlike mad eye when he saw that a sea of middle aged women not unlike mrs weasley was gathered around one particular corner of the store just as he planned to go towards the crowd and see what they could possibly be up to he heard george voice over the din ten galleons to the one who guesses correctly which photo is mine and which is fred s george made his way through the crowd and came upon harry and hermione hello harry hi hermione he said nice to see both of you and that too together you know he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively at harry stuff it george harry replied as hermione blushed a deep crimson anyway where is fred down there somewhere george replied making a vague gesture in the direction of one particular group of teenagers that was assembled in a conspiratorial way beneath a shelf that read skiving snackboxes stacking up for term harry thought harry turned back to george to find that hermione was asking him nice trick there she motioned towards the entrance as she said this clearly she was talking about the world turning upside down trick that was the reversal charm wasntit george nodded but i think you really shouldntuse that at the entrance that could give any poor customer a heart attack hermione voice had assumed her know it all tone now do hell with it george exclaimed irritatingly they might as well know that they are risking a heart attack even venturing near this place hermione snorted but regaining her usual brisk manner she said so did i hear you say that it ten galleons for the one who recognises which is your photo and which is fred s george nodded all right then she rubbed her hands together and said you might as well keep those galleons ready she looked closely at the photos and then looking at george she said you are the one on the topmost corner and fred in the bottom right corner george waited a moment and said in his sweetest voice as much as you think you are correct hermione i am afraid i must disappoint you with the news that you are wrong hermione was about to open her mouth to argue but instead she changed her mind and looked at the banner once more and at the photos in each corner but whoa the photos had seemingly shifted their positions and were now occupying the same flank of the banner hermione looked indignant what the she began but was cut off by george relax sis george said he and fred as well as all the weasley siblings with the exception of ron regarded hermione as a sister just as they regarded harry as one of their brothers hermione face was contorted with what harry recognised as a mix of amusement and disapproval both he and george burst out laughing while hermione looked on mollified george said come i ll show you around after all we owe you for this dontmention it harry began they spent the rest of the afternoon looking around the joke shop harry was impressed he bought a liberal supply of everything determined to test them out when they got back to hogwarts what a pity he wouldntmeet dudley till the next summer otherwise some of the joke shop items like flowering pasties and role reversal jelly would have been worth trying on his cousin even though he wanted to pay for everything george refused to accept even a single knut from him they had seen fred here and there but he hardly had time to say anything beyond hello clearly the shop was moving you know harry george had told him as he piled all his purchases on to the counter you still remain our financial backer and in case you didntnotice you are trying to pay for the very things that are made using the capital you supplied as for hermione she d seen the products on display and realized all too well that it was all the showy sort of magic as she put it okay maybe with a few slight modifications here and there it could really prove useful but it was still flashy stuff however she couldntdeny that she wasntimpressed however she wasntin the least bit interested when fred he d suddenly appeared out of nowhere and was now leading them on while george attended to the wails of a little girl who d just swallowed a banshee treat offered her a squawking toffee this made hermione squawk loudly every time a sound escaped her lips she d taken the toffee without question and realised only too late that it was one of the weasley twins who d offered her the same she d opened her mouth only to find a weird squawk emitting from her throat fred had whooped loudly at this while harry had snorted in a bid to control his laughter however the spell wore off after a minute and hermione treated fred to a long lecture about not giving such dangerous things to people who donthave the least idea about the same however one couldntdeny that fred and george abilities of timing their magic had improved since all the effects of their products wore off in precisely the same time as they claimed of course fred had told harry we accept special orders for making stronger doses but donttell hermione that come since the store part is now over let just hang out at the back george said yeah i presume that were ginny and neville are arentthey harry asked george nodded so what are they doing there harry asked george there are more things in a shop than only making and selling goods harry hermione interjected making it distinctly clear that she had a very good idea as to what job ginny and neville did albeit she was explaining everything to harry in a very motherly tone as if he was a small boy of about four or five years you have to fill out mailing orders address the feedback of customers give orders for the raw material and all those things ginny is working in those departments and so is neville fred picked up from where hermione had left off although we think that he might be here for reasons other than earning a few extra galleons and so he needs to be watched for george had come up to them by now and finished what fred had wanted to say suddenly it dawned upon harry as to why neville was there neville longbottom and ginny weasley together didntsound all that bad but there certainly was the impending problem of dean thomas ginny current boyfriend as if he had read his mind fred told him almost gleefully they broke up a week ago apparently he was eager to i think you should stop at that hermione interrupted or i ll tell your mum that you have been using the extendable ears again what harry asked apparently unaware of everything that was going on around him sorry harry george said but i dontthink we can tell you anything about this not with the twin threats of miss granger and our mum hanging over our heads they had by now reached a particularly crowded area of the shop and since they had to go to the back of the store it meant that their only way onward was to dissect the narrow gaps that the people standing their provided all right buckle up everybody fred shouted over the din harry smiled to himself without doubt the weasley twins had no comparison in theatrics fred shouted again let get through this crowd he signalled towards the crowd of middle aged women gathered near a particular product what are they doing here hermione shouted into harry ear unfortunately that was the only way to speak otherwise audibility would have been hampered considerably considering the noise that emanated from the talk of those women i mean arentthey mature enough for this they had by now reached the door that led to the back of the store this is something that happens when you spill a simple sleeping draught on our ton tongue toffees george explained with a wide flourish of his arms towards the shelves he had somehow inexplicably managed to hear hermione even amidst the din and was answering her now that they had the time and the space to catch some breath fred joined in and said this my friends is the latest and the most effective tool for de gnoming gardens this is the future of de gnoming he joined george with similar flourishes of his arms and it would have appeared to an outsider as if the twins had given up their pranks and taken up dancing this is the revolution that the world of de gnoming always needed george finished off harry snorted as the twins continued their charade albeit in very loud tones as hermione reached for the door and yanked it open so how does it work hermione looked mildly interested as they walked into a quite spacious and well ventilated working area well the gnomes swell to many times their size and then drop off into a deep sleep from which it takes them about a month to wake up fred answered by which time you can banish them to pretty much anywhere that you may wish george finished that interesting but how did well hi ginny hermione waved at the redheaded girl who d just walked into the office with a stack of envelopes under her arms and a small package in her hands hi hermione hi harry she greeted as her eyes landed on her friends will be back here in a moment hermione waved the younger girl off she then turned back to the twins and said so how did you find all this out actually we ve got to give credit to mum for that george replied how harry asked wondering if he was really imagining this or mrs weasley had really helped fred and george make one of their products and the most popular one at that when we apparated into our kitchen at the burrow that fine evening with our brooms clutched into our hands and recuperating after a severe bout of umbridgitis she got really worked up and started ranting off at us fred said we told her that our future had outgrown that of our newts and that we d got our resources together for opening the store however believe it or not she got even angrier than usual and waved her wand at the shelf a little too vigorously as she tried to summon a jar however as it happened a bottle of sleeping potion fell onto a pile of chocolates that we later saw actually were the ton tongue toffees and the rest as they say is wizarding history george ended from where his twin had left off and harry was faced to snort but where do the gnomes come in all this fred said as he put what harry had been thinking into words if harry didntknow better he would have thought that the twins had learnt leglimens as it happened we asked mum what our toffees were doing out there normally she wouldntstand the sight of them but she ignored us and just banished them to the garden the next day we saw the gnomes and well the conclusions werentvery difficult to reach to anyway when mum found that this stuff was really useful for de gnoming the garden george took up the narration she thought that we were really doing something useful the other twin snickered at this and we ve been pretty much flooded with these customers since we formally introduced this product about a month ago not that we are complaining though george continued business is perfect he gave a contented sigh as ginny came down and sank down into one of the chairs near them it wouldntbe perfect if it werentfor me and neville i am the one who does all this office work and neville sits at the billing counter ginny said dully yeah yeah as if you would be working here if our business was not here fred exclaimed well harry we d better be off there might be customers out there who need help he said this with a sly grin and harry couldnthelp but think that whatever happened no one in their right mind would try to ask the weasley twins for help i think i ll go meet neville harry said but you just met him hermione interjected well i want to meet him again some reason you know harry said and hermione rolled her eyes yeah but come back soon her voice assumed a softer tone as she said this hermione i not even going out of the store what do you think can happen harry said exasperatedly okay hermione said a bit sheepishly as harry gave her a peck on the cheek before going out to search for neville this surprised hermione since harry had never kissed her in public before ginny was watching this exchange between her friends with great interest immediately after harry left the room she asked hermione so what was all that about spill the beans quickly what hermione asked her in return trying to sound innocent and nonchalant about you and harry the younger girl asked her again nothing hermione said quickly too quickly perhaps but if it did not betray her attempts at concealment the fact that her cheeks turned a bright crimson gave her away is that so ginny asked a wicked smile playing at the corner of her lips yes hermione nodded i dontbelieve it she replied simply she now had a very good idea as to what was going on and was wickedly enjoying the sight of hermione fidgeting about in her chair clearly embarassed she said all right then let me take a wild guess you and harry got together didntyou hermione looked shyly at her friend and nodded whoa ginny squealed loudly this is some news i knew this happened why are we that obvious together hermione asked quickly no ginny replied but they dontcall me miss observant for nothing now tell me everything so hermione told her everything that had transpired between her and harry that summer of course there werentany lurid details so she could afford to do that wow ginny exclaimed as hermione finished however her voice took a serious tone as she spoke again does ron know hermione nodded again i guessed so ginny said then seeing the questioning look on hermione face she explained ever since he came back from your house he been well just not ron even his appetite has lessened if you can believe that hermione smiled weakly at this joke so ron knows ginny began again and and what hermione responded and how did he respond to your revelation ginny asked patiently hermione hesitated a bit before speaking she was not sure if telling ginny of ron behaviour would be a good idea yet she couldntdeny that she needed to talk to someone about all this normally she would have talked to her mother but that wasnta good idea considering the circumstances harry didnthelp either he kept going completely rigid and silent like a stone every time ron name was mentioned however she couldntblame him either ron had been a prat and deserved the silent treatment that they were giving him all these thoughts raced through hermione mind as she dwelled upon whether and how much to reveal to ginny finally she decided to tell her the complete truth maybe she could help in making ron see sense regarding her and harry so hermione began after a few moments silence he did not take it well at all she shook her head at this why what did he do ginny asked he said a lot of nasty things he and harry had a huge blow up and then and he hit me whoa the git how dare he do that ginny eyes shone angrily as she said no wonder mum was so hacked off at him and shouted at him for hours together what hermione asked faintly after they reached headquarters ginny replied mum asked ron to accompany her to the kitchen they were there for an hour at the least and when the door opened ron was really red in the face and mum seemed too angry for words i did not know about what though she d cast an imperturbable charm on the kitchen door but she has hardly spoken to ron since we reckoned it was because of how recklessly he d gone to your home but i know now that it was indeed something else but how could mrs weasley possibly have known okay so it was she who healed me but i told her that i d just had a fall nothing more do you think she d have bought that she must ve heard the shouting match that you told me of ginny said quietly were they loud yeah i could hear them down in the living room pretty much as if they were in the same room so i dontthink that their voices would not have reached the kitchen hermione replied thoughtfully but then it just not like mrs weasley sorry to say that but i would have thought that she d have gone up to stop the shouting had she heard i dontknow ginny replied but mum has somehow changed over the summer if you can believe it what do you mean ever since fred and george joined the order you know about that dontyou ginny glanced at the window sill as she said this an owl had just appeared on the window sill and she got up to untie the letter that it held up for him she took the letter and the owl flew off with a flutter of its wings ginny scanned the letter and sighed letter from dean honestly she rolled her eyes apparently he sorry and wants us to get back together the git when will he realize that i am ready to move on and will not reconsider anything even if he sends apologies daily she went over to the desk and scribbled a note and tied it to the leg of one of the office delivery owls and told it to deliver the letter to her ex boyfriend so when did the twins join the order hermione asked ginny as the younger girl was packing up the writing material that was on the desk about two months ago mum had a big blow up on the issue she did not want them to join but they were adamant and prevailed over her in the end ever since mum has been less bossy than usual she let us do whatever we want she given us more freedom that one of the reasons why i was allowed to take this summer job of course it doesnthelp that dad refuses to forgive percy ginny shook her head as she reached the last part of her reply percy has done practically everything but beg for forgiveness on his knees but still dad did not forgive him i never believed that i would ever see dad being so unbecoming and unforgiving hermione nodded to convey that she understood what ginny was implying she thought inwardly about this second war already before the war had begun in earnest it was bringing about great changes in the people that she d come to know over the years she shuddered to think about what could happen if things went further hermione spent the remaining part of the afternoon talking to ginny about more pleasant things like the owls and ginny appointment as a fifth year prefect finally after a hour and a half harry appeared with neville harry especially looked very pleased with himself as they made ready to leave hermione whispered to ginny ginny please everything i told you about harry and me please donttell anyone i we want to keep it a secret ginny looked sceptical but nodded nevertheless okay if you want that i promise i wonttell anyone with that harry and hermione made their way back down diagon alley to the leaky cauldron they were relieved to find that lupin was talking to tom the landlord waiting for them with a portkey they thankfully took hold of their purchases and safely reached the granger home hermione parents were discharged from the hospital the evening before the teenagers were to return to hogwarts ironically their doctor had succeeded in delaying their return by three days under the pretext of awaiting a blood report the night they came home there was a big celebration in the house lupin and nick were the order members present as hermione she was helped by harry made all the arrangements for her parents homecoming there was lots of food that hermione had cooked up harry had found out over the summer that hermione was a brilliant cook something that he had never expected from this studious witch like everything else except maybe for flying harry thought this facet of her persona very wonderful however the one thing that really irked him about all this was that he had had to carry the tonnes of food behind hermione as they made their way from the supermarket to the granger home evidently she had planned on packing the refrigerator and the larder with all that she could it was not a very complicated course or anything remotely like the feasts that harry was used to at hogwarts for one hermione had done all this alone she had insisted firmly on not being disturbed in the kitchen as she cooked and secondly the condition of hermione parents did not allow for them to eat anything exotic for sometime to come nick had informed them that certain spices could interfere with the working of the healing potions that they were still being administered the beauty of the dinner was in its simplicity and in the gay atmosphere that prevailed everyone talked nineteen to the dozen especially bob and julia they had made harry call them that instead of mr and mrs granger hermione had used her limited resources well to churn out something as fantastic as what she d done even as they sat down to eat lupin proposed a toast to hermione parents for the health of bob and julia granger two wonderful people and parents to the most brilliant witch i ve ever had the privilege of meeting lupin said hermione parents looked very pleased with this toast hermione blushed pink at this declaration everyone lifted their glasses which were filled with water and took a sip any form of fluid except for water and the healing potions was a strict no no for the grangers for some days and everyone else had decided to follow the same menu for the night harry smiled to himself as he remembered lupin seemingly serious yet playful smile while he proposed the toast clearly once a marauder always a marauder the rest of the night passed in a blur it was filled with food merry making and lots of light talk as harry went up to bed and kissed hermione before he went to his own room they had decided to sleep in different rooms that night even though what they had been doing was nothing beyond snuggling together he couldnthelp thinking tomorrow he d going to hogwarts tomorrow he d be back where he belonged yet he could not deny that despite all the things that had happened over this summer it had been simply the most amazing summer of his life author note here part 3 of chapter eight sorry about the delay but i had a virus problem netsky or something
