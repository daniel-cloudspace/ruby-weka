 chapter 13 the next day jackie and draco went to the library to work on homework draco said i ll see if i can find a book that might help us with this charms shit okay replied jackie as she sat down at a table shortly after draco left in search of some books gary approached jackie he had heard lots of information about this girl from harry and ron but he thought she was cute so today he finally got the courage to talk to her hi hi jackie jackie smiled but then frowned when he sat down next to her gary however didntnotice this jackie said hey what your name again gary okay sorry you just seem like such a different person when you attempted to rob my friend house wow that sounds weird not really well maybe a little jackie laughed do you have girlfriend gary looked shocked i ve got a real knack for hooking people up who did you hook up gary asked interested hermione and rocky and i working on luna and colt but colt doesntlike luna i know so that kind of creates a problem then there was a bit of an awkward moment hey you wanna see my gadgets gary said sounding like a five year old um sure this watch can do anything and i mean anything does it tell time of course what kind of watch doesnttell time gary giggled as he showed jackie his watch jackie smiled that cool oh you re working on the charms homework observed gary it so easy i did it in at least 10 minutes jackie looked around to see if draco was coming back really are you like really smart what your definition of smart say what just then draco came back no such luck jackie all the books have been signed out he then noticed gary sitting next to his girlfriend who are you gary giggles draco glared at gary oh right i remember you i was just showing jackie my gadgets jackie blushed and thought oh my gosh that did not sound right well i hope that you re done smartass draco said rather nastily draco exclaimed jackie be nice draco scoffed to it not a chance draco that was totally mean said jackie as draco grabbed his and her stuff to leave jackie sighed and followed him as they went past a couple of book shelves whose girlfriend are you draco said over his shoulder his anger getting better of him but we were talking no harm done jackie protested and he applebalm gang member if nehal finds out that you re hanging out with giggles draco snorted with laughter then she gonna strangle you i dontcare what she thinks anymore jackie said loudly several people looked her way draco was taken back at the outburst did you two get another fight again he smirked at her jackie ran her fingers through her hair and muttered tylenol what jackie looked at draco you re giving me a headache okay so did you and nehal get into another fight because you two are both important to me and nehal a great girl and she like a female version of me accept not so cocky but she needs your help and you always tend to assume shit what is going on 4 months ago you were declaring your eternal love for me now you re all like nehal oh nehal she such a great girl jackie it not like that okay were just friends it completely innocent hmm innocent eh yeah well what gary and i were doing was also completely innocent jackie walked away from draco feeling pissed hey we have potions together jackie spun around right in potions class professor snape said follow the instructions on the board and create a memory potion you may test it on your partner if you wish he looked at neville however some circumstances may prohibit some of you from doing this simple task neville gulped heather volunteered to team up with neville because she felt sorry for him nehal and jackie both awkwardly partnered up with their boyfriends danielle was about to go across the room to ian when diego came up to her oh hi diego ian raised an eyebrow at danielle diego said can i be your partner danielle glanced up at ian and she saw that casey was stroking his arm seductively a surge of jealously went through her body yeah sure why not she started up a pleasant conversation with diego about all the places that she had traveled to ian was red in the face with rage he felt like he had to do something my mom and i went to scotland this summer said danielle have you ever been there before nope but where was your father in all of this oh he was he was working at the time but you should go to scotland someday diego it amazing so i have heard danielle giggled what asked diego confused what are you laughing at your accent it so cute ian couldntbelieve what he was hearing his girlfriend was flirting with a different guy ian couldnttake it anymore he pulled draco aside and said ask jackie what going on between danielle and diego yeah alright man draco and ian did the guy fist thing draco walked over to jackie and kissed her on the cheek jackie couldnthelp but blush but she knew what he was trying to do he was using his malfoy charm on her it not gonna work this time she smiled at draco draco did the shifty eye thing jackie sighed draco can we talk yeah draco sat down next to jackie completely forgetting about what ian asked him to do okay i not sure if we have a problem or if i have a problem what the problem you re you and i me yeah but if i was you you d be dating yourself jackie gave him a weird look she tends to do that a lot lol what i mean is i do what i do and i like what i like and that just who i am i know and that what i love about you okay but the drugs you do with ian and cam i mean sean and the dark arts spells you do i not into any of that stuff and i never asked you to be okay you know i kind of enjoy the fact that we re different okay i really sorry about what happened earlier today it just that you re the first really great guy that i ve ever dated and that really scares me because i never gave a rat ass before okay but i do now that good because i give a rat ass about you too draco kissed her they smiled at each other draco then saw ian out of the corner of his eye looking angry draco rolled his eyes and looked back at jackie can i ask you something sure what up with danielle and luna luna lovegood hell no luna you know that mexican dude oh there friends like you and nehal jackie eyes then widened is ian jealous draco was about to say something but changed his mind never mind i shouldnthave said anything no what is it tell me well let just say smith is mad draco hesitated for a moment but he shouldntbe because he doing far worse then just some innocent flirting jackie thought for a moment her eyes went wide ian cheating on danielle she said loudly shh hissed draco you cantsay anything but draco danielle my friend jackie looked over at danielle she looked so happy you cantokay just not right now he gave her puppy dog eyes jackie smiled and then laughed okay okay i won t yet but someone going to have to tell her eventually i dontwant her finding ian on top of some girl jackie looked disgusted at that thought draco laughed but draco who is ian with now draco sighed and whispered panning casey panning draco nodded his head that bitch how long has this been going on for i dontknow i think i going to have a little chit chat with ian no draco quickly pulled her away from ian and casey table i dontthink that a good idea sweets just wait awhile okay eventually the couple started to work on the memory potion since jackie had a short attention span she kept looking back at danielle and then ian she couldntbelieve that ian would cheat on danielle they both loved each other jackie tip toed away from draco and walked over to ian and casey hey ian casey hey jackie what up asked ian you know that a very good question but nothing much is up with me but what is up with you my friend ian shrugged his shoulders nothing interesting muttered jackie casey said do you mind we re trying to work here are you sure its work your trying to do jackie said innocently duh now scram before i call professor snape draco then noticed that jackie wasntbeside him anymore he whipped his head around the room looking for her to his great surprise he saw her talking to ian and casey he walked over towards the group he tapped jackie on the shoulder jackie slowly turned around she saw draco who crossed his arms over his chest hey hottie so you re using my strategy now ian sniggered jackie replied i was just talking to and ian casey about work you know work w o r k work draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously i know how to spell work princess jackie shook her head well you never know i almost 17 and i still dontknow how to spell orange come on we ve gotta get back to draco was about to say work but then changed his mind and just pulled jackie away i told you not to say anything i was just talking to him t a l k draco rolled his eyes look i sorry again but danielle can not find out about this she doesnthandle bad news well at all so it gotta end before she finds out i agree maybe you should sort of take the reins on this one i would but i feel like its more your speed draco just stared at jackie meanwhile diego was supposed to ask danielle a question hi danielle laughed uh hello does professor snape ever wash his hair diego looked at snape with disgust nope i dontthink the word hygiene exists in his vocabulary diego laughed apparently it doesntexist in his vocabulary either he said directing his comment at draco he wearing gel diego oh i see nice try there there was an uncomfortable silence for awhile danielle watched diego stir the potion did you have potions at your old school no not really danielle laughed well that explains why you dontknow what you re doing diego also laughed and it also explains why i picked you as a partner danielle brushed a piece of her hair behind her ear i dontget it your really smart danielle and so ever gorgeous diego we already talked about this which is a very dangerous combination danielle smiled aww you re too kind again there was an awkward silence so danielle looked back at diego who wore an amused expression so diego said mimicking danielle they both laughed silence settled between them once again danielle looked over at ian feeling jealous as casey said something to make him laugh you are going to be an auror diego finally asks danielle nodded her head as she added some more ingredients into the cauldron yeah after hogwarts that sounds very exciting i sure you ll love it yeah danielle loves it diego laughed jamie looked at nehal it kind of cool that were partners nehal stopped stirring the potion and she looked up at jamie kind of cool no it cool nehal thought wow this is a lame conversation i think i going to shoot myself now jamie sighed look i know there something going on so just tell me tell you what i worried about you nehal is the riley situation still bothering you that not it yeah well what was up with you last night then a part of nehal just wanted to let her guard down and tell jamie about what happened with her family but she couldnteven tell her friends so how would she be able to tell her boyfriend jamie is there something going on between you and malfoy what you think that too jamie didntknow what to say he didntwant to get into a fight with his girlfriend you know what thanks a lot nehal started to walk away but then spun around and glared at jamie for the vote of confidence jamie followed her around the room aww lol hey look you ve been acting strange ever since we first walked into the heads room i know you nehal you re hiding something what am i supposed to believe nehal was furious you re supposed to give me a little more credit most of the class looked up from their work except for professor snape because he was having a deep discussion with sean jamie whispered to nehal okay fine tell me i have never and will never hook up with malfoy 1 he in love with one of my best friends and 2 he a slimeball if you dontbelieve me why dontyou go over and ask him yourself it was pretty uncomfortable for heather and neville to work together no no no neville eye of newt goes after hair of a maiden directed heather ahaha hair of a maiden oh sorry said neville it alright but next time read the instructions more carefully okay there was silence heather yes nev nev heather then cursed under her breath for calling him that where did tommy go oh he had to go back to germany for some lame ass reason oh and are you two still together er heather slightly hesitated we broke up in diagon alley so you re single again yepp but i wontbe for long heather smiled thinking of a special someone huh i mean yes i am single neville finally the frigid bell rang all the girls breathed a sigh of relief they had not had good day today the four of them decided to go to the room of requirements as soon as they all sat down on the couch it goes jackie heather nehal and danielle nehal immediately told her friends about what happened with jamie in potions np he was probably just concerned said danielle i guess but it still pisses me off growled nehal and you have every right to be pissed if my boyfriend accused me of cheating on him oh wait bad point never mind said heather everything going to be okay jackie assured nehal how about we do something fun recommended heather uh cantwe have a quidditch match right neh neh asked jackie nehal nodded her head sounds fun danielle said lamely well i guess jackie gets the last laugh she is the one with the stable relationship heather said with a laugh that got her smacked with a pillow thank you very much said jackie nehal and danielle rolled their eyes heather looked at nehal how about a game of wizard chess nehal smiled okay let go are you two guys coming or what um said jackie i just need to ask danielle some advice on something alright see you soon so that left jackie and danielle danielle looked at jackie so what did you want to talk about jackie sighed she had to tell danielle about ian despite draco protests you better sit down for this jackie i am sitting right well i dontknow how to say this but but what jackie opened her mouth but she just couldnttell danielle the words ian is cheating on you was like gibberish to her jackie danielle said starting to get worried yeah you were just about to tell me something right um i really dontknow how to say this but i used your pink maybelline eye shadow last night i so sorry i just couldnthelp it it was like staring at me jaxs next time you think of asking me if you can use my make up ask me first jackie nodded her head meanwhile in the slytherin common room ian and casey were busy making out draco said you know you re not very good with this let keep it on the down low thing ian looked at casey can you excuse us for a minute casey grinned certainly she gave ian a quick kiss on the cheek and departed ian glared at draco you told jackie didntyou well she had the right to know snarled draco do you realize what this means she going to tell danielle and then danielle going to dump me your way over your head smith i told jackie not to tell her yet how can you be sure of that how do you know she hasnttold her yet look man i thought you loved danielle i do and that why i dontwant to lose her well you re doing a good job of that draco exclaimed giving ian as thumb up ugh just donttell anyone else malfoy okay man but it not my fault when panning tells ott and beech and they start spreading rumors or confront your girlfriend draco headed to his own room shit muttered ian running his hands through his hair danielle looked at her maybelline pink eye shadow it didntlook like anyone took any alright everybody we can do this nehal said to the gryffindor quidditch team before heading out daryl stood beside nehal nodding and smiling his eyes fell on jackie and he stopped smiling because she was giving him the evil eye nehal continued speaking remember bash brothers you ve gotta keep the slytherins back when our chasers have the quaffle and stop getting into fights with each other when we re in a game the bash brothers nodded their heads the gryffindor quidditch team then walked onto the pitch danielle heather and the gryffindor cheerleaders cheered and waved their pom poms around great speech jamie whispered to nehal thanks i improvised replied nehal jamie sighed i sorry i went off on you i was confused i get it you know i ve been kind of all over the map lately too no no i you have every right to be mad at me i shouldnthave accused you of cheating on me although you already cheated on riley nehal nodded her head and hugged jamie they then kissed thought you werentinto pda at school hmm i coming around she kissed him again jackie smiled at them happy they were okay again fiona spoke into the microphone hello the quidditch match technically should be starting now right said madame hooch she blew the whistle and the game began everyone kicked off the ground and jamie caught the quaffle and passed it to nehal a slytherin tried to beat nehal with his bat but she kicked him in the stomach and scored madame hooch fell asleep so there was no penalty half and hour later gryffindor was winning 100 70 jackie saw a glint of gold up higher in the sky and went up to it with draco following closely behind hey sweets draco blew jackie a kiss and she giggled and blushed but draco took this time to get closer to the snitch no yelled jackie draco hand was almost touching the snitch furthermore the snitch darted away before draco could catch it he went after it but jackie used all her mojo to speed up her broom to get past draco draco was seconds away from catching it but jackie cut across him and caught it at the same time nehal dodged past the evil vicious psycho path beater and whipped the quaffle through the middle hoop gryffindor wins yelled fiona heather gave danielle a high five danielle laughed and then looked around for ian he usually came to meet her after the quidditch match but he disappeared as soon as it was over too bad because danielle wanted to comfort him lol hey danielle do you see mr von gooshy anywhere asked heather no what a loser he wonteven come out for quidditch games said danielle yeah said heather looking at the sun you re not supposed to look directly at the sun you know you cantlook at an eclipse either said diego from behind them oh hey have you seen ian asked danielle nope meanwhile draco i cantbelieve

thought since when does draco know how to use a telephone she walked over to him and just caught the last part of the conversation draco spoke into the receiver yeah i ll pay cash draco then noticed

of the conversations you guys were having with him okay it just seems a bit suspicious jackie shook her head not really danielle and jackie made their way over to nehal and heather who were sitting down in chairs looking like they were going to doze of any second hi guys said danielle cheerfully nehal groaned and mumbled are we there yet professor mcgonagall spoke practically answering nehal

draco hand draco rolled his eyes not caring okay so why exactly did you pay for better and bigger rooms asked nehal well you dontexpect a malfoy to stay in an average room draco said this statement as

all laughed and started to walk away bye jackie said draco winking at her jackie blushed and managed to say bye draco bye ian nehal walked ahead of jackie searching for the room 426 428 oh bingo 430

she and jackie both gasped when they saw what their suite looked like gonna live like this finished nehal if you want to see what it looks like go to started jackie beep a car honked outside so which bed do you want the window or the door asked nehal over the shock of the size of the room she remembered when she was younger she traveled a lot with her parents and they stayed in a couple of rooms like this before whateves jackie said still in shock she doubt the idea of staying in this room for two weeks would sink in jackie can we just make the best of this fine but i get the bed by the window nehal took the bed by the door she threw her luggage on top of it she walked over to a door which she thought was the washroom nevertheless it turned out to be a connecting door jamie opened it at the same time they both looked at each other jackie raised her eyebrow bam chica da na sang jamie ahaha i love that nehal sniggered so you ladies order room service mocked jamie jackie rolled her

there were some people barley wearing clothing some wearing tarzan outfits and some wearing gothic clothing this was defiantly going to be one unique clubbing experience the four best friends made their way to the dance floor losing their boyfriends in the process heather looked around the club everyone was dancing which wasntreally a surprise there were guys everywhere and heather saw one he was in the corner with an insanely large entourage and crowd of girls around him and he was really really really hot heather said that guy over there is really really really hot danielle laughed she then got a good look at the guy omg heather do you know who that is uh danielle didntgive heather time to answer dontyou remember heather he your prince charming the guy you jumped on heather looked

heather then left she went to go hide behind a plant near the hot guy lots of girls were asking for his autograph he had a little collection of men in suits only one of them looked like he was under 30 other than the hot guy that is can i have a picture oliver asked a girl sure oliver answered can i sit in your lap she asked again sure do you have a girlfriend the girl asked su i mean no i don t

the waiter scurried off heather giggled at a job well done but heather didntknow that someone else was watching her as she was watching oliver jackie walked over to a group of couches and sat down feeling tired from all the dancing she was never really the clubbing type like danielle was jackie bit her lip and crossed her legs feeling a bit uncomfortable because some older guys were staring at her her eyes scanned the club looking for draco just as she was about to give up draco came and sat down beside her hey sweets i was looking for you jackie smiled draco wrapped his arm around jackie shoulders you want something to drink um no thanks but um draco yeah what if we caught draco laughed jackie everything going to be okay besides i dontthink mcgonagall and snape are the clubbing types i dontknow i feel so guilty for doing this you know and if my parents found out i was here omg i would be crucified look maybe you just need something to take your mind off of it draco smirked at jackie how do you expect me to possibly do such a thing like that draco moved his arm down to her waist and gave jackie a quick kiss on the lips jackie stared at him politely confused what are you

jackie grinned in response but i hate when you do that answered draco jackie cocked an eyebrow at him no you don t a flicker of a smile tugged at draco lips i don t the couple then continued on with

danielle giggled okay come back soon i will replied diego through the loud noise he started making his way to the bar he stood there for about two seconds in the large line up when he decided it would be best just to come back later he started to head back to danielle when he saw an exotic dancer in a cage staring lustfully at him the exotic dancer licked her lips she looked like a paris hilton look alike join me huh asked diego confused what never seen a girl in a cage before she laughed diego crossed his arms over his chest feeling confused sure she smiled and got down from the cage letting another exotic dancer take over bridgett limper diego luna why dontyou show me what you got alright diego said beginning the dance off to lose control by miss elliot ciara and fatman scoop everyone cheered as diego danced amazingly he finished it off by doing a one handed cartwheel into the splits bridgett said impressive now watch and learn handsome bridgett started shaking really fast her boobs and butt jiggled as she danced guys went wild at this sight and started cheering her on diego knew he would have no chance at winning this competition if this bridgett girl was going to use her body to win he sighed okay i give you win bridgett smiled at diego buy me a drink danielle didntlike the feeling of dancing by herself where is diego she thought she then started to walk towards the direction of the bar almost there she suddenly stopped and saw diego with another girl oh hell no muttered danielle as bridgett giggled hey she shouted announcing her arrival to the scene danielle before diego could say anything danielle attached her lips to diego s he was hers finally danielle pulled away oh hi didntsee yeah there she smiled at the exotic dancer bridgett rolled her eyes hi so

stormed off heading towards the bar danielle diego chased after her dontbother i wouldntwant to keep you waiting baby what diego danielle gave him a chance to explain himself diego really didntknow how to explain himself he opened his mouth but no words came out danielle rolled her eyes pathetic she walked away angrily unfortunately jackie and draco saw this whole scene right before their very own eyes uh oh muttered jackie poor danielle we should go talk to the both of them and try to help draco sighed okay they both stood up jackie said so you go ahead and try to find diego while i no i am not talking to him he s he s okay so will you talk to danielle then asked jackie getting the hint that draco didntwant to help diego draco nodded his head i can do that good i ll see you later jackie walked off to find diego eventually she found him sitting outside the club sitting on some stairs and looking sad diego lifted his head up and saw jackie jackie waved at him and sat down next to him on the set of stairs hey hey are you okay diego no diego sighed i think i really messed things up with danielle hurt her pretty bad yeah you did okay not gonna sugar coat this one huh jackie smiled i know i not one for giving good advice that actually more of a danielle thing to do however if you really want to be with her still then maybe you should think about jackie shrugged just apologizing diego looked like he was considering it you know say you were sorry yeah i know i know diego nodded his head understanding sounds so simple when you say it jackie shrugged again i think that a good place to start okay uh do you happen to know where danielle is right now no but draco looking for her too i sure she still in the club diego stood up also helping jackie up he smiled at her can i ask you something sure did you have a crush on me in the summer jackie blushed um well i wouldnt really call it a crush i i mean i just think your really hot by this time jackie was red as a tomato diego laughed cool anyways i gotta go find danielle thanks jackie no problem meanwhile danielle was sitting alone on one of the bar stools drinking away in sorrow a shaggy haired guy sat down beside danielle danielle gave him a fake smile and then looked away buy you a drink asked the guy okay guy in need of a clue here one women send signals that was a brush off before you dip into your shallow pool of wit let me paint us a picture and save us both the trouble here your evening you are going to slink back off to your buddies laugh this off get wasted go home and make nice with

for style danielle laughed lightly she looked at draco where jackie she actually with your boyfriend you mean ex boyfriend you broke up with him asked draco no but i dontwant to go through it again danielle said this more to her drink then to draco draco did hear her i know smith was a jerk to you but he really was in love with you danielle sat there silent he still wants to be with you danielle looked up at draco and smirked mischievously which bastard draco said seriously diego luna danielle shook her head you cantdo this danielle talk to him just just tell him how you feel i know it scary and i know you had a tough time with smith but just tell luna if you can show him your heart danielle looked like she was going to cry any second or not because if you do he gonna guard with his life danielle took a deep breathe how do you know that draco stared at her then looked over at diego diego said softly i think i can take it here from here draco got up to leave diego patted him on the shoulder thanks man draco felt a bit awkward by this exchange so he simply just nodded his head and went to find jackie diego sat down beside danielle his eyes never leaving hers danielle took a sip of her drink waiting for him to talk i really think you re over reacting said diego overreacting overreacting we were just talking and we just finished having a dance off which she won but how is that possible you re such a good dancer diego yeah i know diego laughed out loud danielle raised an eyebrow so you think this funny no i just i want you to trust me i normally do but when 5 9 blue eyed pretty exotic dancer comes around i get just a little uncomfortable danielle crossed her arms and looked at her lap the next thing danielle knew she felt diego lift her chin and kiss her softly diego said why would i want that when i have my very own 5 4 pretty girlfriend with the most beautiful hazel eyes i have ever seen mean that danielle said looking up yes danielle smiled okay i forgive you

anyways how weird would it be if i just go up to some girl while she sitting behind a plant maybe she crazy and was hiding from people from the asylum the bouncers probably wouldnthave let her in said oliver wisely go look for her i dontwanna said darren like a little kid who didntwant to go and buy his cheese well i want you to you need a girlfriend it was 2 00 in the morning by the time heather

from under her he went to go change into his pajamas in the washroom when he came out danielle looked up at him he was staring down at her his dark brown eyes piercing into her he was standing tall with his shoulders back and his hair was slightly ruffled and danielle couldnthelp herself danielle got up and bravely walked over to him she kissed him on the lips the kiss heated up and diego lifted her up from around the waist and pressed her against the wall danielle wrapped her legs around his waist ow diego was running his left hand up and down her side and the other was tightly wrapped around her waist he lightly bit down on her lip as he pulled away and started to kiss down the side of her neck and to her collar bone danielle tilted her head to the side so he could have better access make love to me whispered danielle seductively diego pulled away and looked at her his eyes widened ww w w what you heard me danielle laughed slightly as she played with the collar of diego shirt i i know but tonight diego asked shocked no time better then the present danielle said as she went to kiss diego again but he started to talk yeah yeah there is danielle i want our first time to

this to be perfect and this just wasntright well i do replied diego danielle pulled away and stared at diego she released her legs from around his waist and he gently put her back down on the floor but they were still pressed against each other against the wall his arms around her waist and hers around his neck danielle walked away grabbed her pajamas and went to change in the washroom diego ran a hand through his hair wondering if everything would be okay 5 minutes later danielle collapsed on the bed she lay down on her side and diego crawled after her and slid up behind her he wrapped his arms around her waist and she placed her arms over his night diego night baby they were silent for a long time and danielle wasntsure if he was asleep diego yeah thanks diego kissed her neck

head on jamie muscular chest nehal your drunk jamie tried to push her away so this isntthe first time this has happened remember when we first met jamie did remember the first time they met they were dancing at heather surprise party she was drunk then too as they grinded to the music jamie knew it took a lot of courage to just go up and talk to her back then nehal didntreally know that he existed jamie sighed i remember nehal kissed jamie cheek come on jamie let make out jamie shook his head i can t yes you can it really not that difficult i know it nerve racking sometimes but you just have to go for it nehal then pinched his arm jamie kiss me right now nehal what what do you want to say nehal paused what say you jamie looked around the room i say this he picked up a book that was on the table and swung it at her head nehal looked a little out of it but then collapsed on top of him shit muttered jamie nehal woke up with a big headache and a hangover not cool ouch she mumbled rubbing

nodded man i so glad jackie back we sucked without her said westley jackie blushed while everyone thumped her back welcoming her to their tribe like trey liked to call it trey and mitchell had both come to the conclusion that hogwarts quidditch wasntgay it was actually pretty competitive and assiduous so this is not an ordinary quidditch match is it nehal asked mitchell no guys but there still a cup with a guarantee that our names are gonna be on there nehal said rather enthusiastically so what the catch asked jamie who was silent all this while nehal took a seat beside jamie and said well as you know this is to cheer up the student body of the school so the teams are playing in a tournament way it only three teams anyways she glanced at jackie and ravenclaws missing their captain she smirked at that thought of a missing riley so we drew in third ravenclaw plays hufflepuff and we already know the outcome the gryffindor quidditch team could hear the hufflepuff groaning as ravenclaw scored again yeah so what the drill asked westley well both the teams are missing a chaser fair play keeper has a bad eye to the left so that our right jamie joked nehal trying to make him feel better jamie made a face at his girlfriend jackie make sure we are at least 40 points ahead before you make an attempt to go after the snitch ravenclaw seeker not that good so do some fakes to wear him out jackie nodded perfectly understanding what nehal was instructing her to do jackie loved how nehal took quidditch so seriously it was one of her favorite sports and she liked the fact that nehal was captain the beaters are tough though nehal glanced at the bash brothers nothing we canthandle sweetie said trey winking at nehal both jackie and jamie saw this exchange jackie smiled while jamie frowned yeah we re the unbeatables mitchell grinned in the distance they heard fiona declaring and ravenclaw wins will they be any match to the gryffindors find out because here they come let go team let show what were made of nehal opened the door to loud cheers the song final countdown started playing in the background it like a song that pumps you up for sporting events and it just fun to listen to danielle and the other gryffindor cheerleaders performed a new cheer just for this special occasion fiona spoke into the microphone and here they come led by nehal pradhan quidditch captain and head girl and a good friend of mine moving on fiona then announced the rest of the team members in a bored tone of voice madame hooch took her place as a referee on the quidditch pitch captains shake hands nehal shook hands with a nervous boy filling in for riley fiona said the game has officially started the quaffle is taken by bell nice swerve pass it to pradhan no quaffle taken by ravenclaw chaser and he score no quaffle has been stopped by thomas quaffle has been taken by pradhan ouch nice hit by ravenclaw beater oh he a looker pradhan has dropped the quaffle taken up by wait who is that again oh that must have hurt two bludgers at once nice one bash bros quaffle taken by bell and he scores ravenclaw in position no gryffindor bell ravenclaw scores bell takes quaffle and scores again making it 60 10 jackie was listening to the commenting and saw the snitch the ravenclaw seeker was about to go after it when she blocked him she saw the snitch and went after it as fast as she could oh my god announced fiona cupping a hand over her lips in shock gryffindor wins the cup professor mcgonagall was so delighted she clapped her hands excitedly she cupped snape face and gave him a long lingering kiss fiona was about to comment on that kiss when mcgonagall gave her a stern and evil look fiona shyed away but then mcgonagall felt bad and gave her a hug everyone landed on the ground and all the gryffindors cheered and had a nice old group hug omg said nehal amazed i cantbelieve we actually won the quidditch cup this is so awesome i know jackie squealed and hugged nehal the cheerleaders cheered go go gryffindor go go gryffindor yeah alright we did it thanks to you nehal mitchell kissed nehal on the cheek making jamie instantly jealous that sweet kiss reminded jackie of draco she wished he could be here with her jackie then noticed colt in the distance looking glum jackie glared at him boy would she love to give him a piece of her mind danielle skipped over to the victorious group congratulations thanks where heather asked jackie danielle shrugged her shoulders i dontknow she never showed up nehal was getting lifted by the guys she sat on trey and mitchell shoulders let go party wahoo gryffindor rocks they all went and partied in the gryffindor common room jamie didntlike the fact that all the guys were all with nehal and were standing close to her his jaw clenched although he wasntone to use violence if something happened to nehal he would be sure to give his own team mates a knuckle sandwich they would never forget hey jamie said parvarti hey parvarti greeted jamie he made sure nehal could see him and then he kissed parvarti on the cheek making her giggle jamie then walked away casually ignoring nehal nehal excused herself from the guys and walked over to danielle and jackie who does he think he is she took a gulp of her butter beer he just making you jealous nehal explained danielle he playing you hot and cold gosh i hate it when guys do that to you it so annoying in a way it like their testing you just to see if you have potential really said jackie i never knew that nehal shrugged her shoulders i just happy that we won the cup with me as captain besides i dontgive a damn about him kissing skanks on the cheek nehal started dancing to the music that was being played she danced with every boy she could find excluding jamie because he was trying to make her jealous and she was just having a good time guys i gotta go said nehal where are you going asked westley curiously visiting daryl we ll all come said mitchell jackie jamie come on um i ll skip said jackie she was pretty exhausted from the match and just wanted to go to bed yeah me too jamie glared at nehal nehal shrugged and walked off with trey mitchell and westley behind her in the hospital wing daryl was lying in bed he had suffered some injuries from the battle this was his fourth day in the hospital wing along with many other students who had serious injuries so how were we daryl asked weakly brilliant we missed you said nehal pulling up a chair to sit beside him yeah ravenclaw sucked without riley said westley daryl laughed lightly nehal smiled at him daryl you re going to make a great captain next year thanks well we should probably get back to the party but get well soon dude said trey giving daryl props alright come visit me again it mighty boring here yeah i figured nehal said remembering the times she spent in the hospital wing she spun around oh daryl you re also going to be a great therapist when your older how do you know asked daryl you ve never asked me for a session nehal laughed i can just tell by the kind of person you are heather decided not to go to the quidditch match or the after party which she didntfind about till later she just wasntin the mood to be cheered up she went looking for timmy in the corridors but there was no sign of him anywhere just then a flyer blew in her face cat in free before 11 00 at the three broomsticks uh oh said heather she rushed over to the three broomsticks she went up to a random bouncer guy and gave him some money to be let inside stay away from my wife timmy meowed

that weekend the girls left to hogsmeade on the way their heather secretly drifted away from her friends heather went into dervish and banges to look for oliver because they were supposed to meet here it was where none of the hogwarts students went and heather wanted to keep oliver a secret because she felt guilty for using him to feel wanted since vlad was gone there wasnta way out timmy had insisted that she try to see other people hi said heather spotting oliver and sitting next to him hey replied oliver what do you want to do oliver stared at heather for a moment looking her up and down and said pineapples hey giggles shouted nehal spotting him in the distance walking around hogsmeade by himself oh no muttered jackie gary turned and around and walked over to the three girls hi

since i ve been elected by mcgonagall to be val victorian but i have no idea where to start well why dontyou ask nehal isntshe good with that stuff asked diego danielle gave him a strange look wondering why he was acting so sour because mcgonagall suggested for me to read some quotes by an important world figure and then she mentioned this charles dicko guy who i thought was that 4th year gryffindor boy who always smells his fingers diego laughed so obviously this is your area of expertise and not mine danielle looked at diego pleadingly can you help me diego looked at her and smiled how about tonight danielle smiled you re the best diego thank you she then ran back to nehal who was patiently waiting for her so how are things asked gary as he and jackie sat down together at a table in the corner of the three broomsticks he took a sip of his butter beer his eyes never leaving jackie s fine said jackie if you can afford one of these everyday you can afford guaranteed life

guy and did the splits ow anyways said oliver and they sat on the couch and he started playing guitar he was quite good at it heather leaned back and tried not to think of vlad everyday she longed for him but also to drink his blood she felt like a smoker who had just gone cold turkey she was so addicted to that blood oliver finally stopped playing and turned to look at heather look it was really good of you to come out with me but i can tell you dontwant to be here so i dontmind if you leave you donthave to go jumping into things again heather smiled lightly thanks for understanding but my
