 think gryffindor head girl huh came a voice from a compartment of seventh year girls inside the compartment sat 4 girls lily adea jane and kayla were about to start their seventh and final year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry lily evans was seen to be the leader of the groups she was down to earth and kind to almost everyone with her emerald green eyes and vivid red hair lily brought the redhead temper to justice and hogwarts knew that it was best to stay on lily good side lily was extremely clever and was top in many subjects with only adea and the marauders for competition adea qureshi was the quiet pensive and slightly invisible character underneath the quiet studious cover lay an observant girl a study of character and a loyal trustworthy kind and understanding friend adea silence led to the fact that almost all of hogwarts didntknow she existed and because of this her beauty was overlooked being of south east asian descent she had jet black hair olive skin and somewhat remarkable eyes the darkest brown with flecks of forest green adea was a bookworm and like lily often got top marks and competed for the best all round student she was best friends with lily and though lily was popular she was also respectful of the fact that adea did not want to be known and so allowed her to blend into the background when speaking with other people jane swales was the free spirit jane neither cared nor knew what others thought of her and this helped her to be at peace with the rest of the school she had dyed charcoal black hair with streaks of cosmo blue and silver mirror eyes which placed a mystical faraway look on her face though jane was as her best friend kayla said not always on this planet people knew she was there for her friends 24 7 her mystical aura could be dropped with the snap of a finger if she thought her friends were being endangered or were upset in any way though it was adea who could pick up sadness quickest her uniqueness combined with her dormant fierceness made many fear her kayla simmons was seen to be a character similar to lily how wrong those people were while lily was strong yet gentle kayla was stubborn headstrong outspoken and harsh her i always right attitude drove some up the wall and made it impossible to work with her while others found her endearing and the younger ones looked to her as an inspiration she had chestnut brown hair and sapphire blue eyes all four girls were striking but each in her own way our ickle lily made head girl we are so proud darling kayla teased shut up simmons do you want a detention no seriously lils congratulations thanks kay lily then turned around to jane and adea so what do you guys think it great lils couldntbe happier everyone knew you were gonna get it so which rules are you going to change first jane asked kayla rolled her eyes and lily raised her eyebrows and adea took the question into her own hands i dontthink lily gonna be changing anything just yet well done you were a cert thanks dee but you had just as much of a chance nah too quiet and if dumbledore announced my name at the feast they d think he d finally gone over the edge for appointing a non existent head girl she joked as the other girls chuckled jane and kayla went off into a conversation about their holidays while adea and lily continued so did your letter say anything about the head boy just the thing about the dormitories but not who it was but i figure it gonna be remus oh i can tell you that now it aintgonna be remus dumbledore been down that road he ll pick someone unexpected yet seemingly obvious wanna bet qureshi kayla who had heard the last part challenged oh you re on simmons but you re going to lose again aaaaaahhhh but this time dee i have it in the bag a galleon enough for you fine by me who else could it be lupin the only candidate for the job i warning you but she was cut short by the entrance of four seventh year boys the marauders there wasnta person at hogwarts who didntknow the marauders they comprised of james sirius remus and peter james potter the bane of lily existence james stood at 6 foot had untamed black hair and bespectacled hazel eyes lily had been the object of his affection much to the aggravation of his fan club since the christmas of first year and had chased her ever since always receiving the same answer no sirius black owner of the largest ego and stomach in hogwarts history sirius was slightly taller than james at stood at 6 1 with elegant brown hair and smoky grey eyes just like they did with james girls practically threw themselves at his feet and he like with james didnthave a problem with it remus lupin the only marauder lily could consider a friend remus had been a prefect with her since their fifth year and he along with sirius james adea and lily gained top marks frequently he stood at 6 foot had sandy brown hair and aquamarine eyes dotted with random flecks of yellow and green he wasntquite as popular as james and sirius in the female department but had his fair share of admirers who found his mysteriousness and shyness intriguing and lastly peter pettigrew the black sheep peter was short 5 3 chubby had dirty blonde hair watery dark shifty was pathetic and obsessed with food and also gave off an uncomfortable vibe no one ever understood why the marauders would even acknowledge peter existed let alone allow him to be part of their clique evans looking good this year as with every other year james started lily rolled her eyes while sirius looked around taking in jane and kayla for the first time quite a couple you ve collected here sirius drawled as lily darted a glance to adea who had conveniently hid her face behind a book so as not to be seen fyi we re people we dontget collected kayla snapped lily sniggered at sirius dumbstruck look no girl with the exception of lily had dared to say something like that to him lily stated with a smirk yes black as you cane see my friends will not swoon at the sight of you volunteer to spit clean your shoes or comply to your every whim but since you asked this is kayla simmons and jane swales and but she stopped after casting another look towards her best friend corner of the compartment sirius snorted something funny black jane barked jane he sniggered yes that my name got a problem what kind of name is that bit outdated if you ask me a n no offence to anyone called jane out there i think it a nice name but sirius is a berk remember it my middle name what kind of person jeers at another name what your first sirius pestered completely ignoring the last part and why should i tell you tell me he whined if it ll get you to go away then fine it snowflake jane answered not a hint of humiliation in her face but her answer had all the marauders with fists in their mouths and the girls minus jane who watched them amused scowling why snowflake james managed to sputter because i a muggle born and my parents are hippies they re not as narrow minded as you are they see a snowflake to be a beautiful part of the earth like an angel falling from the sky a fluttering individual they said i was a fluttering individual their fallen angel she replied dreamily with a hint of haughtiness this explanation had shut all of the guys up oh and black you ve lost the right to call me jane it swales to you kayla took hold of the situation before sirius had the time to reply so lupin where your badge you might want to put it on before the prefects meeting hope you re talking about my prefect badge because the head boy badge aintmine no it mine james muttered resentfully at this adea had taken her face out of her book and was sitting in her corner with a small smirk on her face kayla sensed this and turned around before you rub it in here your money all hail you you were right dee again just like you said and she pulled a galleon out of her pocket grudgingly when are you going to learn i always right sweetheart and she broke off there as she suddenly realised she had brought light upon herself she reddened slightly as she inaudibly whispered sorry i ll just take this continue and she pocketed the galleon and disappeared behind her book the other three girls exchanged pitiful glances while the boys turned around as if nothing had happened remus started off the conversation after a slightly uncomfortable silence so lily you head girl yeah i am james head snapped up quicker than you could imagine his face brightened instantaneously as he punched the air and lily eyes grew wide with horror and realisation oh no god no this is not happening to me eeeeeeeevvvvaaaaaannnns we have to share a dormitory this year james sang you listen here potter i ve wanted this since third year and if you ruin this for me then you ainthavin children ever are we clear crystal he gulped jane had apparently had enough as she groaned in frustration lily will you please take these four out they re trying my patience and you potter and lupin have a prefect meeting to tend to in approximately 3 minutes so i suggest you all leave now she said icily after sirius had cast a final glance at her he and the other boys edged quietly towards the door as lily quite contently strolled out with the tiniest of smiles on her face bloomin hell you d think it was my fault she decided to call herself jane sirius exclaimed you attacked her judging by the way you looked once she d said her bit you wontever do it again lily said james arm snaked around lily waist so evans will you go out with me lily took hold of the hand at her side and felt james freeze she stood on her toes and quietly whispered in his ear what does no mean to you she slapped away his hand and started to literally glide down the corridor to the head compartment sirius and remus smiled you re not even going out and you re already whipped mate james pinked slightly and ran to the heads compartment can you believe the nerve of him attacking me about my name like it anything to him what i call myself jane raved adea nodded in agreement and kayla continued the rant i know i always thought that lily was a little bit ott on the whole potter thing but i never realised how egotistical they are well listen i gotta check on my sister and the brunette left the compartment the two left turned to each other so between kayla and lily i never get a word in edgewise how was your summer jane i t was good hey i ve been meaning to ask you do you think i should have the blue taken out and burgundy put in burgundy where do you come up with this dunno so what do you think i like the blue you know i ve always wondered what your original hair colour was i a brunette jane replied darkly adea just laughed oh no the shame she mocked hysterically and jane just scowled my sisters a brunette she pointed out as if it were the most obvious thing in the world but her friend just looked at her quizzically oh for god sake for someone this smart you re not that sharp are you if we re both brunettes then we have something in similar hence we are not individuals so i decided i would take the step forward and my parents embraced my decision she nodded adea rolled her eyes and then said hey i am so sharp i have like a sixth sense for unhappiness i can pick up it up like a dog picks up food more like you can pick it up like pettigrew picks up food adea laughed while jane shook her head dee that was not funny that was just corny kayla walked in with a first year in tow sorry guys but i had to bring gabby with me i found her sitting with kids i know are gonna be slytherins hey gabrielle the other two chorused adea tentatively asked gabrielle were those kids your friends did you choose to sit with them gabrielle the first year shrewdly searched adea for a second as if looking for a fault and when she found none she replied in a tone not unlike her sister no of course not they came along and thought it d be ok to invade my compartment started asking me if i was a pureblood and whether i thought halfbloods should be accepted and didnti think mudbloods were just vile well i told them that yes i was a pureblood and yes of course half bloods should be accepted and that i knew muggle borns that could put them all to shame so they could take their prejudiced views and shove them where the light dontshine the older girls laughed with a proud manner adea said i knew you were like kayla but i didntknow she rubbed off on you that much and jane who had met gabrielle barely twice and was a muggleborn stated i like her kay where lily the younger girl questioned she got head girl so she off doing head girl business see i was right about muggleborns what about muggleborns came a voice belonging to a redhead at this all four girls chorused hey lily to which she replied hey gabrielle and i not saying hey to you guys i ve seen enough of you as it is she stuck out her tongue she took a seat and grabbed one of jane pumpkin pasties since the meeting had caused her to miss the food trolley lady and she was famished after she was satisfied she said sorry jane i know black should be saying this to you but he never will so i might as well it was wrong of them to make of fun of your name and if you wish to plot their deaths that fine with me no lily that would be stooping to their level that not how things work for me but i will get him back dontyou worry potter try anything doesnthe always she called back warily as this was getting quite routine for her lily turned towards gabrielle so starting hogwarts eh you ll be in gryffindor right i mean do you guys have any other house history my mum s side has a ravenclaw thing going and my dad a gryffindor thing so it very much 50 50 aaaaaahhhh i see well gabrielle what house do you want to be in jane put in kayla snorted god you sound like one of those wise old uncles you meet at weddings and stuff anyway back to the question i dontreally know ravenclaw are supposed to be the smart people and gryffindors are the brave ones which is pretty cool plus they are smart i mean look at lily and didntyou say the head boy is in gryffindor what do you think oh stop calling me gabrielle just say gabby she finished as the older four looked at each other and chanted gryffindor yeah but i cantmake the decision that the hat job isntit this is where adea came in nope i have that covered worked it out in our fourth year i asked all the gryffindor first years leading up to that year what house they actually wanted to be in and they all said gryffindor so i think all you have to do is truly want to be a gryffindor and the power of your will aids the hat to make the decision all the girls stared at her in amazement and she blushed what i was interested but jane shook her head now that little miss boffin has said her bit you know what to do remus suddenly came in and said hey guys you d better change hogwarts is barely ten minutes away once the girls had finished changing and brushed their hair one last time they started to make their way to the exit lily had to meet james and help out any second years who were using carriages for the first time just as gabrielle was getting into her boat lily whispered remember gabby think gryffindor she and james then parted to get in carriages and were on their way to the start of term feast for the very last time a n well there you go please review disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me in this chapter most dress descriptions belong to the site which i found them on so even the dresses arentmine a n this chapter goes around in a slight circle because this story moves too slowly and i need to get halloween over and done with the dresses are slightly dressy and americans would think prommy but i not bothered halloween life really long it just time that short remus sat in the common room alone the day before halloween sirius was off planning some rank on his own but had promised to discuss the basics with remus james was caught up with halloween preparations which were taking twice as long seeing as he and lily were on even worse terms than before and peter was well in all honesty remus didntwhat peter was doing but he wasntwith remus or the other guys so he found himself alone not that he cared last night had been a full moon and he was recovering from it so he just lay on the sofa in an almost deserted common room kayla simmons was running an errand for lily lily had foolishly left her wand in the common room and had only just realised lily would ve gone and got it herself had james not chosen to make a comment on her unusual disorganisation the two were caught up in a heated argument so kayla thought she d best slip off and get her wand for her she said the password pumpkin pie and went in she immediately went to the coffee table where lily had previously been working completely ignoring the person on the sofa in front of it the coffee table was there but the wand wasn t kayla started whispering frantically as she often did when no one was around and she was annoyed where the hell could it go lily is gonna freak when she finds out her wand missing could ve sworn it was on the coffee table ok let think think if i was a wand where would i go talking to yourself is the first sign of madness you know called a cool voice completely breaking her train of thought shit he been here the whole time just had to be him didntit uuuumm hey lupin didntsee you there yep i gathered as much call me remus why didntyou tell me you were there oh i dunno i guess you re right though you might ve accidentally come and sat on top of me not that i would ve minded of course kayla blushed and looked away but remus had already seen the red what this he propped himself up held her chin to make her look at him kayla simmons blushes well i never he said but she was too busy looking at his fingers which were placed under her chin still he noticed and let go blushing profusely hah see remus lupin blushes too you know i always thought you were quiet and shy but you are slowly proving me wrong guess i dontknow you as well as i thought he leaned over to her ear and whispered oh there a lot you dontknow about me his voice so close to her sent shivers down her spine he backed off a little bit what the hells gotten into me i acting like james or worse sirius listen i sorry i dontknow what came over me just then he apologised but kayla smiled oh dontbe i rather enjoyed it and she winked remus eyes widened wait does she like me too no shit sherlock do you really think so uuuumm anyway so what did you think of arithmancy not exactly going easy on us are they kayla was a little bit disappointed they had gone from flirting to homework i not that bad am i course you re not just ask him ask him what if he likes you or not no why not he might say no i d be mortified you ll never know if you dontask you re rather annoying i shutting you out now she tried to test the waters what do you think of astronomy remus he glanced at her anxiously but let it pass dontlike astronomy i bet you don t what do you mean oh we were on the topic of school subjects so i just thought right well i like dada it really interesting and i was thinking that maybe after hogwarts i could maybe come back and teach it because it not like hogwarts has the best track record for dada professors i mean we ve already had two who ve left one came back one summer mentally deranged and the other left for but he got cut off by kayla randomly leaning closer and giving him a light kiss kayla simmons gasped at her stupidity and started frantically muttering again oh my god oh my god oh my god of all the foolishness she glanced at remus who was still in shock she sprinted at break neck speed across the common room and up the dormitory stairs remus however was still in awe of what had happened but he also realised that his shock hadntexactly screamed the message he wanted it to scream so the great lily evans finally faults oh it was one time potter get over it so what are you saying you re faultless oh but you are no stop thinking that sorry habit no i and i well oh shut up potter aaaaaahhhh the art of reason and you certainly seemed to have it mastered dontyou evans lily stuck up the finger now would you drag your enormous head over here and levitate some of these pumpkins no aaaagggghhh you re impossible why not because i dontwant to neither do i einstein who the hell is einstein who bloody cares just levitate the damn pumpkins do it yourself and if you were einstein you d be able to see i donthave one which is why i asking you to levitate them aaaaggghhh you re such a bloody prat evans evans quieten down young ears about you know now deliberately trying to wind her up lily wasntstupid she saw right through him oh i ever so sorry potter how silly of me to get angry at your folly and she finished the sickly sweet sounding sentence with a matching sickly sweet smile yes rather moronic of you wouldntyou say he added she was seething now but flashed him another this time very strained smile she turned around and used mr filch ladder oh for god sake evans but he couldntfinish the sentence on account of the scream that finished it for him james turned around and saw lily on the stone floor with a collapsed ladder next to her he ran to the huddle of prefects behind her lily lily he turned on one of the prefects what the fuck happened to her what did you do james continued to stare at her face her eyelids hiding her beautiful green eyes which were probably tainted with fear underneath their covers her pale complexion with the contrasting red hair decorated randomly around her face one arm here and the other there i d didntdo anything y you a and her had a f fight and and she was was still angry so sh she w wasntpaying att attention and she fell off and and her head it wasntme honest he shook his head fearfully but james wasntdone yet what do you mean she hit her head but here waqar took over alright calm down potter she fell down and hit herself head first you had better call madam pomfrey now james shook his head no mohsin you go get her i staying here the rest of you get back to work the head girl may or may not be able to help us for a while and even hell knows that she does 90 of the head work on her own they all turned around more in fear of facing james wrath than anything else in all if this out of the corner of his eye he noticed that the slytherins remained completely unfazed by the whole episode he narrowed his eyes but nothing else please lily be ok i ll never forgive my self if you aren t i didntmean anything of what i said ok i kind of meant what i said that other day but after that it just been an act lily please believe me shit what am i saying you canthear me you re unconscious or you could be internally bleeding where the hell did mohsin get to just then filch walked in through the door and spotted his ladder on the door the fall had scratched the ladder badly what happened to my ladder boy why is it on the floor what she doing there you i didntthink even you would be thick enough to leave an unstable ladder when you knew one of us was going to need it dumbledore will hear about this argy and hopefully we ll get a blessing and you ll get sacked why would you little brats need a ladder when you have you have your precious wands oh that right because you cantuse a wand to save your fucking life can you filch was tomato coloured now oh i ll tell dumbledore mark my words not until i done telling him how you tried to kill lily get out canttell me to get out boy i said get out filch left muttering darkly under his breath at the same time waqar and the matron walked in where is she where is she the poor dear oh there she is can tell that hair a mile off and she scurried off to the casualty james hovered above her is she badly hurt is she internally bleeding will she have amnesia madam pomfrey sighed no no and no she ll be out for 12 hours at the most plus rest but it just a concussion james bit his lip will she miss halloween oh no dear she ll make halloween i daresay dumbledore wouldntwant an unconscious head girl on halloween james brightened slightly listen i have to tell her friends if she miraculously wakes up while i gone tell her i really sorry and he walked swiftly out of the great hall because the last thing he wanted to see was lily pale expressionless face knowing that the last probable emotion she d had before passing was immense anger because of him james went straight to gryffindor tower there had to be at least one of her pack up there he went through the portrait and the first person he saw was remus he remus was sitting on the sofa holding a book though james knew he wasntreading it because his eyes seemed to be transfixed onto the same spot moony any of evans friends around james asked hurriedly huh oh right yeah kayla up there why remus replied absentmindedly evans fell off a ladder and passed out what hang on i need to tell simmons he started to make his way up the girl stairs suddenly a loud wailing klaxon like sound erupted and the steps melted together to make a smooth stone slide he slid right down and landed damn it remus how do i get up there james shouted in a frustrated manner use your broom you idiot oh yeah thanks moony accio silver arrow a beautiful mint condition broom hovered down the boy dormitory stairs and flew into james outstretched hand he mounted the broom used the floor to give him a good kick off and flew right up the girl dormitory steps james found the right door and walked in kayla was sitting on her bed which was on the other side of the room holding a book though james noticed she was doing exactly remus had been staring at one particular spot as if dazed simmons simmons she looked up and jumped what the hell are you doing here how did you get in here he held up his broom and shook his head no forget that listen evans fell off a ladder in the great hall and is currently probably lying in the hospital wing concussed kayla eyes were masked with terror what oh my god what happened she said quietly her and me we were fighting well you were there when it started well i sort of carried it on more than i should have she got really mad and got the ladder and was just about to tell her to i d do it when i heard a scream i turned around and she was on the floor kayla grabbed him by the collar dumbass you couldnthave helped her out before could you you are such a a there no word strong enough to describe how thick you are she yelled furiously james winced i know i know is there anyone else here you can get kayla nodded hang on we ll have to get jane later she out somewhere with sirius dee dee seriously get out here lily in the hospital wing adea came rushing out of the bathroom hair dripping wet and clothes which looked like they d been worn in a space of two seconds what happened to lily what do you mean lily in the hospital wing she panted and here she cast a glance towards james well according to potter she fell off a ladder and is currently out cold kayla explained we re going to the hospital wing the three of them left as they came to the common room remus got up and left with them but kayla was too preoccupied to notice adea let kayla lead and held james back a little i know two things one you had something to do with this and two she missing halloween isntshe james nodded and then shook his head in answer to the second question you realise this is the second time you ve hurt her adea pointed out solemnly you must know i didntmean to i d never intentionally hurt lily especially not physically i wouldntbe able to live with myself james said in a pleading tone adea gave him a stern look and sped up to catch kayla as they walked into the hospital wing james and kayla started to frantically search the room but remus and adea rolled their eyes and walked straight to the bed in the middle on the right with the curtains drawn james and kayla followed madam pomfrey came out from behind the curtain and said oh you re here now i not entirely sure you should see her right now james took this completely the wrong way why it serious isntit isntit you were lying to me werentyou werentyou he said hysterically in one big feverish breath madam pomfrey looked taken aback and just indicated for them to take a look as soon as james eyes fell on lily he felt a huge pang it wasntthat she looked any different or had like a hundred drips coming out of her he just couldn t the other three just stared not one of them had ever seen lily look so pale which was an achievement on her already porcelain complexion but now she d gone from english porcelain doll to chinese porcelain doll a few minutes later madam pomfrey reappeared yes she doesntlook too good does she they all shook their heads mutely she hasntlost blood or anything it just the fear she felt she hasntlost a drop of blood not a drop on my honour in fact she in a perfectly healthy and stable condition considering the length of her fall the group did perk up considerably however they continued to look on not knowing what to do or say now that the initial worry of why the hell does she look like she in ghost land was over kayla and remus both seemed to notice that the other was in the room as well the tension for two mounted even higher james looked confusedly onwards but adea smiled she whispered something to james who smirked yes well me and he turned to look at adea who had been sitting behind james the whole time shook her head fearfully james continued i mean just me all on my own are i mean am off to get evans and adea gave him a poke i mean lily some lilies would you believe it so we ll just leave you two on your own you wontmind will you both opened their mouths but james beat them both right thought not off we i mean i go then both sniggered quietly and left the room and they didnteven know the half of it neither spoke for at least five minutes and remus realised she just wasntgoing to make the first sound so he cleared his throat then he laughed lightly bewildered why are you laughing you re sitting in a hospital wing and you re laughing kayla asked incredulously he stopped but still smiled convenient isntit that he happened to leave us together alone kayla coughed and still refused to make eye contact she continued to look at lily oh and why is it convenient she asked quietly oh please you cantpretend that thing in the common room didnthappen watch me thing what thing in the common room what thing in the common room kayla he said sternly remus she said identically remus smirked you cantrun away from it i do believe that what i doing run away from what what are you talking about remus sighed you re not going to make this easy are you nope not at all make what easy fine i ll say it kayla the kiss she couldntpretend to be thick now oooohhhhh that uhhh what about it well uuhhhh why kayla was most definitely mortified now ok pretend not to care be the kayla the kayla that usually walks these corridors blunt and outspoken blunt and outspoken blunt and outspoken well i oh for goodness sake remus i like you ok why do you think i did it well that s but kayla couldntlet him speak she d been humiliated enough already no remus stop forget about it ok this conversation never happened so what you dontlike me i well no yes yes i do but i cantwait for your reply i ll uhhh see you later bye and she hurried out of the wing remus sat in silence until he finally said to no one in particular because the truth is i like you too kayla simmons mate what up where simmons said a voice remus turned to find james and adea standing behind him with a load of assorted lilies and starlillies she left we were actually getting somewhere and she left adea shook her head and placed the flowers on lily bedside stupid girl and silently walked out remus who had of course taken absolutely no note of adea at all just shook his head and said i going up to the common room you coming no you go on i ll stay good luck mate james said yeah with her patience i ll need it they both smirked and the two standing left meanwhile one very dangerous item was in two very dangerous hands ok who do you want to find next oh oh find lily bet she fighting with james sirius laughed at her simplicity the marauder map was in her command and all she wanted to do was find where her friends were but he looked anyway right well according to this hang on evans is in the hospital wing and james is there as well hm well james is pacing the spot and evans but jane finished his sentence is not moving which must mean oh god what kinda friend am i come on sirius at the hospital wing nothing much happened sirius and jane got there jane almost screamed at lily complexion but james explained everything before she had a chance the explanation however resulted in jane repeatedly hitting james hard over the head until sirius finally managed to drag her out kayla simmons i can not believe how stupid you are oh thanks she huffed i not apologising he likes you too dumbass a lot actually adea shouted smacking her friend over the head but can you prove it yes actually i can lets think oh i know just last week we were in history of magic everybody asleep except lily and me lils was of course drinking in binns every last word and i tuned out for a while so i look at remus right and do you know what he was mumbling in his sleep god knows what he was dreaming about but he kept going stop that kayla seriously stop it i trying to work and she finished the quote with a shudder but kayla just stood their with a faraway smile on her face adea snapped her fingers kay kay oh you need help the pair of you adea cried and she threw her arms up in frustration and shoved kayla out the door kayla descended the stairs with that faraway smile still on her face at the bottom of the staircase she saw remus who was obviously waiting for someone please let it be me oh hello remus she greeted there you are he was waiting for me listen dontinterrupt me kayla she nodded and listened attentively as he started up again ok what happened in the common room was unexpected that why i didntsay anything but truthfully if you hadntkissed me i would ve done it myself eventually oh and about the hospital wing i like you too a lot i really do and here she opened her mouth but he held up a hand making her stop immediately and sigh oh he so determined that is so cute i not done now before you have time to run off would you like to go to the halloween dinner with me tomorrow kayla was stunned but managed a sure after a few seconds she jumped up flung her arms around remus and squealed he laughed she gave him a peck on the cheek and rushed upstairs to tell adea just what had happened as she gleefully left remus ran his hand over his cheek and smiled it had been a long day a few hours later it had gotten to 4 30 am and it was officially halloween however one raven haired boy still waited for his sleeping beauty to wake from her spell james didntnod off his eyelids didntdroop nor did his eyes glaze over for a second he merely sat and gazed at her intently sometimes he could ve sworn lily had stirred but when he blinked there she was still lying there the same as in the great hall no colour in her face no nothing please lily please lily why wontyou wake up listen i know you canthear me but please i begging you get up dontmake me feel any worse he pleaded with her unconscious body james called a feeble voice his face changed from pained to ecstatic with the snap of a finger lily oh thank god you re up james said gratefully up i haventbeen up where where am i lily asked nervously as she started looking around the room do you remember anything lily thought right ok brain in gear last thing last thing so i was fighting with james potter oh who cares anyway he wouldnthelp me so i grabbed filch ladder then what happened then the ladder collapsed and you fell and everything went black remember oh yeah i fell he nodded solemnly just looking at his face made lily remember the fear she d felt and the way her heart had jerked when ladder started to give way and how she was too petrified to scream at first but when she finally managed it well she couldntremember anything after that before she knew it she had flung herself onto james and was sobbing into his shoulder he looked startled and didntknow what to do oh my god james you have no idea i was so scared i i was fighting with you and i dontmean to be so mean to you really i don t the words they just come out of my mouth and i donthate you as much as i say i do r really i d don t and it was so scary and nobody was n noticing that the ladd the ladder wasntsturdy and and then it started to fall and and lily wept james stroked her hair gently alright lily that enough now it gone you re alright come on look at me look at me he soothed she lifted her head up and looked into his eyes i here now and so are you all that all the fear all that it all gone but the things you said you were right i didntknow i was such a bad person and and the s slytherins i r realised that they make fun of me for a reason and i dontdeserve my grades or friends i dontd deserve a anything no lily now i dontknow why you listened to the moronic things i said but just forget them and the slytherins lily donteven get me started on those prats now i going to go tell madam pomfrey you re awake and give you a few minutes to calm down she nodded and let the pillow soak up the last of her tears madam pomfrey someone groaned from the midst of a dark room somewhere in the back of a hospital wing potter what are you still doing here boy no it just lily woken up i thought you d like to know a dressing gown went zooming past james head and flew into an arm soon madam pomfrey came out from the shadows of a very dark room god i know people like the lights off when they sleep but this is a bit much isntit let go mr potter she yawned and followed him out of her bedroom a surprise met them when they came into the main hospital wing not only were lily curtains now wide open but dumbledore was standing by her bedside happily conversing with lily at 5 00 am madam pomfrey was just as confused as james headmaster what are you doing here at this time of the night morning even dumbledore eyes twinkled ah you see poppy i just cantget to sleep tonight so i thought i d take a little nighttime stroll so i was walking past the hospital wing and i thought well who better to get me to sleep than you with your amazing variety of tonics and medication well when i walked in here i saw miss evans now it just so happens that last night professor mcgonagall and i made a last minute decision about halloween concerning the heads but because of miss evans accident we were unable to tell them madam pomfrey nodded james spoke up what was it you needed to tell us professor yes i never got round to telling miss evans so i ll tell you together professor mcgonagall and i have decided that as a formality we would very much like for you two to attend the dinner together now if you two have dates we are very sorry but i afraid you ll have to cancel on them also we know that you two arenteach other favourite people so we thought this would provide you with some nice getting to know each other time dontyou think so are there any objections dumbledore asked brightly he looked around james looked indifferent but was over the moon inside lily wasntquite as enthusiastic james was the reason i fell off that ladder yes but he stayed here for like 12 hours straight waiting for you to wake yeah that was sweet but i ll have to cancel on oh you donteven like him that much lily she lifted her head hmm what the matter james asked have you already got a date she said completely ignoring his question nah but practically every girl asked you lily said incredulously yeah but none of them were pretty enough i mean they were alright lily bit back a comment just remember 12 hours 12 hours what about you did you have date he asked she nodded jason freeman oh james said feeling disappointed lily nodded so what are you going to do do i have a choice i just feel so guilty want me to come with you james offered would you sure thanks listen you d better get to sleep and i d better head back to the chamber we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow she nodded waved and turned around he got up and just as he was about to walk out the door he heard a voice and james yeah thanks again for everything he smiled and left for his chamber this time determined to keep this whole discussion to himself the following morning both jane and sirius were up early jane was determined to see lily first after being the last last night and in between she had somehow managed to drag sirius into the whole thing as well so now at 7 30 jane was dragging sirius out of the portrait hole to go to the hospital wing why do i have to go with you sirius whined we are going to see lily ok so why am i going repeated we are going to see lily jane answered stubbornly i not getting an answer on this am i i just dontunderstand how your mind works sometimes we are going to see but sirius crushing his lips onto hers cut her off she didntkiss him back but didntstop him either after a second sirius realised what he d done he backed off and just stared at her her silver eyes bored into him but like once before were too glassy to really see anything jane raised her hand and slapped him hard a red handprint started to form on his cheek she continued to walk towards the hospital wing he followed after her jane jane please listen to me she kept walking jane please be reasonable she kept walking he took a deep breath snowflake she stopped abruptly and turned around nobody ever calls me that i haventheard it in a while thanks for that sirius groaned see that why i kissed you jane i sorry we re friends now but i still want to be so much more and when you go off on your faraway tangents for some reason the way your eyes mist over and everything well you look so so sexy no breathtaking i cantget rid of my feelings for you i just can t he explained nervously running a hand through his hair we re going to the dinner today sirius smiled on a date as friends jane replied simply he groaned and now we are going to see lily she continued on her way to the hospital wing when they got there they saw a redhead propped up on her pillows arguing with the matron but madam pomfrey i head girl i have to go and supervise the last of the preparations and o k the menu miss evans you may go at 10 o clock and at 10 o clock only madam pomfrey scolded madam pomfrey you dontunderstand i have to go and i tired of staying here lily reasoned welcome to my world the matron replied sarcastically look i perfectly o k see i arguing with you without collapsing arenti madam pomfrey shook her head miss evans what is so wrong with waiting another 2 and a half hours what so wrong is that its just 150 minutes of my life unnecessarily wasted she cried you re being rather dramatic dontyou think madam pomfrey laughed i seventeen it what i do a n her birthday hasntrolled around yet jane and sirius watched from a distance amused lily spied them jane black thank god you re here she wontlet me out madam pomfrey looked relieved as well oh yes i rather grateful as well you may be able to keep her occupied for at least five minutes the older woman sighed lily turned back round oh you cantget rid of me that easily you know i ll just get one of these two to fetch dumbledore eventually i ll be out of here before ten the matron had had enough she threw her arms up in surrender alright alright fine i ll get you another pepper up potion and then you may leave with miss swales and mr black lily gave her a sweet smile and madam pomfrey grudgingly returned the gesture she then went to her cabinet to get some of the potion sirius grinned not bad evans lily surveyed him and then looked to jane and then back again black you call me lily i call you sirius if you re jane friend i guess i ll have to put up with you as well i cantstand being called evans for too long sirius grinned and lily smiled in return so you two going to the dinner together sirius pinked and conveniently looked away and jane looked uncaring yes as a matter of fact we are just as friends though lily laughed riiight nudge nudge wink wink lily i canteven begin to think of what you re implying jane said in a mock scandalous tone both girls laughed and sirius just looked puzzled ok what happened here miss evans i have your pepper up called a voice ugh finally lily timidly took a sip as her ears started to smoke she scrunched up her face and when it passed she relaxed the head girl then jumped out of bed lets go people she beckoned and flounced out of the room jane shook her head and sirius looked bewildered but both followed the skipping girl out of the hospital wing when they finally reached the great hall jane and sirius departed before lily got a chance to ask them to lend a hand she strode into the great hall many of the prefects waved and asked of her health but she noticed the slytherins werenteven surprised in fact they didntflicker an eyelid or anything james the raven haired boy turned around and hugged lily she laughed and hugged him back you re happy she commented yep you re out i was getting scared how much did you need to fight with her james said referring to madam pomfrey half an hour how are things going over here good except we were anxiously waiting for your return why why couldntyou do it because you made that stupid rule about everything has to be okayed by me and you remember not just one or the other oh yeah forgot about that sorry well you d better whisk round and say a ok a ok it my new thing dontput me down evans hey james yeah lets not fight again ok i think it safer he grinned you bet lily spent the rest of the day whizzing around consenting to the plans flashing smiles humming and whistling it was about 2 00 that she realised she unfinished business with a certain ravenclaw james james was occupied with some house elves james he turned around and nodded to indicate that he d heard her he left the house elves with the hufflepuffs and glided over to lily what was with the shouting what up two words jason freeman she merely said shit come on they scoured the corridors on their way up to the ravenclaw tower they were looking for a boy about 5 10 in height wavy dark brown hair and light blue eyes in the charms corridor they finally crossed paths with the gorgeous ravenclaw lily jason freeman exclaimed but his face darkened when he saw james potter he nodded curtly lily what are you doing with him you re my date remember lily was slightly surprised at his behaviour yes i your date not your girlfriend anyway that what i came for listen this morning when i was in the hospital wing dumbledore came to me about something lily started he indicated for her to continue well he said that as heads james and i had to attend the dinner together jason took a minute to digest the information he then looked to james and grimaced how convenient for you oh well evans too bad i ll have to go with one of back ups back ups you had back ups lily yelled in outrage jason looked at her as if it was the most obvious thing in the world uh yeah just in case something like this came up james wand was now out and ready to go lily shook her head disgustedly let just go james he a waste of a hex she spat at his feet you arenteven worthy of that and left with james who currently resembled the cheshire cat what a bastard a complete and utter bastard james muttered darkly on lily behalf james do all guys do that lily asked do what act like bastards do they all have back up dates no i ll admit there are more like him but the rest of us are decent enough to stick to one girl right what time is it james looked at his watch 2 45 we d better get back to the hall he nodded and they made their way back to the hall at 4 00 lily stopped working and made her way over to james hey james i have to go and get ready james looked confused and consulted his ever faithful watch he laughed lily you ve lost track of time it only 4 00 i know so there like three hours to the dinner i know that as well what could you possibly need to do in 3 hours that cantbe done in one lily rolled her eyes well first there the shower and we have to look extra special tonight so that ll take half an hour then there the hair and lord knows how long that ll take plus we have to go around helping each other and then james held up a hand i dontwanna know just go and make sure you look good need to keep up my rep lily scowled and left the hall in the seventh year dormitory all mayhem had broken out make up was strewn everywhere dresses lay on the bottoms of massive piles on beds towels littered the floor shoes were hung on bedposts two girls were banging on the door and shouting at it another was shouting from the other side of the door and the last who had arrived early to take a shower first guess who was fluttering around trying to find shoes make up and accessories to match everybody dresses jane how long does it take to have a shower keep shouting it ll take a whole lot longer last time i checked half an hour meant 30 minutes no shit sherlock keep your voices down and language to a minimum but dee she hoarding the shower kayla whined well next time i suggest you prevent that from happening not my fault you got here early lily said moodily jane get out the fucking shower do you me to get out the shower or the fucking shower uhh simmons who said you re getting the shower after her uuuh i did back off lily the shower mine next uuuh no it isn t kayla blue eyeshadow right yeah brings out the eyes jane if you dontget out now i ll blast this door open blast it open fine i ll alohomora it same difference the point is get out jane you are taking rather long fine next time i just wontshower jane said as she walked out of the bathroom in her lavender bathrobe lily and kayla fought each other for the bathroom kayla won and she walked while punching the air in victory lily sulked and fell back on her bed jane and adea were discussing jane hair in the corner lily looked at them expectantly but found no answer well what am i supposed to do til kayla gets out of the bathroom still no answer until jane randomly shouted lils i dying my hair okay no it special cosmo blue and silver absolutely not lily shouted jane looked confused why lily looked at her disbelievingly then donned a babying tone jane darling dontyou think it already weird enough that you have charcoal black hair what wrong with charcoal jane asked in a puzzled voice kayla who seemed to have heard this from inside the bathroom shouted it looks like your hair is greying adea looked outraged kayla you cantsay that while lily muttered i swear that girl has abnormally sharp hearing dee someone needed to tell her jane raised a hand uh hello yeah i still here you know the girl with the greying hair does it really look like that lily knew of jane unique temperament well erm you see it very and it s that means yes lily looked sheepish and nodded jane looked perplexed and looked to adea who shrugged i am completely neutral in this debate i refuse to take part jane looked out of the window for two minutes and back to adea again well what do you think i should do adea rose to the challenge weeeellll i thought you d look great in a brand new combination of jet black and silver i mean you can keep the cosmo blue because it nice but you like to try new things so i thought you d like the silver how can you have been neutral if you d already planned how to fix it shut up simmons and get back to your shower adea snapped and lily added yeah if you re talking that much you must be done i am actually kayla walked out fresh and smiling ready to discuss her make up and hair preparations with adea finally and with that lily grabbed a towel and her bathrobe and ran into the bathroom after many hours of preparing and primping the girls were finally ready at 6 45 pm kayla wore a baby blue satin dress with a beautifully pleated neckline complimented by glittering rhinestone straps her chestnut brown hair was in a wavy half updo her make up had been done lightly so as not to clash with the pale colour of her dress she had some faint blue eyeshadow light eyeliner and her cheeks were slightly rose tinted she wore a simple silver chain with a small raindrop shaped crystal locket jane wore an enchanting strapless silver gown with a flattering boned bodice and kick pleat detailing in the stunning open back her hair was done up in an elegant bun making the silver streaks very noticeable her hair though unusual looked amazing when paired with the dress her make up was slightly more noticeable she wore the usual mascara eyeliner but no eyeshadow since the dress already made her silver eyes stand out so much in the jewellery department jane had worn a spectacular austrian crystal necklace and earrings adea had gone indian with her look and was wearing what was called a lehnga the lehnga was a lavender colour the shirt and upper portion of the skirt was decorated with gold silk thread and beads while the lower portion of the skirt was lightly embroidered and the hem was made noticeable by an intricate border her dupatta was silk and embroidered lightly her eyeshadow was a soft gold and her mascara and eyeliner was quite noticeable but not heavy her cheeks had a gold shimmer and she wore some lavender bangles her necklace was a classic indian style of chandi her hair was in a curly updo lily wore a beautiful jade strapless gown the dress was fully beaded in sapphire blue beads her fiery red hair was in soft angel curls worn down she wore a crystal choker and matching earrings her make up was like adea s noticeable but not heavy her eyeshadow was green and along with the dress made her eyes look breathtaking her necklace was a string of fine sapphires and her earrings were sapphires as well the girls were going down in line jane first kayla second lily next and adea last as jane walked out she spied three marauders and one ravenclaw friend who had been given access to the common room by james as sirius saw her coming down his eyes widened and his jaws dropped oh my god that dress and her hair and her everything she was thinking along the same lines oh my god how cute does he look in a suit i d go over there and snog him in a heartbeat jane descended the stairs and walked over to her date sirius just stared at her for a few seconds making her feel incredibly self conscious he soon regained his cool and managed a you look stunning jane smiled not so bad yourself she fingered his hair sirius grinned shall we he extended his arm gladly and together they set off for the great hall kayla immediately noticed remus he stood there in his sharp black suit maroon shirt and tie remus immediately noticed kayla as well as she gracefully glided down the stairs she looks like an angel kayla reached the bottom and smiled hey remus uh hey you look you look amazing yes would be the word kayla blushed prettily and mumbled a thanks remus too extended his arm and they left for the dinner like the two before them now it was lily turn as she walked down in her jade green dress she turned many heads james stood there with a blank expression unable to think of anything all he wanted to do was watch lily he d give anything to truthfully be able to say that he was lily boyfriend but knew he had to maintain the just friends thing they d worked into she walked over to meet him so how do i look she twirled for him making her red curls sway slightly pretty good for someone who only got let out of the hospital wing this morning james said smoothly hey i did not work my arse off for three hours to get a pretty good james rolled his eyes alright alright i guess i could spare you a beautiful vain arentwe lily nodded and accepted james arm last one down was adea she quietly walked down the stairs attracting as little attention as possible or rather no attention she smiled at waqar as he walked towards her he stared at her she broke the silence speechless absolutely good you should be i cantbelieve you wontlet me show you off she playfully hit him he laughed oh well more for me they both laughed and made their way down to the great hall as the four couples walked in three gasped at the sight and the last couple just smirked identical satisfactory and proud grins the hall was beautifully illuminated by nothing but hundreds upon thousands of candles and the billions of stars that sat in the sky pumpkins hung with elegant curly stalks coming out of them all the tables comprised of a beautiful gold tablecloth the gold plates and goblets and two beautiful candles in expensive crystal candle holders kayla and remus chose a table jane and sirius chose a table near them lily and james chose a table near jane and sirius and adea and waqar chose a table near lily and james peter date was a pretty second year hufflepuff who only went with him because he was a marauder she had taken a table near her friends and peter who thanked god beyond words to actually have a date was obliged to follow the students sat and waited expectantly when the last table had been taken dumbledore stood up good evening it is once again that time of year that we wizards prefer to call halloween now i sure most of you will remember that we do traditionally have a feast on this occasion however this year our head boy and girl thought that you d enjoy it more if we tried a new arrangement and well i sure you know the rest from there i do believe there isnta single person here today who could complain about the magnificent d cor in fact as the night progresses you ll find a lot more things you wontwant to complain about i think we have the prefects to thank for that a round of applause was made for the prefects and then dumbledore continued and of course i dontthink any of this could ve happened had it not been for our superb heads another round of applause and now it is with my great pleasure ladies and gentlemen i give you the hobgoblins this round of applause was tumultuous lily and james were slightly disappointed did we really okay that james asked lily shrugged i guess we were so behind we didntreally check i mean they re ok i guess right oh i mean yeah right sirius mad on them james said glancing at his best friend who was torn between listening to his favourite band and staring at his date manic manticores would ve been better though lily murmured james looked surprised but pleased you like the manic manticores lily turned to look at him well yeah no freaking way me too he said really and for the next ten minutes they continued to talk about their favourite band soon it was time to order dinner james had steak and kidney pie while lily who took slightly longer really these hufflepuffs have done a fantastic job just look at the variety decided on some sweet and sour prawns and chinese fried rice to go with it throughout the evening the two discussed their likes and dislikes you actually like that wow me too and found that they had a lot in common they discussed how great the hall looked the food tasted and how the music could ve been better lily had an idea hey james what do you think speech james shook his head no way not happening lily laughed and donned a babying voice aaaaawwww is ickle jamesie wamesie scared of a big scary speech james looked scandalised at the very idea no why would i be scared so we re gonna do it oh i dunno lily raised an eyebrow james resigned alright fine but i telling you evans i will get you for this lily leaned in close leaving hardly an inch between them and whispered i dontthink you will james you wouldntdo anything to me especially not tonight right he nodded mutely and lily realised how close she was and she backed away quick as a flash i dontknow what came over me james i really donti promise it wonthappen again in fact you know what to make it up to you how about we forget this speech ok ok great i need to go to the toilet she said this all very fast in one breath woah what the heck was that does she like me maybe i dunno god what i d do to have her that close again he got caught up in his thoughts he didntrealise when someone came sat in the seat opposite and just watched him when he finally broke out of his reverie he noticed that someone woah doesntsomeone look slightly stunning tonight he said why thank you james adea replied so i only sitting at the next table i saw you and lily get close she smirked slightly yeah james said dazed adea rolled her eyes and laughed you and lily will make an interesting couple you know that he grinned his famous james style grin the lopsided yet unbelievably suave smile that he pulled he turned his head to look at adea actual seat and noticed someone unexpected nod curtly at him he turned back with a surprised expression on his face you and you re here with mohsin james had gotten to know adea and it was through her that he was slowly starting to get the girl of his dreams in all honesty she was starting to become a sisterly figure for him and he didntwant any guy messing with her so what mohsin to you anyway james said gruffly adea looked at him long and hard and then lowered her gaze and muttered nothing hey adea you d better tell me because if that guy hurts you then i ll know whether to give him a warning or a black eye adea mouth twitched for a second but nothing more her eyes never met james it nothing ok please just drop it i d really rather not talk about it now james was concerned is everything alright she nodded while james shook is head and persisted no it not something wrong adea look at me she raised her head and gave him a furious glare which meant nothing to james but so much more to adea i going to find lily she walked away leaving james confused now with two different things until adea turned again listen james thanks for the whole making sure who right for me and who isntthing but james noticed she didntsound at all grateful for the concern in the last part of their encounter lily lily there you are you know it really doesntlook great if the head girl disappears for random periods of time in an event she hosts lily smiled oh dee i did the stupidest thing her friend held up a hand i know and let blame it in hormonal imbalances shall we i think it ll make you feel better lily grinned private joke you wouldntget it fine leave me out of it then okay that right of course what else could it be hormonal imbalances they both left the bathroom and went back to their respective dates when lily got back she noticed james seemed completely indifferent which she was rather thankful for she sat down so took you long enough i was about to send a search party out for you james joked didntknow you cared that much i well yeah they sat in an uncomfortable silence until james yelled manic manticores rock at the top of his voice causing the hall to go quiet even the band lily shot james a what was the point of that look james said sorry everyone continue as you were the hall laughed and he turned back to lily sorry i dontlike uncomfortable silences lily raised an eyebrow and fought hard to hold back a grin yeah and of course that wasntuncomfortable at all she replied sarcastically no actually i felt rather at home well with sirius as a hypothetical brother i imagine you would who said my name i heard my name knew you wanted me lily sirius inserted oh yes sirius i ve been waiting years to confess my undying love for you i sorry fair lily but my heart belongs to another and he winked at jane who until now had been staring discreetly of course at her date jane clutched a hand to her heart and looked shocked surely you cannot mean me oh dear sirius it pains me to say but do you not know i have eyes only for peter the four of them laughed they looked at their watches and realised it was nearing the end of the events and people had started to leave already all four couples rose from their seats and seven of them

of us has a boyfriend she glanced at adea shut hangings as well and another well another has a lot more i just wish she d realise it behind those close hangings the another was contemplating a change from all the oblivious flashbacks that were taking place in the room where do i stand now with waqar i wish i knew i mean he till one of my best friends but what of the well you know i can talk to him

friends with them and james was finally convinced that he was a decent guy the christmas holidays were drawing nearer lily kayla adea and peter intended to go home the girls realised that since only jane would be left in the castle they had better do some christmas shopping lily managed to rig a visit ok where do we need to go well i say honeydukes lily said simply i need to go to gladrags kayla

meet i say three broomsticks at 6 kayla said lily rolled her eyes yes that all very well but we can only stay out til 4 now it was kayla turn to roll her eyes and she said using the same condescending tone lily had donned only a moment ago yes but dear you have yet to get used to your head girl perks lily looked quizzical kayla dropped the voice and continued on hogsmeade days you can stay here until curfew and as long as we re seventh years and with you we can too realisation dawned on lily face oooohhhhh yeah and she looked at kayla you know you re very good at nitpicking you d make an excellent lawyer huh what the hell a lawyer lily laughed adea cleared her throat guys as much as i d love to stay out here i dontthink it very sensible lily nodded she right you get all sorts of nutters going up to the hog head and that just in the day kayla sighed exasperatedly yeah but we re going to the three broomsticks she exaggerated the name of the pub adea shook her head yeah but to get up there they have to go through here kayla looked to jane for backup jane pointed to the sky cygnus looks pretty dontyou think cygnus looks pretty kayla had what the hell look on her face and turned back to the two who presumably with it hey lily she heard a voice call her name and turned around she spotted two bespectacled hazel eyes she turned to her friends and smirked hey james hey guys the guys all said hi so are you guys planning to go up anytime soon they nodded sirius spoke up yes we have some major snape sabotage to be getting on with adea poked kayla and whispered frantically kayla nodded reeeeemus remus looked up and raised an eyebrow kayla walked up to him and put her arms around his neck you see the thing is we wanted to stay here longer only we cantunless we have some big strong men to protect us ugh i cantbelieve i blurting this crap yeah but kay we need to but he couldntfinish his sentence because kayla had grabbed the back of his neck and kissed him full on leaving remus no choice but to comply within a few seconds they were going at it feverishly james and sirius looked outraged the girls looked gleeful you cheating little little i ll say it bitches sirius cried not that he didntswear he just didntthink he d get away with calling the two most mentally dangerous girls in the school bitches lily merely laughed aaaaaahhhh the joys of being the fairer sex by now kayla and remus had stopped kayla was pulling her top down which had ridden up in the ordeal and smoothing her hair remus looked to his friends guys we re staying james and sirius groaned the marauders could only plan as a four remus continued well do it later on tonight he looked expectantly at the girls lily took charge again james you go with kayla and kayla james smiled a secret smile peter you wanna come with us or go or what the redhead asked uncaringly lily didntlike peter much i think i ll go up thanks if i go now the elves will be able to give me a feast before dinner he licked his lips and set off in the direction of the castle remus and sirius you come with us sirius looked delighted but remus was far from it he turned to kayla so what how come i cantgo with kayla lily and jane exchanged nervous glances because we need you here to control sirius why cantjames and i swap because because because we donttrust james and sirius together remus looked suspicious still kayla took over the reigns remus come on if you do this i ll promise we ll find a broom cupboard or something sirius laughed nice offer simmons kayla sorry but remus is a gentleman he ll never agree to that kayla looked back fine we ll go to the library anything you want you ll get sirius cheered kayla glared at him almost anything honestly you are so perverted kayla said in a disgusted tone sirius stuck out his tongue remus kissed kayla cheek and went to stand beside lily right so we ll meet at the three broomsticks at 6 okay both parties nodded in affirmation and set off hey adea james squeezed himself between kayla and her kayla looked highly annoyed how come i dontget a hey she said in a mock indignant voice james sniffed because i dontlike you simmons go away and he stuck his nose in the air he turned back to adea so we re pretty good friends now right adea looked thoughtful i suppose so i can ask you anything right she stiffened and her tone wasntwarm and pensive no james you can t but why because you just can t and she became deathly silent you couldnteven hear her breathing kayla looked determinedly onwards not saying a word but decided to intervene james every group has their secrets this is ours ok he threw his hands up in surrender and knew the matter was not to be pressed any further so where are we off to he said grinning the tension felt not two minutes ago completely forgotten kayla smiled and adea shook her head kayla pinched james cheeks you are so cute do you know that james raised an eyebrow so how about you ditch remus and come kiss me like that he flashed her his adorable lopsided smile kayla patted him on the head you re not that cute sweetheart adea laughed and looked pityingly at james who looked confused come on you two off to gladrags james sped up to kayla wait so you prefer moony yep why am i supposed to prefer you well people usually do and then you wonder why lily calls you arrogant is this arrogant there just no hope for you is there nope oooohhhhh look we re here right now before we go in please dontdo anything embarrassing does that mean i cantdo my gay act i d prefer it if you didn t what am i gonna do for entertainment i dunno well we re here to get something for lily oh ok they walked right through the glass doors and a voice sounded welcome to gladrags kayla and adea started off in a direction and james called hey where are you going the robes and stuff are this way they turned round each grabbed an arm and dragged him off in the opposite direction once they were far enough in a secluded corner they whispered james no shouting please why you just dontshout here why you just dontdo it why kayla screamed in frustration and then covered her hand with her mouth indicating for adea to take over luckily the latter knew exactly which buttons to push because if you do the assistants will kick us out and if the assistants kick us out we cantget lily a present and if lily doesntget a present lily wontbe very happy now will she dontyou want lily to be happy you make a good point ok no more shouting good and by the way you were acting like a three year old now come on and the three of them set off for the muggle wear section while those three were shopping in gladrags the other four were topping up supplies in honeydukes however one of their number was not a happy bunny remus stood in a corner arms crossed his face showed no emotion but they knew he wasnthappy sirius noticed first aw remmy cheer up your other half will be here soon remus looked at sirius shut up padfoot no seriously mate since you two started going out you haventspent but two seconds away from each other sirius said seriously no pun intended that not true you re over exaggerating what that you say you need a second opinion why didntyou just ask my friend jane lily remus rolled his eyes as a redhead and a well sirius didntknow what to call her so lets say a chameleon head headed their way ah miss evans miss swales sirius said with his arms outstretched please dontdo that it scary lily said as jane laughed sirius smiled sorry remus here needs some convincing oh about what i told him that since he started going out with kayla they haventspent barely two seconds apart and if you ll believe this he said that wasnttrue in the slightest lily and jane burst out laughing and remus looked perplexed i sorry but you two are attached at the hip you d even sleep together if you werentgryffindors remus smiled and then it broadened and he grinned sirius turned to lily and jane this wasntsupposed to happen he was supposed to be surprised and then say something like oh sirius i so sorry i deserted you sirius finished in a high pitched voice that was supposed to be remus lily and jane took no notice and looked on remus started to hum lily and jane sighed that so cute aaaaawwww i wish a guy would hum when he remembered me sirius just shook his head and i thought james was whipped this one fallen hard remus walked out of honeydukes lily jane and sirius ran to the counter paid for their goods and ran after remus they sprinted to catch up with him he was a much faster walker than they d anticipated lily and jane panted whereas sirius who was used to sprinting in james militaristic quidditch practises sailed right through moony where are you going to a jewellers remus replied there a jewellers here sirius asked as he craned his neck to see yeah well that why i slowed down i dontactually know where one is he looked expectantly at lily and jane they nodded follow us they said in unison a n you ll have to wait til the next chapter to see what they bought the two parties met in the three broomsticks at 6 o clock sirius and james managed to persuade madam rosmerta into giving them a private parlour free of charge they all ordered butterbeers except for adea who couldnteven have the slightest bit of alcohol the 6 of them started chatting and laughing while the seventh pulled out a book and just read occasionally taking a sip of her water or smiling at one of the jokes though two of the others seemed not to notice they carried on until 7 30 when the head and boy and girl put a stop to the fun and demanded that they all report back to the castle it was as if they d transformed with the turn of a second once back in the castle kayla lily and adea realised that if the train left in two days december 21st they had better just go pack while remus promised his packing would be done by tomorrow when the four girls reached the dormitory jane decided to help and lily said she would too as long as they went back to her room and helped her as well lily found a letter on her old bed with a note from dumbledore next to it she recognised the handwriting to be her sister petunia s she wondered how petunia managed to brave tying the letter to the owl leg and came to the conclusion that one of her parents did it for her she sat down on the bed not quiet ready for what the letter beheld petunia and lily never talked never not even the occasional pass the salt or have you seen my mascara this started the day lily got her letter of acceptance into hogwarts petunia stopped responding to lily lily following her sister act stopped as well eventually they stopped communicating they could be in the same house same room even for hours and never even glance at each other these actions prevented lily from ever knowing what petunia truly thought of her but she knew it couldntbe good lily put it down to fear xenophobic tendencies she dreamed one day probably once she d graduated from hogwarts petunia would set aside her fears and she and lily could be sisters once again she had visualised this day so often that the thought of petunia making contact any earlier disconcerted her she stared at the envelope a quiet voice called through the room reading her thoughts like she always did open the letter lily we re here she canthurt you lily smiled gratefully at her friend her sister with shaking fingers she opened the letter she read the words over and over again not quite sure what to make of them lily marie my fianc meeting mum and dad this christmas dontcome home petunia eleven words that all her sister had to say for the past six and a half years the words were hurtful but not insulting slytherins had thrown insults hexes and curses at her but she never cried the only time she did was in that fight with james that was thee first time which she could clearly remember yet these blunt eleven words made tears well in her eyes faster than ever before determined not to mess up things even more than they already were lily wrote a reply petunia grace ok i won t congratulations lily silently she picked up dumbledore note dear miss evans i was in your chamber checking up on things i saw this letter but knew you were headed for your friend dormitories so sent up fawkes with this professor dumbledore lily shakily wrote thanks to him as well she then curled up into a foetal position and cried silently she rocked to and fro her three friends made their way to her jane and adea hugged lily kayla picked up the letter she read it over and over kayla was the big sister of four she always played the part and never understood that siblings didntalways get along reading the letter made her seethe beyond all limits lily what kind of person is this kayla yelled indignantly lily looked up her cheeks tear strained her eyes red the sight was a little new to kayla lily looked at kayla not quite sure of what to say and eventually she managed a she my sister kayla reread the words and then looked over to her friend she shook her head sadly no she isn t this isntyour sister she quietly handed the letter over to adea once adea had finished she put it down and said into the air kayla right she not she just someone who shares your blood parents and house lily nodded that right my one and only sibling kayla shook her head yet again those things dontdefine a sister a sister is only a sister when she listens to you sure you may fight but deep down loves you no matter what is ready to rip any guy who hurts you head off who listens to you in the dead of night who tells you your outfit looks nice every once in a while lily looked up with wide eyes really adea and kayla nodded jane got a tissue and wiped away lily tears lily shook her head guys dontworry it not like she said anything awful right i mean this is the first we ve said to each other since the summer after junior school that good i m i ok kayla looked at her pityingly look me in the eye and tell me you re ok lily continued to stare at kayla but why doesntshe like me why i ve never said anything to her never she never said anything to me we practically pretended the other didntexist why cantshe act like a real sister and be happy that i was going to meet her fianc soon why didntshe tell me she had a fianc why didntshe tell me she had a boyfriend lily sobbed kayla indicated to the letter she no sister of yours we re your sisters all three of us we may not share the same blood or parents but look at it this way at least we share the same house lily smiled jane who was an only child unlike the rest of them could not say much in this situation she had to play her part of second mother and just soothe so she added a soft group hug the girls laughed lily wiped away her tears and embraced her friends for the first time she understood how lucky she was to have them they are my sisters i just never realised it til now after kayla and adea had packed she rushed over to her chamber to make sure she added her own name to the list of those staying at hogwarts what the girls didntknow was that lily had pocketed the letter lily wanted to keep it she still didntknow what petunia thought of her the letter only told her that she didntwant lily to meet her fianc it didntsay that petunia hated lily lily loved her friends like family like kayla said they were her real sisters but petunia was the sister she was born with she couldntchange that maybe petunia didntlove her but lily knew that no matter how angry or upset petunia made her feel underneath it all she did really love her blood thicker than water at this rate petunia may never speak to her even after graduating this was her only proof of the fact that her and petunia were related and she couldntlet it go that night lily added her name to the list tears daring to spill but she remembered something she d heard once when she was younger she hadntunderstood it then but she did now we will meet again life really long its just time that short one day she and petunia would speak again it may not be in this lifetime or even in this world but one day they would the dream lily had that night was rather unusual lily was floating along a drive privet drive she stops at a door at the foot of which a child lay she reaches out to touch the child but finds she cannot she looks at the child a pair of eyes look up at her two very familiar eyes her eyes this child possesses a pair of eyes identical to her own yet this couldntbe hers this baby had black hair the door opens a rather bony horse like woman with dark brown hair stands before her milk bottles in hand she knew that face it was it was petunia she reaches out to petunia but finds she cannot touch her sister either as petunia bends down to put the bottles out she notices the infant the bottles fall and smash as the woman lets out a shrill scream lily sees a letter situated next to the bundle as does petunia the living woman picks up the letter and reads aloud as if knowing lily can hear her too she reads dear mrs dursley i am afraid that your sister lily potter died at the hands of lord voldemort last night he came late and killed both your sister and her husband james potter their child harry who as lily had told me previously you haventmet is now your only remaining blood relative harry miraculously survived the fate that lord voldemort victims tend to meet in the midst of trauma there is a ray of hope voldemort inability to kill your nephew caused his downfall and i sure you will be slightly pleased to know that the murderer of all your family members has been forced to flee and is currently i believe on the verge of death one day lord voldemort will come back to try and kill harry whether he will succeed i cannot tell you i have not yet explained why harry survived lily was an extremely talented and bright witch one of the brightest to pass through my school so far she died to save harry leaving in him a proportion of love that voldemort does not possess nor can he penetrate to ensure that harry can maintain the gift his mother left him he must stay in the protection of one of his blood relatives voldemort unfortunately managed to kill every last person of the potter heritage before harry therefore leaving him with only you to turn to harry gift and advantage will also help to protect your own family from voldemort wrath i know that lily and yourself were never on the best of terms since the day she found out she was a witch but please find it in your heart to take harry in think of him not as your sister son but as the only person you may remember your own family the evans family by yours sincerely professor albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts lily gasps that boy the baby was her son she was dead lily looks up at petunia and is shocked to see petunia wipe a tear from her eye petunia bends down once again and picks up the child lily glides to petunia side to find her child looking his aunt straight in the eye petunia looks straight back her expression that of a person meeting a long lost relative her sister speaks to the child solemnly you have lily eyes the child says nothing petunia continues but that hair that black hair that not evans hair that must be from your father i remember he came once to meet mum and dad and he had hair just like that the woman takes a last glance at the letter and then looks to the sky with that she walks inside with lily child in her arms 17 year old lily woke with a start in her room she looked around and instead of privet drive found her snow white room she looked at her arms to make sure she was actually there alive she breathed a sigh of relief and leant back against the bedstead contemplating her dream what was that was that a sign of things to come or just a dream a normal fictional dream it didntseem like a dream and that little boy he had my eyes it makes sense now he was my son he was james son too i was lily potter james was my husband no it cantbe the boy did look awfully like james save the eyes lord voldemort kills me he kills my parents he kills my aunts and uncles my cousins james family as well petunia was upset about me forget that lily ok think now voldemort voldemort i know who he is he that weirdo he goes around making conferences about how muggles should be wiped out and muggleborns should be tagged he going to kill me my son going to create his downfall good on him yes but you ll be dead oh yeah but a knocking on her door interrupted her thoughts she put on her white silk dressing gown and went to the door she opened the door and found no other than james potter knocking upon it she stood there a minute just surveying him searching his eyes for some sort of sign james potter my future husband nah impossible well he not half bad you know maybe but future husband taking it a bit far dontyou think a hand swept past her view and she snapped out of her reverie lily lily are you there she shook her head and looked up at him again huh she said confusedly you ve just been standing there looking at me as if thinking about something really deep oh sorry i a bit out of it this morning i can tell so what were you saying oh right yeah i was saying that we have to get to lunch we re doing that prank on snape today and then would you like to join us for a snowball fight james explained oh did it snow last night lily said absentmindedly looking out of the window james looked at her with disbelief uh yeah oh well i d have to ask my friends lily started well you re not exactly early sunshine its 11 30 i already asked them kayla in but jane and adea said they d just watch but you know adea she ll probably just read or something lily smiled and nodded alright i in too as long as peter not on our team our mine and kayla s oh yeah and i not playing unless she on my team why her why not me she my best friend and me and kayla always win when we play against jane and adea we re invincible together james put an arm around lily shoulder my friend how wrong you are lily removed his arm and said well you ll have to learn the hard way wontyou as they made their way down to the great hall james assured lily that the prank was practically harmless and lily assured james that if she found otherwise all four of them would find themselves in individual gruesome detentions lily and james took a seat with their friends and loaded some food onto their plates they took small bites waiting for the next part to happen they watched snape take a sip of his pumpkin juice looked dazed for a second and then shake his head suddenly he got up onto the table and in a very elvis voice though the marauders later claimed they knew of no elvis he pointed to professor mcgonagall and announced this one for my girl minnie the next time his mouth opened however it was much more mariah carey a n originally i had the lyrics up here but since doesntallow it snape began singing all i want for christmas with all the notes correctly and slowly and very femininely yes that would be the word people all over the hall debated whether snape voice had actually broken because at this point in time it certainly didntseem like it their whispers were cut short as snape started blowing kisses and shouting i love you minerva mcgonagall several times it was in between the sixth that snape finally came to his senses he put his foot in porridge the bowl slid down the table taking snape with it the hall burst into laughter lily turned to give james a stern look he shook his head ok now see that wasntus it was just icing on the cake sirius added professor mcgonagall made her way down from the head table her face very red the boys put on innocent faces sirius turned to face her why hello professor dontyou give me that black i sorry professor am i missing something the fuming woman took some deep breaths and said in a deathly quiet voice you four all of you my office now the girls smirked as the marauders filed out of the hall behind mcgonagall identical angelic smiles on their faces just as he was about to leave sirius made a small bow when he was sure mcgonagall wasntlooking they followed their head of house to her office having the occasional snigger she opened her door violently and indicated for them to take a seat once doing so herself she tapped her fingers impatiently and looked at them expectantly well what do you have to say for yourselves she barked all four of them feigned confusion remus spoke up with all due respect professor we haventa clue as to what you re talking about mcgonagall raised an eyebrow oh really snape lunch christmas song any of it ring a bell mock realisation dawned on sirius face oh that yes it was rather amusing wasntit i never knew he had such a thing for you peter almost let out a laugh but sirius stepped on his foot before he got a chance mcgonagall groaned in frustration you re not going to admit it are you admit what james asked that was the last straw mcgonagall mouth transformed into a thin line out out all of you now just go you four are going to be the death of me they hurried out of her office and down the corridor once out of earshot they burst out laughing well lads i think that the angriest she ever gotten at us and we didnteven get a detention sirius said we didntget any points docked either peter added they decided that they had better meet the girls outside for the snowball fight since lunch had probably been cleared away by now right ok three rules no physical contact no hitting your own team member and absolutely no magic sirius and james groaned lily sharply turned her head do we have a problem you two they shook their heads oh and if one team member forfeits the whole team forfeits ok so teams james now started ok lily made a few pre game requests so kayla lily and i are on one team sirius remus and peter are on the other they stood in their teams and walked off in opposite directions lily kayla and james set up their own game plan james being used to captaining took charge ok lily let that red head temper go just attack got it no mercy you re headed for peter hopefully no most likely he ll get scared and say forfeit kayla you re headed for remus trick him confuse him preoccupy him and eventually beat him i sure you know how i ll get sirius ok the girls nodded determinedly right i think the best way to get a head start is to make as many snowballs as is possible while their setting up their plans right lets go the other three were still talking as james lily and kayla started preparing their weapons meanwhile sirius peter and remus were planning their own game come on lads we need to show those girls why men are the stronger sex remus raised an eyebrow but peter just looked confused but james is a boy peter said dumbly sirius looked at him yes i know but i remus held up a hand and shook his head it doesntmatter pete ok sirius continued so i ll go after james remus show your girl who boss and peter squeaked but that means i left with lily sirius looked at him sympathetically i know mate but just whatever you do dontforfeit got it peter nodded meekly alright men lets go they turned around to find the opposing team standing their ready full with large snowballs and surprisingly menacing faces ready james asked ready james immediately threw his snowball at sirius who dodged and started gathering snow as james picked up the next one lily got her snowball and got peter in the face he was so shocked he fell over before the snowball hit him she had him now she pelted him with simultaneous snowballs and watched him trying to escape kayla sauntered up to remus snowball in hand remus was ready to receive you re not going to fight me are you remmy you bet kayla made a sound of indignation but couldnthelp but smile good and while remus grinned at her she mashed her snowball in his mouth he spluttered snow for a few seconds before gathering some snow oh you re getting it now simmons she squealed and ran over to her stock he chased her around while she randomly threw snowballs over her back meanwhile with james and sirius things werentquite as vicious or quite as laidback the term would be competitive they were each eyeing the other sinisterly so far neither had been hit sirius threw a snowball to catch james off guard james was definitely not expecting it and was hit full on he wiped off the snow oh that it padfoot you had better run sirius turned around to gather snow as quickly as he could but james hit him at the back of the neck sirius yelled out of surprise back with peter and lily things had gotten slightly better lily couldnterupt on demand there had to be a reason so she felt kind enough to let peter get back on his feet but that was all she kept hitting him and all he could do was hold his arms in defence he didnteven think to gather snow as long as he got away from the redhead without forfeiting peter would you put up a fight she yelled i trying i really am he cried well forfeit if you can t i cantdo that he whined well fine then prepare to have snow for dinner and she threw a particularly large snowball at him remus and kayla were having the most fun each was skirting the other snowballs as they ran around trying to hit each other remus threw a snowball kayla fell to the floor kayla are you ok he ran over to her he bent down she looked up at him blearily grabbed some snow and stuffed it down the front of his shirt she giggled got up and ran remus stood there frozen when he seemed to recover he shouted kayla simmons get your ass over here right now she stuck out her tongue and the chase started up again jane and adea merely watched well jane did adea took a few peeks from over her book every so often but nothing more they look like they re having fun dontthey jane commented adea didntlook up no one stopping you jane jane looked at her friend what do you mean go throw snowballs have fun go on jane shook her head she turned and spotted a robin on the ground she got up but as she did the robin hopped over onto a bush come here sweetie come on i want to your friend jane cooed she tried to coax it over to her while the robin did not fly away it didntbudge from it bush either she continued to try and get it to come to her sirius turned to check on how jane was doing and maybe try to get her to join in but when he turned round he found her standing at a bush he edged closer to hear what she was saying come on i swear i wonthurt you i just want to talk to you you re quite cute you know he watched her as she continued to talk to this this what was it he peered around her back and found it was a robin james walked up to his friend who seemed to have paused the game hey padfoot sirius held up a hand to silence him and indicated for him to watch jane jane continued to coax the little robin please come over here look my scary friends arenthere it just sweet little me i want to talk to you birds can be quite good company so can humans i bet you ve never talked to a human before we re not that bad really ok some are quite awful but i quite harmless really and it was as if the bird had heard and understood it hopped closer to her jane held out her finger and the robin perched onto it jane led it back to where she was sitting held it close to her face and started talking to it james and sirius watched on in awe she an angel look at her james she is sirius whispered james smiled you ve got a special one there mate dontlet her go he said softly sirius looked back to his friend i love her james eyes widened what i serious look at her and the things she does how could i not sirius said excitedly are you sure never been surer well if you re positive then tell her yeah later tell her before the holidays start just do it ll save you both two weeks of misery sirius nodded suddenly a voice cried out he said it peter just forfeited lily shouted in glee sirius groaned pete you didn t peter nodded looking scared james laughed and high fived kayla and lily ha take a loada that peter james lily kayla and remus headed back to the castle sirius however stayed behind a moment jane jane looked up from her robin friend and signalled for him to wait a second she took her friend and placed him back in his beloved bush what is it sirius i need to tell you something something really important jane looked puzzled but did not question any further ok so tell me she said shrugging no not here but i know a place jane tossed a glance to her invisible friend she didntget a glance back but she knew what it meant ok come on let go jane and sirius trudged through the snow back to the castle the last remaining girl looked up finally and smiled into the air she d heard james and sirius conversation and adea qureshi knew what was about to take place sirius where are we going jane asked after a few minutes of non stop walking to a room he replied briskly yes that all well and good but i know for a fact that there isnta room in this corridor sirius paced the corridor in question three times a large door appeared right before jane ok well that shuts me up for the night jane muttered as sirius held the door open for her she gasped as she took in her surroundings the floor was marble and the walls well there werentany it was as if room was made for her where there should have been walls was just a night sky with a beautiful sliver of a moon the stars scattered around shining brighter than she d ever seen them the sky itself was black as black could get sirius stood next to her notice something jane looked on but sirius continued these things they re you look at the moon that not what the real moon looks like those are your eyes jane looked at him with tears in her eyes the stars that your person look how bright they are you ll never see them like that outside jane looked down see the sky some may not see the beauty but isntthat black stunning she looked out upon the sky it mysterious yet inviting that your aura sirius it s where did you find it jane whispered in an awestruck tone jane this room is just that a room what inside it comes from your mind jane looked at him with her beautiful eyes so honestly i found it in here he tapped at his temples he paused trying to think exactly what he was going to say next you remember before halloween she nodded still speechless you said it not enough to like me you told me i had to understand you first jane i know you but i can never understand you or the way you think it one of the things i love about you you re so unpredictable you can be so complex and then so simple jane i promise i will never tire of you i swear sirius said looking her directly in the eye and catching her off guard with his sincerity jane looked at him with wide eyes she felt her heart pounding it wanted to jump out bit was restricted she wanted to know what he was going to say you re not like anybody i ve ever met and chances are i ll never meet anyone remotely like you that why i love you sirius said jane shook her head disbelievingly no sirius dontsay what you dontmean i not i mean it i love you you donthave to say it back but please say you ll give me a chance before you leave for the holidays tomorrow jane hugged him and whispered i love you too and yes i ll go out with you sirius smiled and captured her lips jane returned to her dormitory that night to find her friends assembled on her bed looking agitated when they noticed her kayla let out a cry of frustration where have you been you realise you ve been missing for two hours now jane continued to smile and began to hum lily looked at her questioningly what up why are you so happy jane smile became even broader canti just be happy of course you can but not that happy wait this has to do with sirius jane nodded kayla looked at the dreamy girl expectantly well jane looked at her friend anticipating faces he loves me all the girls squealed and hugged their friend adea spoke up so you re going out jane nodded again do you love him as well yeah her friends remained silent kayla looked concerned are you sure are you sure you re not mistaking it for something else but before jane could answer adea spoke for her she hugged jane and said kayla jane does love him cantyou tell look at her eyes have you ever seen her this happy kayla smiled cantargue with you there lily rose and picked up her jacket well you guys you have a busy day tomorrow so you d better sleep and i d better leave she hugged jane again and left for her own room a n i think this might even be longer than halloween i like lily dream but hate the prank it doesntwork quite as well without the actual lyrics for some reason tell me what you think disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n christmas is here this chapter is very adlib dontexpect much christmas is here the 21st of december had finally arrived while lily wasntecstatic that adea and kayla were leaving she wasntentirely depressed either it wasntanything to do with them it was more to do with the fact that the majority of the school would be gone for two weeks practically heaven not entirely but practically james was slightly more upset one of the marauders would be out for the season snape would be in the building but they wouldntbe able to prank him it was wrong just wrong stupid pact who idea was the freakin pact anyway he did however enjoy one aspect of the situation in hand lily would be staying while jane and sirius were off and remus was off reading or moping about kayla absence he and lily would be alone in a just about empty castle now if she d just go out with him jane and sirius were over the moon they d only just started going out and they were willing to spend as much time together as possible the honeymoon period as remus called it remus wasnthappy at all as was expected he wished kayla could stay but his parents were taking a trip to china for christmas why he didntknow and he had to stay while she had to go on the morning of their departure only head girl and head boy were allowed to see them off to make sure the first years were ok james was helping peter with his trunk while lily said bye to adea kayla and gabrielle ok you haventforgotten anything have you no lily have you got your wands yes lily ok well have a safe journey and dontbe sick we wontmum lily turned to kayla and gabrielle now you guys have a nice christmas ok and she hugged both of them now i ll send your presents over on christmas eve they ll be under your tree on christmas morning she then turned to adea you have a good holiday i ll send your christmas present on christmas eve too it ll be on your bedside table in the morning ok they all hugged one last time before boarding the train lily looked onwards to make sure everybody was on when she noticed a first year girl looking fearfully at the train while her friends tried to get her to board come on laura the train leaves in two minutes it wonthurt you i promise will you hurry up you ll miss it if you dontget on i ll drag you in what seems to be the problem here the little girl looked at lily and then back at the train i dontlike trains they make me feel sick how did you get on in september my parents were there to see me off it was different and i dontwant to go but they ll be waiting for you isntthere another way meanwhile her friends were looking even more frantic lily looked kindly at the girl and hugged her listen to me as long they re in there she indicated the girl friends i promise nothing will happen trust me i know now you d better board the girl looked at lily and back again before she finally boarded as the whistle sounded she waved at her as the train left the station and lily waved back happily as she called merry christmas that was a nice thing you did called a voice lily turned round and saw james and for some reason her heart jumped a bit at seeing his face what oh that i guess your sister is she older or younger than you older too bad you d make a good older sister you d make quite a good mother as well lily gave him an odd look erm thanks james jabbed a thumb over his shoulder we d better get back lily smiled yeah we better had they made their way back through hogsmeade and over to hogwarts james you re not helping lily said as she tried to finish decorating the christmas tree in their chamber james looked up the red bauble should be on that side am i helping now cute potter very cute she replied as her hands became tangled in fairy lights why cantyou just use your wand like normal people james said amusedly he flicked his wand the fairy lights disappeared as real fairies sat in the branches of their christmas tree lily undid the fairies and the lights reappeared hey that not how things are done at my house we use lights and we dontuse magic well what about how things are done at my house if you cared about how things are done at your house you d get off your arse and help no you re right i dontcare about how things are done at my house but i do want fairies lights fairies lights fairies lights fairies fairies no lights that what i ve been saying oh hey wait a second james said indignantly lily laughed james crossed his arms in a childish huff lily walked over to him aaaaawwww poor little jamesie wants his fairy wairies lily mocked with her arm around james james scowled at her well if you re gonna have lights i ll just put the fairies in with them he leaned over lily and conjured some fairies as he retreated he found his face very close to lily s too close they gazed at each other for a moment oh the tree the tree yeah the tree isntdone i d hate to have an unfinished tree for christmas wouldntyou she abruptly jumped up and made her way to the tree james sighed and joined her yeah wouldntwant that he muttered lily continued to decorate the tree and james refused to help he just flipped through which broomstick while lily did all the work she finally found something she couldntdo well without magic anyway with their 10 foot christmas tree and her 5 5 height it was just about impossible for her to place the star on top of the tree the muggle way she d been put off ladders for life there was only one way she turned around james huh now will you help sure what with the star oh sure all the while never looking up he raised his wand wingardium lev lily rolled her eyes stop i mean the muggle way oh well then no you re impossible dontya just love me she let another frustrated groan lily why cantyou just do it the magic way that just not how we do it at home so make a new tradition no you ve never spent a christmas here before have you he asked lily scowled at him no i haventfor your information james sighed took the star reached up and placed the star on the christmas tree happy now very lily made some hot chocolate and handed a mug to james he took a sip hey how come this tastes better than my hot chocolate lily smirked because it was made the muggle way james stuck out his tongue they sat by the fireplace and silently sipped on their hot chocolates james spoke up so lily tell me something sure what up how come you didntgo home for christmas this year lily paused contemplating her answer well this is my last year i thought it d be nice if i spent it here james laughed and that would be very convincing if you werentsuch a bad liar i am not a bad liar the eyes yeah they give it all away lily stuck out her tongue as james shook his head seriously why didntyou go home he persisted maybe i just didntwant to ok for someone who didntwant to go home you sure do miss it lily turned to look at james and remembered petunia letter dontcome home suddenly the tears started up again lily are you ok she wiped her tears and nodded come on tell me what the matter lily set her mug down and got up come with me james nodded and wordlessly followed her to her room lily shut the door as james looked around this was the first time he actually got to take a look before being ushered out lily sat on her bed and james followed she took out a box from underneath her bed it was covered in mint green raw silk she mutely opened it and handed some paper to james james was quite confused now he knew lily was muggleborn however he d always believed that once magic was in the family parchment became a way of life james unfolded the paper and read the letter your sister she nodded in response james reread the letter you know i sure this is a one off lily shook her head does she always treat you like that like she embarrassed of you she shook her head again well there you go then there ll be a reason lily shook her head that the first time she talked to me since i got my acceptance letter james eyes widened hmm well my sister a lot younger than me but i pretty sure siblings arentsupposed to do that james said as he ran a hand through his hair so you know why i stayed at school lily said yep hey listen if you ever want to talk about well this you know you can come to me but honestly you should talk to sirius sirius lily said in a puzzled manner trust me ok lily looked sceptical james got up well miss evans as much as i enjoyed being in here we re obviously not here to do what i would like so come on lets go wandering lily slapped him playfully and followed james out of the room hey remus have you seen sirius remus looked up from his book yeah he only just realised what to get you for christmas remus said absentmindedly oh remus went back to his book as jane sat studying him remus looked up can i help you jane smiled she misses you too what are you talking about remus asked though he knew exactly what she was talking about she alright as well swales remus who to say i was thinking about kayla who to say i was talking about kayla remus groaned jane smiled again he looked at her wearily she thinking of you too jane said and how would you know that donthide it remus you think about her all the time and with that she quietly walked out of the portrait hole to find her boyfriend remus smiled and contemplated what jane had said sirius is right there something about that girl james and lily sat in the room of requirement lily choice so of course the room was identical to the living room at her house during christmas right down to every last picture lily walked to the fireplace and looked at the mantle shelf she picked up a picture of her and petunia when they were younger both wrapped in scarves big jackets and bobble hats playing with the snow she turned around and looked at james shyly sorry you must find this really boring i not always this homesick promise james smiled broadly actually i kinda like it it different very homesy very nice hey you wanna bring the guys here on christmas eve and we ll have one of those traditional christmases that muggles love so much you know hot chocolate by the fire sharing stories blah blah blah lily laughed sure oh oh oh and we ll skip dinner in the great hall and have the house elves bring it here he said excitedly lily nodded of course james and i ll have the pictures and the stockings changed oh cool and we ll have their presents brought over to our common room and in the morning and we ll all open them there lily pinched james cheeks you are so cute when you get all excited james stuck out his tongue james walked over to mantle shelf to observe the pictures lily had been looking at he picked a picture up of a brunette this your sister lily walked over to him looked and nodded yep that her lily looked at the picture and realised that the girl in the picture looked quite different to the woman in her dreams i guess there right when they say you re face cut isntdetermined until you ve fully stopped growing the brunette in the picture was not horse faced she had a longish face but was in general quite pretty no offence lily i mean aside from the fact that you re both quite pretty oh you are way more than quite pretty you dontlook a thing alike lily mulled it over and cast another appraising glance at the face in the picture he was right to be fair they only had one thing in common their hair was set in elegant waves but that was about it i guess we don t she becomes horse faced in later life james gave her an odd look and how would you know that uh i dontknow i have no idea where that came from lily lied james nodded though not completely believing her excuse lily smiled nervously before changing the subject so what your sister called james smiled before replying allegra lily smiled as well that a beautiful name thank you how old is she lily asked she four aaaaawwww tell me about her lily said giving james her full attention she loved kids she beautiful you know she has black hair just like me only its not messy she doesnthave hazel eyes she has blue ones like my dad she quite tall for her age as well lily laughed at how sweet james was oh and the way she laughs just like a little girl well i suppose she is one but whenever she laughs it makes everyone else laugh as well james said in one breath does she go to school yes she really clever except her teachers think she a bit of nightmare her magic always goes off she has short temper you see it really funny when she gets angry i hate it when she cries though lily took the picture from james hand and put it back do you have a picture of her james grinned of course i do come on he and lily went to their chamber lily hesitated a bit before walking into his room but walked in anyway james was searching through his trunk aha got ya he handed her a photo album lily flicked through it and gasped the very first picture was of james holding his little sister in st mungos when lily noticed he was in his third year the photos were taken right through allegra four years one of lily favourites was of james throwing his sister in the air and catching her repeatedly yeah got in a bit of trouble for that one there was another one of james andallegra on broomsticks the picture couldntcatch all of the movement but from what lily could see she d turn out to be just as good as her brother that was when she was only three not bad huh lily couldnthelp but grin the last picture in the album was a portrait of james and allegra both wearing dress robes james had his hand on allegra shoulder the girl in the picture was so pretty and lily knew she d be beautiful when she grew up she handed the photo album back to james i bet you re a great big brother it certainly sounds like it james grinned his cocky smile well i dontmean to brag but lily couldnthelp but wonder in september that smile would ve taken her to hell land but why was it so ok now in fact in all honesty it was sorta cute not cute cute she assured herself kind of little boy cute hey i d better get to bed you do that sweet dreams you too and with that she left christmas eve had finally arrived james was talking with the house elves to make sure that dinner could reach them lily was in the room of requirement making sure that everything was just right the living room looked just like lily but the family photos had been replaced there was one of all the girls the christmas before last it was taken in the three broomsticks and all of them were wearing santa hats there was one of the marauders looking particularly devious one of remus and kayla and one of sirius and jane only taken the night before there was also one family photo each for lily it was the one of her and petunia for jane it was one of jane and all her cousins for remus it was a normal family portrait for sirius it was one of him and a girl who graduated last year lily remembered her to be andromeda black of ravenclaw lily found this rather odd as she was sure that sirius had a proper family the one of james was even weirder it was one that she hadntseen in the photo album it was a portrait photo of allegra with james and sirius on either side of her they must be closer than i thought guess who lily smiled she turned around hey you so how d it go with the house elves aaaaaahhhh you know they were so thrilled to serve somewhere other than the great hall plus you know the potter charm added no problem lily nodded absentmindedly as she ran a critical glance over the room james watched as her eyes stopped at the curtains she started eyeing them the way james did to snape like the curtains were her arch nemesis well get your charm over here and transfigure these curtains she shook her head disdainfully and muttered to herself what mum and dad were thinking i ll never know what wrong with the curtains james asked defending them lily tutted impatiently and sent him a glare to match james when a room had a deep red thing going on you just dontput lemon yellow curtains in with it james rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like girls with a wave of his wand the curtains became a dark gold with an elaborate print on it lily clapped her hands perfect james mimicked her she sharply turned her head and gave him a piercing glare she turned to give the room another sweeping glance her eyes again stopped at an old ornament her mother had it was a clown and frankly hideous as a child lily was quite frightened of it she whipped her wand out but james grabbed the clown and started running oh no you don t i like this thing he said childishly james bring that thing back here it awful lily cried they stopped at opposite sides of a table each trying to outsmart the other going this way then that well i like it oh yeah well i don t both of them laughed and continued the chase sirius jane and remus made their entrance but found an interesting sight on arriving james and lily playing a nice game of tig sirius grinned and was about to join them when jane held out an arm and stopped him cantyou see this is the first step to what jane opened her mouth remus shook his head dontworry you get used to his blondeness a n no offence whatsoever to blondes the clown lay forgotten the tables had turned now james chased lily as she squealed and ran sirius cleared his throat the two turned around to find their friends oh hello how long have you been here long enough lily looked at them apologetically before giving jane a hug merry christmas she proceeded to give sirius and remus hugs too as the boys exchanged manly handshakes and a hug between james and jane jane looked around and her eyes lit up she had spent christmas with the evans the year before and had had a lot of fun this is nice christmas evans style my second favourite lily smiled she and jane went to the table and started setting it as dinner was being taken care of once the plates and cutlery were set the boys were called they said their prayers and the food magically would you believe it appeared you had your potatoes the largest turkey lily had ever seen gravy brussel sprouts no one touched those stuffing you get the gist of it right they laughed talked joked and just had fun after dinner they sat by the fireplace had hot chocolate and just reminisced they talked about past christmases their family traditions and christmas incidents both lily and jane noticed that sirius never had any of his own home experiences to share he contributed very little but when he did it was always something that had happened at james house the boys seemed not to notice but whenever sirius added a word or two the girls would exchange a glance at 11 30 pm they left when asked why sirius was ushering them out before midnight he laughed nervously and said that he couldntlet the night become christmas before going to bed james and remus knew why he wanted t put an end to the discussion lily and jane had observed him getting more and more uncomfortable as the chat had progressed with a final goodbye and a last merry christmas see you tomorrow they left the room and went their separate ways james and lily sat in their common room eyeing the presents do you think we should open them technically it christmas i dontreally know but you know maybe just one which one though i mean we cantopen the ones from sirius and co because then they ll be upset that they werenthere how about the ones we got for each other that could work they looked at the presents again calling their names yeah ok lets do that they ran to the presents and sought out the ones from each other you should go first it not very good but i didntknow what else to get you james mumbled shyly lily tore apart the wrapping paper to find a velvet covered box inside she gasped when she saw what was inside it was a beautiful sterling silver necklace the locket was an l with a lily wrapped around it the flower had a beautiful frosted effect to make it stand out thank you james you re the best she hugged him james let out a sigh of relief and started to open his own present they were robes not just any robes though they were the appleby arrows robes personalised appleby arrows robes he was shocked he stared at his name on the back and then to lily and then back again how how did you do this he asked incredulously she looked sheepish i bought some normal ones and then transfigured the name on the back james looked at her with his mouth open if you dontlike them i can take them back sirius told me you liked them but he was probably messing you probably like the wasps or something james shook his head no no no i like the arrows this is this is you rock he hugged lily lily let out a sigh of relief identical to james a few minutes ago they got up to go to bed when a buzzing sound was heard james and lily were confused where is that noise coming from james looked around the room as lily looked up james hm james said as he glanced around did you let sirius in here any time this week uhhh yeah he needed to borrow a cloak why did you leave him in the lounge alone might have done because the prat gone and charmed the mistletoe oh ooooohhhhh james said as his eyes widened and he slowly looked up lily nodded she made to run away but found she was rooted to the spot ok you try james was hesitant i d really rather stay here and take part in the outcome of the tradition but he tried nonetheless his attempts were fruitless lily eyes were shut tightly shut and she was muttering to herself no no no this is not happening so not happening am i really that bad james said amusedly for the safety of your feelings i d really rather not answer that she quipped and he rolled his eyes so what are we going to do he enquired no idea well you know we cantstay here all night i know that lily said as she thought and thought so how about just a quick kiss just a quick one yeah i can do that lily stood there feeling self conscious as james leaned in their lips brushed both felt as if a huge electric current had rushed through them as they broke apart the mistletoe stopped buzzing and each left for their room without saying another word the awkwardness felt on the previous night had almost completely been forgotten lily had gotten up really early and was getting a glass of milk all on her own no help from the house elves for james she had her can of pepsi lily loved fizzy drinks of all kinds but you of course couldntfind them in wizarding world anywhere so this year she d brought her own stock james bounded into the room and headed for the tree james he turned around to where lily was standing have you brushed yep ok here you go she handed him his glass of milk he glanced at her blue can and looked at her eyebrow raised what what on earth is that he said pointing at her can pepsi what si pepsi pepsi pepsi ok so what pepsi a fizzy drink a fizzy drink yes must you repeat everything i say sorry forget it but i still think your weird good i cantbe arsed to explain to you what it is we have presents james looked back round to his original destination and his face lit up presents he yelled as he ran over to the tree lily laughed and shook her head james picked up the first one when lily quickly stopped him what he asked scandalised remember we have to wait for the other guys james swore an idea had just come to him he ran into his room and extracted a mirror from his desk sirius black he spoke into the mirror no reply figures the prick sleeping on christmas day sirius black he yelled into the mirror and in the distance he heard a what the hell that sounded suspiciously like lily no shit shut up fine a very sleepy looking sirius appeared what the fuck do you want i was sleeping prongs language language merry christmas christmas oh my god christmas it christmas he cheered and james heard a now he realises which he knew came from remus not a word from you i wasntgoing to say anything you re speaking to yourself by the way we re coming mate five minutes later jane sirius and remus could be heard knocking at the door cries of merry christmas soon rang through the room as they exchanged greetings they then ran to the christmas tree and attacked the presents lily was happy with what she d gotten this year kayla had gotten her a beautiful emerald green shawl you might think they re old ladyish but if you play your cards right they can look pretty good adea had gotten her a set of chiffon dress robes in lilac jane had gotten her a copy reviving the forgotten a book on ancient ways of healing and healing potions as healing was the career she was looking into sirius had gotten her the hugest box of sugar quills on the face of the earth from remus she got a set of the finest quills eagle feather pheasant feather peacock feather etc and from peter she received a box of chocolate frogs her parents had gotten lily some new clothes and sent a new pack of pepsi s petunia sent well nothing while her grandmother had sent her a considerable amount of money james was content too sirius had gotten him the best of pranks dungbombs wet start fireworks nose biting teacups two bars of frogspawn soap and much more remus had gotten james quidditch through the ages peter had gotten james a massive box of bertie botts kayla had gotten james an appleby arrows scarf adea had given him a sweater jane had gotten him a massive box of ice mice his favourite his parents had gotten him the latest broomstick the silver arrow the five friends then proceeded to the great hall to have breakfast and enjoy christmas day a n that the end of this chapter classes start next chapter and then we proceed to valentine day slight very very slight progress in the james lily department disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n hello well i going to start responding all reviewers of the last chapter and from here onwards look for your responses at the bottom and thank you to everyone who reviewed it really does make me feel better back to the kerfuffle the christmas holidays had ended lessons started friends returned and the vacant spaces in both groups had filled out again since sirius and jane had gotten together so close to the end of term the night before everyone had left not many had gotten to know that they were going out so when they came back and did find out well it meant hell for jane everywhere she went everywhere she turned she was badgered by weeping girls is it true you re going out with sirius black when do you think you ll break up if he your boyfriend does that mean we canthave random snogs with him is it true can you pinch yourself and tell me if it till true are you sure he your man why would he go out with you this comment had done it for jane nothing was said in reply just a nice slap and a handprint forming on the offender cheek for sirius it was quite different he was quite often stopped by guys who questioned his sanity are you okay mate i mean swales did she bribe you into it come on all the girls are after you why her isntshe a lunatic i heard she transferred from st mungo s why would you go out with jane swales she such a hag this was the comment which made sirius snap by the time sirius was finished with him the boy was sporting a black eye broken nose and bleeding lip but all in all amidst the slaps punches and black eyes they were pretty happy and used almost any opportunity to spend time together they had chat quite a lot of other couples didn t mutual understanding both knew at which emotional level the other stood and they managed to maintain the close friendship they had before but still be something more it was when matters got to kayla and remus that problems arose kayla knew of remus lycanthropy she wasntgoing to tell him that she had given him time to place enough trust in her and tell her himself what irritated her was that they d been going out since halloween and remus was still backing out of dates and lying through his teeth about it it aggravated her that he still didnttrust her enough to know about his condition she had unintentionally become colder towards him because of it so remus want to sneak out this weekend this weekend sorry love cantdo this weekend i have to visit my mum again next weekend maybe dontlie to me remus was getting a little agitated what are you talking about remus why cantyou make it this weekend i told you because i visiting my mother unbelievable what unbelievable that you can stand there look me in the eye and just flat out lie about what you re doing this weekend i haventa clue what you re talking about why would i lie to you kayla let out a bitter astonished laugh she then looked at him pleadingly remus please one more time where are you going this weekend please dontlie please remus looked into her sapphire blue eyes which were at present dulled by a tinge of sadness and hurt a sight he truly hated to see it became increasingly difficult for him to lie to her after she was asking so sincerely so desperately he turned away so he didnthave to look at her i visiting my mother fine you know what fine she got up to leave remus took hold of her arm kayla come on she wrenched her arm from his grasp and said talk to me when you want to tell me the truth lupin he winced at the sound of her using his last name he watched her retreating form if you wanted deep shit this is it he muttered he morosely made his way to the common room since he had twenty minutes before care of magical creatures started kayla stormed off to her charms lesson as she walked in she noticed adea staring at her i dontwant to talk about it okay i didntsay anything well you implied it adea analysed her for a second before coolly saying okay and turning away kayla felt guilty now she had upset her friend a friend who was not upsetted easily she listlessly answered to her name when called from the register and hardly listened to a word flitwick said miss simmons would you like to tell us what charm we ll be learning today she looked around and saw lily mouth something err the protean charm professor professor flitwick shook his head as he squeaked thank you for that miss evans but i really was asking miss simmons lily smiled sheepishly miss simmons please do not daydream while the protean charm is being taught otherwise i guarantee you will make a mistake kayla nodded sat up straight and started taking notes she hoped focusing on something would take her mind off her fight with remus class put on your dragon hide gloves we ll be handling firecrabs today remus put on his gloves but his mind was elsewhere he d fought with kayla the girl he d had a crush on since third year the girl he thought would never notice him the girl he d finally gotten and now she was gone remus miserably walked to the front of the greenhouse to collect a firecrab with the rest of his friends sirius took pity on him come on prongs we have to do something look at him he heartbroken james glanced at his friend remus crab had just set fire to his glove but remus hadntnoticed james whipped out his wand and extinguished the fire even after a jet of water had come shooting at his hand remus still didntnotice you re right padfoot he devastated james said slightly embellishing a bit they knew why remus and kayla had fought he d told them but james didnttell him that kayla knew you should tell her mate we haventbeen going out that long tell her prongs dontbe a prat just tell her dammit remus looked enquiringly at james you know something he stated laughing nervously he replied what are you talking about what do you know nothing remus raised his eyebrows james crossed his arms and even if i did you ll never find out so there tell her but what if she breaks up with me i dontwant that to happen sirius looked thoughtful isntthere anything you can do i mean you could talk to lily or jane i couldntwithout giving too much away james stayed unusually silent what we need is someone who close to kayla but who doesntknow enough about you to put two and two together sirius said james coughed she has a sister gabrielle first year i ve only spoken to her a couple of times nice kid sirius shrugged worth a shot alright i d like your homework next lesson without fail you may leave the students got up grabbed their bags and made for the door dee sorry i snapped at you she smiled at her friend hopefully adea looked at kayla she didntwant to smile she didn t the sides of her mouth twitched and yes there was a smile friends kayla asked adea nodded and they hugged adea eyed her friend with interest now unless i wrong it was either problems with remus or pms kayla thought about it shrugged and said both adea shook her head and said you really need to stop being so forward about everything kayla looked confused what you asked adea laughed and patted the other girl on the head kayla had flew to her hair hey dontmess with the hair oh you do not know how much you looked like james just then kayla made a sound of indignation i ll take that as an insult dontlet him hear that the two girls giggled and made their way to history of magic forgetting their problems for that short moment gabrielle hey gabrielle a first year girl turned around remus ran to meet her her friends started giggling excitedly a seventh year a marauder no less had stopped their friend in the hallway remus gave them an odd look while gabrielle scowled she turned around and said he my sister boyfriend the giggling subsided hey could i maybe talk to you over there he pointed to somewhere quite a bit away from her friends gabrielle nodded and followed remus what the matter have you talked to your sister lately not since last night no remus let a sigh of relief gabrielle looked at him shrewdly why oh no reason i just wanted to ask you something go ahead what do your family think of werewolves gabrielle gave him a what the hell look and remus tried to make an excuse for the odd question um its for a survey for erm my uh defence against the dark arts class gabrielle rolled her eyes and said in a casual manner i know you re lying so i wontask any questions what about my question oh that oh we re fine with them mum had a friend in school that got bit by a werewolf she got kicked out they re people really arentthey remus nodded so kayla she thinks the same way of course she does oh good why gabrielle enquired uh uh no questions fine it too trivial for me anyway she huffed folded her arms and stuck her nose in the air remus laughed and took in the young girl profile in truth gabrielle simmons did not look a thing like her sister you couldnteven tell they were related that is until you heard them both speak gabrielle hair was an unusual colour you d think it was black but in the sunlight you d come to realise that her hair was midnight blue her eyes were an intriguing violet unlike kayla golden skin gabrielle complexion was incredibly pale she had extremely sensitive skin and had to go to extreme lengths to protect her skin from the sun in the summer it was the only flaw on an otherwise beautiful girl a lot of the first year boys had crushes on her and remus could see why she had the kind of beauty a na ve first year boy would go for not the kind of beauty however that a hormonally imbalanced 4th or 5th year would go for you know kid any guy would be lucky to have you gabrielle looked at him confusedly what the hell does that have to do with anything she shrugged and said thanks i think remus patted her head and her hand immediately flew to her hair as he turned around he heard her call hey watch the hair in a manner so identical to kayla that remus froze for a second and all thoughts of kayla came swimming back to him he shook his head to break out of his reverie and continued on his way lily attitude towards james had changed not to his face it was just the little things for instance she noticed that in class when he wasntlistening almost always or was bored not almost he was always bored he d extract some parchment from his bag and start doodling what he wrote on those pieces of parchment she never knew whenever she asked him he d change the topic that my dear is for me to know and you to find out and whenever he was particularly stuck not very often he started to frantically run his hand through his hair they were in their potions lesson and james and lily were working together professor jabin had in september assigned them to work together due to their dislike of each other well it had worked at the time and they had provided her with many lessons of entertainment but now that they were getting along they were boring to her james i need some spine of lionfish got it he handed her the substance as she threw it into the cauldron and stirred 3 times clockwise and 34 times anti clockwise making the draught of living death was no picnic james i ll need a bit of asphodel too here you go thanks after finishing the 53rd stir that was needed after you added the asphodel the potion was ready to be poured into a flask labelled and handed in as lily walked up to professor jabin desk she heard the sadistic woman sniff disdainfully and added hmm miss evans not up to scratch for the head girl are you dense girl lily discreetly rolled her eyes she knew their potion was perfect and there wasnta thing in the world old jabin could do to stop them from at least getting an e but still being called dense was not something lily was used to as the class was dismissed lily and james walked out discussing how sullen their teacher had become since james and lily had buried the hatchet she called me dense well if that isntthe pot calling the kettle black i dontknow what is james quipped lily cast a sideways glance towards him are you taking the mick why to be sure i am james i serious i was quite insulted then you let her achieve her goal what do you mean oh she just annoyed that we re friends now and she cantleech the fun out of our lives anymore lily mulled this over i bet she had a right field day when i fell off the ladder lily said being the bitch that she is she probably did james replied disgustedly oh she makes me so angry i ve always wanted to cast a cheering charm on her must be her worst nightmare james laughed actually an idea has just began to form in my head james said thoughtfully oh she replied interested i have to discuss it with the marauders of course lily looked slightly worried now no james forget about it nope can i change your mind lily asked hopefully will you give me a kiss james countered just as hopefully ok fine just donthurt her or get me in trouble but it ok for me to get in trouble your ideas your trouble as of now i have nothing to do with this and she stalked off as he watched her retreating form i need to find adea i dontknow how much longer i can go without giving her the slightest little kiss he didntknow where adea was and he knew he wouldntbe able to find her so he decided to ask someone else he searched the map and found kayla out on the grounds alone perfect hello miss simmons ugh kayla was sitting under a magically dried patch underneath a bare tree well i must confess you do look beautiful today flattery my friend will get you everywhere what do you want james i was looking for adea have any idea where she is james asked politely i dontknow where she is now but she was in our dormitory last i saw of her thanks kayla no problem hey can i ask you one more thing james added before he left make it quick would you have told you by now he said looking her straight in the eye kayla scowled james dontdo the whole wise thing it not you james sighed and nodded he was almost out of earshot when he heard a small thanks he smiled but didntturn around adea sat on her bed with her hangings shut she was digging her sharp nails into her skin until she bled but she didntknow why her cheeks were tearstained and her eyes refused to cease crying she was asking herself why she was doing it and coming up with no answer i dontneed to be doing this i don t why canti stop it isntright you stupid girl stop it stop it right now what is wrong with you you worthless piece of crap stop you ll never amount to anything and you ll amount to even less if you dontstop this foolishness you arentpretty you arentnice and you re fat you re of no good to anyone stop just stop it stop with the name calling i ll do anything just please she screamed tearfully the weeping girl took some deep breaths and looked at herself what am i doing i completely ruining myself she whispered at she ran her fingers over the marks on her arm adea are you in here oh no she whipped out her wand and pointed at her arm tectum she muttered and the grooves in which her nails had painfully lain disappeared she then pointed at her face and said tersi visio to clean up her face now she just needed to cover the red puffy eyes she pointed at her eyes and whispered occulto she took a deep breath and ripped open her hangings james stood in the dormitory broom in hand and a window wide open behind him hey he said good morning james he raised his eyebrows and took in her appearance you sound strangled why he asked shrewdly adea forced a smile oh it nothing really sore throat is all your face looks more fresh than usual dontbe so paranoid cantmy face look fresh once in awhile though james noticed she didntquite meet his eyes as she said this he scanned her eyes for something they looked pained something he hadntseen in them before she was quiet but unhappy she was hiding something her face looked different her eyes looked different her voice was different why have you become so thin he asked critically oh it these winter months you wouldntknow you haventseen me in the winter before i always get like this wait a second did something happen with mohsin i can beat him up in a heartbeat if you like adea almost laughed at this insinuation oh come on you know he d never do anything to hurt me yeah yeah he your oldest friend right adea looked confused yeah why james shrugged oh no reason he lied he turned and headed for the window when adea remembered something hey wait didntyou want to ask me something she said james thought leave that for now i ll get back to it i sure i ll manage uh i forgot yeah when it comes to me i ll get back to you ok she nodded and watched him fly out of the window before leaving for her next lesson remus come on get up would you look at yourself all sad because of some girl you ve gone soft mate sirius whined to his melancholy friend remus still didntknow what to do he really wanted to tell kayla but it wasntquite as easy as you d think piss off sirius sirius huffed in mock indignation as he turned to peter one of us is going to have to do something sirius whispered what about james got his own problems oh was all that peter could say sirius sat in deep thought well do you want to do it pete peter shook his head quickly no simmons scares me sirius looked disgusted pete honestly get a grip fine i ll do it peter smiled and sirius smacked him round the head hey peter cried call yourself a marauder james searched the marauder map and saw that waqar was currently in an arithmancy lesson james himself had 50 minutes until his next lesson damn it i really cantbe arsed to wait for the end of the lesson i have my own lessons to got i did not just say that he shook his head and made his way to professor vector classroom professor vector oh mr potter how may i help you i was actually looking for waqar mohsin he wouldntbe here by any chance would he well he is here what may i ask is he being called for james thought fast something happened the ravenclaw prefect needs to be alerted a first year been injured i guessing the first year is a ravenclaw the seventh years in front of the teacher sniggered no sir i thought i d alert the ravenclaw prefect because a slytherin first year been injured james said with a hint of sarcasm vector looked confused the students laughed louder james was looking at the man with astonishment it was a joke sir professor vector smiled ah yes very well mohsin dontforget to get the homework from someone waqar nodded grabbed his bag and followed james how can someone that thick teach arithmancy james asked waqar shrugged dontknow but he manages to make us all pass somehow what first year was it james smacked him round the head hey what was that for i was lying dumbass oh they continued to walk so why am i skiving arithmancy waqar asked james suddenly remembered why he d gotten the ravenclaw out of class first of all you should be thankful secondly have you noticed anything different about adea lately how do you mean i dunno about the way she talks looks eats anything waqar thought for a second well actually now that you mention it i was eating at the gryffindor table the other day and she ate a carrot and 2 slices of cucumber for dinner didntyou say anything when i asked her about she said that she d had a big lunch i asked her again and she told me to trust her so i left it at that james looked at waqar bewildered and you just trusted her just like that yeah i mean why shouldnti i ve never had any reason not to james raised an eyebrow he d only been in two serious relationships and both had finished because of lack of trust it was something james just couldntfathom potter are you there james snapped out of thought haventyou noticed that she become thinner yeah it always happens in winter james shook his head does she always eat less in the winter as well well no so isntit a bit odd that she jut ate a carrot and cucumbers and all of a sudden she thinner as well maybe she did have a big lunch have you considered that well i guess but listen thanks for being concerned but i trust her she would ve told me but waqar wasntcompletely convinced himself james looked at the other boy poor guy he ll be crushed when he finds out because i know she hiding something james shrugged and said well if you re sure the bell rang students started pouring into the hallway listen potter i have to go look after her when i not around with that he walked off kayla i need to speak to you for a sec kayla rolled her eyes what is wrong with the world today is it too hard to have two minutes to myself she looked up at sirius oh you re here about remus got it well sit down and do whatever it is that you need to do as the role of best friend talk sense into me give me wise advice no wait that was potter so you re here for the sense bit or maybe it your job to make me evaluate my relationship is that it she looked expectantly at him as sirius looked rather taken aback uh actually oh i sorry i have this tendency to never bottle up my feelings i know it overwhelming dontworry i an overwhelming person nope you ll never meet another one like me kayla said sirius stared at her blankly ok i understand why peter was so scared to talk to you now scared ah that wuss can i get a word in here please oh of course this is your moment isntit go ahead i all ears she sat and stared intently at him sirius was even more disconcerted he tried to start over right well first of all you can stop this act what act the messing around i dontcare that i ve just broken up with my boyfriend act duly noted act has been dropped you re still doing it doing what exactly that hm sirius sat and thought about the word he wanted to use it was on the tip of his tongue bravado that what it is i know you re just as upset as he is kayla frowned and threw her arms up fine what do you want me to do do you want me to cry my eyes out do you want me to grab a tub of ice cream and sit around in my pyjamas all day well what sirius looked thoroughly baffled now look i dontknow what kind of twisted and i do mean twisted things girls are supposed to do when they re upset you just said you never bottle up your feelings i don t i always say what on my mind you know that do i what sirius looked at her long and hard and spoke in a soft voice which made it seem like he was talking more to himself than her do you do you always say what on your mind do you never bottle up your feelings i dontthink you do i think you make seem like you do so you can really hide what going on inside kayla grimaced and didntsay anything for a bit i really do not know what you re talking about but i onto you this time kayla i know you re upset upset why on earth would i be upset i ll let you answer that she stayed silent for a while he watched passers by he whistled she thought finally she said i bet you think you re smart i dontthink i know kayla stuck out her tongue as sirius remained indifferent he got up and said i want you to come with me to where you ll see it had reached 10 00 and james and lily were out patrolling james was having a hard time looking at lily without losing the control adea had taught him you know saying some cheesy chat up line or trying to accidentally kiss her so in conclusion all he did was look the other way and try to make as little eye contact as was possible this proved to be difficult on account of the fact that they were sharing living quarters for a vast majority of the year so it a nice night lily said absentmindedly james looked out of a window they were passing and nodded nice yeah lily rolled her eyes he been doing this the whole week ok what up up with me no what up with merlin lily said sarcastically i dontknow but i suggest he talk it out with morgana james joked dontbe smart with me sorry i canthelp it you re trying to divert my attention not working sweetheart shit language oh shut up fine they walked in silence not talking james didntknow what to do he was trapped he knew he couldntdo anything that would jeopardise his and lily friendship friends was better than nothing but he was having a problem not doing anything damn it lily what do i do maybe you have an answer because i certainly don t i donteven know what you re talking about i still like you what i sorry you re my friend and i love that we dontfight anymore and you re a great friend you really are but i want more i canthelp it what do i do lily stood rooted to the spot she didntknow what to say she hadntbeen prepared for an outburst like this she thought james had gotten over his crush ages ago what did he want her to do did he expect her to be hunky dory with it or what she looked around at the walls the windows anywhere but him her mind was spinning and she didnteven know why his little confession was so short and so quick she couldntmake head nor tail of it her heart was pounding but why why am i reacting like this normally i d give him two tight slaps why canti do anything just say something go on just do it hit him shout at him i can t i just can t what is wrong with me she looked at james her breath got caught his hazel eyes were staring intently at her they were clouded with something there was concern and something else lingered in there it scared her slightly lily say something anything i need you to tell me what to do i i tell me lily will you ever give me a chance ever tell me i i cantbe here right now she turned around and ran she ran from the confusion she ran from the hurt she knew james was feeling there do you see him sirius asked kayla he had taken james invisibility cloak and quietly snuck kayla into his dormitory kayla looked to remus and looked at his face he looked thoroughly miserable she hated knowing it was her fault he was like this and she hated knowing she couldntrun to him and make him feel alright sirius looked at her expectantly well he asked she remained silent go to him kayla she shook her head maybe when he learns to trust those who care about him she turned and left the dormitory once outside the door she carefully placed the cloak at the foot before returning to her own dormitory sirius ran down the stairs to meet his girlfriend in the common room he spotted her reading on the sofa he went to her and grabbed her book hey he silenced her with a kiss she pulled away so what happened she kayla what do you expect happened jane looked at him sympathetically she thought for a moment but drew a blank what should we do she asked sirius sighed and put his arms around jane at the minute i dontwant to do anything i just going to sit here with you he kissed her again he ran his fingers through her salmon pink and black hair while they sat in silence the occasional kiss jane went upstairs to find kayla sitting on her bed her eyes were glazed over for some reason the window was wide open and the chilly january airs invaded the room kayla seemed oblivious to this however as she sat freezing in her pyjamas jane threw a glance at her friend before going to shut the window she then walked over to kayla bed and hugged the girl that sat on it come on kay lets get you into bed but her friend didntflicker an eyelid she just stayed exactly as she was jane shook her head well i going to have to do this the hard way still no answer jane went to her own bedside table and extricated her wand from it mobilicorpus kayla stationary body hovered a few inches over the bed jane held her wand in one hand and peeled the covers of kayla bed with the other she then placed kayla under the covers and tucked her in her friend still hadntmoved and jane was getting a little panicked she checked kayla pulse which seemed to be normal kayla you are going to need to nod so that i know you re medically okay now kayla moved she gave a very small nod but it was enough for jane jane knelt down kayla level and whispered listen i know you re upset with him but this isntthe way to go about it do you hear me now you and remus are going to have to figure this out like adults the pair of you are acting like selfish children i especially disappointed in you how can you expect him to be so open about so something so big and you haventexactly told him the entire truth either have you i want you to think about that tomorrow right now go to sleep with that she shut the hangings and proceeded to her own bed a n well i tried very hard to make this chapter as long as possible but this is all that came out i sorry for the wait but was it really that bad okay well leave me your comments review responses hazen i glad you like this and look i have an update the all mighty and powerfulm thank you so much for your review hope you liked this chapter clare i glad you think so and i definitely not going to discontinue this thank you to all my reviewers keep reading and reviewing disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me the poem in the scene where kayla is contemplating is the 10 things i hate about you poem therefore it belongs to the makers of 10 things i hate about you the song at the end is i bruise easily by natasha bedingfield and therefore belongs to her and whoever wrote it a n again very adlib i just wanted a head start on the next chapter i promise january passed and the awkwardness felt in january enhanced as february fell upon them not only were remus and kayla still not on speaking terms but also lily and james had become oddly quiet around each other it seemed that they would never talk to each other unless it regarded their head duties peter was too cowardly to try and fix anything so he tagged along with remus most of the time it did seem as though jane and sirius were the only ones who could help of course there was one other too but for the first time she had her own problems to deal with the funny thing well funny to sirius anyway was that jane didntseem to want to do anything about the situation or situations rather janie sirius whined jane started to hum as she randomly drew on some parchment no sirius and dontcall me janie she said idly but why he persisted jane sighed but did not let go of her quill or even remove her eyes from the parchment listen we are going to have to step back and let them work out their problems we ve done our bits now until someone gets seriously hurt i wontinterfere now if you dontmind i over this she said insouciantly and started drawing again sirius just watched her jane he asked no answer just humming jane only humming jane his girlfriend appeared to be temporarily deaf he planned some pranks while she continued humming after a while she got up laid her parchment by his side and glided up her dormitory stairs sirius watched her leave he picked up a parchment to see a perfect portrait of him staring back at him she d captured everything without saying a word or even properly looking at him during the last hour sirius raised his eyebrows that girl is hot he exclaimed he placed the drawing inside his bag and went to show his friends the pranks that he d planned adea and waqar were out walking about the grounds they walked through the frosty airs and the icy earth not saying a word this wasntunusual for them but today both had something plaguing their minds so i noticed that you re getting quite thin these days waqar said in what he hoped was an offhand voice adea looked around before answering oh come on you know it just these winter months he nodded and then added you just look thinner than you normally do at this time of year still she refused to look at him when she spoke really i hadntnoticed waqar looked at her well the back of her head anyway she still faced the other direction she never could lie to me lie well anyway he didntvoice his thoughts though but he did voice james concern just wanted to make sure you re eating ok he said hoping for some reaction adea finally met his gaze we went through this i told you to trust me she said waqar nodded again i know just remember that okay remember that we ve known each other all of our lives remember that i d trust you with my life remember that we promised to tell each other everything he said adea looked at him with well not love just the unnamed feeling you have before you fall in love in her eyes i trust you with my life too she said quietly she looked at the ground when she said the next part i do tell you everything he looked at her he could feel it she was going through some sort of pain when you love someone you just have that connection he wanted to make it better for her to soothe her until she could feel pain no more but if she wasntready to tell him then he d have to respect that she still kept intently focused on the ground her eyes start to well up with tears memories of their childhood started swarming in her mind flashback my four year old self sat on the floor of my bedroom sobbing waqar walks in i see the surprise on his face dee what wrong he asks i hold out my torn teddy bear for him to see t teddy arm came off and and i couldntfind mummy and daddy to fix it and then and then i asked kiri my house elf but she she said she

she i ask he beckons for me to follow him we go downstairs and into the parlour where shahira aunty a n no waqar and adea are not related in anyway see authors not at the end for explanation sat with feroz uncle when they see me they look worried adea darling what the matter shahira aunty says as she hugs me i hold out teddy she takes him and then looks at me questioningly teddy she asks i point to his arm his arm is broken and no one can fix it but waqar said you could shahira aunty smiles and then looks at teddy well we re going to have to fix him before it gets serious wontwe she takes out her wand says something and teddy arm looks good as new i smile and give shahira aunty a hug thank you shahi aunty thank you thank you thank you she laughs and gives teddy back i look back at her

cry he doesntseem to respond he just says adea i dontwant to play tig anymore i fold my arms you just dontwant to be it he shakes his head and i drop it i think for a while hey wanna get the water guns i ask excitedly he shrugs sure i frown what the matter i did something naughty in school today adea i gasp naughty what did you do well we were painting our clay pots and miss walker said we had to paint them red but i wanted to paint mine blue when i asked her if i could she said they had to be red and then i got a little angry suddenly my pot goes flying out of my hand and then it explodes in miss walker face her face was all grey because it was covered with clay dust he looks at me guiltily i try to make him feel better well at least you showed your magic he nodded i guess but now miss walker says she wants to talk to my mummy and daddy tomorrow i worried now uh oh he looks sad have you told your mummy and daddy i ask he shakes his head i shocked waqar he winces i was scared adea will you help me tell them i smile of course i will come one lets go now end flashback everything she repeated softly her eyes started to sting as she kept her tears cooped up they started to fall freely she looked up at waqar and shook her head no no i donttell you everything he looked at her understandingly what haventyou told me adea he said softly she rolled up her sleeve whipped out her wand pointed it at her arm and said aperio bruises and scabs appeared before his eyes where her flawless skin had previously been his eyes widened in shock waqar had a sneaking suspicion as to what caused them but hoped to god it wasnttrue how did this happen he asked more tears started to fall i i but she couldntfinish the sentence because she started crying waqar hugged her and she cried into his arm i sorry i so so sorry i promise i ll stop i promise he stroked her hair it ok calm down i trust you dontworry come on finally she pulled away wiped her tears he looked at her questioningly i cantdo it i want it taken away i not strong enough waqar took hold of her shoulders look at me look at me now he demanded their eyes met you were chosen for a reason you ve managed it all your life even when we were little dontlet it take over and dontyou dare say you re not strong you are the strongest person i ve ever come across ever and i know i ll never meet another person as strong as you she nodded i being stupid really getting soft that what it called she said waqar shook his head no you re not getting soft you re being human she smiled it just lately there been a little voice in my head that been telling me how ugly i am how fat i am how stupid i am it s it awful and then with the others i couldntcope i just couldn t waqar looked at her in awe i dontknowwhy this voice exists but let me set it straight he said defiantly adea smiled at how cute he was when he was determined he persisted onwards in a tone which almost commanded her to pay attention you are gorgeous intelligent loved and an amazing person you are a blessing to those who know you and those who are fortunate enough to even notice you canthelp but love you and dontlet anyone or anything tell you otherwise he said adea smiled do you know what i think she asked he motioned for her to continue i think you are the most perfect guy to have walked the face of this earth waqar raised his eyebrows do you know what that was he said she shook her head and he continued cheese on a stick that what that was adea laughed and shoved him hey i resent that i thought it was unbelievably profound waqar made a gagging sound profound my arse she slapped him playfully and he started to chase her for the time being they forgot about their troubles as they played in the freezing cold weathers just like they used to lily sat in the head lounge working on her ancient runes essay professor cummings had asked for a three foot essay this was his idea of preparing them for the newts well to each his own flippin hell what possessed cummings to set us a three foot essay preparation my foot more like revenge after a bad weekend that what it was small dark mutterings like that could be heard coming from the redhead she frantically wrote down facts as she flipped through the pages of the humungous textbook with her other hand james was just walking out of his bathroom he d left his glasses in the lounge and needed them he didntthink lily was in so he d just nip in and get them he walked in with just a towel around his waist to see a mass of red hair at the table shit he cried lily looked up oh oh my god lily blushed as she took in his bare chest at least you know where all that quidditch been going she shook her head i i um she fumbled he seemed to be equally lost at their awkward situation though he grinned at the fact that she was still staring at his chest she darted a glance towards his face and saw that he was grinning she blushed harder and gazed downwards away from his face and his chest i so sorry lily i didnteven know you were in here he said finding it easier to talk when she didnthave her eyes on him lily shook her head sorry i should ve given some warning my fault entirely james whistled well i guess we re even now james said lily nodded still gazing downwards she pretty when she blushes he said her head snapped up and was looking him straight in the eye her eyes full of surprise what she said more a statement than a question james realised what he d said oh i said that that i have to go now bye he stuttered and made a dash for his room lily shook the image of his perfectly toned chest out of her head and tried to focus on the ancient runes essay in front of her james locked the door behind him and let out a sigh of relief oh god yes well that was awkward but hey did you happen to notice how she was staring at your chest uh how could i not and she was blushing she likes you i dontthink so anyone would blush in a situation like that kayla sat and contemplated the last month or so unattached and remus free no boyfriend to worry about no messing about with make up and what to wear no shifting her schedule around to fit in date no fuss at all it was hell quite frankly she hated not being with remus she hated seeing other girls checking him out and not being able to do anything about it she hated not being able to talk to him and she hated that she couldntbe around him for too long most of all she hated that she actually missed him kayla could act as insouciant as she wanted but it didntmatter because inside she was miserable yes for the first time kayla simmons was not being outspoken or blunt or harsh she wouldntwalk around the castle with her head in the air sending calculating looks to strangers no in fact these days she walked through the halls with her head down not daring to make eye contact with anyone you would think someone like kayla wouldntbe affected by something like a break up she d never even cried not that she was crying now she d never sink that low someone once said those who fight their emotions hardest find their heart broken easiest funny isntit remus wasntmuch different the past two weeks had been unbearable sometimes in lessons he d sit and stare at the back of her head or the side of her face subconsciously he would wait in the common room in the mornings and it would take him ten minutes to realise that there wasntanyone to wait for anymore he would scribble her name on his parchment a hundred times over and not get bored part of him really wanted to tell her but another part held him back he wondered why he always let the latter win i mean could anything really go wrong well apart from her completely freaking out besides james was pretty confident that she wouldntso why couldnthe remus just do it remus knew kayla wasntover the moon either for some reason that didntmake him feel any better it just made the sick feeling stomach deepen valentine day was fast approaching and though remus never participated he wished he could usually he wasntwith anyone and if he was with someone then she wouldntbe the right girl or she d be a friend of some bimbo james and sirius had picked up but this year he d had the right girl keyword being had what was with james anyway james constant badgering of him to tell kayla led remus suspicions of james knowing something else to become stronger with each passing day oh and then there was sirius and jane why were they so damn perfect together it made remus feel jealous but guilty at the same time the jealousy was easily explained remus was bitter because he himself had a chance to have that but he was passing it up he was guilty because he knew he should be happy for sirius but wasn t what was remus supposed to do he could tell kayla and put them both out of their misery or he could tell kayla and he d still be miserable while she would be petrified or option 3 he could not tell kayla and they could carry on being miserable well with winning chances like those what can you say you could say jane swales hated many things but of all the things she hated number 1 had to be well number two actually number 1 was conformists number 2 had to be when her best friend didntact like her best friend anymore jane didntwant to interfere she really didntbut just tell remus would you jane suggested as she threw rocks into the lake with kayla thought you said you werentgoing to try ad get us back together anymore kayla replied coolly jane shrugged and said i not i just trying to get my best friend back i dontknow what you re talking about i standing right here kayla said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world jane shook her head no kayla simmons is standing right here i trying to retrieve kayla my best friend both girls remained silent for a while how about we talk about my best friend kayla said jane thought for a second before replying sure why not kayla annoyed by jane calmness continued anyway i think she changed since she got herself a boyfriend still no reaction jane mulled it over and said maybe she has kayla stopped throwing the stones and looked to her friend so what are we gonna do about it jane the other girl smiled and held out her pinky how about we pinky promise that we never let anything or anyone change who we are kayla laughed and latched her pinky onto jane s pinky promise she said so what do we do now jane asked kayla put her arm around her best friend well i ll glare at people in the corridors and you can read some astronomy books upside down jane looked up to the sky and muttered nice day which kayla knew was jane ish for sounds good this sucks james said as he sat with the marauders in the gryffindor common room sirius looked puzzled i swear those girls are trying to de marauderise us and you know what peter remus rolled their eyes we re letting them james cried outraged yeah we have to do some guy stuff sirius added james nodded remus still looked unconcerned and peter didntknow what to do so he stayed silent well it full moon this weekend james said remus sighed and said in a very sarcastic tone yeah cantwait sirius obviously didntnotice the irony as he clapped remus on the shoulder that the spirit moony james snorted we could do a prank peter timidly suggested sirius clicked his fingers yeah yeah a prank is long overdue but who should we prank james looked around and casually said we could do one on jabin sirius was really excited now genius prongs sheer genius he exclaimed and pounded his fist on the table sirius fist was pretty powerful the witch weekly that had been teetering on the edge of the table fell onto the floor well well well what do we have here sirius mused james gave him an odd look do you know how much you sounded like regulus just then a dark glint could be seen in sirius eyes as james regretted his words never never compare me to him or any of my family sirius whispered menacingly james nodded shamefully remus tried to lighten the atmosphere so padfoot what were you saying sirius shook his head before picking up the issue of with weekly look at this he said indicating the page that the magazine had landed on all three boys huddled to see what sirius was talking about the page he was referring to had was titled mugglisms do they work james remus and peter shot sirius odd looks with raised eyebrows sirius rolled his eyes and pointed at the picture the picture was of a muggle woman in a hot pink bathrobe a towel wrapped around her head and brown goo covering her face james remus and peter still looked confused sirius shook his head think about it lads imagine jabin walking into the great hall looking like this they laughed oh and we could give the old hag extra hairy legs remus suggested james smiled and added and perform a charm on her mirror so that she doesntnotice peter had a complaint guys that all great but where do we get this goo the marauders looked thoughtful we could make some goo suggested remus james shook his head yeah we could but with our potion skills it ll end up purple and lavender smelling remus nodded in agreement peter looked around sheepishly we ask one of the muggleborn girls to see if they have some james looked astonished brilliant pete absolutely brilliant now sirius had a complaint but where do we find a muggleborn girl he asked james remus and even peter rolled their eyes at this one your girlfriend a muggleborn you prat realisation dawned on sirius face oooohhhhh yeah good one prongs remus smacked him round the head before handing him a broom and ushering him up the girl dormitory stairs sirius entered the girl dormitory and saw jane lying on her stomach reading a book on further inspection she was reading it upside down and her eyes moved along the page as though she understood every word how the most gorgeous girl in the world today sirius said making his presence known to her she didntlook at him but said i fine today not too sure about yesterday though sirius grin grew broader he went to sit next to her hey i was talking about kayla but hey whatever floats your boat he joked jane nodded absentmindedly before saying oh kayla fine too at least that what she says sirius rolled his eyes you know i was talking about you no one else could possibly be the most gorgeous girl will you stop reading jane donned a whiny childlike tone but it getting to the good part she still refused to remove her eyes from the book sirius glanced at the book and then at jane and then back again umm janie your book upside down jane turned the page i know so what your point sirius laughed my point is just that you re reading it upside down jane nodded again that right no fun in reading a book right side up she said quietly sirius looked attentive explain it to me jane shook her head nope now how am i going to keep it to myself if i go around telling people before you know it ll become the next fad she made a gagging gesture sirius carefully prised the book from her hands and gave her a kiss a gentle kiss which slowly grew more and more passionate finally jane broke away and held out her hand there you ve had your kiss now can i have my book sirius stared at her any other girl would ve forgotten all else after a kiss like that with sirius black not jane but then jane wasntan ordinary girl you re amazing sirius whispered jane smiled and gave him a quick kiss before saying aaaaawwww you re amazing too book sirius shook his head i just need your attention for one more minute she motioned for him to continue you re muggleborn right sirius asked well yes though i dontsee how you didntknow that forget that for a second i need to borrow something if you have it sure what do you want brown goo brown goo he nodded jane looked thoughtful before replying well i donthave any though i wish i did dontknow what i d do with it though the last comment made sirius realise she didntknow what he was talking about no no brown goo it this stuff muggle girls put on their faces after they ve put towels on their heads and have bathrobes on sirius explained jane looked puzzled now on their faces did you say he nodded look i ll show you he said before taking out his wand accio witch weekly jane eyebrow rose as a copy of the latest with weekly came flying their way he grabbed it and flipped through the page before stopping on the desired one he brandished the article in front of her face jane rolled her eyes as she looked at the picture that a mud mask though i can see why you d call it brown goo do you have this mud mask then no i make my own avocado ones these types of masks are cruelly tested on animals but jane never got to finish her lecture as sirius had already left she shrugged picked up her book turned it upside down and started reading again so any luck james asked as he saw sirius fly down the steps nope but we can always ask lily remus nodded and looked to james james really didntwant to me why it got to be me james said as three pairs of eyes looked his way why do you think it got to be you remus asked james shrugged peter spoke up james you share a dormitory with the girl james looked to remus moony why dontyou go she gets on with you remus sighed james normally i would but at the moment i cannot be arsed james muttered darkly as he walked out of the portrait hole he walked to the chamber thinking about what he would say but before he had formed a plan the regal mahogany door faced him he took a deep breath said the password emerald haze and walked in lily was sitting on the sofa writing in something with a pepsi can in one hand what she writing in a diary maybe focus you idiot focus on the task at hand task at hand bit dramatic just do it ok sorry hey lily lily hurriedly shut the book and looked to him um h hey james he noticed her tone had changed when she d said his name softer more breathy he shook his head so do you need something she asked lily took a deep breath calm down would you it just james yeah you re right it just james she took a deep breath and stood up only realising that she had nothing to stand up for yeah actually i was wondering if you had a mud mask by any chance james had actually bothered to skim through the article lily gave him an odd look james smiled mischievously which made lily sigh for some reason what do you need a mud mask for lily asked after getting a hold of herself james smile was still there just something lily looked at him with suspicious eyes but asked no more follow me she said as she led the way to her room she motioned james to sit trust me this could take a while i have quite a collection james sat down on her bed as she went to her bathroom and started rummaging through the cabinet didntknow you were into all this girly make up y stuff he called to her lily laughed love the terminology no i not too into it i just like to keep my skin clear james nodded pretending he knew what she was talking about he personally liked to use good ole fashioned wizarding ways none of this technical muggle stuff aha here it is lily cried from inside the realms of her bathroom she walked out holding a sachet now potter i not giving you the tube for obvious reasons so here she handed him the sachet thanks lily he said he got up and made to leave but felt a hand on his shoulder wait right there potter let make something clear lily said sternly james nodded you are not to use this to poison anything or anybody for that matter got it james looked at her with innocent eyes now why would i poison something lily gave him a look and he shrugged ok so maybe i would but still you have my word no poisoning he saluted her and left james hurried back to the common room where his friends met him did you get it sirius asked excitedly james nodded and showed him the sachet they boys left for their dormitory more people were coming down to the common room and the marauders never revealed anything until opening night lily lay on her bed just thinking thinking about school her duties her friends her homework her family and james lily was so preoccupied with her thoughts that she failed to notice an owl fly right through her window and perch itself on lily vanity table after a few minutes of watching lily amusedly the owl tired of being ignored and gave a loud and distinctive hoot artemis lily cried she went to her vanity table to take the envelope from her mother owl lily had gotten artemis for her mother in fifth year as a mother day gift lily took the letter stroked the owl and instructed her to go to the owlery for food though lily had gotten her mother an owl in all her years at hogwarts she d never gotten herself an owl lily opened the

started thinking about petunia and the bridesmaid prospect i ll never get a letter from her that for sure but hey a girl can dream cantshe lily decided it was time to talk to sirius she remembered at christmas that james said that if she ever needed to talk about the petunia situation lily should go to sirius lily walked into the lounge and called around for james james james are you in here no answer lily then tiptoed into james room to find him sleeping she quietly walked over to his desk and started rummaging through it aha there it is she whispered the marauder map lily knew the password she d seen james use it countless times i solemnly swear i am up to no good she muttered lily gasped as the map came alive though she d seen it being used she d never taken a glimpse of the map herself after the initial surprise she scoured the map for sirius black there he is lily whispered she placed the map back where she d found it lily was about to leave the room when she felt a hand grab her wrist as it went for the door handle not so fast shit lily turned around to find james staring back at her she smiled sheepishly uh hi james she laughed nervously james continued to look at her indifferently lily looked around and added um nice room by the way nothing you haventseen before james replied coolly he still hadntlet go of her wrist there was something about his mood which seemed strangely attractive to lily lily what were you doing oh you know nothing james threw a glance to his table and added you forgot to close the map he said calmly lily was really cornered now i should just tell him james will understand i was looking for sirius lily mumbled james face fell sirius he repeated lily nodded it just i was thinking about my sister and you said i should talk to sirius so she finished james was not nearly as hurt oh he said and let go of her wrist as soon as his hand released her she reached out and took it in hers james stared and lily gasped let go let go of his hand idiot girl it was as if her hand had a mind of it own it just didntwant to let go james stared at her for a moment lily i think you re going to have to go on your own so i going to need my hand back james said his voice seemed to be the key she let go and immediately thought of an excuse s sorry about that it just my hand was um cold and yours was well warm so i just thought that yeah lily finished lamely he nodded but was still unconvinced lily was blushing profusely she looked longingly at the door i just wish i could get to that door and run away from all of this i i better uh get going yeah i should do that lily fumbled before scurrying out the door sirius was doing laps on his broom at the quidditch pitch he felt he should get out and be at least a little active their game against ravenclaw was in a few weeks so taking a few laps wouldntkill him he d been flying around for ten minutes when he spotted someone in the gryffindor stands a redhead was sitting in the stands shivering slightly by the looks of it sirius slowed down and made his way to her lily sirius asked lily smiled hey sirius she replied brightly sirius was puzzled what are you doing here jane in her dormitory you know lily shook her head that nice no actually i wanted to talk to you sirius raised his eyebrows he flew a little closer jumped off his broom and took a seat next to her so what new he asked hang on a minute sirius she said lily took out her wand and a jar incendio she whispered and a small fire resided itself in the jar both she and sirius hovered their hands over it for warmth so now what new sirius asked again lily thought for a minute she really hadntplanned how she was going to start well you see it like this i have this sister right sirius nodded and lily continued well we donttalk haventsaid a word to each other since the day i got my hogwarts letter i didntknow whether she really liked me or not i thought she just took a long time adjusting at christmas i got this letter from her saying that she didntwant me to come home for christmas because she was introducing her fianc to mum and dad and well i was a little upset but i wasntwrong was i she asked looking at him sirius sympathetically shook his head and beckoned for her to continue well you know i didntgo anyway i just got another letter from my parents they said pet wants me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding bullshit i just dontget it i mean all sisters fight mine doesnteven want to know me let alone be related sisters usually tell each other when they have fianc s why canti have one of those sisters i love her like i should why cantshe accept me lily eyes began to well up she looked at sirius expectantly lily i sorry she the sister you got but you have to push her aside and look to other things you heard of regulus black fourth year lily nodded he my brother lily gasped but he such a a slytherin lily blurted and then looked ashamed oh i sorry i probably donteven know him that was out of order sirius shook his head no you re right actually you were being rather kind i ve heard the bastard given you quite a bit of trouble in the past sirius said offhandedly lily shrugged well my parents are obsessed with pure blood i hate them i hate them all my cousins my aunts and uncles lily looked at him sympathetically sirius shook his head disgustedly and added i ran away last year went to james house see that my family the potters mrs potter even lets me call her mum i d change my name if keeping it didntwind my mum up so much lily didntsay anything she didntknow whether to smile or not sirius looked back at her see i had james remus and peter and i ve come to realise that i dontneed anyone else lils now your sister i hate to say it but she ll never come round she ll never open her eyes and see you for the wonderful person you are and that not a bad thing because people like her lily you dontneed them you have two great friends they d do anything for you you still have your parents you re lucky forget your sister there no need getting upset over her sirius finished lily looked around for a while before confidently nodding and getting up you re absolutely right sirius i dontneed her thanks lily said she smiled and hugged sirius sirius put his arm around her and said come on time to be getting in valentine day had finally arrived and so had the hogsmeade trip to go with it jane and sirius were obviously spending the day together as were adea and waqar remus had decided to take a walk around the village and lily and kayla were using the trip to shop hey kay so what do you need to get i presume we re going to gladrags lily asked look at all these disgusting public displays of fucking affection kayla said disgustedly as she looked around at her fellow students lily laughed now there no point in being bitter you ve had plenty of chances to be where they are kayla mimicked her lily rolled her eyes oh that mature simmons come on gladrags it is 3 sickles please here you go ma am have a good day duck thank you here you are sirius jane said brightly as she handed him a rose sirius took it raised his eyebrows now what am i going to do with a rose sirius asked jane shrugged fine give it to me sirius shook his head cantget it back now he stuck out his tongue jane folded her arms would you make up your mind she shook her head and muttered honestly sirius fellow teammate eric bell walked past and shouted to sirius hey black what with the rose like smelling pretty things do you sirius scowled and replied my girl got it for me dontsuppose yours got you anything bell the other boy immediately stopped laughing and hurried away see you like it now jane said with a smirk sirius turned around and said you and you re uniqueness your corrupting me jane looked thoughtful before saying i wouldntsay corrupting saving would be the word sirius laughed before saying i love you and gave her a lingering kiss jane pinched his cheek arentyou sweet she giggled and ran away sirius looked highly affronted well arentyou going to say it back she shook her head from a few feet away i ll make you say it then i know you love me and he went chasing after her i feel like buying shoes lily said kayla nodded absentmindedly that nice lils lily turned around to see her friend looking bored am i speaking to the same kayla simmons who was customer of the month nine times last year kayla nodded lily directed kayla towards the dress robes if anything you re at least leaving with dress robes i dont do window shopping i do actual shopping lily said airily kayla gave her a small push oi that my thing well you werentsaying it so i had to uphold the tradition lily said matter of factly kayla looked at the clothes inn front of her you know what you re right that just what i need what you muggles call retail perathy the term is retail therapy and i a witch thank you very much whatever you say sweetheart both girls laughed it was a long running private joke the two had had it had started in first year when kayla called muggles odd and lily had taken it the wrong way and became very defensive by the end of the their expedition each had decided to buy some robes a bag a pair of shoes and jewellery what should we do now kayla asked as they came out onto the street wit their bags lily looked around and felt her throat dry could do with a butterbeer what d you reckon kay lily asked i reckon you re right come on kayla said before they both set off for the three broomsticks on entering the pub the girls found that it wasntas congested as usual they found a table before madam rosmerta came over to them her heels clacking away hello madam rosmerta lily said cheerily the barmaid smiled at her well i glad someone happy to see me yeah what happened where is everyone kayla said throwing a glance around the pub madam rosmerta shook her head oh it that new caf that opened up madame puddifoot they call it they re having their grand opening and so most of your lot have rushed over there dontthink i ve ever had a drier hogwarts trip than this lily looked sympathetic so what ll you have madam rosmerta asked oh just get us two butterbeers please said kayla a few minutes later madam rosmerta returned with two foaming tanks of hot butterbeer thank you they chorused before taking a sip poor madam rosmerta said lily oh dontworry they ll come back and look there are a few loyal people in here said kayla lily looked around i suppose she said hey is that it is look kayla whispered and pointed to a corner what is it dontpoint kayla said lily before turning in her seat to see what her friend had been pointing at lily froze her heart started pounding her mouth dried up she couldntblink or look away she couldntspeak and if her heart beat any louder the prisoners of azkaban would ve heard it her stomach churned and her lungs constricted she couldnttear her eyes away from it and there was a distinct roaring in her ears there in the far corner of the pub sat james potter kissing dulcie fairbairn dulcie was a hufflepuff seventh year she had curly blonde hair and piercing blue eyes kayla didntnotice her friend shocked state before she shouted hey james james and dulcie broke away james waved back while dulcie smiled he looked towards lily who was staring at him in disbelief their eyes met and lily tried to manage a weak smile listen kay i heading back up i dontfeel like staying you stay ok said lily hurriedly sure lils what the matter are you ok asked kayla and lily nodded she then grabbed her bag and ran out of the door james had witnessed this and so had his date he tried to look back and concentrate on the girl with him but found he couldn t luckily dulcie had noticed as well go on james run after her said dulcie kindly after who evans nah i ll stay here thanks said james in what he thought was an offhand voice lily james her name is lily and you do want to go after her said dulcie are you sure he asked do you honestly think i came here thinking you liked me more than you did her she finished james looked relieved he gave dulcie a kiss on the cheek and left remus had walked in as soon as james had left and taken a table kayla heart skipped a beat and she debated going over to him it been over a month it getting pathetic now go and talk to him do you want things to remain awkward between you for the rest of your days kayla took a deep breath and strode over to his table hey said kayla quietly remus looked up and stared at her in disbelief but didntsay anything kayla pointed to the seat in front of him can i sit here she asked he nodded so anything the matter said remus finally kayla searched for her next words i ve just i i ve just missed you i guess kayla whispered remus looked downwards and said i ve missed you too kayla winced at his pained tone and continued and i uh i wanted to apologise i sorry for for you know he nodded again remus i need to tell you something said kayla hurriedly what is it asked remus no not here there wontbe many people at the shrieking shack lets go there they paid and left for the shrieking shack lily sat in her bedroom assessing what just happened why do i care about who he dates all of a sudden i ve seen him with a hundred girls no more than a hundred and it never concerned me it just it was different today maybe you re falling for him how many times have we been over this i am not falling for james who said anything about james what oh that was cheap no i think you just outsmarted yourself am i falling for james i dontknow you tell me i cantbe right yeah i mean he has nothing going for him yeah exactly nothing well maybe those hazel eyes yeah that light up when he laughs the beautiful green tinged with dark brown their his weak point you can know exactly what he thinking just by looking into them yeah what about his hair oh that hair it so stubborn and so cute the way it sticks up everywhere and sill looks amazing would you listen to yourself why oh my god what am i doing i dontknow you tell me it happened hasntit what it has i am falling for him i cantbe no just let me talk to myself for a bit no no i refuse to believe it it not like i melt when he smiles at me and it not like my heart wrenches when he upset my stomach doesntdo flip flops when he in the room and i didntexactly bawl my eyes out when i saw him maybe i just concerned for him i mean he a friend now and i dontwant him hurt by anyone of course i don t lily lily can you open this door for me james yelled lily shook her head sorry james i was just uh preoccupied lily called back ok do you mind opening up now it kinda weird talking to a door said james lily went to the door and opened it up sorry lily said sheepishly james waved it away oh forget it he said are you okay said james after taking a seat on lily bed you ran pretty fast out of there lily glanced at her clock and tutted oh donttell me you left your date to run after me she said james shrugged oh james that poor girl lily cried james rolled his eyes calm down would you she told me to come after you i wanted to stay james said lily made a sound of mock indignation you mean you wouldnthave checked on me if she hadnttold you to she asked james shook his head lily shoved him playfully oh you know i would lils said james lily nodded before heading into the lounge and taking out the hogmeade plan james had followed her so when do you think the next trip should be lily asked james raised his eyebrows are you sure you re ok you re awfully unpredictable today lily started writing something down and said ah well you know it all part of the enigma that is me lily laughed quietly without looking up james watched her before muttering it certainly is kayla and remus stood awkwardly in front of the shrieking shack kayla paced around nervously while remus leant on the rickety fence ok so i need to tell you something that i may have failed to mention while we went out and that you probably really need to know kayla said fearfully remus nodded me too i should probably go first he said resignedly kayla nodded now dontfreak out or anything promise kayla looked away remus took that as a yes ok so i when i was little i mean like you know five maybe six we my parents and i visited my aunt in the countryside well behind her house here were some large woods my aunt and uncle and my mum and dad had strictly forbidden my cousin and i to go in there we werentto set a foot inside well obviously that lighted a curiosity in us so naturally we just had to take a look i wish now and have done ever since that we hadn t we were just getting into the heart of the woods when a wolf attacked us i was too young at the time to realise it was a werewolf but anyway my cousin thank god managed to get out i wasntso lucky i got bitten so every month i come come here actually in there he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder towards the shack this last piece of information was new to kayla but she didntsay anything she still didntlook at him remus observed her you arentreacting you arentscreaming or yelling or crying why kayla turned around her eyes were sapphire eyes tarnished with fear yet a faint glimmer of hope could be caught as well remus looked even more upset oh god kay you re not scared of me oh god that the worst thing that could ve happened remus said kayla shook her head no well yes but not in the way you think i am i just scared of your reaction to what i wanted to say kayla said so fast that it was almost incoherent remus was thoroughly confused now well what is it he asked now remus don t dontget angry or anything will you remus narrowed his eyes in suspicion while kayla continued well see i i knew that you were a werewolf i have done since fifth year she said again very fast remus looked dumbstruck h how he stuttered kayla bit her lip i just found out by by chance she whispered w why didntyou tell me remus asked i wanted you to be able to tell me yourself she said sheepishly remus stood rooted to the spot taking a minute to digest the information that had just been thrown in his face slowly he began to laugh not his usual laugh which made kayla smile on the contrary this laugh made her even more nervous than she already was why are you laughing kayla asked remus laughed even more this this is funny he said w why think it about it for a second would you you ve just put us both through hell for the past two months for the fun of it he said kayla understood now now remus please please dontbe angry i didntmean to hurt you i just needed to know if you could trust me i didntwant to know from anyone else i wanted to hear it from you she pleaded at her tone remus stopped laughing and the anger that had been steadily surfacing was buried again well i guess it is fair remus pointed out more to himself than anyone else he looked back at kayla one question why why did you still go out with me if you knew why remus asked knowing that you were a werewolf didntchange you in my eyes kayla said as she gently fingered his hair remus eyes widened with incredulity it didn t he asked hopefully kayla shook her head and gave a sly smile nope if anything it made you sexier sexier remus repeated sceptically kayla nodded well oddly enough to a girl like me knowing that there a wolf buried inside your guy somewhere is kind of sexy i still your guy no but you used to be well i d better leave all i wanted was to straighten things out between us she grinned and turned to leave but felt a hand on her elbow remus spun her around and pulled her close maybe that all you wanted to do but me i want something else he whispered before drawing her into a passionate kiss they put everything into this one kiss all the pent up anger the emotions they d felt the happiness at having each other again and a bit of what they d had before that had never really left and now that bit wasntgoing anywhere it had been a hectic day to say the least in a nutshell this valentine day had been entirely different from any other valentine day that the marauders had ever experienced sirius had obviously had a fantastic day and unlike others it hadntbeen too expensive either you see you could refer to jane as high maintenance but only as far as understanding her went when it came to material things she was brilliant she always bought her own drink she didntexpect presents all the time she paid for her own half of dinners they had together perfect for sirius but we ve already established that james day hadntbeen as great as sirius but it had been okay though she wouldntadmit it james knew that lily was finally starting to come round and hey after seven years of chasing the same girl you can probably see why he was quite content remus according to his own opinion had had a better day than everyone in the entire school put together he had kayla back and she didnthate him in fact she d known all along and still gone out with him he was to put it frankly over the moon peter had also had a good day he spent an entire day down in the kitchens tasting food for the elves food yes that was peter valentine and it always would be james lay asleep in his room sirius and peter were in the same state only in their dormitory remus however was completely conscious as he lay awake thinking about what else kayla after a while he heard something a distant voice coming from behind the door probably from the common room what idiot is singing at this time of the night remus thought angrily yet he listened again at least they can sing well i a prefect i can stop them they ll wake the tower he left his bed exited the steps and crept quietly down the stairs the person sat facing the fire so they couldntsee him just as he was about to open his mouth something stopped him it was as if this person wanted him to listen to really listen to what they were singing she continued singing a mournful song about delicacy they sang beautifully and by the sounds of it they had no idea but who was this person you have the voice of an angel do you know that remus said softly the person gasped and turned around a n i hope you enjoyed it now for an explanation in her flashback adea calls waqar parents shahira aunty and feroz uncle adea and waqar are not related adea is south east asian and in that culture your parents friends are referred to as aunty and uncle but your parents siblings have specific names so for instance your mother sister is called a khala you get it right originally at the end the personwas singing i bruise easily by natasha bedingfield and the lyrics were very fitting but of course this sitedoesntlike lyrics so they had to come out oh and when kayla was thinking i had originally inserted kat poem in 10 things i hate about you but that had to come out as well leave me a review because unfortunately i cantread your minds review responses anna thank you so much

of a wall her skin is the paint and her clothes are the pattern they dontsee her but she sees them what are they thinking do they know i here i have no voice at least not one that can be heard because they re part of a world where i dontexist they laugh and they smile how does that feel i ve tried it before but happiness rejects me they re part of a world where good emotions exist i part of a world where where good emotions dont the person gasped and turned around it was a girl a beautiful one at that the fire illuminated her face she had straight hair it was sleek and jet black her eyes were so brown they were almost black and speckled with forest green they were emblazoned with fear and seemed eerily dull with pain her skin was a soft olive tone and utterly flawless who are you remus asked intrigued i m i no one in fact i not even here the girl replied yes you are i can see you you re sitting right there remus said no no i not she said and leapt up and made a dash for her dormitory i will find you remus yelled up the staircase who was that i ve never seen her around before she must be a gryffindor otherwise she wouldntbe in here remus walked over to the coffee table and examined the books and their titles the standard book of spells grade 7 a further insight into the past newt potion theory advanced arithmancy advanced charms when you re already an expert remus was really confused now these were newt books designed for seventh years and the last one was for someone like lily whose skills surpassed the spells taught in the curriculum yet these couldntpossibly be lily books he knew for a fact that lily didnttake arithmancy whose could they be i mean i know all the seventh years no wait no i don t there is one adea qureshi but she isntin gryffindor remus opened the cover of advanced charms when you re already an expert to see if there was a name inside there was a name well remus thought it was a name it was still useless it seemed to be written in a different language a language entirely unknown to remus whoever this person was obviously intent on hiding and seemed to be good at it the book was labelled so that even those logical enough to check for a name still wouldntbe able to find an answer it could only be identified by the owner and the few people in the castle who could read the writing as well i ll ask someone in the morning right now bed and with that remus left the mystery for the night and resigned to his dormitory adea bolted upstairs and threw the door open she dived onto her bed but rolled right off and landed with a thud onto the cold stone floor ow ow ow ow she moaned clutching her back well that hurt remind me to never dive onto the bed again dee is that you kayla mumbled amidst the darkness adea sighed great sorry kay i d forgotten you were such a light sleeper it alright what happened fell off my bed adea said ouch are you okay kayla asked fine do me a favour will you sure what is it distract remus for the next couple of weeks or so adea said offhandedly uh why kayla asked suspiciously adea fidgeted a bit well i was downstairs i was i was well singing and remus saw me what kayla cried but her concern was interrupted by a loud snore coming from jane area of the room kayla shook her head and calmed down what happened adea she asked well i told you i was singing and as soon as i finished i heard him say i was good and i realised that he must ve been listening and then i turned around and he started asking me who i was i ran up here and he shouted i will find you so i just need you to keep an eye on him and keep him distracted ok adea recalled her friend consented with a nod of the head are you okay kayla whispered after a while adea nodded yeah fine dontworry about it we should be getting to bed both girls returned to their respective beds and fell asleep after a few minutes remus got up early the next day to wait for kayla and all of her friends he knew lily always came to the common room in the mornings to walk down to breakfast with her friends after waiting for about fifteen minutes a cheery redhead walked into the room whistling happily she seemed to ignore remus as she walked to the girl staircase kayla jane dee she yelled dee who dee came a voice from behind her shit remus what are you doing here lily cried remus persisted who dee he asked again lily sought an excuse and tried the first thing that came to her head dee did i say dee i mean t to say the she said and then realised how lame it sounded remus raised his eyebrows and why would you say the remus asked well you see i was going to say the great hall is waiting but then jane and kayla would just shout at me for being too perky and i decided against it lily finished remus nodded and left it at that lily was a little surprised at remus perceptiveness and realised that something must be up so she decided to yell kayla a warning kay remus is waiting for you kayla and jane rushed downstairs but no adea kayla immediately engaged remus in a passionate kiss giving jane just enough time to tell lily what was going on remus found out about adea so she ll have to hang around upstairs for a bit dontsay anything no glances to her direction no holding back to walk with her no nothing jane whispered hurriedly lily was shocked though some things made sense now no wonder lily muttered jane looked at her quizzically this morning when i called you down i called dee as well remus was sitting here and started asking all sorts of question about why i said dee as well lily explained jane raised her eyebrows i didntactually expect him to continue with his curiosity she said lily shrugged and then smiled looks like kayla doing a good job of making him forget though lily commented she and jane looked to the sofa where two teenagers were currently very absorbed with each other jane cleared her throat loudly as two second years stood watching kayla and remus in shock kayla remus please honestly not in front of the children lily mock scolded the two sprang apart remus blushed but kayla straightened her blouse entirely unperturbed she then turned to glare at the two second years who immediately broke into a run and exited the common room lily tutted five points from gryffindor the head girl muttered lazily kayla made a noise like an angry cat what why kayla cried outraged lily gave her a stern look you continue to be unkind to the younger pupils and for that i will have to take points lily said airily i nice to gabby kayla reasoned lily sighed being nice to one out of a possible thirty pupils doesnthelp your case kayla especially if that one pupil happens to be your sister lily said the other girl rolled her eyes fine whatever i ll just talk to james about it kayla said haughtily as she folded her arms now lily rolled her eyes good morning the first year in question said brightly kayla looked at lily and then ran forward to hug her little sister gabby was definitely surprised though her sister was brilliant she never gave random hugs what kayla did next surprised her even more kayla turned and smiled at her sister friends who froze with shock at this act of kindness coming from kayla simmons hey i dontthink i ve talked to you very much you re jaylin right the girl jaylin nodded kayla smiled again and continued i love your earrings she then turned to the girl on the other side of gabrielle this girl was particularly innocent looking and had pretty features and you must be nerissa right the girl nodded fearfully well you are going to be a stunner someday arentyou kayla praised nerissa blushed and stammered a small thanks hey gabby could you guys go upstairs and grab my compact for me i need to talk to lily kayla said sweetly gabrielle looked at kayla with suspicion before climbing back up the staircase with her friends well kayla asked looking round at lily expectantly lily rolled her eyes before saying five points to gryffindor kayla cheered but lily cut her off but you have to keep being nice to them lily challenged kayla smile faltered a little keep being nice she asked the redhead nodded smugly kayla looked as if she had an extremely unpleasant taste in her mouth she sighed fine but only for a month kayla and lily shook on it and lily added who knows you might even end up liking them gabrielle nerissa and jaylin came bounding down the staircase gabrielle chucked the compact to kayla who checked herself once over before storing it in her bag remus smiled hey gabrielle why dontyou and your friends join us for breakfast i owe you one anyway gabby anyway gabrielle shrugged sure why not come on remus smiled again and said just go on for a sec i need to talk to these three about something gabrielle shrugged again and led her friends out of the portrait hole remus faced the three seventh year girls all of who now wore anxious looks on their faces guys i just wanted to ask you about these books remus said as he pulled out the five books he d found in the common room the night before now these are seventh year books and they re not yours he pointed out jane kayla and lily exchanged glances yes they are lily said grade 7 and arithmancy are mine potions and charms are mine history of magic mine remus raised his eyebrow and opened the cover of a further insight into the past and pointed at the writing inside see this he jabbed a finger at the writing this is a name i cantread it but i know it a name now it written on each of the books they re not yours but do you know who they belong to he said sternly the girls exchanged glances and decided it would be best to say no they shook their heads remus looked thoughtful i think i know someone who could read this and remus took off who are you going to lily shouted mohsin he shouted back lily sighed in relief kayla and jane went to join james sirius peter gabrielle and her friends at breakfast while lily waited for adea to come down adea thundered down the stairs in a mad rush oh finally he gone she exclaimed lily didntreply she merely said follow him down and get your books adea nodded and walked out of the portrait hole as well while lily made her way down to breakfast hey waqar slow down remus called through the corridor waqar stopped and turned around as remus caught up brandishing the books in the ravenclaw face can you read this for me remus pointed at the writing and tell me whose books these are waqar scanned the name these are adea no problem remus it easy they re mine waqar said calmly remus raised his eyebrows and why were your books in the gryffindor common room i was tutoring someone tutoring who were you tutoring felicity williams waqar replied without thought she a sixth year these are seventh year books remus said cantblame a kid for wanting to be ahead can you remus shook his head and handed the books over to his fellow prefect here you go sorry about not believing you and everything see you later remus said ever since halloween when waqar had been spending more time with the marauders and the girls remus and waqar had become good friends they had a lot in common they both liked to read and were popular they were soft spoken and didntlike to cause too much trouble but in remus case it was slightly harder sure dontworry about it you re the prefect it your job isntit see you later waqar said glancing at a shadow in the distance remus nodded and walked onwards to breakfast waqar stood tapping his foot lightly and smiling slightly adea ran to him with a relieved look on his face do you know this is like the time i took the blame for when you nicked those sugar quills from your cousin he said adea smiled at him sheepishly sorry but thanks for getting my books for me she said oh it fine something tells me i ll be taking blame for even more in the future waqar said that right you have the rest of your life to spend with me yet adea joked oh god i know how am i ever gonna survive waqar sighed oh you know you love me really adea said waqar rolled his eyes and looked at her his breath got caught as he gazed into her eyes the way they were still glassy from waking up and how they glowed as she smiled how even when she smiled he could detect the pain she felt from her burden and most of all he noticed how they still didntcontain love when she looked at him yeah i suppose so he muttered adea laughed waqar slung his arm round her shoulder and led her into the great hall for breakfast james and lily were having an emergency head meeting something about james having an on the spot supposedly genius idea lily rolled her eyes when peter had given her the message but decided to meet him anyway besides it got her out of potions head meetings always did when she went to see jabin about it at the beginning of the lesson she noticed that james hadnteven bothered to excuse himself typical james professor ah miss evans what a pleasure i sure jabin sneered lily took a deep breath and let it go sir oh sorry i mean miss here lily gave jabin a fake sweet smile i have a head meeting to attend right about now so i wontbe in this lesson lily excused the other woman sniffed oh what a shame without another word lily turned and left the dungeon she walked into the head lounge to find james reading pride and prejudice a muggle book by jane austen that lily absolutely adored she had left it on the table the night before and forgot to put it back in her room james didntknow you liked muggle books or any books for that matter lily joked just wanted to see what they were like lily looked at the page he was holding and raised her eyebrows you ve gotten quiet far james shrugged as he carefully placed the book back on the table so genius idea hm oh that yeah i donthave one so why am i missing potions i thought it d be nice you know just you and me james and lily quality time james it february oh no not february say it aintso lily say it aintso james replied hysterically lily kicked him hard causing james to howl in pain do you know we re kind of like darcy and elizabeth in a way james commented after the pain had subsided lily mulled it over and said except that darcy and elizabeth never exactly become friends and she falls in love with him james sighed yes but you could fall in love with me if you didnthave that whole mental block against james potter thing going what are you talking about i have no mental block against you oh really fine describe your perfect guy lily gave him a weird look do you know scary it is that you re asking me that lily said james rolled his eyes there is a point to this just do it would you evans he commanded fine the perfect guy would have to definitely be taller than me have to have a good physique not too muscular but not scrawny either he doesnthave to have any particular facial features just as long as i found him attractive he d have to be confident but not arrogant he d have to be intelligent and be able to hold stimulating conversation a good sense of humour he d need to have some sort of fault i find faultless people amazingly annoying he would have to be sensitive honest loyal and and he d have to have an air of mystery about him as well lily finished ok ok now which of those do i have james asked crossing his arms smugly lily rolled her eyes i see where this is going can you say persistent yes i can dontyou be cute with me potter canthelp it evans lily rolled her eyes at the use of her last name and sighed in resignation fine you win she consented well you are taller than me and physique lily shrugged passively yet fighting tooth and nail to fight back the blush that was daring to creep across her cheeks at the memory of seeing james physique oh dontyou give me any of that i saw you staring at my physique that day i ll answer your questions for you i do a lot of jogging weight lifting press ups it not all quidditch although my brutal team practises help but to be honest with you it felt quite degrading to have you stare like that james said in the same tone lily had used with him for so many years well except that lily tone wasntfake you canttalk all you ve done for the past seven years is stare at my arse chest and in the summers my legs in fact you still do it lily cried james shrugged what can i say lily you re too damn gorgeous he said offhandedly as lily blushed prettily can we go back to me being your perfect guy james said you are not my perfect guy yeah yeah whatever you want to call it lily sighed and continued well you are attractive donttwist my words aha i ve got you now you james potter are arrogant how are you going to shoot that one down lily folded her arms and smiled triumphantly oh come on lily i haventbeen that arrogant at least not this year james whined lily thought about and grudgingly agreed ok fine you are intelligent and you have a good sense of humour no doubt fault evans i wear glasses good point that ll do well you are sensitive or at least you were at christmas honest well i suppose you are honest you ve never really cheated on any of your girlfriends have you god knows you re loyal so all that left is mystery you re not mysterious lily finished matter of factly james thought hard wait here he went into his bedroom and fished out a wad of parchment he went back into the lounge and thrust them into lily arms lily shot him a curious look but james kept his gaze firmly focused on the ground she leafed through them and gasped they were the parchments he doodled on in classes a lot of them were her initials beautifully engraved into the parchment more than just doodles there were lots of pictures of a broomstick with a lily entwined around it there were several poems and songs obviously dedicated to her and lily noticed with a smile lots of potters there were pictures of lilies blooming there was a sketch of an emerald with a pair of snitch wings fluttering around the page parchment upon parchment of his artwork all dedicated centred and focused on her lily was shocked but she didntstart feeling tears until she saw the parchment right at the bottom it had a date and title it was meant for a history of magic lesson in their first year but james must ve gotten bored because instead there being notes on binns lectures there was a heart with her and james initials on them with an arrow going through obviously the work of an eleven year old there were so many emotional and beautiful things in the pile she was holding but of all the things this little love heart meant most to her it showed her that never not once in seven years had james stopped caring about her it showed her that no matter how many teenage insecurities she went through on different days it never mattered to james and it proved wrong the very theory she had believed to be true from day one he didntjust like her for the chase or because he was attracted to her body james liked her for her nothing else lily gazed up at him with tear stained cheeks is this what you do when you re bored in lessons james met her gaze lily couldntdeny it any longer she knew it she was falling for james falling fast do you mind if i keep these lily whispered softly james shook his head she slowly got up and went to her bedroom once she got inside she collapsed onto the floor leaning on the back of her door breathing heavily what happening this isntsupposed to happen this was never supposed to happen when did he become so perfect why does he like me i not special enough for him who is he he like a whole new person now no he always been the same person you ve just never realised it the tears were now rolling freely down her cheeks why she didntknow maybe it was confusion shock joy maybe even remorse she didntknow but in the back of her head underneath the haze of confusion her mind knew this was the best most indescribable emotion ever shakily she retrieved her special box she fingered the mint green raw silk after placing the parchments inside it seriously kayla you should ve heard her her voice it was just so so i dontknow remus sighed at lunch the following day he went back to sipping his pumpkin juice kayla smiled nervously as her and gabrielle exchanged glances you know if i was the jealous type i might be worried kayla said what do you mean remus asked the way you go on about this girl one might think remus smiled at his girlfriend comment this girl could sing as well as she wants and have the nicest features but she ll never be as gorgeous as you remus said kayla smiled and gave him a kiss ugh came a voice the couple turned to look at gabby who sat with fork in mid air looking revolted god could you two be anymore disgusting honestly she shuddered as kayla and remus laughed the bell rang remus picked up his bag and slung it over his shoulder well i off to ancient runes you have muggle studies i ll walk you there come on he offered kayla got up and together they walked out of the great hall and onto their lessons oh wow am i glad we re back kayla noted any particular reason remus asked yeah i hated carrying my own books opening my own doors and pulling out my own chairs kayla listed well if that all you wanted me for remus said as he opened the door of her classroom for her and handed her books then i d best be off and he started to walk away hey what about my kiss kayla called still standing in the doorway remus walked on as if he hadntheard her kayla rolled her eyes and took a seat adea sat in ancient runes sitting beside waqar and thought back to her days before hogwarts flashback adea why are you so scrawny mandy says poking at me as if i was some sort of odd animal yeah and why do you always put your hand up in lessons claire says as she does what supposed to be impression of me in classes the other girls laugh why d you talk so quiet yeah and you talk posh as well and you always wear that stupid necklace it so ugly and weird stuff always happens when you re around and you have no friends hey comes a new voice waqar voice he pushing through the crowd of jeering girls all hovering over me are you ok he asking i nod the other girls start whispering that never good waqar fancies adea waqar fancies adea they sing i groan inwardly waqar looks furious waqar gonna give you all black eyes if you dontget out of adea face he shouts menacingly the girls look scared he looks at them again now he yells they scurry away in different directions end flashback wow it seems like another life i have female friends now by chance of course i know people will be nicer now but i couldntface anyone else too many memories too many hurtful memories and on top of the no just forget about it ok she caught waqar eye and offered him a weak smile which he returned before turning back to professor cummings and proceeding with the note taking half an hour later the bell rung and waqar and adea quietly slipped out of class remus stood standing beside lily desk waiting patiently like a good friend lily looked up at him in surprise oh remus you re here oh hey listen you go on you have a lesson to get to and anyway mcgonagall classroom isntthat far from here she said remus smiled and headed off to his next lesson lily head was buzzing with thoughts of the day before she liked james she knew it but her pride stopped her from doing anything on top of everything she didnthave anyone to talk to about it kayla and remus were back together and never went anywhere without each other unless they had to adea was spending an unusually large amount of time with waqar these days and jane well jane in all honesty lily felt that out of all of her friends she connected with jane the least as much as she loved her there was just something in the both of their personalities that made them very different from each other and hard to relate to jane was an only child yet the most motherly of them all oddly enough there was just something motherly about jane and lily knew that whenever she was upset jane would always be the one she d hold her arms out to like she would have done to her mother back home yet there was just something for some inexplicable reason jane suddenly seemed like the right person to talk to in this situation lily looked at her watch and broke off in a run she had one minute to get to her transfiguration lesson the lessons flew by but the end of the day couldnthave come sooner for lily all she wanted to do was talk to jane or anybody about her problems before she exploded fortunately lily managed to catch jane in the corridor after their last lessons hey jane lily called a black haired girl with bright purple streaks turned around and smiled at lily lily smiled back wow jane must really like that black she had it in since halloween jane walked over to her salutations jane said um hi lily replied awkwardly i was messing dontworry about it lily laughed at this jane looked at her redheaded friend questioningly how can i be of service to you oh right i um need to talk to you about something quite important lily said jane looked amazed you want to talk to me she asked and lily nodded jane shrugged ok where do you want to go my room or the room of requirement lily suggested and jane eyes slid out of focus while she smiled slightly hang on a minute lily lily looked puzzled as she waited while jane began to scan the heads in the corridor where is he he was just in class with me she suddenly spotted who she was looking for sirius jane called sirius looked up and grinned she ran to him put her hand to hand to the back of his neck and started kissing him impulsively sirius was shocked but slowly started to kiss back with the same energy the girls cooed over the sweetness of it all and the boys just stared at the two jane pulled away and walked back to lily without another glance at her boyfriend let go to your room lily was smiling sadly what was that about she asked jane shrugged as they started walking through the designated corridor making their way to mahogany door lily said do you know how many people would kill to have what you and sirius have yeah and i know how many people would kill to have i have with sirius lily laughed as she led the way through the lounge and into her spotless snow white room they sat down as lily procured some sugar quills and two cans of pepsi she handed one to jane so you and sirius are happy right i mean you guys are like perfect lily said i guess we are jane replied have you and sirius ever lily looked at jane meaningfully slept together no we ve only been together for like two months jane cried i know plenty of girls who d put out for sirius black in a week lily muttered jane rolled her eyes in agreement lily spoke again has sirius ever another meaningful look tried nope he knows that if he ever tries without consulting me first i d be up and out in a second jane said matter of factly lily grinned you ve got him whipped wow my friend the girl who tamed sirius black he wontadmit it though jane said as she sucked on her sugar quill so what did you want to talk about lils she asked lily sighed she d almost forgotten what do you do when something you swore would never happen actually happens jane looked thoughtful do you want to elaborate she asked lily nodded reluctantly i think i think i falling for james lily mumbled jane eyes widened with shock for james no no no no right she asked jane incredulously as is she expected lily to burst out and laughing and splutter as if but she didntget an answer you re serious oh my god i cantbelieve this i mean wow i i how jane asked lily thought back when did all of this start anyway last night just triggered it but when did it start not halloween maybe christmas it must ve been christmas because i started paying him odd attention after the holidays well he was really nice about that whole petunia thing but there something else what is it the kiss idiot kiss oh my god that stupid mistletoe kiss it wasntstupid you know it and she did just the thought of it made her run her finger over her lips as she remembered how she felt when their lips brushed she gasped as she found herself wishing that it had lasted longer lily looked back at jane with fearful eyes it been going on since christmas eve oh my god i didnteven know oh my wow lily whispered jane stared at her as lily continued ok i going to tell you something i haventtold anyone anyone not even dee jane nodded and signalled for her to continue lily took a long deep breath on on you know christmas eve sirius well sometime he must ve messed with the mistletoe or something because we were under it and we couldntmove we were completely glued to the spot so so we you know we kissed jane grinned and whistled so is that it just a kiss did you feel anything what come on tell me tell me tell me jane squealed lily laughed that so un janeish alright alright calm down would you yes i did feel something jane looked ready to explode as she started flapping her hands signalling for lily to go on it was it was like a huge electric shock a nice electric shock lily smiled in spite of herself so what do i do jane got a hold of herself as she took a deep breath well first of all you re going to have go down just like i did jane remarked smugly but lily was confused jane looked devious crush time she cried lily looked fearful and shook her head no jane come on now let be fair oh please lily pleaded but jane shook her head and lily knew her mind was not to be changed lily sighed resignedly then what do i do lily asked jane gave lily a significant look after you ve told your friends there only one thing you can do lils lily bit her lip and looked hesitant of the idea there no dodging it lily james doesnt really need to know does he lily argued weakly yeah i mean what does it matter that you might spend the rest of your life thinking what if lily laughed at dramatics of that comment it didntlast long though i mean seriously it not that big of a deal is it i d get over him eventually lily reasoned right of course i mean it not that big of a deal that james could be your soul mate jane said simply lily bit her lip again and asked d you think her friend shrugged couldnthurt to give it a go could it but what if he isntmy soul mate i d be upset lily said she was fishing for excuses now but jane shrugged again like you said lils and here jane got up and heaved lily up too you ll get over it eventually she gave lily another significant look and looked to the window you have an owl jane then hugged lily and left the room closing the door quietly behind her lily thought for a minute before attending to her owl hello artemis she untied the letter from artemis leg you know where the owlery is by now dontyou the owl hooted in response before hopping out of the window and soaring over the hogwarts grounds to the owlery the letter was addressed to her and obviously written by petunia again like petunia other letter it was short and harshly blunt lily marie be a bridesmaid at my wedding petunia lily screamed in frustration this was getting ridiculous she and her sister were finally having some sort of a sibling relationship only they were acting more like woman and mother in law and even those relationships probably had more words in their conversations she stormed into james room to find him working on some homework he looked up distractedly and upon seeing her he blushed and looked at his feet lily suddenly realising she was before james did the same do you have any floo powder she mumbled almost incoherently james nodded and reached into the drawer of his desk he pulled out a small pot which when uncovered contained sparkling green powder floo powder she took the pot into the lounge lily put her head near the fire took a pinch of floo powder and threw it into the fireplace 15 goddetia avenue lily roared and felt an odd sensation she felt her head spin and travel past all the fireplaces along the way to her own her head suddenly stopped and she felt extremely dizzy petunia petunia petunia where are you lily head called at the image of her living room it smiled slightly at the familiar sight her heart ached a little and she found herself feeling slightly homesick what on earth cried a confused voice and lily saw a flash of somewhat faded blonde hair and her smile grew wider rosalind evans appeared she had grey eyes was quite short and very slender with faded blonde hair that had been passed onto her eldest daughter mum lily cried lily yep it me oh lily darling you dontknow how much i ve wanted to see that head now where the rest of you oh mum i still in hogwarts my head can just see you at the same time lily explained patiently mrs evans looked pleasantly surprised and delighted at this new discovery so why do we bother with letters when i can talk and see you at the same time like this mum that is something you ll understand when you go through the experience that is floo transport lily said wisely and her mother smiled by the way can you eat through that thing because i just made some of my famous strawberry jam and i could do with an expert opinion her mother said excitedly and lily grinned go on then just put a bit on the spoon and quickly shove it into my mouth without getting burnt mrs evans approached lily head with a spoonful of jam which lily quickly swallowed mmmmmm one of your best not the best that was summer before last but definitely one of the best her mother nodded in a satisfied way and then looked confused lily what are you doing here rosalind asked lily rolled her eyes and wanted to smack her forehead but obviously couldn t i wanted to talk to petunia privately do you mind lily said meekly on the contrary her mother looked thrilled at the thought of her daughters talking things out oh of course sweetheart let me get her and the older woman disappeared up the staircase and in the distance lily could hear the faint cries of petunia petunia you ll never guess who downstairs for some odd reason petunia came charging down the stairs as if actually excited to see lily she straightened up as she got closer and concealed her excited smile but not quickly enough for lily to miss it lily you re in the fire petunia said in greeting i noticed lily replied coldly and felt a satisfaction at seeing her sister wince at her tone we need to talk lily said brusquely petunia nodded curtly the sisters then fell silent wow we haventdone this for a while petunia said lily head rolled it eyes okay let start from that thing you sent me at christmas lily said you mean the letter petunia said petunia that was hardly a letter petunia shrugged why couldnti see your fianc do you not like me are you ashamed of me lily prompted her sister looked uneasy not of you per se petunia said quietly as she twiddled her thumbs lily looked expectant well then you could ve at least told me you were seeing someone or that you were engaged there is a reason i promise go on then let hear it promise i wontget angry lily said petunia took a deep breath right okay i know we ve never really got along but you know we were normal i just ever since you got your letter i just dontunderstand you anymore i mean you re still my sister and i lo i just dontlike magic actually i hate magic i haventsaid anything but i hate talking to you like that in the fire and everything lily whose eyebrows had been raised ever since petunia couldntsay that she loved lily now realised something petunia was always one of those people who could never understand anything that was so completely different than things that were routine to her and if there was one thing petunia hated it was not being able to understand something petunia had always basked in the feeling of being able to relate to everything around her so when she couldn t she just blocked it out it made sense now magic just freaky i hate your nose biting teacups and your dumb frogspawn soap it is disgusting and i have a phobia of your stick thing petunia continued it a wand petunia lily said irritated as for not introducing you to vernon well vernon the thing i love most about him is that he loves everything orderly and neat and well you re magic and everything it just wasntgood for him to know i wanted us to seem perfect so i told him you attended a top of the line private boarding school lily felt disgusted at what her sister was spouting petunia didnteven seem to realise this might be hurting lily oh well arentyou ashamed of me being a bridesmaid at your wedding lily asked coldly i didntsay i was ashamed of you lily rolled her eyes as petunia ploughed on i mean there just wouldntbe enough time during the wedding for vernon to find out and you are my sister i did always want you to be my wedding i just dontlike who you are there she d said it and now there was no point in her sticking around lily blinked in understanding petunia understood that her younger sister was about to leave lils before you leave i i just want to tell you something like i said you are my sister and and i lo well i donthate you petunia said brightly as if proud of herself for being able to say it lily looked at the now unrecognisable girl in front of her and said you re my sister too and i do love you but i do hate you at the same time never thought i d be able to say that with a straight face but i guess now i can petunia was deeply affected by her words lily i sorry but lily laughed at that and replied of course you are a thought just occurred to petunia are you still going to be a bridesmaid she asked hopefully lily laughed again of course i am canthave something as small as me spoil your dream wedding can we and with those quiet words lily retracted her head from her parents fireplace and returned her whole self to hogwarts she sat by the flickering fire and watched as it licked the sides of it location her heart had completely shattered james walked out of his room to get something from the lounge he saw lily seated by the fire it flames illuminating her hair beautifully making it seem even more spectacular than usual he smiled until he noticed the look on her face a mournful brooding look lily he called out to her softly she slowly raised her head to look at him in that instance all of her problems with him vanished in that instant she wanted him to comfort her to be able to cry into his shoulder as he stroked her hair james made his way to her he took hold o her shoulders forcing her to face him what wrong lily but the redhead just shook her head and james understood that she d rather not talk about it he hugged her and lily broke down and she started sobbing uncontrollably james didntsay anything as he held her he knew lily didntexpect him to she just needed him to be there for her and he was more than happy to the next morning as lily heard the birds twitter and sing to indicate morning she felt infinitely better but considering yesterday events she didntreally know why suddenly she realised exactly where she d fallen asleep on the floor of the lounge by the comforting fumes of the fire which resided there no more as she tried to heave herself up she found herself unable to lily gasped as she looked at her stomach james arm was wrapped around her waist protectively as she turned her head she noticed that he had her pressed so tight against him there was less than an inch between them lily instinctively blushed as she inwardly admonished herself for be stupid enough to not realise this when she first woke up she d have had to be blind or senseless not to realise it she tried prising his arm off but to no avail he would not let go of his firm hold on her lily didntwant to wake him up or maybe she didntwant to move from this position either way as she relaxed herself back into the position she was in before waking up she felt herself melt james arms just felt so safe as if no wrong could happen as long as she stayed there all of her other worries disappeared lying there and thinking about they just werentimportant anymore just so long as she had james but you donthave james what is with you first you tell me off for not liking james now you re making me feel bad because i do like him i not trying to make you feel bad i just trying to make you do something about the fact that you donthave him yet but that could change you know i donthave to listen to you what will happen will happen so get lost lily cast her emerald glance on the clock and noticed that it was 8 40 am lessons started at nine she had to be at breakfast as well there was absolutely no way she could get ready n ten minutes with a reluctant sigh she tried to shake james awake james james wake up we ll be late come on at least let me out i ll make your excuses lily whispered hoarsely it had no effect whatsoever on james he didntmove he just made a small sound she heard him muttering and smiled aw he sleep talks listen to yourself would you lily leaned closer if it was possible to see if she could make anything out love you lils james muttered lily laughed softly as she took in his sleeping form properly james looked so utterly peaceful and so so angelic he looked cute to put it in a nutshell lily ran her fingers through his stubborn hair james groaned in protest mmmmmm who is that he reached out to grab the hand so that the key to waking james potter up huh lily teased as she removed her hand from his hair lily no dontstop it rather nice actually james said i dontthink so because of you i now have only 5 minutes to get ready and get to breakfast lily scolded softly james opened his eyes which had remained adamantly shut up until then he stared at his and lily close proximity oh my god did something happen he said nervously but lily cut him off no nothing happened in fact you were the perfect gentleman james sighed in relief and then looked at her properly and noticed his arm wrapped tightly around her waist lily noticed where his glance was headed yes i would ve been up much earlier if it hadntbeen for that lily laughed james blushed as he removed his arm and mumbled an apology at first lily was confused as to why he was blushing and then realised she had been blushing for the very same reason they were way too close too close for comfort yet oddly it felt comfortable lily blushed as well i ll just be getting up then since you now have three minutes to get ready james said as smoothly as was possible he got up and turned around very quickly as if not being able to look at lily hey james lily called at his retreating figure james stopped indicating that he d heard but didntturn around thank you for staying with me last night i really needed it james nodded and hurried off to his room lily ran to hr room as well to get changed in record time james shut the door and leaned on the back of it oh god i need a cold shower now and he grabbed his things and ran into his bathroom being that close to lily in a state of consciousness ha a i thinking oddly enough lily hadntnoticed james ah uncomfortable situation because she was too wrapped up in the feeling of warmth she d felt when she d been in his arms without his arm around her waist now lily felt lonely oh god it more serious than i thought within the next two minutes the two of them were dressed and out of there rushed but the job was done lily noticed james that avoided her gaze as he spoke what day is it james asked oh uh wednesday lily replied as she flicked her hair and exited the chamber with james shit come on we have to move james said frantically grabbing lily elbow and dragging her in the direction of the great hall why what is it james let go lily said james let go immediately as he replied you ll see and he ushered her into the great hall so fast that they reached it with one minute to spare as they took their seats all four of the girls noticed that the marauders looked particularly devious today as they ate their breakfast and were slightly worried as lily poured milk into her cereal bowl whispers erupted followed by giggling which became steadily louder with each nanosecond when she looked up she was met with the most bizarre sight she d ever seen professor jabin had just walked into the great hall she obviously hadntlooked in the mirror jabin was wearing a hot pink bathrobe that stopped horrifically at the knees baring her mannish and disgustingly hairy legs a bright orange towel was wrapped around her head her face was covered in a thick pasty layer of mud mask through which her incredibly bushy eyebrows though as far as lily could remember they werentnormally like that could be seen they protruded like odd little tufts not only were her eyebrows visible but her newfound moustache was as well the funny thing was that jabin thought she looked perfectly normal and obviously she was deaf as well because the students sans the slytherins were now howling with laughter as she strolled onwards towards her seat at the head table people caught a glimpse of her back on the back of the hot pink bathrobe in large thick white letters read the words i upset lily evans and this is my punishment she then sat down took some toast produced an issue of the daily prophet and continued with her everyday breakfast routine the marauders cast a glance at dumbledore whose blue eyes sparkled with pleasant amusement they then directed their eyes towards professor mcgonagall professor mcgonagall looked like she was trying her absolute best not to laugh but couldntrefrain from smirking it was a common known fact that mcgonagall and jabin had been at hogwarts together and had been rivals ever since none of the teachers the students noticed bothered to tell the potions mistress of her current state all too soon professor mcgonagall came to her senses she rose out of her seat still smirking and looked directly at where the marauders were sitting at the gryffindor table potter black lupin pettigrew and miss evans report to my office immediately james looked uneasy and lily jaw dropped as her name was bellowed by the transfiguration teacher slowly but surely lily rose from her own seat along with the marauders and followed her head of house to her office sit professor mcgonagall snapped when they reached her office all five of them sat down professor mcgonagall though not smirking still was still smiling i think we ll start with miss evans i am very disappointed in you you are the head girl the older woman reminded making lily feel extremely guilty for no reason i know professor i sorry i ow james had just stepped on lily foot as she was apologising she gave him a look that plainly said what the hell was that for to which james replied with a look that said what the hell are you doing at that lily came to her senses no wait a second professor i had nothing to do with this lily said professor mcgonagall raised her eyebrows you had nothing to do with this she asked sceptically to which lily adamantly shook her head so why was your name written on the back of that bathrobe she asked again but this time lily looked to james that was my doing professor james admitted mcgonagall turned her head towards him your doing and why would you write i upset lily evans so this is my punishment on back of that bathrobe james had more trouble explaining this one because the truth sounded stupid well you see we had this lesson and uh professor jabin was bullying lily james started slightly exaggerating the roll of events and lily was very upset at the end so i thought it only fair that professor jabin get punishment for singling out and bullying individual students for no reason james finished as eloquently as possible professor mcgonagall sighed and turned to the remaining three and i guessing you hoodlums just needed a reason to prank someone peter looked terrified remus stared up at the ceiling and sirius grinned at her well with the exception of miss evans i have to tell you that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated pranking students is one thing but to completely defy the rules and prank teachers well especially you mr potter how many times must i remind you you are head boy we are now in february and you still haventmanaged to grasp the concept professor mcgonagall scolded though her anger did not seem entirely genuine james had now taken to staring at the ceiling as well for this act of disobedience and outright disrespect i shall give you all one detention each and take away five points from gryffindor each professor mcgonagall said the marauders grinned at their head intended feeble punishment sirius flashed professor mcgonagall his winning smile even though he knew it had no effect on her see minnie no one can resist a good old fashioned prank on professor jabin mcgonagall mouth reduced to a thinner line at sirius remark black dontpush it she then pointed to the door and all five of them left four of them wearing broad smiles that saturday the girls gathered in the seventh year girls dormitory for their sleepover jane had promised that something big would be revealed once the sleeping bags had been arranged and the food had been summoned the girls sat down someone change my hair jane whined lily smiled she had felt a lot closer to jane after they d talked and she and jane had spent a lot of time together in the week since adea and kayla had been off in their own little worlds and so they had nothing better to do i ll do it i haventdone it in ages lily volunteered she went to the vanity table to stand behind jane keep the purple streaks i like those jane ordered lily nodded as she tilted her head from one side to the other trying to envisage a colour for her friend eventually she thought of one she flicked her wand and muttered an incantation jane hair turned indigo jane smiled i like it lets leave it like that an idea had just struck lily hang on a sec i just want to try something she waved her wand again and cleared every bit of dye except the streaks there in front of the mirror sat jane her hair had gone from straight violet to wavy locks of luscious deep brown which as it happened set off the purple streaks nicely wow kay dee look at jane lily called beckoning the other two jane suddenly looked less dotty and a lot more beautiful she looked childlike and innocent pure and very vulnerable her silver eyes didntseem so eerie they seemed to fit her pale skin contrasted oddly with her hair but instead of making her look sickly or timid it gave her a slightly fairylike quality jane looked at her reflection as though she was looking at a stranger wow jane you look gorgeous yeah amazing jane looked uneasy now lils change it back change it back please now lily was confused at her friend request why sirius will be blown away when he sees you like this tomorrow lily said jane frowned sirius doesntmind how i look as long as i me and this this isntme jane ended softly kayla raised her eyebrows not you how can you say that this is your natural hair colour and jane said expectantly lily shrugged ok it your hair i guess she flicked her wand again and jane hair became indigo and purple again jane sighed contently as she examined her reflection and turned around ok girls now crush time she said as she clapped her hands to grab their attention lily groaned saying crush time now only applied to lily as the rest of them already had boyfriends or something of that sort i going to kill you jane lily cried but jane stuck out her tongue of course you will sweetheart jane said in a babying voice kayla looked interested why lils is there something we should know she asked teasingly while adea just laughed as always adea qureshi knew what was going on and she hadnteven been told oh go on lils you have to tell or we ll force it out of you adea brandished her wand in the mood for dancing lily she threatened laughingly lily put on a pitiful look as she mumbled two words james potter what was that i didntcatch that kayla said she leaned closer lily scowled james potter okay i have a crush on james potter are you happy go on then laugh all of you you have a minute lily huffed adea jane and kayla however sat there with blank looks on their faces woah calm down lils time of the month kayla asked sympathetically lily gave her a look kayla shrugged so what am i going to do adea spoke up well first you re going to tell us what happened lily looked to jane who encouraged her with a nod of her head well we um we might have kissed the redhead mumbled chaos broke loose they started to squeal and shriek and hug lily simultaneously okay okay okay calm down lily said the girls settled down and tuned in to listen to lily once again well you know ever since then i suppose he grown on me then on valentine day he was at the three broomsticks with dulcie fairbairn from hufflepuff and i swear time stopped felt like i couldntbreathe i knew it kayla cried suddenly the other three looked to her but she shook it off sorry you had to be there lily shrugged and continued with the story then a couple of days ago he made me tell him about my perfect guy and all of a sudden i realised that he was sitting right there chasing me the whole time it was james aaaaaaawwwwww adea and kayla chorused so what do i do now lily asked but started again as all three of them opened their mouths that doesnt involve telling james the mouths all shut lily groaned at their help you are kidding me do you know how humiliating that going to be lily whined adea looked at her wisely lily you are going to have to swallow your pride she advised jane nodded in agreement and added yeah it doesnt have to be humiliating you could take a leaf out of kayla book just snog him to death he ll get the message oi kayla cried and shoved a pillow in her best friend direction lily was deep in thought the thought of snogging james to death didntseem so disgusting anymore you know i might just do that lily mused but no one heard her as a pillow fight had broken out and lily could do nothing but join in ah good times a n there you go not much going on at the minute tune in next

angry but read the chapter first before you start pelting cyber tomatoes at me if it isntto your liking then pelt away this essence february drew to an end march began bringing with it the chirping birds the leaf bearing trees the blooming flowers and that general aura of happiness that was spring lily and james had not progressed any further though that wasntto remain for too long lily had been looking over those beautiful parchments and being her analytical self she had dug underneath every word read between every line and brought out just about every hidden emotion some of the underlying feelings in his written work made her blush well he was a boy a teenage one at that but some of his earlier work made her coo the fact was that lily had just about everything she needed after a few contemplative sessions in her room alone lily had finally worked out a way to let james know without having to endure a serious blow to her pride lily had devised a plan which comprised of james coming to her rather lily going to james next time he flirted with her instead of protesting she d play along something she knew would throw james off his guard newts were in june and no matter how much the seventh years tried to convince themselves otherwise they really werentthat far away four months though it might seem long to the average second year wasntreally that long when it was the distance between then and the arrival of tests whose results would determine your future no four moths definitely wasntlong in fact it wasntlong enough lily took her transfiguration notes into the lounge and started revising it was after all one of the subjects she lost out to james on and though her feelings towards james himself had changed she wasntabout to leave hogwarts without putting her sweat blood and tears into a subject she hadntalways been best at it just wasntwhat lily did she d been revising for about half an hour when james walked out of his own room holding his charms notes he glanced at lily and noticed she was revising transfiguration and lily after sneaking a quick glance at james noticed that he was revising her favoured subject you test me in transfiguration i ll test you in charms done without looking at each other during their short conversation james sat in front of lily took hold of her notes and preferred to look over them devising questions while feeling her gaze upon him as he asked questions concerning her notes and corrected her mistakes james successfully manage not to look at lily for which she was grateful because he would ve distracted her even more watching his slightly long stubborn hair fall in his face and resisting the urge to run her fingers through it was distraction enough he put down her notes and handed her his charms notes you did well but i suggest giving human transfiguration one last look he commented while looking at the ground lily nodded as she scanned through his charms notes okay list three advantages of the bubble head charm lily asked james racked his brains bubble head bubbled head oh come on i know this i do he glanced at lily looking for a clue lily was biting on her lip and twirling her hair round her index finger absentmindedly both of these were habits of hers that james loved he watched for a second before shaking his head and focusing on the bubble head charm come on james you wonthave this much time in the exam you know lily admonished making james look up at her and meet her deliberately in this case piercing emerald gaze the gaze that james couldnthelp but losing himself in he held her gaze for a second before finally giving up i dontknow next question he muttered as lily sighed okay the advantages are a they re a great way of keeping yourself from epidemics b very useful for secluding yourself from unpleasant smells and noises and c they also help humans breathe underwater she answered james nodded okay what is the most important factor for a successful summoning charm see this is an easy one lily prompted she picked up one of the parchments from her transfiguration notes and scanned it lily then tilted her head to one side furrowed her eyebrows slightly and set her lips in a confused pout all things she did when she was puzzled about something but was trying to work it out on her own another one of james favourites james observed her again he shook his head when he realised he d been staring again this time he decided to take action against his distraction oh but what a distraction it is lily she looked up at him her red lips were still set in that confused pout but her eyes had transformed into large innocent emerald pools his voice faltered a little u um do you need anything you look stuck james asked sweetly lily looked back at the parchment smiled and shook her head sorry my mind drifted from now on you have my complete attention she smiled at him swivelled in her chair bringing her legs into view except that she hadntbothered to change out of her pyjamas that morning it was a saturday and she couldntbe arsed so her slightly too small t shirt and shorts were brought to james notice l lil lily um why arentyou wearing your robe you always wear your robe he stuttered lily smiled again this time accompanied with a mischievous glint in her eye she reached over and pulled his cheek and a line from one of his works ran through her head and the day her luscious red lips utter a word of love for me arentyou a gentleman today that what i love about you james you are so cute he was gaping at her now what she d said was true she just hadnthad the guts to say before then lily was quite surprised at her daring would you look at that i do possess gryffindor qualities lily y you feeling okay today james asked incredulously the redhead nodded brightly you haventgive me the answer yet james james shook his head again and thought but lily decided just then to switch and cross her legs the other way this simple action drew his eyes to her legs again he finally tore his eyes away again and looked at the fireplace there you go it much easier when i not looking at her to be able to create a successful summoning charm the most important factor is to focus the object that you wish to summon correct lily said and began to leaf through his notes again okay james let try a harder one what is it exactly that protean charm does lily looked up and found james staring behind her in a very perfunctory way lily laughed and waved her hands in front of his eyes james i over here she said james shook his head and was forced to look back at her as he took lily in for what seemed like the sixtieth time he released a cry of frustration what is wrong with you james shouted lily was even more confused what she said james abruptly stood up grabbed his notes and marched out of the head lounge once he was out of sight and sound lily jumped on the sofa and laughed triumphantly remus was currently headed for professor mcgonagall office to talk about this mysterious student he had just been walking along the transfiguration corridor when he bumped into someone professor dumbledore sir i so sorry remus apologised hurriedly dumbledore waved a hand entirely my fault mr lupin one does tend to lose themselves in our wonderful halls dontthey dumbledore commented remus nodded and an idea struck him who better to ask sir i was going to ask professor mcgonagall but maybe you could help me remus asked hopefully dumbledore nodded within reason mr lupin he said quietly could you tell me about someone i ve been searching for actually her name adea qureshi dumbledore sighed at the seventh year question any particular reason you re searching mr lupin the older man asked wisely but remus just shrugged there no reason really albus dumbledore sighed again mr lupin even if i wanted to i would be unable to tell you anything you do not already know he answered which would be remus asked that miss qureshi is an excellent student dumbledore finished knowing that remus was disappointed at his reply remus nodded and looked thoughtful dumbledore continued to look upon the boy and mulled over something mr lupin there is one other thing it wonthelp you though he said warningly but remus looked at him expectantly anyway the only other thing i can say about miss qureshi is that she is very powerful he said quietly the old man did not regret divulging that useless piece of information even though he wasntsupposed to he bowed his head good day to you remus he said and continued walking onwards to his original destination remus however thought hard about the headmaster comment powerful what on earth could he mean by powerful powerful how in lessons powerful because i already know that or powerful powerful like dumbledore powerful well i doubt a seventh year could be as powerful as dumbledore but you get the gist of it speaking of seventh years how powerful could a seventh year be who is she by now remus had subconsciously started walking back to the gryffindor common room as he turned the corner out of the transfiguration corridor he ran into someone else ow holy sh oh it you remus said in a surprised one he faced waqar mohsin who d overheard remus and dumbledore conversation i need to talk to you waqar said solemnly remus looked confused but nodded all the same go ahead i know her waqar said quietly yet knowing it had had an impact remus looked amazed what he asked incredulously i know her i know who adea qureshi is i know what house she in what she looks like who her parents are what she likes who her friends are i know everything he finished remus looked at him expectantly well i canttell you he said quickly remus was angry now what is it with everyone what is it about this girl why cantanyone say anything honestly it like this girl wants to not exist remus ranted but at this he noticed that waqar had hurriedly averted his glance and something struck him so that what it is he said quietly stop looking waqar said what stop looking for her why should i remus said in a challenging tone adea means a lot to me and the last thing she needs is someone stalking her just stop besides if mcgonagall find out you ll have to stop on her orders not mine waqar said before briskly turning away and leaving remus was completely and utterly perplexed i dontunderstand is it really that serious i ll tell you one thing mate you have one temperamental girlfriend if you dontstop now she will not be happy remus sighed again and felt immensely tired his thought reeled to the date and he realised tonight was full moon i should take a nap or something hey sirius jane said as she sat down next to her boyfriend sirius grinned and gave jane a small kiss and said hey what are you doing this easter jane asked sirius looked at his girlfriend quizzically easter that like a month away isntit he laughed but jane shook her head no sirius have you forgotten two weeks she reminded sirius ran a hand through his hair thoughtfully well i ll probably be at my place i dunno maybe drop in at james on easter sunday help look after allegra another day nothing special he listed jane however beamed at his lacklustre response why dontyou spend easter with me jane squealed sirius jaw dropped easter with you at your parents sirius said quietly yes with me not at my parents i have my own place but we ll be eating with them easter sunday she said calmly as she placed a small portion of pasta salad onto her plate and took a bite for sirius however the panic was not quite over your parents are hippies right he asked nervously jane looked thoughtful as she chewed yes though not the stereotype hippies they used to be when they were younger but they ve moved on a little bit my dad an executive at an eco tourism company and my mum head chef at this vegetarian restaurant in the city centre she explained sirius nodded um i mean i mean sure sure why not i ll spend easter with you uh sure he said feverishly as jane shook her head fondly now why do you sound so petrified she asked gently well you re asking me to meet your bloody parents for god sake that pretty serious isntit i mean that what girls want to do when they want to get engaged or something you know make sure they have the parents approval sirius said hysterically but saw that jane was laughing you didntthink i wanted to get engaged did you she asked her eyes shining with hilarity sirius was shocked y you don t no are you crazy i not even eighteen for christ sake i just thought it d be nice if you met them is that a crime she giggled again sirius sighed in relief and ran another hand through his hair as he smiled as well so you have your own place huh sirius said devilishly jane rolled her eyes and turned to face him yes is that a problem she asked innocently well of course not sirius grinned but continued how many rooms does this place have exactly he asked it a flat a two bedroom flat so that one room for you and one room for me she said sirius grin faded oh he said you didnthonestly think i was just going to let you sleep in the same bed as me jane asked with a smile sirius thought about his answer of course not he lied has anyone seen kayla simmons remus called throughout the common room kayla where are you he called again a second year girl came down he staircase remus stopped her have you seen kayla simmons remus asked the girl frantically damn it where your girlfriend when you need a snog the girl threw a glance at the staircase she up in the first year dormitories but she completely lost it the girl said frightfully remus was worried now what do you mean he asked again the girl sighed dramatically she being and she looked to either side of her before whispering nice remus stared at the young girl get back to your own business he said coldly he rushed up to his own dormitory and grabbed his broom in true marauder fashion he flew up the staircase and walked into the first year dormitory there remus saw a sight he thought he d never see kayla was sitting on the floor of the dormitory with gabrielle and nerissa on either side of her she was telling as remus realised when he actually listened a story of one of the marauders early pranks when the first years obviously werentin hogwarts jaylin sat in front of kayla having her strawberry blonde hair braided by the seventh year girl right so then you know lily the head girl you should ve seen her blow it was hilarious she went bright red and started shouting and screaming at james you know him and her red hair was flying all over the place and if looks could kill james would ve so been six feet under anyway so just as she finished calling him a self centred big headed arrogant conceited pompous spoiled prat he goes you re really beautiful the girls all laughed and remus chuckled slightly from the doorway as well her face froze for a second and i swear donttell lily she d kill me but she almost blushed but no one saw except me of course and then she started yelling at him and accusing him of playing one of his uncaring hurtful and embarrassing pranks on her kayla finished remus decided to step into the room and finished what kayla didntknow and ever since then james has sat in our dormitory devising ways to win lily over because since that day it has been his sole mission to make miss lily evans mrs lily potter he said gabrielle nerissa and jaylin clapped as remus bowed kayla rolled her eyes you stole my thunder she cried she grabbed a bobble and tied up jaylin hair and admired her handiwork so what did you want she asked remus smiled i need to discuss things with my girlfriend he said and winked at her kayla caught on well girls i ll be leaving but i ll drop by another time okay next time we give nerissa a makeover bye she called as she left the room show off she muttered playfully your month is up you know remus reminded her kayla nodded and turned to remus with a very sincere expression i do know but spending time with them is just so much fun you know they want clothes advice make up advice boys advice it just i dontknow it like i haventlaughed like i do with them for i dontknow how long kayla said in a small voice what do you mean remus asked i dontknow if you ve noticed god bless your innocent little soul if you haventbut things are changing they started changing from our very first day its impact has been becoming heavier and heavier as we ve progressed through the school times are becoming darker kayla stopped and inhaled the essence of hogwarts this is our last year at hogwarts and we re damn near coming to the end of it when we go out there we ll face terrible things things like voldemort i dontknow if you know about him but i ll tell you he out to make this world a living hell old millicent bagnold not helping too much is he it failure to failure everywhere he goes i just i dontknow i wish sometimes i could forget about it and just laugh kayla smiled fondly at the corridors gabby and nerissa and jaylin they re so young they dontknow anything they canteven feel it yet their troubles are so trivial sometimes being with them is my favourite place to be when they re moaning about homework or how awful the boys are it just all this voldemort business goes out the window and i start to concentrate on how to help them manage their homework or how to make them see how guys can actually be pretty cute and i getting there kayla laughed loudly remus smiled she was beautiful he hadntheard her laugh like that for four years it was as if she was a third year again when remus first started to crush on her her sapphire blue eyes lit up her golden cheeks pinked and she generally sounded carefree lets terrorise somebody she cried remus laughed as well an unfortunate ravenclaw second year walked through that very same corridor you what are you doing out so late you should be in lessons kayla yelled the second year looked scared as he started to stutter an excuse but i donthave he started but remus cut him off no buts that ll be fifteen points off and i ll be having a word with your prefect he admonished the second year was truly scared now as he bolted down the corridor to get away from the two seventh years remus and kayla looked at each other and burst out laughing remus you cantt take points kayla gasped through her laughs remus nodded i know but did you see the look on his face god you would ve thought fifteen points was the end of the world they laughed again and then stopped let me do all your worrying for you long as you keep laughing like that remus said as he tucked a strand of hair behind her ears kayla smiled i wish i could but we have to share the weight of the world between us she said kayla noticed something about her boyfriend you look really pale are you okay she asked as she put a hand to his forehead remus averted her gaze and his face darkened kayla realised what the cause of his sickly looking face was oh i see my boyfriend going out to become the wolf tonight is he kayla joked remus looked back at her and gave her a weak smile he still wasntused to her being okay with his lycanthropy she gave him a small teasing kiss and stared at him when she pulled away you know if i could i d take away everything you have to go through kayla asked i know remus said as he took her hand and kissed her fingers come to my room tomorrow i ll heal you kayla said slyly and winked at him remus smiled he took hold of her chin and leaned down to kiss her kayla smiled against his mouth when he broke away she sighed contently answer me something kayla said remus indicated for her to continue why me why do you want to go out with someone like me i mean i not a very nice person i know that i brave enough to admit it and i so blunt you deserve to be with someone as compassionate and kind as jane not me kayla said and scrunched up her nose remus stared at her and searched her face for his answer i want to be with you not jane wonderful as she is you re ten times so you re beautiful and you re a beautiful person too he tapped at her chest right where her heart was you have a good heart and you love whoever resides there you just dontlet them in very easily you re afraid to get hurt but you d give your life to protect those you love i know you kayla simmons like the back of my hand he said softly she gasped how does he know that even i ve never admitted it to myself how did he work that out today when i saw you with gabrielle and her friends i stood there for a good five minutes just staring at you when you re nice you radiate your cheeks glow you like being nice to people as long as you can be sure that their trustworthy you dontreally like terrorising little kids funny though it is you re scared of them remus finished as he ran his thumb across her cheek now why are you going out with me why dontyou go out with sirius he could make you forget the outside world with him it d be all fun and games all the time with me you have to give up your boyfriend to the moon once a month you have to live with the fear of being with a werewolf i just depress you remus mumbled dontyou dare say that remus look at you sirius could never make me laugh half as much as i do when i with you i not stupid remus i cantforget what going on out there you re so kind and understanding and sensitive and perfect how many times do i have to tell you i like your inner wolf i not scared of you i never will be and inside you re just like me you re scared to let people get too close to you because you think they ll hurt you and you re so brave i dontknow i feel really safe with you i guess we just balance each other out just like jane and sirius do kayla whispered remus laughed and hugged kayla okay let move away from that now we have things to tend to remus said like kayla prompted like getting lily and james together oh dontworry lily got that covered kayla said waving her hand but this was news to remus she what he asked laughingly oh shit kayla said and smacked her forehead repeatedly remus burst out laughing you re kidding me lily evans wants to get james potter to go out with her remus promise not to tell kayla pleaded but remus shook his head no way kayla james deserves this and he ran off in the opposite direction to tell james right away kayla groaned and started banging her head on the nearest wall lily is going to kill me james james mate open this door now remus yelled as he pounded on the mahogany door he waited for a minute before the door swung open james looked confused moony what up you sound like you re having a heart attack remus laughed again i not having a heart attack but you will when i tell you this is lily here he asked first to be sure but james shook his head right get this kayla just told me that lily evans is trying to get you to go out with her james froze as he heard what remus had said but shrugged it off shut up remus that was only funny the first fifteen times i fell for it james said calmly not wanting to get his hopes up no prongs i not kidding kayla just let it slip i was talking about getting you two together and she said oh dontworry lily got that covered remus explained james grinned as he thought about it and then realised something got it covered she said so that what she was doing this morning james said what do you mean oh we were revising she was testing me and she started doing all these really hot things like twirling her hair around her finger and biting her lip then she brought her legs out and they were in full view she was wearing pyjama shorts i just wanted to but remus held up a hand dontwanna know james dontwanna know remus said closing his eyes and shaking his head so she likes me she actually likes me remus you re a genius i owe you one next time we re in hogsmeade your lunch on me i ll pay for kayla as well but i need to go talk to someone james said hurriedly as he and remus made their way out of the head chamber and up to gryffindor tower james reached the seventh year dormitory in a mad rush adea where are you adea i need to talk to you i thought you might be coming to see me adea said as she sat reading on her bed in the far corner of the room james went to her and sat down next to her is it true she must ve told you james asked but adea feigned confusion james what are you talking about she said absentmindedly and went back to reading adea he whined and took her book away adea smiled and sighed resignedly lily might have mentioned something she said james looked at her expectantly well he prompted but adea lips remained pursed what in it for me she said james rolled his eyes flowers adea lots of flowers she shook her head a galleon he tried she shook her head sugar quills she shook her head again levitating sherbets and chocoballs adea thought about it and then nodded they shook hands okay lily likes you and she wants to go out with you but i know she wontjust ask you out but basically yeah lily likes you my work is complete adea squealed and hugged james who stared at her dumbstruck you are a genius adea qureshi you have managed to do something the marauders have been trying to do for seven years seven years and you manage to do it in six months lily said you were brilliant james cried as he ruffled adea hair adea grinned at his praise so what are you going to do about it she asked now james was stumped hm there a question he said thoughtfully why dontyou just kiss her adea suggested james looked at her in surprise what he asked as though not having quite heard her just kiss her why dontyou she wouldntmind i sure james thought about it appealing though it sounds i urge you to think about your past encounters with lily when kisses have been involved she did slap me every time exactly what about that kiss at christmas she didntslap me then the situation was different james adea said trying to get his attention she waved her hand in front of his glasses he shook his head and focused on his petite olive skinned friend sorry what were you saying adea shook her head and rolled her eyes it her birthday next week you know march 21st adea said hoping to jog his memory james nodded and smiled of course i remember i dontknow what to get her though it got to be special this year we re actually friends he said as he fell in thought again well you re a potter right adea said stating the obvious james nodded in agreement well if it not too much trouble then get her an owl she always wanted one james looked sceptical an owl it seems it seems simple adea supplied yeah james said but found that adea was laughing quietly that always what held you back with lily your need to impress her with something spectacular adea explained hey girls like it when we do spectacular things for them james said defensively but he noticed that adea was now shaking her head despairingly yes but this is lily while spectacular things do seem appealing they lose their charm after a while to her she likes to be treated like a human being not a prize the simplest things could put you in the highest esteem adea elucidated james raised his eyebrows and i couldnthave been told before where was this piece of information say six years ago he asked lily was panicking slightly now and why shouldntshe petunia wedding was three weeks away that meant two weeks to get a date most would think that two weeks is quite a period to find yourself a date well boys would anyway but it was slightly different when you hadnthad a boyfriend in nearly a year even worse when your last ex had broken it off by cheating on you with a slytherin slut so lily feelings on this whole finding a date issue not confident no other way to put it it didnthelp that her last date not boyfriend well if you could call him a date admitted to having found a reserve for you it the situation of cancelling arose which in this case it did lily would ve liked to ask james however brave as she was when flirting with him things were quite different when facing the task of actually going up to him and asking him to be her date to a wedding of all things and last but not least when all things came down to it lily always brought out the fact in her own opinion of course but she d never realised it she didntexactly have a gifted face yes though james potter found her for a reason lily couldntdecipher beautiful most guys just didntsee it sure at halloween she d turned heads but only because she d been dolled up lily had a hidden beauty of course to her own two eyes she had no beauty she didntlike her red hair her tiny height her abnormally pale skin though she was glad that atleast jane was in the same predicament she just didntlike her physical appearance and it wasntappealing lily envied her friends mostly kayla and adea though she felt less resentful in adea case since no one noticed her kayla was noticed however and she would ve had dates left and right if she werentso insistent on having everyone fear her jane wasntso abnormally pretty which lily liked though felt awful for thinking actually now that she thought about it she pretty much envied jane as well jane who underneath her violet dye was actually positively gorgeous but ah well at lily and jane were in the same boat though jane took the term hidden beauty to a new level lily secretly wished that one day she would wake up with kayla hair adea skin and jane body she d keep her eyes she liked those wow my concentration span is off the mark today back to the original problem oh yeah the date what were her choices lily needed to ask someone a boy preferably usually when her parents threw parties and she was asked to bring a friend she d just invite jane or kayla but her mother letter with it oh so subtle hint made it quite clear that she expected her youngest daughter to bring a friend of a different sort a male friend to be precise who oh who was she to ask lily sighed out loud and made her way to her potions lesson just as she was about to leave the solitude of her chamber and join the hustle and bustle of the hogwarts corridors she remembered that she d left her favourite quill in her letters drawer she rushed back to fetch the quill lily yanked open her letters drawer and gasped what a perfect wonderful flawless and utterly genius idea at least my mind can be brilliant at times that was it she got it lily grabbed the quill scribbled a sentence down and left the chamber hurriedly for the dank dungeons of hogwarts professor jabin back was to the class and lily was late she sighed in relief ran to her seat and thrust a note into james hands miss evans professor jabin voice rang throughout the room lily winced yes professor she asked innocently the potions mistress sniffed disdainfully obviously a habit of hers you re uniform is a mess fifteen points and you re late to my lesson a further twenty points sit down she said lily was fuming someone must ve told her about the prank no duh she noticed however that professor jabin was red in the face with suppressed anger lily sniffed disdainfully mocking her potions teacher just so you know red isnta good colour on you neither is orange nor pink for that matter oh and i d shave your legs if i were you lily said scathingly and yes the desired effect had been achieved professor jabin was now positively purple as the gryffindors in the room burst into laughter and the marauders applauded lily for her unexpected audacity detention tonight out of my lesson now take to this to professor mcgonagall the older woman barked and hurriedly wrote a note gave it to lily who was smirking and pointed at the door indicating for her to leave lily snatched the note contemptuously from jabin grasp and stormed out of the dungeon all the while giving the older woman a look that would make the devil run and hide lily roamed the corridors in search of a particular one congratulating herself on her successful escape from a torturous potions lessons finally professor mcgonagall room lily took a deep breath and went over a game plan okay let put those green eyes to work and those braces you had for 3 bloody years so nice big smile now and in we go good morning professor mcgonagall lily said brightly making sure her eyes were nice and big and sparkly which she ensured by checking in the plaque on the desk and a large hopefully dazzling smile professor mcgonagall looked up from her papers and smiled very slightly at lily well who wouldn t when someone was being that nice good morning miss evans how may i help you professor mcgonagall said as she pushed her glasses up slightly i have a note from professor jabin lily said politely and her mouth twitched when seeing her head of house mouth thin at the sound of professor jabin name professor mcgonagall eyebrows rose as she scanned through the note she looked up and looked at lily incredulously miss evans is this true lily nodded ashamedly though not meaning it at all yes and i ashamed to say so though in my defence i was provoked lily said meekly how so well i was three minutes late to the lesson and wrong to be so i know that i walked in and she took off twenty points twenty points for being thee minutes late lily huffed in outrage and i d been running so my tie was a little crooked and she took fifteen points for a crooked tie professor you cant tell me that fair lily explained and professor mcgonagall nodded in agreement miss evans i understand why you would be angry but you have to learn to control your temper especially in front of teachers it not like you to be like this even with professor jabin the woman grimaced lily laughed silently i really sorry professor i just have a lot of other stuff going on lily lied professor mcgonagall had her own theories she looked at the redhead over her glasses worried about the newts lily stared at her teacher for a minute not quite understanding until it hit her the newts of course how could she have forgotten with all this james business she d completely forgotten about the most important tests of her life but for now it made a good cover i suppose so lily laughed nervously professor mcgonagall nodded knowingly miss evans i ve known you for going on seven years now you are a conscientious intelligent bright student i know these impending exams seem nerve racking but i know you ll get through them without hassle and you should know too you dontneed to worry about them just revise well and things should go right for you she said kindly lily felt flattered sure that wasntthe advice she needed right now but it was definitely nice to know that people thought that about her in fact it was wonderful to know and made her feel happier she knew people thought she was clever but no one had actually directly said that to her it felt nice thank you professor i dontknow why i was so horrible to professor jabin i wontlet nerves get the better of me in future she said professor mcgonagall nodded again now about this note well i hate to say but points that have been taken have been taken and i cantget them back for you unless rewarded and the detention i cantdo anything about that either you ll have to serve it quietly it tonight at seven o clock you may leave lily smiled at her professor and exited the office james stared at the note lily had handed him over and over again james would you mind being my date to my sister wedding i a bridesmaid and my mother expecting me to bring someone a male someone so i d really appreciate it lily lily evans wanted him james potter to be her date to a wedding lily evans wanted james wanted to punch the air in triumph notice the word date yes yes i not blind so are you going to go what the hell kind of question is that course i gonna go for the first time i approve of your decision wait let me get this straight my twisted contradictory completely fun sucking conscience is agreeing with me oh good lord i ve done something right dontyou be smart with me ah well it nice to know you haventchanged after the potions lesson was over james rushed over to the head chamber to see lily once he entered the lounge he saw lily on the sofa with her legs curled up reading a book you confuse me james stated simply running a hand through his hair lily looked up and bit her lip nervously well you had to face him sometime h hey james how are you how was potions hope i didntmiss anything too big nice weather we re having dontyou think lily said feverishly james cast a glance to the window it was pouring lily seemed to have realised this too as she now looked as searching for a new topic what would you say if i did this james hugged lily who awkwardly patted him on the back when he pulled away she said i d say what was that for hm no reaction james observed he then brought his hand and caressed lily cheek what about this lily kept herself as composed as possible and refrained a sharp intake of breath i d say are you feeling alright lily said boldly still no reaction james said to himself looking at her oddly what about this he leaned over and gave lily a soft kiss lily was shocked but relented nevertheless and started to kiss back softly the kiss became more passionate as james released everything he d bottled up for just about seven years lily finally broke away breathless and staring hm yes i think i got a reaction there james said with a grin lily glared at him james sorry he apologised he then looked back at lily red lips and grinned again do you know how long i ve wanted that he said enjoying watching lily blush at his comment lily looked up from the ground so will you be my date to the wedding it seemed so much easier now to ask him than before for some reason james glanced at hr lips again and back at her eyes i dontknow i ll think about it he left off knowing that lily fully understood the implications the redhead rolled her eyes and kissed him fiercely for a minute leaving james slightly in a daze now she asked impatiently james stared at lily not quite believing what had just happened and nodded mutely so what about this lily asked again not wanting to leave loose ends untied james shrugged obviously wanting her to decide there was no hesitation on his part whatever you want he said lily smiled at the sweetness i guess we re going out that is if you dontmind lily said unsurely dontmind lily i ve wanted to go out with you since first year course i dontmind james exclaimed lily laughed don t sound too eager she quipped he stuck his tongue out lily looked at her watch and jumped they had five minutes to get to ancient runes james get up i dontwant to be late again she said as she picked up her bag james rose slung his own bag over his shoulder and wrapped his arm around lily waist lily smile slightly at the feeling of safety she suddenly felt as they made their way to professor cummings classroom the gryffindor table erupted in applause as james and lily entered the great hall hand in hand for dinner they d kept quiet about the whole business but word had seemed to spread slower than usual but it spread all the same finally sirius exclaimed as they sat down i was beginning to think we d be out of hogwarts by the time you two cottoned on lily rolled her eyes and knew that adea was smiling next to her once everyone had settle down and resumed their original activities james and lily turned towards each other anything i need to know about your family lils james asked lily thought about it well dad likes to treat petunia and me like princesses he cantstand it when we cry apart from he a real well you know into the whole macho business doesntlike boys who are stupid but they have to be athletic and smart doesntlike boys who eat too little but then he doesntexpect you to be huge either because you wontbe able to play sport properly you ll be fine you pretty much fit his perfect description lily said reassuringly james smiled long as i stay on your good side he said and lily laughed yep so it ll be four weeks of sucking up i afraid otherwise i just might have to complain she joked lily continued mum is an absolute sweetheart she obsessed with cooking she brilliant at it just remember to compliment her she ll love you oh and she likes flowers james nodded what kind of flowers james asked lily stared at him as of to say are you stupid right lilies it is then james muttered lily laughed and gave him a small kiss which james needless to say enjoyed what about your sister petunia james asked tentatively lily sighed petunia is in short a bitch she awful dontyou worry about keeping her happy because she wontbe no matter what you do just ignore her she said resignedly the week flew by and lily became more and more excited until june 21st finally arrived incidentally june 21st happened to be a special day for not just lily but jane as well small world isntit jane however was not quite as excited for no reason it was just who jane was and they way she thought and looked upon things of course that didntstop her from expecting people to remember and give her presents she just didntact all hyper and ecstatic and she acted relatively normal and collected even if it was her eighteenth the girls always received their presents from each other in the mornings before breakfast this year lily had received a gorgeous set of satin silver robes from adea that she d been eyeing for a couple of weeks now kayla had gotten her a set of crystal jewellery obviously chosen to match the robes jane had gotten her an incredible jewellery box which she had slightly modified it contained a mirror which decided which of your jewellery would look best with your outfit very useful jane had received a book from adea called explosive concoctions and their properties kayla had given her a cat she knew jane wanted one and hey if best friends cantgive the best presents then who can lily had given jane a brand new set of the latest empress fate make up line in very jane ish colours so in other words odd colours which jane surprisingly loved the boys however had to wait to give jane her presents kayla stop you from giving jane her present as well james asked remus in the common room remus nodded yep said sirius was probably planning something huge and that i should wait just in case i accidentally upstaged him or what not remus explained same james said girls are weird remus commented yeah james agreed lily came bounding downstairs to meet james he d understood the tradition between her friends she hugged james and they shared a kiss right okay close your eyes james said lily raised her eyebrows but closed her eyes all the same james took the owl out of it cage located behind a sofa and perched it onto lily arm okay open them now he said quietly lily opened her eyes and gasped as she looked towards her arm on her arm sat a short bodied owl with a large head in a cute way it had fluffy reddish feathers streaked with white underneath and had spots on it back it also had large yellow eyes which looked up at lily almost enquiringly they always said owls were intelligent lily looked back james speechless he saw that he looked nervous she a saw whet owl she small but the lady said she can carry anything you like and fly as long you like a n not sure if real saw whet owls can do that but hey it the magical world of harry potter she s she beautiful how did you know lily asked james sighed in relief and grinned well i might have had a little help he muttered thank you james you dontknow how much this means to me i ve always wanted an owl thank you thank you thank you lily cried she gave adea the owl gently flung her arms around james and gave him a lingering kiss james grinned again in a more awed way he still wasntused to it well what are you going to call her he asked lily thought and thought very carefully a special name something to do with greatness look at the size of her and the things she can do lily said thoughtfully adea thought about it and whispered something to lily lily clicked her fingers dee that perfect she whispered her name is shaan lily proclaimed and then looking to the owl and knowing they had chosen the right name it was already giving off a greatness vibe remus clapped his hands well i sure mine isntas good as james but here you go remus had gotten her a vial of abyssinian elixir rare stuff that wasnteasily found he knew lily liked collecting them the topaz fluid it smelled and tasted like spice as lily had read the taste and it properties combined could get rid of throat infections in an instant it was less commonly used nowadays as it was almost impossible to brew so pepper up potions were used instead when asked remus assured her it wasnttoo expensive and that he had persuaded his aunt into giving him some since she worked for the accidental magical reversal squad and had recently needed some to stop a muggle whose throat had started flashing different colours when a child was playing with his parents wands in the street lily had laughed to hear that peter had timidly handed lily a massive box of sugar quills which she was politely appreciative of good morning happy birthday lily sirius voice boomed as he down the stairs of the boy dormitory jane looked expectantly at him but he just gave her a quick kiss and turned back to lily well seeing as it your eighteenth and since you were a muggle and it all big for you i got you something extra special he said sirius summoned her present and a set of bone china teacups set in an open lavish velvet box came hovering down the staircase they had a lovely pattern lily raised her eyebrows teacups they re they re really lovely she lied in truth they were the sort of thing petunia would ve loved but lily not so much sirius laughed his bark like laughter you didntthink they were just teacups did you me give you teacups for your birthday course not look at the card lily picked up the card and read it slowly a smile started to creep up on her face nose biting teacups perfect petunia will simply love these thanks sirius lily said deviously suddenly the teacups seemed a lot more interesting lily kayla and adea cast a furtive glance between sirius and jane to see what he d give her sirius however seemed completely oblivious to the fact that it was his girlfriend birthday even the marauders exchanged confused glances as they followed sirius into the great hall jane though surprised and hurt at first was now completely fine with the problem that seemed to be fast approaching her or so the boys thought the girls knew better kayla was especially annoyed at sirius behaviour what he playing at can he not tell that jane upset that he forgotten understandably so no no he cantpossibly have forgotten he crazy about jane he probably planned a massive blowout surprise party for her god knows he could pull it off yeah that ll be it kayla thought and convinced herself remus opened his mouth to tell sirius but felt a hand on his arm stop him he turned around to see jane shake her head he ceased and shrugged his shoulders though he was pretty sure where this was heading and frankly he felt sorry for his friend james turned to lily hey i want to take you out to dinner tonight at this restaurant in hogsmeade say yes he said hopefully lily expression became stern james we can t she reminded him but her boyfriend just rolled his eyes it your birthday live a little would you lily sighed at this and became even more annoyed when james gazed at her with his puppy dog look no james come on not the eyes she sighed again oh alright just stop with eyes lily said frustrated that she d relented so easily james grinned at her which made her mouth reluctantly twitch upwards in a smile she couldnthelp it wear something nice okay he said sweetly well i already have some new dress robes so i could just wear them and it ll going to be our first date so there ll be the need to make a special effort great sirius noticed that jane looked even more beautiful than normal if that possible he leant in to kiss her but she turned her head so he got her cheek instead hey he protested jane turned around and looked at him in mock surprise oh i sorry did you want a kiss didntrealise she said scathingly not trying to keep her hostility towards him constrained sirius noticed that jane eyes were glassy just like when she was upset he scowled what wrong someone upset you your eyes have gone weird who is it i ll get them for you he said protectively jane just gave him a dirty look sorry if you dontlike my weird eyes but i ve just woken up forgive them for not being perfect jane snapped testily and in a way that was not like her she gathered her things hastily and rose well i off need to get to divination early happy birthday again lils see you at lunch yeah she said in her normal dreamy voice as jane left she didntturn around once to glance at sirius who was left to stare open mouthed at her retreating form now even the marauders realised that she was upset what wrong with her sirius asked in puzzled way not able to hide the hurt in his eyes everyone but him exchanged quick glances before shrugging sirius knew his girlfriend possessed a unique and confusing temperament and so let it pass as the day progressed sirius still made no indication of the significance of the day that related to jane finally at lunch kayla decided to approach about the birthday scene just to confirm what exactly it was that he was planning hey she said casually oh hey sirius replied so i have to give you credit for your acting sirius jane is thoroughly pissed she thinks you ve completely forgotten there ll be lots of appreciation on her part when she sees what you ve planned kayla said smilingly but sirius just looked politely confused planned planned what what he hell for he asked kayla stared at him blankly before shifting it to a more penetrating look for any sign of acting all of a sudden it dawned on her oh my god you have forgotten you are in deep shit sirius back kayla whispered furiously huh what are you on about jane march 21st ring any bell kayla tried sirius put on a sarcastic look oh yes of course jane favourite season is sprin how the hell am i supposed to know he demanded indignantly kayla shook her head amazing you have no idea do you 21st march is jane birthday you moronic imbecile she said angrily sirius looked at kayla as if she d gone mad no kayla march 21st is lily birthday not jane s he said patronisingly the brunette rolled her eyes yes i know darling but it jane birthday too she said just as condescendingly sirius laughed nervously and shook his head as if trying to convince himself more than he was kayla are you trying to scare me because it working he said anxiously hoping against hope that it was a joke but kayla just bit her lip i not trying to scare you i scared for you she said with an expression of great pity shit i cantbelieve it right we ll have to set up a last minute party you cane be in charge of but kayla cut him off no sirius you and jane arentlike normal couples james and remus not that remus would forget would be able to do that but not you you and jane are at a place where you have to tell the truth in this sort of situation whether you like it or not she explained carefully sirius sighed dejectedly you re right you re absolutely right he said kayla pointed to the entrance hall where jane had headed go she said simply and gave him a reassuring smile jane settled her self down underneath a tranquil looking willow tree and pulled the food she d taken from the great hall out of her bag as she chewed on the cheese salad sandwiches she thought about her feelings on the whole sirius birthday thing i cantbelieve he forgot i cantbelieve it i told him i specifically told him last week he remembered lily birthday yet he cantremember mine you dontcare about your birthday you ve always said it a beautiful idea that has been colossally besmirched by the media well yes but it still special i dontwant a present or an infernal birthday card i just wanted a happy birthday jane jane called an unsure voice she knew who belonged to and frankly she was in no mood to be forgiving grudgingly she turned to face the apologetic face behind her what do you want jane snapped he brought out a cake which had obviously been taken from the kitchens jane saw right through him and merely narrowed her eyes happy birthday sirius said nervously but she just snorted derisively he took this as his cue to explain the reason for his forgetfulness jane i am so sorry i had no idea truthfully i didntknow if i had i most definitely wouldntbe in this muddle i mean i just in my defence you never told me sirius said hoping she was in a mood to see reason i did she replied stubbornly sirius racked his brains flashback i trying to get to quidditch practise james is going to kill me jane prattling on about something birthday next week jane finished uh huh that nice jane i have to go i say quickly she waves and i off end flashback oh sirius said simply so you did remind me he really couldntsay anything else jane looked at him in a disappointed fashion oh no no no please dontlook at me like that i cantstand it what do you want me to do i ll do anything i ll do your homework i ll take you to hogsmeade buy you whatever you want ugh jane screamed in anger cutting him off mid sentence she got up forgot about her bag and started to head towards the castle wait jane what are you doing sirius called and ran after her being slightly more experienced in the art of running he soon caught up grabbed her arm and turned her around and she immediately burst out in furious sentences how dare you how dare you think you can buy me that just the sort of thing i hate about birthdays you should know that cantbelieve you even had the audacity to even think you could pathetic good for nothing attempt to make me forget that you forgot my birthday it was moving away from being angry at the fact that he tried to buy her i used to be a muggle too you know the eighteenth is important to me as well you completely forgot and you dontlisten to me then you turn up here with a cake no less to win me over well i have two words for you sir as if then oh ho then you try to buy me buy me you dontknow a thing about me not a single thing tears of anger started to fall all i wanted was for you to say happy birthday first thing in the morning maybe even a kiss but that didntreally matter i hate you she cried and her silver eyes blinked to release the tears had started to sting her eyes sirius ran to her side to hug her but she wrenched herself out of his hold he sighed this isntabout your birthday he whispered he soon regretted his words how stupid are you of course this isntabout my birthday not anymore this is about you not listening and being too fucking interested in your hobbies yes i know you were itching to get away from me that day but would it have killed you would it sirius just to have stayed from one more second and to listen this is about you not knowing me how can you say you love me i not a hobby and i dontintend to be treated like one jane screamed and she fell down sobbing sirius heart broke he couldntbear to see her like this he ran to her again and held her and this time she didnteven try to shake him off she merely whispered her protests no get away from me leave me alone i dontneed you dontyou think i do she struggled but sirius laughed softly dontlaugh at me is everything a joke to you sirius shook his head and cupped her face in his hands he gently wiped away her tears with a finger i laughing at your spirit i love you i do know things about you i know that you love to read books upside down because they might one day reveal a secret to you i know you would die for someone you love i know you hate conformists and people who donthave individual personalities i know you re a firm believer of karma i know you like to think of stars as your friends i know that you prefer grass to flowers because it so much more remarkable and beautiful especially when there are dewdrops on it in the winter i know you love spring because it the season of rebirth i know you i do jane sniffed but refused to look at him in the eye he didntdeserve that quite yet i sorry i didntlisten to you that day i sorry i not the best listener i sorry i thought quidditch more important that day but it isn t of course it isntright now you are one of the most important people in my life joint top with james you re not a hobby jane i so sorry i made you feel like one forgive me i ll make it up to you i promise he pleaded i not going to forgive you jane muttered sirius face fell yet she finished his spirit lifted you can start making it up to me but dontexpect me to be all nice to you just because i talking rationally doesntmean i ll let you get away with things she thought for a minute and started again i dontwant to forgive you you know annoyingly enough i love you too much to let my birthday get in the way jane said grudgingly sirius grinned can i kiss you no oh jane got up and wiped her tears but you can walk me back up and you can put your arm around me i need your shoulder jane said sirius got up and put his arm around as she d said where she immediately buried her face into her shoulder slowly he led her back up to the castle once they reached the entrance hall they saw kayla who took over and hugged jane she and jane then walked away leaving sirius to look after them and think of ways to make it up to jane where are they lily cried frustratedly she and adea were in lily room desperately waiting for kayla and jane arrival where have you been lily cried agitatedly kayla opened her mouth but jane stepped on her foot dawdling sorry completely forgot she lied lily rolled her eyes and turned back to her armoire right so i think i should wear the robes you gave me this morning adea what do you think adea and kayla looked thoughtful jane eyed lily hair well lily personally i think you should wear the chiffon ones that i got you at christmas i mean you re birthday is on the 21st march spring officially begins today the lavender would be more appropriate adea advised kayla nodded in agreement exactly i was going to say the same thing lily nodded and brought them out of her oak armoire right okay i have the shoes jane hair please lily commanded rather than asked and sat down at her vanity table jane studied lily hair over and over again the straight hair just wouldntwork no matter what you did soon she realised that the only way around it was to leave lily hair as it was naturally jane waved her wand and lily hair returned to it natural state elegant waves jane opened lily drawer and pulled out an ornate slide and slid it into lily hair lily then changed into her robes perfect jane said and clapped her hands lily stood up and did a twirl for her other two friends gorgeous adea and kayla chorused wait jane called rushed forwards and tied that necklace that james had given her at christmas around her neck they pushed lily towards the door as she was meeting james in the lounge james was sitting on the sofa reading a quidditch magazine with his back facing lily door so he didntsee her come out hey i ready lily said timidly what if he thinks i look awful james of course wasntthinking that at all you look you look beautiful james stammered lily blushed and looked at her feet to hide it james reached over and lifted her chin up voicing a thought he d only ever let slip once you look pretty when you blush he said simply with no intention of impressing her merely stating what he thought was obvious lily gave him a small smile james gave her a light kiss and offered her his arm as they walked out the mahogany doors of their chamber three pairs of eyes had been spying through the space that was obtained when opening lily door a crack the whole time thos eyes now looked away and their owners shut the door and start cooing oh my god he is so sweet he perfect for her adea squealed happily where do those marauders get their charm from i swear with the exception of peter it like they have a spell or something kayla commented jane sniffed well only james and remus must know how to cast it then she said acrimoniously kayla looked at jane sympathetically and turned to adea to explain the situation but as she did so adea shook her head and mouthed i already know kayla was confused but let it pass oh jane but jane held up a hand no donteven think about it this is about lily jane smiled let get some food lots of it and just gorge til lils comes back jane suggested and the other two girls agreed happily great i ll get the food jane said happily and walked out towards the kitchens luckily they werenttoo far from the head chamber as jane entered the kitchens she noticed that sirius sat in a corner on a spare table eating some shepherd pie she frowned as she recalled that he d missed dinner and then smiled remembering that this was where they d start to like each other she wasntgoing to let him see that she was happy to see him jane composed herself and walked towards the elves with grace and poise completely ignoring sirius as best she could hello the elves turned to face her hi i was wondering if you could get me some stuff she asked politely the elves looked delighted and were more than willing to serve their visitor i d like some ice cream in assorted flavours sweet popcorn all the sweets you have two jugs of pumpkin juice some nachos with cheese and salsa oh and some red grapes jane ordered sirius head snapped up at the sound of her beautiful voice jane he called unsure of whether or not she d answer jane turned and feigned surprise sirius didntsee you there she said reluctantly she took a seat next to him sirius stared at her intently before remembering that he could give her something for her birthday he loved her and so even if it meant a lot to him he wouldntmind besides jane wouldntcare that he hadntbought it jane i have something for you it nothing much i didntbuy it or anything you probably wontlike it but he took off a leather strap tied around his wrist and handed it to her here jane looked at him oddly before taking the strap and examining it it was a plain piece of leather with a magically attached charm it was the black coat of arms obviously removed from a signet ring the crest had a massive cross engraved over it the handiwork of a child jane knew exactly what it was it was something sirius had created when he was eight he d engraved the cross over it to show his hatred for his family and to annoy his mother she knew how much this meant to him i canttake this she whispered jane tried to give it back but sirius declined no keep it please it all i can give you at the minute you deserve more he said guiltily jane anger lifted slightly she still wasntready to forgive him but he had made his predicament slightly better no this means more than anything you could ever buy me jane whispered and placed her hand on his sirius smiled jane kissed his cheek collected her food from the elves and rose to leave on her way out the food hovered behind her she kissed the bracelet and placed it on her wrist knowing that sirius would be watching as he saw this sirius felt even better though he knew this didntmean that things were peachy but they were definitely getting there oh finally ice cream kayla cried and she lunged for the ice cream adea took some popcorn what took you so long adea asked jane who happened to be deep in thought hm oh met sirius in there jane explained vaguely kayla looked up what is it with you two and the kitchens jane thought it about and laughed inwardly at realising that the pair of them really did have a penchant for rendezvous in the kitchens i dontknow fate i guess the girls waited for lily and ate discussing odd things james had taken lily to a magical restaurant located deep in hogsmeade called the jade pagoda it was a wonderful chinese restaurant by an old chinese witch whose portrait hung in the entrance as they ate they talked and laughed just like they did before at the minute they were fighting over who was cleverest i the cleverest it so obvious why would the teachers be so nice to me lily bragged james shook his head adamantly they only love you because you re a suck up now me everyone knows i the cleverest james said confidently what proof do you have of that lily challenged james ran a hand through his hair my fan club he said simply lily frowned yes i d forgotten about them they ll have to be disbanded lily said airily james grinned jealous evans lily nodded well i like having my fan club around you cantdisband them james said just to see how she would react to his disappointment she merely shrugged and said fine then i ll let joseph webster keep flirting with me and we ll be even lily definitely wasntdisappointed at james expression webster webster flirts with you doesnthe know we re going out i ll kill him james said furiously lily laughed calm down james joseph not flirting with me no one ever flirts with me lily said quietly james looked confused why wouldntpeople flirt with you not that i want them to but why wouldntthey he enquired lily looked at him incredulously look at me i know i not exactly the most attractive girl out there i ve only ever had three boyfriends one went out with me for two weeks on a bet one went out with me obviously because he thought i was a brunette and when the dye washed out he dumped me and my last boyfriend cheated on me with krista hartley james winced lily smiled well i think you re gorgeous and i ve always thought you were beautiful james said matter of factly lily emerald eyes sparkled at his comment and she smiled brightly and continued to eat her food james watched her with awe she amazing the pair made their way home but were rather delayed james decided he wanted to carry lily home as opposed to getting a carriage they would ve gotten home faster had james not insisted on kissing lily every so often james lily protested feebly as he leant in for another kiss once they entered the head chamber lily jumped out of his arms and ran to her bedroom she stuck her tongue out at home just before closing the door she sighed contently until she noticed three people aaaagggghhh she screamed and whipped out her wand jane adea and kayla looked up at her excitedly lily finally they cried lily clutched a hand to her chest dontever do that again she breathed and the other shrugged and immediately began hounding her with questions about her night how d it go was he a gentleman what did you talk about lily held up her hands okay okay calm down one at a time she took of her shoes and put them away and turned back to her friends oh girlies he perfect i had such a good time none of that awful first date awkwardness you know and he was such a gentleman he even carried me home by the sounds of it we talked about everything she gushed for the next fifteen minutes they talked about lily date until the redhead realised how late it was oh my goodness look at the time i sorry you guys but get out i need some sleep lily pointed at the door that nice kayla huffed as they headed for the door lily stopped them again oh no no no i dontthink so it is way past curfew you are being escorted by the head boy she poked her head out of the door and called james james guess who i found i my room you re going to have to take them up to the tower for me lily said kayla adea and jane filed out of the snow white room kayla was still sulking we re not babies you know kayla whined

up on me because i do fully intend to finish this story i mentally unable to abandon it parental advisory it was the friday before hogwarts broke up for easter and a general feeling of excitement could be felt buzzing around the corridors it was heard in the voices of the students along with relief which was shared with the teachers the seventh years were anxious but excited and relieved all the same yes the holidays needed to be utilised for revision but a few days off wouldntkill them right the marauders were convinced the easter holidays should be used for rest and relaxation purposes only their girlfriends were a different story kayla and jane were for the first time just as conscious as lily and adea of the upcoming exams and who might have sparked these feelings lily james said as he watched his girlfriend frantically cram her books into her trunk what are you doing he asked amusedly not a good idea lily head snapped up from its set position long enough to give james the queen of all death glares sorry james mumbled thank god sirius isnthere he d never let this go i dontblame him you are incredibly whipped james looked back at her and heard her give a slight scream and felt himself smile but look at her come here let me help james said feeling sorry for her he strode over to her but she refused to budge lily let me do it james said but she shook her head making her red hair sway no james it okay i can handle it james rolled his eyes at her useless persistence you obviously can t he drawled james bent down slid his arms around her waist and lifted her away from her trunk trying desperately to stop her flailing hands from breaking his glasses once he d moved her he whipped out his wand shrunk her books and placed them neatly into her trunk lily blinked trying to digest the use of logic james had just performed oh my god i canteven do shrinking charms shrinking charms lily cried james walked over to her okay lils what you need to do is calm down james ordered lily looked at him in a disbelieving way as if no one could ever even think about calming down in a situation like that calm down calm down are you insane here i am about to take my newts in may and i canteven do a shrinking charm i do not think this is the time to be calming down she cried hysterically she ran to get her books but james snaked his arm around her waist before she got too far but she still fought he sighed he leaned in and gave her a kiss feeling her give a small sigh against his mouth when he broke away he saw that she had relaxed slightly but her eyes were still hazy with fret look would you still be head girl if you dumbledore thought you couldnteven do a shrinking charm you do have to be smart to get it you know you ll do fine just like always you will breeze through and laugh about it trust me lily nodded james picked up a cushion and held it out to her lily whipped out her wand and shrunk it successfully before returning it to its full size she flung her arms around james in relief who smiled there you go see perfect now as long as you can keep a cool head you should be alright he said soothingly lily smiled at him and they left to take a walk around the grounds jane and sirius had become oddly formal around each other with jane making all the calls sirius didntknow how to act so he mirrored her behaviour one thing that was decided was that they were still spending easter together okay so am i allowed to write you over easter sirius asked cautiously you re spending it in the same flat as me why would you need to write me jane asked sirius spirits lifted well i thought that since we you know i thought that you wouldntwant me to sirius finished jane shook her head no i not letting you spend easter alone why on earth would i do that jane asked quizzically sirius was really confused now look just because i angry at you doesntmean that i ll leave you all alone at easter i not that harsh she explained sirius grinned that was a few weeks ago jane and sirius demeanour around at each other made the students of hogwarts think that they had broken up the girls found this especially appealing one acacia abrams was very interested hey sirius acacia cooed sirius rolled his eyes the blonde haired girl approached him i heard jane swales broke up with you you poor soul she said faking concern i ve always thought she was a bitch she said thinking that sirius would wholeheartedly agree how wrong she was take that back he said coolly acacia looked taken aback and then donned her previous expression once more oh how insensitive of me you re still hurting why dontyou let me make it better for you if you catch my drift acacia proposed winking at him sirius looked at the girl and took in her appearance acacia abrams was from a respectable family her younger sister c leste abrams was the exact opposite while acacia was well seemingly dim c leste happened to be a top student while acacia had never so much as gained a point for her house c leste had made it to prefect while acacia looked down upon everyone and was cold hearted c leste welcomed everyone and was warm hearted acacia skirt was always rolled up as high as could it go and as many buttons possible undone whereas c leste had all her buttons except the collar because that looks odd done and her skirt at a perfect length did they have anything in common they were both exceedingly beautiful in september sirius would ve walked off with acacia abrams and found the nearest broom closet but that had changed he glanced behind her to see c leste looking at him apologetically on behalf of her shameless older sister sirius gave her a small smile and turned back to acacia i dontknow who told you that but me and jane have not broken up the girl ignored this and placed a hand on his shoulder this made him grit his teeth in his books very few girls could now do that and acacia abrams was not one of them it okay sirius you dontneed her she doesntdeserve you now me i deserve you more than anyone and you definitely deserve me we re perfect dontyou see and look on the bright side she wasnteven pretty acacia reasoned bad move jane is a thousand times more gorgeous than you will ever be sirius said with a great deal of hostility acacia stared at him for a minute before bursting out in laughter did she have you under a love potion or something or are you just blind she asked sincerely once her giggles had subsided sirius inhaled and exhaled heavily stopping himself from hexing the girl in front of him you are so lucky i not who i used to be he said dangerously the girl remained oblivious to his tones thinking he was joking oh sirius she said playfully she then fiddled with his hair and batted her eyelashes that was it enough she d seen all she needed to see this girl had gone too far jane who had been there the whole time had seen that sirius had tried to be calm about it and he d definitely been faithful for this particular episode jane anger was not directed towards him she marched over and lodged herself in between sirius and acacia jane proceeded to fling her arms around him and kiss him full on sirius was in shock at first but gladly complied with her wishes acacia stood there in alarm as her face reddened with rage once jane had pulled away and sirius had smiled lovingly at her the onlooker decided to speak up what are you doing he mine she yelled jane fierceness kicked in dream on he mine abrams run now she said threateningly acacia jumped and scampered away sirius looked down at his girlfriend grin intact so are we okay now he asked hopefully no oh jane sighed but you re still my boyfriend sirius gave her a what that got to do with it look well as long as i here no slut is stepping within two feet of you she explained sirius laughed and looked at her proudly good jane gave him a kiss on the cheek that for standing up for me and not going off with her she whispered they were met with an awkward silence did you mean what you said jane asked self consciously about me being more gorgeous than abrams sirius looked at her why would you ask of course you are jane nodded remaining unconvinced the train will leave in five minutes please board now lily called board now that five minutes til the train leaves please board now all students board now she called monotonously james was patrolling inside the train to make sure everyone was okay and had a carriage you you over there lily called to a fifth year couple sharing a kiss you ll see each other in two weeks the train leaves but the girl cut her off yes i know the train leaves in five minutes please board now the girl mimicked her testily lily rolled her eyes and ignored the comment as she watched the girl board as lily looked on down the platform she saw the first year who had been scared at christmas laura laura caught lily eyes and gave her a big smile before quietly boarding the train once the last person had safely boarded the train lily boarded the head compartment with one minute to spare she sighed and laid herself down on the wide comfortable berths that were situated there lily sighed again as she placed her arms carelessly in whatever position they landed in her hair fanned out beautifully framing her face her pale eyelids shut over her emerald eyes looking like a pair of almond shaped doors tempting came a voice james lily didntmove and casually said say what you want but i couldntcare less james laughed sat down quietly and watched his girlfriend rest what are you doing lily asked still not bothering to open her eyes who me james asked innocently lily didntanswer i was watching you james answered why because he replied because lily asked expectantly because you re beautiful james filled in lily knew that she couldntkeep her eyes shut now not when he insisted on being so sweet her eyelids snapped open and she looked at him here i am minding my own business revelling in the tranquillity and then you come along and now i have to stop because you re being so damn sweet lily babbled more to herself then james making him smile lily gave him a small kiss i like it when you re sweet nobody ever said something so nice to me before she said nice isntit this private compartment means we can do anything we want james said suggestively lily shoved him and pulled out a pack of exploding snap james groaned in disappointment estrella fonseca patrolled the corridors and checked the compartments to make sure that students were sticking to the rules she poked her head into a random compartment and found an unexpected sight sirius black lay on one of the seats with his head in jane lap she read a book and absentmindedly ran her fingers through his hair on hearing the door open they looked at her sirius frowned jane looked inquisitive oh hello anything the matter she asked kindly the prefect shook her head and lowered her gaze um no no no nothing the matter i was just just checking i need to go to the food trolley now she fumbled jane smiled in her odd manner and said really me too mind if i came with you sirius sat up estrella looked to him and saw that his girlfriend request was not to his liking jane didntseem to care and by his silence estrella guessed that sirius knew this uh sure she said unsurely jane rose and without a word to sirius exited with the sixth year girl who now had no choice but to actually go to the food trolley jane and estrella strolled down the narrow passage passing itself off as a corridor neither said anything for a while before the younger girl spoke up so you and sirius you re still pretty strong huh jane nodded thoughtfully i guess i mean we have said we love each other she answered estrella looked crestfallen oh she said quietly you re still not over him are you jane asked you should be the last person i admit that too estrella said resignedly but why you two broke up in october jane exclaimed i know i sorry but i dontknow ever since you two started going out he began to look even better than usual and then i do want to be over him she whined they reached the food trolley and each bought a few of every type of sweet before heading back would you like to meet someone i know jane asked estrella shrugged jane led estrella to a nearby compartment with a boy who was reading in it he was a boy who was introduced to jane through waqar as he and this boy shared a dormitory and a few classes jane thought he d be perfect for estrella jordan the boy looked up from his book and smiled slightly the boy had longish dirty blonde hair and blue grey eyes with an intellectual aura about him not unlike remus estrella eyes widened she wasnttoo acquainted with the seventh years from other houses apart from the prefects and those from her own house estrella this is jordan gibson jordan this is estrella fonseca jane introduced formally there was definitely a spark between them she could feel it they were still casting appraising looks at each other though it was hard not to gain the other approval they were both very good looking once they d said their hellos jane and estrella went and sat with him and jane waited until they had gotten into a productive conversation almost ten minutes later the pair had launched into a conversation on books and had just about forgotten that jane was there just as she was about to close the door estrella called out hey jane give sirius a message would you tell him i sorry for what i said in october it was unfounded out of order and completely untrue oh and thanks jane nodded and left returning to her respective compartment adea and waqar sat together lightly discussing random things until waqar imposed a very serious question hey adea have you thought about about the the wedding at all waqar asked cautiously adea head snapped up and she stared at him wedding what wedding she asked fearfully buying time for an answer waqar gave her a look you know what i on about uuuumm we should have it in winter adea tried waqar shook his head you haventthought about it at all have you he asked accusatorily adea looked guilty well you know they ll be talking about it when we get home waqar said she nodded to indicate that she did know you sure you want to go through with it he asked again unsure of whether or not he really wanted to hear her answer no no i do want to i just haventthought about the actual wedding adea said waqar gave her another look she knew what it meant fine we ll talk about it she said moodily she pulled out a parchment and a quill okay do we want it here waqar asked adea thought about it and nodded i want my friends to be able to come without too much hassle what about you same i guess he answered adea scribbled it down are we sticking with the winter idea because if we are then january would be perfect adea suggested waqar shrugged whatever suits you what will you wear adea asked quite getting into this wedding planning mode waqar looked at her as if she was insane i dontknow you figure it out just hand it to me the night before ironed and everything and i ll put it on for the day he said adea rolled her eyes and wrote down her ideas for him okay what will i wear she said out loud why dontyou wear what you wore for halloween waqar recommended thinking he was being completely logical adea glared at him and he regretted his words okay sorry sorry forget i said it adea turned back to the parchment how do you think i d look in a soft gold she asked waqar shrugged good he answered simply what about a silver she asked good red good fluorescent yellow she asked suspiciously good you arentpaying any attention she slapped him waqar ducked i so am he protested adea folded her arms and gave him a challenging look no i am watch what fluorescent yellow he asked innocently adea inhaled deeply and let it pass fine i ll talk about it with our mums you re no help she wrote something down and again and asked another question house or hotel hotel got it they continued with questions like those planning out their wedding in what some would call a very unimportant and carefree way and others would call a detailed way but to them it was right jane got back and sat down next to sirius who was staring out of the window he looked at her you ve been gone a while he commented jane smiled and said introduced estrella to jordan gibson they really get on she said happily sirius nodded when jane remembered estrella message oh by the way estrella told me to tell you this she sorry for what she said in october it was unfounded out of order and completely untrue jane recalled sirius thought about it well i might as well let her off i mean it was october and she apologised probably seen how brilliant jane is and regretted her words sirius smiled and nodded knowing jane wouldntquestion him about it an awkward silence fell upon them kayla and remus walked in just then after spending a while with gabrielle hey you two lovebirds kayla joked but noticed that jane had sidled to the opposite end to sirius both he and jane looked up to glare at kayla moodily before turning away o kay kayla said looking from one to other i thought they were over that obviously not kayla and remus sat in the large space that now existed between their two friends they made futile attempts to start conversations so uh easter gong to be great right kayla said laughingly albeit nervously mm and that all she got remus snorted and felt a kick to the shin uh we should all meet up have a drink in the leaky cauldron remus suggested kayla nodded approvingly absolutely she added before getting remus by the arm and dragging him to the door give us a minute or ten kayla said remus needs to make his prefect rounds dontyou wha oh right yeah we ll be back right back and they stepped out once they were outside remus laughed they ll have fun spending all easter like that kayla hit him remus it not funny she scolded i know sorry trying to lighten the mood that all if they keep on like this next thing you know they re breaking up jane kicking him out he comes to you and voila you spend the rest of your holidays watching sirius mope around and obsess over jane kayla said exasperatedly creating an unfavourable image in her boyfriend head remus cringed they made their way to the head compartment in haste on reaching their destination remus and kayla found lily and james partaking in a quiet chess game wow you two are hot hot hot kayla commented dryly the pair looked up james looked quite annoyed we would be if lily wasntsuch a prude he said lily poked him so what are you doing here lily enquired kayla sighed jane and sirius what are we going to do about them i mean really it getting a teensy bit blown out of proportion i suggested we all meet up for drinks in the leaky cauldron but judging by how they re acting that ll be really awkward remus voiced well there nothing we can do really james said feeling helpless the four sat looking defeated until lily clicked her fingers we could lock them in a room she suggested but remus shot that one down lily we re all going on a 2 week holiday to separate places how will we manage that before school starts again true what if we hit jane with a nostalgia charm kayla said lily looked interested but now james was the bearer of bad news guys that not entirely safe i mean i know you re great at charms lils but what if and only if it went wrong that spell triggers different parts of your brain and if it got the wrong parts then he didntneed to finish the sentence lily could imagine the consequences and they were not nice not nice at all the four sat there for a while randomly spouting ideas which got crazier as time went on only to have them stamped on by someone else eventually lily and kayla came to a solution well when there no visible solution there always one person to take it up with lily said defeatedly and exchanged glances with james and kayla while remus looked confused i ll go kayla volunteered lily rose as well i ll go too let me come with you remus said but james held him back hey moony me you chess game three galleons what do you say james proposed remus looked to kayla who smiled at him he shrugged and turned back to james you re on adea adea lily and kayla called the addressed girl looked up from her parchment with a knowing look on her face it jane isntit what going on she asked worriedly wincing slightly lily stared at her best friend how did you kayla cut her off we ll talk about that later right now we need to stop jane and sirius splitting up adea looked deep in thought well she ll need a stern talking to from kayla apart from that if they were meant to break then they will whatever happens will be for the best stop being selfish the pair of you she snapped at seeing lily and kayla expressions to her suggestion if jane turns up at one of our houses and spends the whole holiday crying so be it i ll sit there listening and pick up every damn tissue if i have to and you two will be there too adea admonished kayla grabbed the parchment that adea had been writing on and her eyes lit up at reading the title adea tried to get it back but failed and so gave up oh my god dee how brilliant how fucking brilliant she exclaimed lily craned her neck to see what kayla was fussing about and caught a glimpse and she too became excited as she read the title out loud wedding preparations wedding preparations does that mean it does doesntit when when when oh my god oh my god oh my god no fucking way lily screamed as she hugged adea adea tried to hide behind waqar as she replied january kayla and lily started squealing again adea getting married wow i ve never been to one of your kinds of weddings what do i have to do what do i have to wear they asked sounding like little children adea laughed something bright and you ll be holding a corner of the canopy over my head as i walk into the hall oh and reapplying makeup when needed she elaborated the two girl eyes scanned the rest of the list and possibilities sprung into their heads until of course they remembered that one of their number still needed to be notified oh my god jane we need to tell jane they took the parchment and ran off in the direction of kayla actual compartment hey jane look at this kayla said animatedly handing the parchment to jane who skimmed through it her eyes steadily sparkling brighter and brighter no way no fucking way jane repeated what had been heard from lilly moments ago wedding she mused jane looked at her two friends with wide eyes she getting married she said not quite believing it she getting married lily reiterated though in a different tone they all started squealing again jane in her delight kissed sirius without thought sirius laughed though completely unknowing of whom they were talking well i ll let you girls have your girly moment he said and left the three to be excited on their own as sirius left adea walked in and her eyebrows rose in an amused fashion at the faces before her i dontget why you guys are so elated you knew it was going to happen yes but we had no idea when and when you told us about you and waqar in fourth year you were so angry and depressed that we couldntthink to be happy i mean this is different kayla explained patiently adea shrugged and took a seat the girls sat around thinking of clothes to wear to this wedding did they care that this wedding was more than six months away no as it happened the rest of the train ride was spent like the old days girls separate guys separate with the exception of peter who only joined the marauders for all of ten minutes once the train had halted lily and james got off first to ensure no one got hurt in the mad rush of students exiting the train please leave the train in an orderly fashion please leave the train in an orderly fashion lily called in a conductor drone as narcissa and bellatrix black left the train they shoved lily aggressively lily being of a small frame fell back instantly and stared up at the two jeering slytherin girls aw cantthe mudblood keep her balance what a shame they taunted lily breathed deeply and let it pass just as lily was about to stand up again bellatrix kicked her hard on the shin jane was heading towards them her eyes blazing dangerously but james got there first and pulled lily up without trying clear off now before i do something you both regret james said icily but he looked terrifying narcissa and bellatrix were slightly worried it could be seen in their eyes but they didntback away oh really potter so what the boyfriend gonna do they asked challengingly just as two jets of light headed their way with a loud shout of furnunculus as soon as the light hit the two slytherins their faces and arms and legs erupted in boils they screamed and ran off in the direction of their boyfriends lucius malfoy and rodolphus lestrange both of whom gave jane murderous glares jane lily cried jane seemed to snap out of a daze and gave a satisfied smile looked to lily brightly but lily did not look amused jane you shouldnthave done that malfoy and lestrange will kill you lily said worriedly jane shrugged let them try she said carelessly lucius malfoy walked past with a sobbing narcissa black you ll pay for this mudblood he whispered by now sirius was at jane side just try malfoy if she doesntkill you first you can bet you wontbe alive when i done with you he replied malfoy wasntall too strong without his cronies so sirius threat raised his alarm slightly but he sneered and walked on as though it hadn t jane looked sirius and smiled grudgingly thanks she said in a small voice sirius grinned broadly and walked to where their trunks were kayla who had come to say goodbye for the holidays and check to see if lily was okay once she had finished with the others she approached jane can i talk to you over there kayla indicated to an isolated spot on the platform jane nodded when are you going to get over the fact that sirius forgot your birthday kayla asked as soon as they d reached the private spot jane shrugged kayla sighed it really is ridiculous how cold and distant you are to him she commented jane looked away look he made a mistake i know that but he done everything to make it up to you he gave you an emotional token of his childhood he been incredibly loyal to you he refused to go off with abrams and you know that the old sirius wouldnthave thought twice he stuck up for you even when you re horrible on two occasions why cantyou let it go kayla asked in exasperation jane bit her lip they re all good points all of them i know i should ve let him off by now it really horrible that i still being angry i dontwant to be i really dontbut what can i do could you at least tell kayla well i ll have to wonti i scared okay jane said kayla looked surprised at first and then her eyebrows rose and indicated scepticism scared jane you re not scared of anything kayla said jane thought about it and then went back on her words slightly overwhelmed more than scared i suppose she said kayla looked puzzled how do you mean jane took a deep breath and set about explaining look sirius and i have been going out for for what six months i mean we said we loved each other straight away i mean more than that we said we loved each other and then went out because of it jane got cut off by a disbelieving kayla what dontyou love him kayla asked with wide eyes of course i do dontbe an idiot jane snapped testily what i meant was that we were just going really fast werentwe kayla nodded in agreement cantdeny that sirius totally put it into perspective for me unknowingly of course when i invited him to spend easter with me he freaked out he thought i was asking him because i wanted to get engaged i mean seriously what else is there for us to do now kayla opened her mouth but jane knew what she was going to say no i not sleeping with him not until we get engaged at least and that might not happen she filled in kayla thought about it and with a resigned sigh came to a conclusion you re right jane but you should tell him if you actually love him then you must be able to talk about something like that he really doesntdeserve all this hostility and if you carry on he could get fed up at any given time and poof it over you re heartbroken end of story kayla said flailing her arms wildly poof jane raised her eyebrows at her friend wording really kayla how old are you she asked disapprovingly jane come on sirius called further down the platform kayla gave her best friend a meaningful look before watching her step through the barrier with her boyfriend once through the barrier jane and sirius halted sirius looked at jane for instructions while she looked to him in puzzlement why have we come through here jane asked sirius thought this would ve been obvious because i cantapparate somewhere i have no clue about can i jane saw the problem an idea struck her hey ever been in a cab she asked conversationally a what jane took that as a no and pointed in the direction to a line of black london cabs waiting outside sirius looked bewildered and shook his head the cabs were a lot bigger and looked slightly different to normal cars or he wouldnthave been so confused jane dragged him over to one and gave the driver an address jane indicated to sirius to take a seat while the driver got out and stared in a dismayed way at the luggage jane saw this and thought fast we collect antiques big uh colossal fans of antiques she finished lamely but the driver seemed to accept this and he started piling it into the boot hope you re comfortable it a long ride home jane said and smiled at hearing sirius groan after getting out of london which took a while since the driver decided he just had to take them the long way round somewhere along the line jane slipped back into her usual daze so when sirius started getting excited at spotting big ben instead of saying something believable like he foreign first time in london she said he likes to get in touch with his inner child this earned a grin from sirius and slightly wary look from the driver nearly four hours later sirius saw a picture in an odd casing with a funny gold coin on it and the words welcome to sheffield printed underneath oh sheffield sheffield you live in sheffield are we there sirius asked restlessly jane glanced at her watch and said in her dreamy voice not long now finally they pulled up in front of a reasonably large red brick house where jane asked the driver to wait before rushing inside and coming back out with some money to pay for the ride once the trunks had been returned to their respective owners they were ready to have a proper entrance sirius heart started beating rapidly as he swallowed and waited for the door to open once jane had knocked but he realised something wait didntyou just go in here he asked jane nodded yes but that wasntspecial coming home has to be special she said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world sirius realised that though entirely untrue in his case in jane case the phrase the apple doesntfall far from the tree was quite true the door swung open and an average height thin woman with dark brown hair which fell to the middle of her back stood before them the woman was pretty for her age but jane had inherited none of her traits as far as sirius could tell anyway snowflake the woman called in an absent minded voice though the tone was slightly less eerie than jane s it was more sanguine jane smiled absently though her eyes sparkled and hugged her mother sirius stood there watching on wistfully he d never been able to do anything remotely like that jane now turned to her dad sirius could instantly tell that jane and mr swales relationship was different there was more serenity you could call it the man was tall with an indefinable presence light brown hair and silver eyes he was just like jane bar the hair dad jane said simply welcome home snowflake the man said and looked at her with a seemingly blank expression jane smiled widely and hugged her dad how are you you re okay good good introduce me introduce me the woman said sirius laughed slightly nope she nothing like jane mum dad this is my boyfriend sirius black sirius these are my parents maiara dean and river swales jane said sirius was slightly confused concerning her parents last names he decided to ask jane later as he grinned and shook hands with both of them and noticed her father had the same aura maiara smiled and led them into the dining room i ve made your favourite she said winking jane eyes twinkled again and sirius laughed at how little it took to please her if there was a thought behind it he thought about this as maiara served vegetable lasagne when jane and sirius crossed over lily and james had almost immediately followed right well my dad can pick us up so we dontlive far from here so let me call him lily said but james interrupted cantwe apparate i know where your house is james said the last part sheepishly lily looked at him oddly but james didntcare to divulge how especially since the story contained a drunk james and a sensible sirius okay a little creepy but fine lily said amusedly they crossed back onto the now empty platform 9 and disappeared with two pops they appeared in the same way they left on the doorstep of 15 goddetia avenue lily rang the doorbell james took a deep breath as he watched the handle turn a woman possessing faded blonde hair grey eyes and a delicate frame yet graceful posture like lily james thought when noticing the last two characteristics opened the door and looked at them in delight lily oh come come in dears she ushered as soon as the door shut mrs evans hugged her daughter fiercely and james too even though she didntknow his name lily went to her dad and smiled hey daddy she greeted only calling him that on occasions like these hey princess her father said in return and ruffled her hair james had a rough idea of what mr evans was like and took in his appearance the man was broad and smart with a head full of red hair which like his wife s was fading he had emerald green eyes as well lily seemed to be a mixture of both of her parents though it didntseem so at first glance mrs evans looked at her youngest daughter expectantly oh of course lily smacked her forehead mum dad this is james potter my boyfriend james this is mum and dad mrs evans looked surprised you mean you re actually going out with james potter i thought never mind mother lily cut in calmly james stuck out his hand pleasure to meet you mrs evans he said charmingly mrs evans smiled but lily just rolled her eyes nice to meet you too james there ll be none of this mrs evans business call me rosalind her mother said kindly james now turned to mr evans nice to finally meet you sir james said the man shook it firmly nice firm handshake you re alright so far s pose you could call me adam mr evans said with a slight irish accent let me get you some tea rosalind offered and headed off to the kitchen a n note to american readers hope you know that tea isntliterally tea in this case it a commonly used name we give to dinner or an evening meal play sport boy adam asked james nodded enthusiastically absolutely know about quidditch sir heard mention of it yeah captain of my team james said proudly adam seemed more interested now really explain it to me love to know lily never been able to give me a clear idea bless her he added fondly lily smiled back but frowned immediately as she noticed that someone was missing her dad had noticed her frown what wrong lily lily shook her head as if saying it doesntmatter but as if her dad could read her mind he said oh you re sister not here she been going round the twist these days because of the wedding and everything hang on adam could soon be heard shouting petunia would you like to grace us with your presence i sure that lily wold like to see your face a blonde haired girl with cold grey eyes descended the stairs and entered the living room the girl was different to who james had seen in the photo back at christmas there was warmth in that girl eyes now she seemed almost empty her beauty had been stripped of her though her appearance hadntchanged you couldnttell at first glance her grey eyes that had in that photo and the one of her when she was younger been filled with a sort of happiness yet now there seemed to be no ounce of it in existence lily noticed as well no matter how much they fought blood thicker than water any day somewhere in the back of her head lily knew it hurt to see her sister like that had her parents not noticed how could they not it was so apparent so blatant how could they just sit back and let that happen petunia glanced at her younger sister and looked back to her father what is it dad vernon will be here soon she said adam rolled his eyes your sister entertaining company too or had that escaped your notice he said nodding towards james lily frowned her dad never spoke like that not to his daughters other fathers might ve done but not adam evans petunia turned once more to face james and her jaw dropped soon a hand was waving in front of her petunia closed her mouth promptly who might you be she asked tartly james potter he replied jovially offering his hand petunia stared at it for a second then glanced at her sister whose eyes shone with curiosity slowly she extended her own hand and for the briefest second shook hands with the boy in front of her before dropping it as quickly as possible the blonde haired girl looked between him and lily and back again wait you re going out with him she asked rudely lily in turn nodded adam we need to get some pop we ve run out rosalind voice called from the kitchen lily rose mum it okay james doesnteven know nonsense her parents chorused as they grabbed their coats and headed out the front door the three of them stood in the middle of the living room in formidable silence before petunia proceeded towards the kitchen lily followed her signalling for james to sit and stay once inside the kitchen petunia decided to pour herself a glass of water lily hoisted herself up on top of the counter like she did when they were younger why arentyou happy she asked abruptly petunia twisted immediately her eyes full of fear and doubt that was the first time that evening that lily had seen petunia eyes filled with anything what what are you talking about i perfectly happy what do you mean i not happy i very happy very happy indeed what would you know about these things lily vernon and i will be married next week and we will embark on a beautiful journey that is marriage she repeated as if she d learnt it off by heart lily stared at her sister i never said anything about vernon she whispered shit petunia started banging her head on the counter with those words of wisdom lily smiled you still fall for that one she asked mockingly i don t petunia said childishly you so do i do not do too times infinity and one petunia huffed in indignation take that back no lily replied yes petunia ordered no yes yes lily asked in a deceivingly puzzled way i meant no petunia said just as lily had predicted that exactly what i ve been saying lily exclaimed oh really hey not again petunia groaned at realising that she d fallen for another of her sister verbal tricks ha you even fell for that one lily said triumphantly shut up no petunia looked at her sister in surprise what are we even fighting about the older girl asked i dontknow lily answered they fell into giggles something they hadntdone in a long while the sisterly moment was broken however by the sound of a doorbell as the bell chimed through the house the giggles subsided petunia hand flew to her hair and lily cleared her throat uncomfortably that ll be vernon petunia said passively lily nodded and they exited the kitchen though lily decided to wait in the living room soon petunia entered the room with an unbelievably large man at her side lily and james stared for a second before springing to their feet lily this is my fianc vernon dursley vernon this is my sister lily and her boyfriend james potter the man had six chins a purpley face and an impeccable moustache as for his size he took the term beefcake to a whole new level and not in a good way lily watched her sister attempt to stare adoringly at her husband to be petunia could try but lily knew her sister eyes were devoid of love she d seen how jane looked at sirius how petunia was staring at vernon didnteven come close they sat down vernon struck up a conversation so lily petunia tells me you attend a top of the line boarding school which one would that be vernon asked pompously lily emerald gaze flitted to her sister face petunia grey eyes met her green ones that when she found the final piece of petunia mind the puzzle was complete this was what petunia wanted to be entirely different to lily that was why she was marrying this man not because she loved him because she wanted to become someone lily could never be and never was someone petunia had always wanted to be entirely cut off from lily and everything that defined her it brought tears to her eyes to have it spelt out like this but it had to happen someday lily blinked away the tears this is what she wants i her sister i cantstop her from getting yes i do actually have you heard of st anne up in scotland lily lied conversationally though it was barely above a whisper vernon now looked to james who happened to be very confused what lily no you lily stepped on his foot mid sentence causing james to change direction yes you do he said obediently so do you go to st anne as well vernon asked james looked at lily suspiciously before saying yes yes i do lily and i happen to be head boy and girl impressive the man commented though everyone in the room knew he didntmean it hello called a voice rosalind lily james and petunia gave a silent thanks to mr and mrs evans excellent timing as everyone went into the dining room lily held petunia back that what you want to be married to someone you dontlove just because the life he can give you seems attractive there are a million guys in the world who can give you that he doesntdeserve you you could get anyone look at you lily said and stopped herself from saying for now lily we ve been over this i am in love why shouldnti be petunia snapped you tell me lily murmured and left her sister to take a seat by her boyfriend after a nice evening with mr and mrs swales jane drove back to her flat once they entered sirius noticed that her walls were a dark pink almost purple but not quite nice colour sirius commented dryly thanks it called garnet symphony jane called sirius looked around where do i sit on the floor harder to meditate on a sofa sirius didntknow what meditate meant but sat down on one of the cushions anyway though the colour was dark and not entirely to his liking it emitted a certain vibe of peace and calm jane took a seat next to him inhaled deeply and closed her eyes sirius watched her face take on a blissful expression she sat in silence completely content with her own company a moment later her eyelids flickered open revealing once more her ethereal silver eyes i haventbeen here since september just familiarising myself with its vibe just to get back in the feel of things jane got up and beckoned for sirius to follow her he rose and trailed his girlfriend to some double doors which she thrust open to expose a beautiful balcony adorned with plants beautiful night isntit jane said as she tilted her head upwards to gaze at the sky sirius was now inclined to look at as well it was indeed as jane had said a beautiful night the stars twinkled in their random fashion illuminated by the moonlight belonging to a crescent moon which stood so clearly among the shimmering stars plotted on an inky black sky it is he replied simply he looked at jane again her pale skin seemed to glow by the light of the moon and her eyes shone vividly as they mirrored the stars the wind blew faintly blowing her violet hair forward hiding her face giving only slight flashes she had never looked more beautiful he wished he could take a picture but found himself unable to leave such was the enigma that defined jane swales sometimes i stand out here and i forget that there another world within this planet i forget that i belong to two different yet bizarrely similar worlds though i suppose you ve never felt that imagine thinking that you re just part of a mundane world where excitement diminishes almost as quickly as it starts then one day you find a letter that is the key to a world you ve been yearning to discover yet never knew jane paused to smell a flower from a nearby pot being a muggle for eleven years and then being a witch for the following seven it s an experience jane laughed sirius stared hanging onto every word her dreamy voice spoke he could listen to her the whole night through when how how could that voice that mind ever have become boring to him it seemed impossible though as his mind recalled it had indeed happened oddly enough sometimes sitting in hogwarts or roaming hogsmeade i sometimes miss this mundane world that i left behind her tone had a hint of distinct fondness she looked directly at sirius piercing his smoky grey eyes with her own sparkling silver what about you when did you realise you werentlike the rest of your family a shadow crossed over his face day one my mother always was said that i was and i quote a rebellious infant sirius said grimacing jane gazed at him her eyes urging him to go on when i was old enough to understand their ideals and opinions i realised i wanted to be their opposite yet sometimes i d be upset that i didntfit in if you cantfit in with your family who can you fit in with my mum never once looked at me the way yours did when she opened that door i know you wanted to roll your eyes even if it was in fun dontever take it for granted my cousin andromeda was the first person to ever make me feel wanted within my family and for that i cantthank her enough when i got sorted into gryffindor and sat alongside james and remus and peter i thought finally i somewhere people arentjudgmental and narrow minded and cowardly and i was right for the next few years things were great we pranked went out with a new girl every week and stuff then in september i met you properly have you ever met you in your words it an experience when i insulted you and you had me kicked out right then i knew you were different sirius finished the two stared at each other blankly jane was unsure of how to react but when she saw sirius lean in she decided to let her problems slide for just one minute they hadntkissed like that in a while it felt like their first soft and tentative yet oddly satisfactory jane ran her fingers through his hair but felt guilty all of a sudden when his tongue ran across his lip she broke away breathing fast wait we have to talk jane whispered sirius wanted to groan but didn t they walked back into the living room and sirius immediately began talking jane i so sorry i forgot i really am do you want me to say it again because i will you know or do you want me to get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness because i ll do no no one needs to get down on their knees and ask for anything jane said hurriedly sirius gave her a what was that about look jane sighed okay the birthday thing in my books you re forgiven you were ages ago the problem quite different okay so donthate me for this i needed a little space she muttered sirius stared at her dumbstruck so are we have we he couldntquite say it but jane shook her head no no i never considered us broken up i couldn t no matter how much space i need i couldntstand not having you around and frankly what would you do without me jane said sirius smiled at her words knowing them to be true so what this about he asked in a concerned tone jane suddenly started talking in one breath really fast i dontknow maybe i being stupid am i being stupid oh i dontknow i really don t i felt like we were going so fast i mean remus and kayla have been going out for eight months and even after working through a fight they haventsaid they love each other we just said it straight away and she had been talking feverishly which in her throaty voice was doubly confusing woah woah woah slow down shit how do you talk so fast he asked incredulously sirius shut up jane shoved him alright look i caught the gist if it i agree we were going fast and i understand why you needed space but you cantpretend that we dontlove each other just to slow things down i not about to pull out a ring from my pocket and get down on one knee anytime soon and it seems you re fine with that like i said i know we were going fast but that worked for us i not going to say i dontlove you because i do whether you still do i dontknow sirius finished and looked up expectantly that a stupid question jane said yes or no jane sirius said firmly jane searched her boyfriend of course i do she said with an air of surety after a moment in silence jane rose slowly it late time for bed let me show you where you ll be sleeping jane offered sirius shrugged and followed her they entered a room possessing a dark wooden floor and walls in a burnt sienna is it okay jane asked sirius thought the room odd but again felt vibes of tranquillity radiating from it it fine once he d changed out of his clothes he fell onto the bed and was immediately in a state of slumber a n not as long as they usually are but there you are anyway so again please review and tell me what you think oh by the way i just curious but i ve wanted to ask this for ages how do you pronounce adea review responses cheesytrees thanks so much for your review i glad you like james so much hpfreaklk thanks a lot and yes sirius was an idiot wasnthe how did you like this zippyfox thanks a lot but did you mean poor sirius thanks again for reviewing the all mighty and powerfulm thanks for your review i know they did take their time didntthey disclaimer harry potter belongs to j

months yeah i didntrealise until i checked today i am so sorry really i am well i hope you like this chapter and please leave a review even if it is to tell me off for being lazy intended bliss the highly anticipated day of 17th april had finally arrived and mayhem was lurking in every corner whether it was petunia fretting about her dress or one of the bridesmaids was late or the veil kept placing itself in the oddest places the fact was that the situation seemed to have its own mind as important situations often do lily was still uncomfortable about her sister reason for marriage petunia however didntseem to want to listen lily final resort was rosalind this proved to be rather difficult due to the fact that mrs evans was always running around tending to everyone problems time was running out fast swifter every second for the moment lily had forgotten her newfound hatred for her sister adam and rosalind had fallen in love with james as the days had passed james loved rosalind food rosalind my standard raised so much hogwarts food will just disappoint and he was so damn obsessed with his masculinity that he and adam could go on for hours about sports and well sports james taught adam about quidditch he even lent adam quidditch through the ages which fascinated adam exceedingly with its moving pictures adam in turn taught james about football and rugby when lily compared her parents attitudes towards james with their attitudes towards vernon she noticed more than a small difference her parents were very cold towards vernon they gave him the smallest food portions at dinner and rolled their eyes when he talked of his ambitions lily had to admit that her sister fianc was boring as hell all he ever talked about was the company he worked at that wasntthe worst of it though the worst of it was the fact that this company made drills lily made every effort to be nice but he just wasntinterested the fact was that lily was prettier smarter and a lot more popular than his fianc e vernon always had the best if he shut lily out then petunia would still be undefeated the bridesmaid dresses were lily grudgingly admitted simple looking yet elegant the dresses were blush pink with a bone bodice the skirt had organza layering and silk lining art first hearing that the bridesmaid dresses were a shade of pink lily had cringed what with the fact that red and pink just didntmix but the shade was so pale it didntmake any difference the bouquet was composed of roses identical to the corsage on petunia dress petunia did look beautiful she d had her hair dyed dark brown despite protests from rosalind the maid of honour was petunia friend yvonne the flower girl was their cousin felicity the other two bridesmaids were scarlet and trinity williams the williams family had lived next to the evans since before petunia was born and the four girls were close in age scarlet was a year younger than petunia and trinity a year younger than lily the girls had been friends since before any of them could remember all of them had had their hair curled and left down as a gift from the bride they d received a chain of freshwater pearls at the minute petunia had sent yvonne to check on vernon and the crowd once yvonne had checked vernon was alright and that the crowd had settled the girls would start sorting themselves out but she hadntreported back as of yet the finishing touches were being put on petunia three minutes later everyone was ready and silent just waiting for yvonne word petunia sat quietly through her last time as petunia evans rosalind was sitting on a nearby chair and lily knew it was taking her all her willpower not to bite her newly treated nails lily sighed and strode slowly over to where her mother sat hey mum lily said softly rosalind in turn smiled sadly and kissed her younger daughter forehead hello darling she said tiredly lily looked at the ceiling for a second to collect her words from an unknown source noticed anything different about petunia lately lily asked offhandedly apart from the fact that her eyes are dead she never laughs and has forgotten how to smile or experience any positive feeling too late to be bringing that up sweetheart rosalind smiled forlornly lily was shocked how is she letting her do this how are you letting her do this the redhead cried for once recounting her thoughts word for word rosalind looked at her expression that clearly said oh please dontlook at me like that have you tried talking to her she asked yes but lily started but got cut off then we obviously got the same answer if we re sitting here in these outfits rosalind said her grey eyes had started misting up with tears not the tears of joy that filled every mother eyes on her child wedding day no rosalind evans tears were those of regret remorse and fear mum why didn t lily started again but yet again was cut off by her mother do you know what it like for me lily rosalind cried wretchedly lily opened her mouth but closed it again wordlessly rosalind continued do you do you know what it like to be a mother awaiting the moments in which will throw away her whole life and her chance at happiness and know that she doing it no lily she was unable to carry on as her tears fell freely yet soundlessly never the less lily closed her eyes pursed her lips and hugged her mother comfortingly a pair of eyes could be felt upon them petunia rosalind looked up and began explaining i just happy is all she said unconvincingly petunia turned her head she turned back and stared at her mother with eyes that brimmed to the rim of each iris with insecurity petunia swallowed and whispered dontcry mum there no time to do your face up again this must ve had a hidden meaning which lily didntcatch because rosalind offered a small smile and wiped her tears well there were some disadvantages of going to boarding school just then yvonne came rushing in we d better go the organist will start any minute all the girls fell quiet and rushed to form a line in the precise order in which they were to leave the evans were the last ones out lily looked to her mother and then petunia sadly before sighing and leaving felicity went out first scattering beautiful rose petals then scarlet went out followed by trinity and then lily she slowly walked up the aisle looking at her soon to be brother in law looking rather impatient instead of excited she glanced at james who looked at her how she thought vernon should look at petunia when their eyes met james quickly mouthed you look beautiful lily spirits lifted just to know that someone cared about her like james did and her heart went out to petunia after lily yvonne and finally on the arm of adam walked petunia her dress was quite unusual and not everybody could pull it off but she d managed it she wore a dress with a blush pink duchesse bodice with a rose corsage and heavily beaded straps to match the flowers the dress organza skirt was lined with deep rose silk many in the crowd doubted the dress and the design but nobody could deny that petunia looked beautiful she had decided not to wear a veil because the dress was enough as it was and she didntwant to look overboard the priest then began the ceremony nobody whispered comments about the dress no one made a sound throughout the time that vernon recited the vows the priest turned to petunia a n not quite sure about the way a service is conducted but i ve had a go petunia froze she glanced at vernon expectant face she then darted her eyes in the direction of her parents and gave them a look that plainly said i so sorry i have to do this rosalind and adam moved forward in their seats at seeing this but didntactually get up people were getting worried now petunia then looked at lily with a blank expression as if enduring an internal struggle between relief and regret her gaze changed of its own accord and to lily it was like they were speaking to her petunia grey eyes flitted to james and back to lily as if saying you re very lucky lily nodded and then nodded towards vernon the bride closed her eyes knowing she was seconds away from sealing her fate when she opened she spoke in a slow but steady voice i petunia grace evans take thee to be my wedded husband to have and to hold from this day forward for better and for worse for richer and for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish until death us do part according to god holy law and thereto i give thee my troth after the vows the priest announced to the hall that they were officially married and then came the customary kiss people clapped but the remaining evans winced not wanting to believe that petunia had actually gone through with this two days after the wedding adea had contacted lily jane and kayla to discuss her dress she didntelaborate much merely told them to apparate to her house that friday all three girls invited sat in the vast ladies living room that was part of the large victorian manor that adea lived in apart from lily kayla and jane sat two other women one of them was adea mother jessenia qureshi and the other woman they didntknow the first few minutes were spent by the lily filling her friends in about her sister wedding and the other two women conversing cheerfully in a language they didntknow usually people feel uncomfortable when this happened but the girls had frequented this house so often they were quite used to it and utterly at ease at that moment a few more minutes passed and a beautiful dark haired woman entered the room she was of average height her hair was dark but could clearly be distinguished as a dark brown her eyes were a caramel shade and had a warmth about them her skin tone was identical to adea and she looked in her twenties the girls could guess who this was but hadntactually met her before following this unexpected entrance came adea s she walked in smiling and hugged her friends everyone fell silent adea rose guys you know my mum obviously hello girls adea now gestured to the other woman with whom mrs qureshi had been conversing with this waqar mother shahira mohsin and this she pointed at the woman who had entered before her is my older sister rayna the girls smiled and then further analysed rayna she was indeed beautiful at first glance she easily came second to adea but on closer observation she seemed almost as beautiful her hair which had looked just brown was now obviously distinguishable as having an under layer of dark auburn her caramel eyes had appeared remarkable at first sight and were remarkable still her skin tone was identical to adea though with her dissimilar features it created a different effect the girls knew rayna was married and had a little girl she was seven years older than adea rayna smiled at them hi i sure i ve heard a lot about you i just wish i knew your names she said in a very jovial voice quite different to adea mysterious voice which sounded like a whisper but not quite adea had rolled her eyes at this comment the other girls had smiled fine if you re in a rush she pointed at her friends aapi aunty a n in south asian culture you call your parent friends aunty and uncle and you cantcall your older siblings by their name as a mark of respect so when adea says aapi she means rayna this is lily kayla and jane rayna spoke again i was right i have heard a lot about you girls how are you fine thank you the three chorused brightly right okay ladies the date been set for november 21st adea started in a very military style of talking what about january lily asked problems busy month etcetera etcetera etcetera adea explained vaguely before waving away the question that gives us less time to do all this we have to get the dress the shoes and the jewellery we have to get the invitations printed hire a cameraman and a photographer we need to choose a venue appoint caterers and decide when each event is going to take place in relation to the wedding date we have to hire a beautician the mehndi artist get the ubtan from god knows where and all the little things that crop up in between and we have approximately seven months to do this adea listed feverishly lily jane and kayla raised their eyebrows lily in particular was visualising the nightmares to arise in the near future hhhhmmmm why is it that helping out in planning a wedding seems so stressful all of a sudden today we get the dress planning out of the way if we plan we donthave to spend stressful hours in a stuffy shop hidden away god knows where probably abroad and frankly we have exams coming up and donthave time for it if we can get the dress planning out of the way we can move onto other things but i doubt it they were interrupted just then by the giggling of a three year old followed by adea younger twin brothers both aged eleven run liyana we re going to catch you then we ll feed you to that big old tree outside it getting hungry they said menacingly the little girl screamed and hid behind rayna mummy the little girl cried her mother smiled and soothingly said dontlisten to them darling its okay she seemed to find it rather amusing adea mrs qureshi and mrs mohsin however were not quite as pleased raheel diyari adea admonished the two boys turned their heads to face their sister they were both quite obviously rayna brothers though their hair was like adea and the pair were taller than adea who was only 5 3 what have i told you about scaring liyana she continued crossly she three for heaven sake if you scare her about trees now she might grow up to have a a tree phobia or something adea cried in frustration the two boys snickered slightly tree phobia adea really came a voice from behind trying hard to conceal laughter adea looked between her siblings fine fine if you want to pick on me then fine i ll be the bigger person here you two take her outside dontmake her cry and please try not to interrupt again she said calmly but the little girl liyana seemed to have changed her mind she had lighter skin than her mother and aunt green grey eyes and black hair which curled into ringlets she was slightly pudgy which added to her innocent very childlike appearance and she was a very pretty child she looked in curiosity at lily kayla and jane all of whom cooed at how cute she was who are you she asked boldly liyana ask politely her mother chided but the girls had just laughed who are they mummy she persisted she spoke well for a three year old this is lily kayla and jane rayna said they re adea khala friends a n your mother sister is referred to as your khala in urdu hindi the girl still stared at lily kayla and jane hello i liyana rizvi she said holding out her pudgy hand and shaking all of theirs in turn the girls beamed at the adorable child adea sighed before turning back to her brothers raheel diyari if you wouldntmind one of the two picked up their niece and hoisted her onto his shoulders mrs mohsin and mrs qureshi looked worried for a second but it passed you re very very naughty liyana said wagging her finger at the boy who hadntgot her on his shoulders diyari naughty are we i suppose naughty boys dontbuy their liyanas ice cream now do they diyari teased love you she brightly and the two boys laughed such a little madam she turning into mrs qureshi said fondly oh but she does breathe the life into this big house mrs mohsin laughed this house is hyperactive what with those two running around as well oh the things they get up to shahira said they could compete with the things adea and waqar used to do remember when yes thank you mother moving swiftly onwards adea cut in firmly this is why the girls loved coming over to the qureshis there wasnta moment in the house where somewhere something entertaining wasnttaking place and plus adea really became herself when she was with her family the next couple of hours were spent discussing the dress it wasnteasy the colours couldntbe too dark it not traditional to wear black adea no matter how nice it looks a soft gold was suggested but adea shot it down how am i supposed to enjoy myself if i sparkling the traditional red was too bright i want people to have a good time without being blinded dark blue was suggested but kayla disapproved adea i know your colours dark blue will be okay but it wontdo you justice silver seemed to be unanimously liked until jane was asked silver doesntseem your colour somehow she whispered after nearly three hours of getting basically nowhere the females decided to order in for lunch they ordered pizzas in a mass amount as adea assured her friends that raheel and diyari were known throughout the mohsin and qureshi families as the termites shahira walked up to the staircase and magically amplified her voice to shout lunch when the pizzas had arrived four pairs of feet could be heard trotting down the handsome cherry wood staircase one little pair two identical pairs and oddly enough one big pair liyana diyari raheel and waqar appeared in the dining room lily raised her eyebrows just how close are you guys the redhead whispered to her best friend adea smiled dad and uncle have been best friends since they were ten years old this whole atmosphere was kind of like their dream we both have big houses if one person goes the whole family goes mum and dad have the key to his house and his parents have the keys to ours waqar older brother and sister are both married and his sister has a little boy but they re all at work and the boy at a birthday party or they d be here they ll be here for dinner aapi took a day off she explained as the plates were handed out adea and rayna rose to fill the glasses with pumpkin juice they headed for the kitchen laughing at something or the other mrs qureshi cast worried looks their way and exchanged glances with shahira uh lily darling would you mind giving adea and rayna a hand with the glasses there are nine of us so if you split three glasses between each of you it d make things easier she said lily smiled sure mrs qureshi no problem wonder why she wants me to help they both have their wands oh well it ridiculous lily heard a voice cry from the kitchen she froze and didntenter the voice had sounded like rayna s aapi this matter is not going to be discussed adea said coolly adea this isntsomething you can shut out it has to be discussed rayna snapped the setting down of glasses could be heard fine you want to discuss it then fine go ahead what is so important adea said calmly though there was a hint of something else there hat lily hadntheard before you re too young to be married can you just accept that you ll be married at eighteen rayna cried again well the fact is that i have accepted it adea replied are you okay with this rayna asked incredulously i wasnthappy with this rayna cut her younger sister off mid sentence ha see why dontyou tell them they promised you off at fifteen and now they re planning your wedding she said angrily adea sighed you re right they did promise me off at fifteen meaning i ve had three years to get over it and i have yes i was furious when it happened but i said okay because it was my fate we always knew this was going to happen me and waqar if i didntsay yes then i would ve said it later on and what the point she said reasonably lily decided that now would be a good time to step in though when she did neither sister took notice you shouldnthave to be obliged to fulfil dad and uncle dream the older sister shouted you re right again i shouldntbut can you think of anyone who could be better for this no but still i was twenty one when i got married and this time adea cut rayna off as she hastily levitated three glasses and said and i not you she left and on passing lily she added take three glasses rayna jumped and looked at lily in surprise lily was at a loss as to whose side she should take adea is your best friend it your duty to side with her but i know exactly how rayna feels she feels exactly the way i did about petunia rayna spoke up i was only trying to help she said lily lowered her gaze i know she shouldnthave to do this i understand lily said she too young she is she could ve at least listened to me rayna said exasperatedly she should ve listened to you lily replied rayna sat on one of the chairs tucked underneath the breakfast table i only want what best for her she so delicate i dontwant her to get hurt sometimes i suppose i get a little overprotective and that doesntdo her any good lily looked up now i know you only want what best for her but she isntdelicate she one of the strongest people i know lily said defending her best friend rayna smiled bittersweetly there are things about adea you dontknow she very strong and i very proud of her for that but then there times when she can be so delicate you wontbelieve she the same person rayna said lily was confused but decided to leave it for later i know how you feel lily said sympathetically do you rayna asked lily nodded unfortunately my sister just got married to a guy she doesntlove she only married for the life he can give her i tried talking her out of it so many times but she just refused to listen lily elaborated so you do know how i feel rayna conceded i just dontwant her to ruin her life without knowing i rayna said lily smiled i wish my sister was like you rayna laughed and then continued she so special i mean she very vulnerable tell me how does she treat people at school rayna asked who you mean kayla jane and me no no i mean the other students lily stared at rayna in a bewildered manner other students hasntshe told you lily asked told me what the other students dontknow who she is i mean they know of her but they dontactually know her to hogwarts adea qureshi is like the stuff of myths the girl everyone knows but can never see she concealed herself in such a way that no one notices her i can be talking to someone and she ll stand right there next to me but no one ever sees her lily said does she cast a spell no that the thing though she doesntuse magic at all she spent all of first year hiding hiding everywhere in lessons she sat in the darkest corner she always skipped flying lessons at meals she took food before everyone else and rushed up to the dormitory she even tried to take hide from jane and kayla if i hadntconvinced her anyway it funny really everyone in our year thinks she like a ghost or something every year she hides for the first week waiting for the rumour about her to be spread it all in the power of suggestion you see the power of suggestion rayna repeated questioningly lily set about explaining in the magical world it easier because we know there are such things as ghosts and magic and witches so myths are easier believed the students think it impossible to see adea qureshi so even when she right there no one bothers to think it might be her because you just cantsee adea qureshi rayna filled in exactly wow rayna said clearly impressed at her sister way of thinking right what happens when someone sets about trying to find her that when the problems start she hides again waqar walked in just then hey people want their drinks liyana going to throw a tantrum any second now sorry the two chorused and followed him back into the dining room adea was still clearly angry as she d taken rayna seat next to her mother because she knew that she couldntbe bothered in that position rayna had no choice but to take the seat next to lily this gave her a chance to ask the redhead more questions about her sister school life so has anyone ever seen her rayna asked lily took a bite of pizza and swallowed quickly before replying two people the first was kayla little sister gabrielle but the only reason she saw adea was because she saw her on the first day on the train so she didntreally know about the whole deal lily said and took another bite and the second lily smiled at this the second was james potter i think that james never believed all the guff about adea he just noticed her one day at dinner lily said proudly rayna looked suspicious but amused all the same why are you so happy all of a sudden she teased lily laughed and said he my boyfriend rayna smiled knowingly so has anyone else ever seen her rayna asked lily thought for a second not exactly but they have come very close it was kayla boyfriend he heard her singing one night she ran away before he tried to put two and two together but he saw her books he couldntread the name but he took a guess lily said grimly then what happened well waqar covered for her remus kept trying to find her though one day waqar told him to drop it and that was that i know you re not happy about this but he really is the best guy for her lily said rayna was quiet for a few minutes i know but she finished her sentence with a sigh lily voiced a thought that had been plaguing her mind for years why does she want to be invisible she says it because she was bullied in junior school but i dontget it it been seven years and even if it was just bullying why cantshe tell james it not like he ll lily stopped when she realised that rayna had become strangely quiet what what is it lily asked she stared at the young mother for a few minutes before it dawned on her it not bullying is it it something else dontask questions about that you ll have to wait until adea ready on the opposite end of the table mrs qureshi and mrs mohsin were still discussing colours for the dress we cantseem to agree on anything waqar sat quietly not listening to a word just eating his lunch when the women turned to him what do you recommend waqar they asked all the other girls became quiet to hear his reply he looked up huh she your bride any particular you d like to see her in waqar looked around for clues and said the first thing that came into his head green he thought fast think of a girly colour think of a girly colour or uh pink the girls and women looked around at each other that interesting we hadntthought about those yet jessenia mrs qureshi mused okay ladies ten minutes to finish your lunch and then it back to the drawing board adea announced liyana felt her plate and walked around the long table to her mother mummy i dontwant anymore she whined rayna glanced at her daughter plate and back with a stern face no finish your lunch but mummy i dontwant to liyana what did i say rayna said the little girl eyes started to well up when lily jumped in liyana do you know why you have to eat all your food lily asked the child who in turn shook her head lily smiled and said because if you finish your food then you ll grow up to be really really pretty liyana eyes widened will i be as pretty as you she asked excitedly lily stared at her she d never felt so flattered the little girl eyes shone with hope and lily laughed come here she hugged liyana you ll be way prettier than me if you finish your food okay and liyana ran back to her seat and resumed eating she adorable lily said to rayna who smiled thank you you re very good with kids lily shrugged and replied who does she look like i mean she very different to you she entirely her father adea likes to think liyana hair colour came from her but the hair her father as well she is beautiful isntshe she asked with a hint of pride absolutely the red head answered rayna smiled like only a mother could and suddenly her resemblance to adea was remarkable you and adea are quite different as well lily commented casually i suppose she looks like our aunt spitting image i more of a mix of mum and dad i guess though at times people say we have a slight trace of each other in our expressions i can see that alright time to go everyone adea said at those words six people left the table to return to the ladies room once there they took their seats and resumed their conference right okay any more colours you d like to suggest adea asked well i thought we should discuss the ones waqar suggested mrs mohsin inserted i thought they were good ideas everyone else nodded in agreement adea inwardly rolled her eyes and yet he had no clue what he was on about the idiot i suppose let start with green mrs qureshi said i ve never really tried green adea said hesitantly yeah it always been thought lily colour so we never really kayla trailed off lily was in thought though now you mention it i think you d look good in green she said slowly mint jane said languorously everyone stared at her i sorry shahira mrs mohsin asked jane looked around in confusion and then realised that she must ve voiced her thoughts oh i was thinking that adea would look really nice in mint green they all fell silent each imagining adea in mint green perfect jessenia whispered the others started to smile as well perfect what a mind this child has i would have never even considered that but she absolutely right adea mother continued in her praise of jane choice what about the pink rayna questioned oh adea looks gorgeous in any shade of pink i ll vouch for that kayla said lily agreed with an eager nod of the head on my side of the family we ve all worn pink the red comes from her father side pink is tradition jessenia finished mrs mohsin looked unsure oh but she would look lovely in the mint green but then again the same goes for pink i know came adea rational voice mm aunty when you go shopping for the dress look out for pink and green dresses find a final candidate for both colours and pick the best one just remember aunty the final decision is yours adea concluded lily and kayla looked confused so are we all decided adea asked yes the other five chorused lily jane and kayla looked at each other and lily spoke up well we should be going the three rose and adea followed them out once they were in the entrance hall adea smiled at her friends hey why dontyou guys stay for dinner then you can meet the rest of this this well pack i guess it loads of fun she offered the girls laughed i wish i could you know i love it here but i ve left sirius alone at home god knows what he could do to my poor flat jane shuddered and james went golfing with my dad today there no telling what mum might tell him about me adea smiled sympathetically perfectly valid reasons you re excused she then turned to kayla what about you i d love to it d be nice to get away from my own madhouse and get acquainted with a new one my mum not in so i can probably stay the night kayla said that d be so much fun great i ll send gabby a note bye guys she waved to lily and jane and bounded up the cherry wood staircase okay you two enjoy the rest of the holiday dontforget to owl me and take care oh and tell james hi adea hugged both of her friends oh and stay safe and do some revision and be happy and and lily held up a hand okay mother we ll be fine she assured adea sighed of course you will well okay then bye and with that jane and lily disapparated with a pop and a whistle i home lily called i up here james replied from somewhere upstairs lily went up to the guest room where he was lying on the bed reading a quidditch magazine lilly gave him a small kiss how was golf she asked it was great i had fun good listen yeah my parents have invited us over for dinner tonight if that okay he said lily smiled brightly i think that d be brilliant i d better ask mum and dad though i ll go with you i was getting bored reading this anyway they headed downstairs where adam was watching a football match and rosalind was pottering around the kitchen mum dad lily said rosalind walked into the living room as well yes lily they prompted mr and mrs potter have invited us over for dinner tonight may i go she asked mr evans raised his eyebrows just dinner yes sir that it they just want to meet lily james explained rosalind and adam exchanged glances and nodded sure i dontsee why not lily hugged her parents thank you oh no what should i wear she said rosalind laughed and steered her daughter out of the room while saying come i will show you the art of dressing to impress your boyfriend parents they walked on james and adam were left the older man cleared his throat james i need to talk to you take a seat james widened his eyes oh god here it is the moment i ve had nightmares about ever since lily invited me he sat down and tried his absolute best not to look too nervous yes mr evans i know this sounds frightening i dontwant to have to do this especially for you anymore than you want to listen but well after seeing how petunia chose i have to say it petunia thrown her life away i ll admit when i became a father i promised myself i would do everything possible to keep my girls happy i tried but it too late for petunia i dontwant lily to repeat her sister mistake i dontwant to have to be an onlooker to that again do you have any idea how it feels to have failed in something so important that you dontthink you ll ever breathe in the same way again the difference here is that i know lily happy with you she always been my happy go lucky child and now she with you she even more so i dontwant to see that change i dontwant to ever see her upset i like you i want to carry on liking you but if i hear that something should happen to lily i promise sir i ll do everything possible to keep her happy and safe james said firmly adam nodded vaguely and stared out of the window in you two i see a little bit of rosalind and myself if you two got engaged tomorrow i d give you my blessing because i know that it would be a well thought out decision you ve both got a good mind on you it sense and sensibility really have you ever read that james shook his head well lily sensibility so i suppose that leaves you with sense james now looked at adam in disbelief who laughed at this yes lily told me you re quite the prankster but i know you ve got good sense in there somewhere he paused to allow james a minute to think sense me yep adam lost it let think just remember that sense and sensibility are two completely different things but lily has both does she was it sense when she had a breakdown about the exams no not exactly but wasntyour method of calming her down sense i suppose was it sense at halloween when she tried to do everything herself of course not but was it sense when you stopped sirius prank and saved snape from getting bitten by remus i guess and wasntit sense when you made friends with adea it was sense wasntit it was indeed i think you re right i mean adam right i sense and lily sensibility bang on you re right i never realised it james said sometimes though we strive to become men we dontparticularly like admitting that somewhere along the lines we grew up as well adam said wisely right again james laughed adam smiled and with a tone of finality look james all i asking is for you to look after our lily james nodded i ve already given you my word i cantgive you much else you ll have to trust us jane had arrived in her bedroom and after taking a quick shower she was going to start the salad in her bathrobe once the salad was done she planned to change into some clothes after all how long does it take to make a salad she walked into the kitchen and began taking the vegetables from the fridge when sirius walked out of his temporary room and froze at the sight of jane her just a little too small bathrobe quite obviously left her legs rather exposed this was something sirius was not accustomed to seeing jane wasntinto mini skirts she usually wore long flowing skirts or occasionally trousers it wasntthat she minded showing her legs it was just that the clothes she preferred just didn t and in their more amorous meetings she always made sure that they didntget too carried away namely before the skirt came off j jane sirius said shakily his eyes glued to her body oh hello what the matter jane said abstractly she looked at her attire and rolled here eyes oh sirius dontbe ridiculous sirius didntanswer shit those legs are long and damn it why has she got that bathrobe tied so tightly i mean really what the point well a so that it doesntcome undone and make your head explode and b to torture you yes i can see that dontyou want to change into something else it d be more comfortable sirius proposed no i don t what are you going to do she whispered sinisterly well i am trying to control myself but it isntworking so go change sirius ordered are you telling me what to do no ma am jane smiled smugly good because i d like to remind you that this is my home sometimes i like to make the salad in my bathrobe and you ll have to get used to that because if you dontthen i ll do it again tomorrow oh and by the way i up here not down there jane said just then a voice came from the fireplace sirius sirius dear it me came a woman voice sirius froze for a second time and then winced crap not now jane change into something decent jane give him a look in response making sirius sigh and lead her over to the source of the voice hello anita sirius said kindly she had brown hair and hazel eyes sirius continued jane this is my pseudo mother anita potter anita this is my girlfriend jane swales mrs potter smiled brightly at jane who knelt down so sorry you had to see me like this i ve just come out of the shower you see no problem dear i just hope you werentbusy mrs potter said eyeing the pair of them not at all actually you called in the middle of an argument with a lot of potential jane said mistily lucky i called when i did then the older woman laughed and sirius laughed too albeit nervously so what brings you here sirius asked oh i was wondering if you two would like to join us for dinner i ve invited james and his lily as well sirius looked at jane who nodded and turned to the head perfect timing i was just going to start the salad when you came brilliant then it settled definitely sirius said half seven it is then mrs potter said jovially and then looked at the clock that gives you an hour by the way jane lovely place you have here thank you that so kind jane replied mrs potter head then smiled and disappeared jane stood guiltily for a second and then looked up at sirius sorry she said if i d known i would ve listened to you sirius laughed at her change in stance it doesntreally matter he said suddenly he crushed his lips onto hers jane struggled at first and then pushed him away sirius you know i hate it when you do that at least give me some warning sorry i had to sirius said jane smiled and walked off into her room to change the next hour was spent getting ready for dinner they sat in their rooms quietly preparing jane had decided to stray away from her usual ways for one night for sirius sake she knew mrs potter meant a lot to him she also knew that lily was the perfect girlfriend and the potters would simply love her and so she had to at least make an effort even if it killed her at quarter past seven both jane and sirius walked out of their rooms sirius was wearing some navy blue robes when he saw jane his jaw dropped her hair did not look like it normally did it was down curls and it was dark brown with very dark purple streaks she wore flat shoes light make up and white dress robes giving her an almost angelic appearance wow sirius whispered jane looked incredibly uncomfortable is it okay she asked with a hint of resentment i got rid of almost all the colour just for tonight sirius nodded you look amazing yeah well might as well make a good impression but just so you know i dying over here jane huffed well i do appreciate it if that any consolation he replied handing her a pinch of floo powder to jane ladies first she threw the powder into the flames stepped into the fire and said clearly potter manor a n not the most creative name i know she landed gracefully in a large entrance hall with marble flooring sirius immediately followed and landed next to her this was one of those rare occasions when sirius actually looked nervous jane ran a hand through his hair and looked at him with eyes that teemed with reassurance and support ugh god i hate flooing came a familiar voice jane and sirius turned to see a redhead in front of the fireplace dusting herself off a second later a raven haired boy followed in a rather more dignified way than his date jane and sirius smiled hey lily and james jumped and then smiled back at seeing who it was hey i didntknow you two were coming that great lily exclaimed she d worn her hair down and was in pastel green dress robes while james had opted for maroon james and sirius grinned and exchanged a manly handshake while the girls hugged you look great jane lily said same goes for you jane countered jaaaaames shouted a voice the girls turned to find a little girl running towards james with her arms outstretched she looked about four had black hair like james and blue eyes james laughed and spun the girl round who giggled the girl now turned to sirius who knelt down so that the child could give him a kiss on the cheek siri she cried in delight and laughed as sirius picked her up chucked her in the air and caught her again lily jane this is our little sister allegra james said beaming proudly both girls noticed the usage of our but thought it sweet and didntenquire further allegra smiled at the two girls and then ran up to them hugging lily first who was taken by surprise but laughed and hugged the little girl back aaaaawwww hello i lily she said allegra now turned to jane and hugged her as well jane looked bewildered but in a good way as she hugged her too i jane arentyou pretty allegra looked at her brother and back and said thank you quietly as if she had suddenly become very shy sorry she hasnthad the dontbe friendly to strangers talk yet sirius explained as he picked up allegra again lily laughed and said oh dontbe silly she adorable i can see why you re so proud of her james allegra looked confused siri arentyou proud of me as well she asked of course i am arenti jane he said yes you are jane said firmly both of your brothers are very proud of you allegra she finished oh sorry came an older voice i took forever getting ready and supervising the elves and what not well it doesntmatter said anita potter she looked at her two sons sirius very nice james dear you look very handsome but couldntyou do something about your hair it your father fault that what it is how are you dears and i dontbelieve we ve been properly introduced she said this all very fast in one breath mum this is lily evans lily this is my mum james introduced good evening mrs potter lily said politely mrs potter stared at lily as if remembering something look at you just look at you arentyou just oh she gasped and hugged lily tightly who smiled mrs potter turned to jane and stared at her brightly and you oh my goodness i didntrealise how stunningly beautiful you are she praised both of you you re both so beautiful she breathed she then guided them into the dining room a few minutes later a tall man with glasses walked into the room and smiled brightly at all of them hello i see you ve all arrived safely sorry i a little late he apologised mrs potter looked at the man fondly girls this is my husband joseph joseph this is lily james girlfriend and this jane sirius girlfriend joseph nodded to both girls and said splendid as soon as he sat down at the head of the table the house elves entered carrying the starter course at the qureshi house adea and kayla were having fun with all of the manor other occupants on top of the nine people present in the house during the afternoon mr mohsin mr qureshi rayna husband jauhar waqar brother haaziq and his wife and kid and waqar sister inaya and her husband and kids had joined the party as well it was definitely enjoyable there was a lot of commotion noise and laughter the sound of children chuckling and squealing as they ran around the house the shouting and cheering of the two mohsin boys and inaya husband as they played video games the giggling of adea rayna kayla inaya and eilyah haaziq wife waqar sister in law and the chattering of the women kayla walked into the kitchen to refill her glass she saw waqar sitting quietly at the breakfast table she filled her glass with pumpkin juice and sat opposite penny for your thoughts she said he looked up at her oh hi i haventtalked to you properly in ages what up just thinking he said solemnly i d never have guessed kayla quipped waqar gave her a look okay sorry what the matter she asked maybe i worrying too much why dontyou let me be the judge of that kayla replied wisely it just this whole business i dontknow if adea is ready to be married yet waqar said oh but she is she really looking forward to it and getting into the planning everything kayla cried defensively maybe but is she looking forward to the wedding or getting married he challenged kayla thought about this and quite frankly she didnthave an answer for him he right i mean in all of adea excitement about the wedding she hasntsaid anything about the marriage i mean she hasntthought about where she going to live or anything yet i positive she ready to be married she ll be the perfect wife the way she always tidying the room and making sure that we dontleave too long until we write home and stuff she needs to be married she needs someone she can fall back on without worrying if they ll fall under the pressure that a very good question and to be honest i couldnttell you but i know one thing adea really cares about you and she d be a terrific wife i dontknow if she registered the fact that she going to be married but when it does hit her i know she ll take in stride and rise to the challenge spectacularly adea always been careful about the things she gets herself into she never impulsive about her decisions and this should be no different kayla finished you re probably right i ve known adea for eighteen years she not stupid she ll have thought about this thanks kayla he smiled gratefully kayla shrugged any time back at the potter residence the evening was progressing magnificently lily and jane were enjoying a wonderful dinner in good company there was plenty of entertainment provided by james sirius and mr potter their jokes and imitations had the girls in constant laughter as the main course was served mrs potter started a slightly more serious conversation so lily you re head girl arentyou she asked i am what that like stressful lily replied mrs potter laughed but lily shook her head no but seriously it very interesting i mean i ve learned more this year than all the others put together to see how students think when you re a third year say and you re lurking out after curfew you feel so good about yourself but when you re head girl and you re lurking out after curfew its just annoying lily explained and james laughed at the memory of some of their more frustrating late night rounds though i imagine it a very good opportunity mrs potter commented oh definitely you know it really teaches you how to handle stress and responsibilities it also helps with time management skills and people skills as well mrs potter nodded sounds like you really enjoy it though it must annoy you that it takes up so much of your free time it fun but you re absolutely right i mean sometimes i feel like giving it up it takes up so much of my free time especially since i get so little help from my counterpart lily said pointedly james looked up and swallowed a big mouthful oh are you talking about me sirius snorted and james kicked him hard well i help out sometimes but lily just plain better at the being authority deal you should feel lucky miss evans i dontpay compliments like that easily he said conceitedly lily shook her head despairingly what am i going to do with you she groaned mrs potter patted her on the shoulder it okay dear i ve asked myself the same question for the past eighteen years jane laughed aloud what do you plan to do after school lily joseph asked i d like to be a healer lily answered the potters looked impressed and james grinned proudly wow it takes a lot of will and a lot of newts it does but it ll pay off in the end lily replied good naturedly the potters now turned to jane and you jane jane looked at them with her silver eyes as though she was surprised at being addressed i ve been thinking that i d like to work for the committee on experimental charms she replied abstractly joseph and anita stared at her for a second letting her faraway voice float around until the words spoken had fully registered in their minds they blinked and looked intrigued fascinating tell me what attracted you to that field joseph asked in an amazed tone of voice jane eyes glazed over as she replied the possibility of discovering new spells to further benefit our world building the steps for the magic of tomorrow and the development of new spells and incantations and research mr and mrs potter looked clearly impressed again so do you and lily see a lot of each other at school or are you just acquainted through james and sirius jane and lily exchanged confused glances well not exactly we re best friends i mean there are fo three of us we ve known each other since first year and until i got my own room we shared a dormitory too lily elaborated anita looked surprised oh well that even better you must have a lot of fun she said jane nodded we do especially since remus and kayla are going out as well joseph laughed attack the whole pack did you he teased you could say that kayla liked remus for ages and vice versa but these two were the only ones who didntfall for the natural charm in fact for the first time we fell before they did sirius said jane and lily smiled seven years of pursuit and rejection james said reminiscently good times he sighed sirius thought back as well wasntthat bad for me three months but painful months they were he said dramatically anita looked at the girls well i have to congratulate you two you ve finally taught my boys how to respect the opposite sex thank you but it wasnteasy especially for jane when she had to say no to sirius lily said sirius looked confused after the main course it was time for dessert to be served after that was the departure of james lily sirius and jane thank you for a lovely evening mrs potter i really enjoyed it lily said sincerely mrs potter beamed my pleasure come over again wontyou james hugged his mum who quickly whispered hold onto her james or else i ll kill you he laughed quietly and then disapparated with his girlfriend jane now stepped up dinner was delicious thank you so much for having us no problem it was a delight to have you look after yourself dear and do come round again donthesitate just come anytime you want jane hugged the woman and waited for sirius sirius hugged mrs potter like jane had done and mrs potter whispered to him as well i really like her sirius and she perfect for you look after her sirius nodded and then he and jane disapparated as well when they were back at jane flat sirius held jane arm before she could go to her room wait just one second i need to ask you a question he said jane twisted her captured arm around into a position that caused sirius immense pain once he d let go she said ask away sirius shook his arm and continued why was it hard for you to say no to me i was under the impression that up until christmas you just didntlike me he said jane smiled why are all males so clueless i liked you at the same point that you started liking me the night in the kitchens she put her shoes away sirius trailed after her why didntyou ask me out so that your ego could become even larger dontthink so jane said and made her streaks more defined what about when i dumped fonseca he cried i was supposed to say yes after what you did to that poor girl besides you couldnteven promise me that you wouldntdump me after a week the kiss at halloween couldnthave showed something there jane shook her head i ve told you i hate it when you do that all that time you didntsay a thing sirius said indignantly because i dontgo out with guys who cantrespect me it was only in mid november that you started to do that and by december i had you with respect for the female population and by that time i was in love jane said simply though it d been harder than it sounded she walked on when sirius voice called out you re surreal did you know that jane looked in thought i ve heard extraordinary eccentric spooky freaky brilliant clever abnormal psychopathic ugly ghostly even maybe somewhere along the lines i ve heard surreal as well cantquite recall she said sirius stared you ve managed to do what people thought literally possible i guess jane shrugged now sirius looked thoughtful if i dumped you i could return to my old ways and be even more successful if it possible which it apparently is sirius said conspiratorially you could and you would jane replied i wouldnteven have to wait a week just chuck them after two days you could indeed of course i d have to get rid of you first he said jane inhaled deeply and said indeed you would and started to walk back to her room a hand grabbed hold of her wrist let me go sirius wouldntwant to ruin your fantasies after all i imagine it harder with your girlfriend in the room she snapped oh come on jane it was just a joke i all for jokes but i didntfind this one quite so funny sirius now held her in his arms but jane soon made sure there were an arm length apart you didntlet me finish so i d dump you and then date every girl in school and be extremely miserable because i wouldnthave you anymore then one day i d come crawling back and beg you to take me back then we d pick up where we left off he whispered and drew her closer jane shook her head and took a step back again no no let me finish so you d come crawling back and beg me to take you back and i d say no because i not an idiot and you could carry on being miserable jane said pleasantly sirius nodded you re right that is what d happen jane nodded but sirius shrugged or i d not dump you in the first place and we could continue in bliss possible but who to say i d keep you and who to say it would be bliss jane challenged sirius sighed well it seems we ve reached a fork so which path are we going to take he asked jane raised her eyebrows we excuse me but i was under the impression that each of these paths differed by varying final decisions made by me so which path are you going to take jane stared at sirius and the leaned forwards to give him a teasing kiss i ll tell you at breakfast goodnight she said and walked into her room sirius stared at her door for a second before shaking his head and walking into his own it was almost two in the morningand yet lily evans found herself unable to sleep she crept downstairs to find the fire alight and figure silhouetted against it james the raven haired boy turned oh lily hey couldntsleep either no they sat together for a while in silence i bored james said suddenly okay let play something exploding snap chess no and no something normal lily said they are normal i mean something muggle ah you mean something abnormal okay lily rolled here eyes at this i know i used to play this with my neighbour it like what if we were married no that a girly game james whinged james it fun she protested just out of curiosity your neighbour was a guy right james asked lily shoved him be serious james stared at her it a game would you like to look game up in the dictionary he said i ll stop talking to you she threatened okay i ll be serious well we d buy a house in a small village lily started now why would we do that i want to live in a big city james resisted then you can live without me alright but you need to loosen up after a year we ll have a baby a boy first definitely and we ll call him elijah lily said we ll do no such thing he cried philip no charles are you insane harry lily tried james shook his head harry sounds like something you d call your rabbit lily blinked and looked at him crossly harry was my grandfather name james eyes widened and he laughed nervously harry it is then i ll be able to teach him quidditch and everything lily nodded yes but not until he six james stared open mouthed three he exclaimed five four done they shook on it after that we ll have a little girl lily planned and i ll name her because you named harry fine what about pia mmmmm no mary no joanne no azalea had enough of flowers thank you very much what about ariella what kind of name is that lily asked one that sounds nice james replied ariella potter yeah okay james sighed in relief she ll be the prettiest little girl ever lily said dreamily of course she will she ll have you for a mother james said lily smiled our beautiful ariella she said james laughed it did sound nice and if a guy ever dares to talk to her then i ll cut him up into little pieces and feed those pieces to an acromantula he said lily giggled lils we ll have four kids keep the house alive james said lily mulled it over okay what about us she asked well what will we do always stay together share a world and explore it side by side james said confidently i ll be behind you one hundred percent me too we ll make every decision together if i ever make one without you you can kick me out the bedroom james proposed rest assured i will lily said we ll never keep secrets from each other james promised do we keep them now lily asked do you maybe and you maybe okay well all will be revealed right here right now lily nodded gestured for james to start in first year i d put on my invisibility cloak and sit next to you in the common room just so i could hear you laugh he admitted lily looked shocked you listened to my conversations no now it was lily turn well in second year i had a crush on remus what calm down it was only for like a month lily assured james seemed to be comforted by that i still hex snape sometimes if being head boy hasntstraightened you out then whatever her tone of voice made james insides squirm with guilt i was going to say yes to you once i got fed up of your stupid badgering fourth year lily said why did you say no i remembered that i really didntlike you james laughed i kissed kayla once in a game of truth or dare for 30 seconds in sixth year you d gone to bed lily didntknow how to react to that feel anything she asked well she a pretty good kisser lily felt insecure james gave her a kiss to which she consented just so that james wouldntthink kayla better when they broke away lily stared expectantly it was nothing compared to that it wasntanything at all just a dare lily nodded i think i was always rather flattered that you like me so much that no matter what someone always thought me chase worthy james smiled okay you know this whole year i sort of got adea to help me win you over why did you go to all that trouble you could ve had anyone you see the trouble with me is that i always want what i cant get aaaaawwww so sweet lily said kissing him you know at valentine day when i ran out of the three broomsticks i was really jealous of dulcie fairbairn but i convinced myself i wasn t lily said shyly james shrugged it okay lily do you have anything else to confess james said asked nervously lily shook her head okay this is really big dontget too angry because your parents are sleeping james reminded lily eyed him suspiciously i ll be angry she repeated questioningly james nodded how angry she enquired james glanced at her red hair and thought back to previous experiences very angry he said decisively furious james shook his head livid lily dragged him into the dinning room and then cast a silencing charm on the room and locked the doors her eyes had already started to flash threateningly talk she ordered and folded her arms james was slightly unnerved by his girlfriend demeanour um i you see it all he started feverishly lily stared at him james led her over to a chair and sat her down maybe you should just watch he said lily narrowed her eyes james placed his glasses on the table and within a second was gone in his place stood a majestic stag its coat was a tan colour and it stared at lily with black eyes lily gasped james she whispered the stag moved its head oh my god she mouthed her hand flew to her mouth after a second she hesitantly reached out her hand and slowly stroked its nose she then ran her hand along its back and patted it she tentatively touched its antlers and drew back her hand and stared again why i you she started but she was rendered speechless in another instant james reappeared in human form and put his glasses back on you you re an animagus lily stated you are an animagus she repeated slowly and turned to him well that something isntit you know the ministry would love this especially since you managed it as a student i dontthink anyone done that i sure professor mcgonagall doesntknow james inserted lily looked puzzled oh so professor dumbledore james filled in again now lily was really confused but then how james stopped her again i unregistered he whispered lily released a short breath what she yelled james winced are you insane do you know that illegal illegal meaning it not allowed do you know howdangerous this is do you she shouted gesticulating wildly i uh james started if someone found out then oh my god do you know the dangers of becoming animagi without supervision or did you get a transfiguration newt without telling anyone and oh my god when did you become an animagus she asked fifth year he said quietly lily screamed do you know it illegal to becomeananimagi before the age of seventeen so not only are you unregistered but you became one when you were sixteen that breaking the law twice in one go if someone told the ministry you d be sent to azkaban does that mean anything to you lily fumed and shoved her boyfriend let me explain there a reason i swear lily folded her arms oh there a reason well this must be some reason go on james what was so important that you risked a jail sentence for it she shouted remus james answered promptly oh remus fault is it it always remus poor guy you always blame everything on him dontyou well let hear it then how are you going to make this onehis fault lily said james took a deep breath and tried to find the words he needed it not anyone fault look he was bitten as a child he was isolated from other children for seven years he couldnteven remember what it felt like to laugh with other kids until he came to hogwarts he didntknow friends until we became those to him even then hefelt lonely when transforming because no one really knew him he was so frightened to tell us but we figured it out we wanted to make it so that he d never feel lonely again we cantkeep him company at full moons as humans so we decided to become animagi but we couldnttell anyone because technically speaking it dangerous to hang out with a werewolf even if it is in animal form james finished lily stared yet again so once a month you go gallivanting around with a werewolf i ll say it again are you insane what if something happens she asked well i a stag and sirius becomes a huge bear of a dog so we can keep remus somewhat under control he said lily looked at him disbelievingly somewhat somewhat that not enough james pranks hexes detentions missed deadlines bunked lessons but this this has got to be the stupidest thing you ve ever done she looked james who stood looking completely ashamed and she felt guilty but it also one of the sweetest things i ve ever heard she relented grudgingly lily stood up on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek a kiss from the fair lady to the gallant knight james joked lily laughed and punched his arm she looked up and scrunched her nose why are you so tall lily asked referring to the eight inches between her 5 5 and his 6 1 james grinned i think the real question is why are you so short i not short i average height lily answered no lily you re just short james aid bluntly he moved his face closer to hers and whispered titch lily gasped theatrically take that back uh uh i am going to call you titch from now on titch he teased oh that it she said transfiguring all the plates into cushions shegrabbed one and threw it at him james was hit in the face by said cushion which made him grab another one and chase her around the table lily squealed and the two blissfully forgot their worries for the time being the following morning remus had decided to make a surprise visit to his girlfriend house peter had been round a few times and it had been fun but without all four of them together it wasntthe same james and sirius had duties this holidays to their girlfriend and remus was courteous enough to leave them alone but remember their current locations made him want to see his own wonderful girlfriend whose house he had never frequented though he knew where it was so that morning he rose early having previously taken permission from his parents for a visit had breakfast thinking about his impending journey and it destination he had never met kayla parents and only ever seen photos of them and even then not very many she never really talked about them just mentioned them in passing normally he had never felt that she deliberately avoided the subject just that she d never really thought it necessary which to be honest it hadntbeen until then he knew that if this visit was planned he would ve received a full briefing but it wasntand he hadntso he wondered what they would be like would her mother look just like her would her father be overprotective and intimidating like kayla or would her mother be the dynamic and unpredictable character that her daughter was and her father the meek wise one like remus himself in this relationship what about her other sister and brother would they be nice would they be terrors would they hate him would he be given the talk all these questions swarmed around in his head as he chewed on his toast once he d had breakfast it was time for him to be setting off to the simmons house he took a pinch of floo powder and threw it in the fireplace with a deep breath he shouted 64 langley drive and steeped in to be whisked away by the green flames which encompassed him he span and span faster and faster until he really did feel that he would vomit when suddenly the obnoxious feeling ceased and he was hurled onto solid hard ground he opened his eyes and looked around his surroundings were that of a warm inviting living room normal sized he looked back at the fire which he had inhabited briefly not so long ago and saw that it now contained a cosy looking fire with flames that gently licked the sides of the grate the mantel shelf above it contained several pictures of children running around and playing and laughing two of them remus recognised to be kayla and gabrielle the other two he did not know one that struck him particularly as it was placed in the most elaborate picture frame was of four children all climbing on top of a man who must ve been mrs simmons mr simmons was hunched over and was wincing laughingly as his children wreaked havoc and a woman stood in the background throwing her head back and laughing prettily a sound of footsteps storming down what was obviously a staircase could be heard remus turned around immediately and the temporarily forgotten fact that no one knew of his visit came flying back to him who here called a suspicious gabrielle from the corridor it me gabrielle came into the living room and sighed with relief oh okay hey remus how are wait what are you doing here kayla didnttell me you were coming over no it supposed to be a surprise how did you hear me i wasntbeing that loud i have good hearing i ll admit runs in the family i heard rustling and a slight clattering of photo frames she said hang on a second she walked over to the staircase and yelled kayla you might want to come downstairs but no answer came gabrielle furrowed her eyebrows hhhmmm alethea still no reply spencer finally a voice called down in response yes gabby remus meanwhile was thinking about these siblings kayla gabrielle alethea and spencer the first two arentfunny and even spencer but alethea nice though he shook his head and tuned back in spence where are kayla and alethea gabrielle asked alethea in the attic and kayla says she ll be working until 10 00 come rain or shine and not a thing in the world will get her out before then the young voice answered alright thank you gabby shouted back well there you go mystery solved wait here i ll fix you something you wonthave to wait long she said glancing at the clock where your mother gabrielle rolled her eyes fondly oh mum she works for the department of international magical co operation travels a lot taught us how to manage she coming back next week gabrielle disappeared off down the corridor abruptly a few minutes later a little boy and a slightly older girl appeared in the room remus smiled at them both the little boy grinned back one of his canines was missing and the girl smiled with her eyes rather than her mouth hello spencer simmons the boy stuck out his hand politely for remus to shake remus lupin dontmind kayla she ll be down soon the boy said importantly remus smiled again how old are you six mr lupin remus if you dontmind alright i ll go help gabrielle remus looked after him with a bizarre expression and looked back to who must ve obviously been alethea simmons oh never mind him she said in a quiet voice and sat down opposite her guest mum out a lot and he takes it upon himself to be the man of the house and kayla gabrielle and i are intent on making him the perfect gentleman coming along rather nicely isnthe she asked for confirmation as if she needed remus final say to be absolutely sure remus nodded he is you ve done well yes i knew that just wanted to know what you thought she said remus smiled she was very like kayla and gabrielle and yet she seemed so sombre that it was almost that she was nothing like her other sisters alethea by the way how do you do she shook remus hand i already knew you were remus lupin kayla always talks about you and you re just how i imagined remus blinked and stared at the blunt girl before him she was a mix of both her sisters quite evidently he could only compare her to kayla and gabrielle having seen neither of her parents yet she had kayla curls but they were curls of midnight blue or so remus guessed he needed the light to be sure she had kayla cat eyes but the irises were the intriguing violet that gabrielle possessed not kayla beautiful sapphires if you looked at those features you d think the scales tipped slightly in favour of gabrielle but alethea topped it all off by being born with a golden complexion like kayla which confused the matter to be honest she would grow to be the beauty of the family which had enough beauty in it already spencer himself was a small version of kayla with sparkling sapphire blue eyes golden skin and curls of chestnut brown how old are you alethea remus asked nine years old alethea smiled properly this time she had a crooked smile which showed a straight set of small teeth though crooked it was endearing as it was the only fault on an otherwise perfect girl but having a fault so charming as this made her even more beautiful and she was only nine years old this family is rather beautiful isntit quite blessed remus complimented when it comes to looks certainly i ve always been rather proud of it myself i wontlie and be modest you know i understand gabrielle complexion is rather rarity though it uncommonly pale i like it it sets her apart from us though kayla says its just that we got mum skin tone and gabrielle was the only one who got daddy s the girl explained unnecessarily oh remus looked at the photos again and found an interesting question had established in her head and he knew he could ask alethea somehow one wanted to just say exactly what was on their mind in her presence can i ask you why there a rather an age gap between gabrielle and kayla but not so significant ones between gabrielle yourself and spencer mum and daddy had a child in between kayla and gabrielle two years after kayla was born but he died stillbirth she said truthfully oh remus didntknow what to say but was spared as alethea continued to finish the answer to his question well they were rather disheartened for a while but five years later they had gabrielle and she was perfectly healthy so two years later they had me and then four years after that they had spencer and then daddy died what i sorry i thought you implied that your father is no longer alive oh i did you didntmistake me daddy no longer with us still here in spirit though she looked fondly around the room didntkayla tell you she asked remus shook his head mutely he had no idea what to say gabby he heard a voice cry he looked to see kayla looking shocked and somewhat frozen in the doorway gabby came running down the corridor having heard the conversation and her older sister cry gabby took charge of the situation immediately she sat kayla down on one of the armchairs kayla instantaneously buried her face in her hands gabby then turned to her younger siblings and addressed her brother even though he was the youngest spencer take alethea and yourself upstairs please she ordered calmly spencer took hold of alethea hand who looked confused and dragged her upstairs after they were out of earshot gabrielle wedged herself in next to kayla to calm her down remus was still pretty shocked he was even more shocked when kayla looked up at him with tearstained cheeks something he d never seen before he had never seen her cry or even the aftermath of it obviously her tears were reserved for a special memory suddenly instances came flooding back to him flashback christmas we re standing on the platform i cantbelieve i have to spend christmas without her are your parents picking you up i ask er yeah mum kayla answers okay end flashback flashback who are you writing to your parents mmmmm kayla replies obviously not having heard properly i look over her shoulder and see the words dear mum end flashback flashback we re in the owlery kayla sending a parcel what is that i ask as she coaxes a particular owl by the name of mehak it mum birthday tomorrow oh when your dad s i ask the owl flies down november 22nd she replies promptly funny dontremember you sending a parcel off then i recall she tying the parcel onto his leg she finishes and turns to me huh i shake my head fondly never mind end flashback no dad never dad remus wondered aloud he was never there who picking you up from the station mum no dad who are you always writing to mum no dad that day in the owlery you heard what i asked you have excellent hearing how could you not have how could i not have realised he looked up at his girlfriend who seemed at a loss as to what to say remus you have to understand it not been easy for us never has been it the one thing that really shook kayla she hates talking about it gabby explained rationally kayla sniffed i can talk for myself gabby gabrielle nodded my dad he uh he at the beginning of third year what else do you want me to say i sorry i never told you ever since it happened i ve tried to separate that part of my life from everything else i didntwant to bring it back up you know i dontlike crying and now you ve seen what happens when i do i know you ll compare to this to your own affliction and your own confession but this had nothing to do with trust i promise you this was just something i could never bring myself to say i get to as far as dad and breakdown i not strong enough it not a nice feeling if i could ve told you i would have told you but the fact is that i can t i cantsay it i sorry i sorry you had to hear it from alethea and not me but she was always the strongest do you know alethea means truth we always say dad named her aptly kayla finished and waited for remus to stand up and leave but he didn t he merely looked at her searchingly what am i supposed to say now she covered everything i cantbe angry at her for this what do you mean she a hypocrite she got so angry about your not telling her about being a werewolf when all along she been keeping this a secret it not the same is it really yeah i wouldntunderstand how he said simply kayla looked to her younger sister for assistance gabrielle looked grave dad worked for the department of mysteries we never knew what he did exactly kayla was in third year i remember when the letter came it was a frightful eagle owl chestnut brown feathers mum was at work our house elf whinny was looking after us i was the mistress of the house at that time rather proud of it until i faced the reality of the responsibilities i still remember when whinny handed me that envelope i was six i didntunderstand exactly what they were trying to say to me but as i read it over and over i know it was the eighth time that it hit me what they were trying to convey apparently he had turned up for work quite as he did every morning he sat down in his office secretary came in to drop off some papers and he was lying dead his head resting on the desk i believe they thought it was the avada kedavra i dropped the letter and all i could think about was oh lord what will i say to kayla alethea came running downstairs and ran past me i couldntlook at her properly i knew if i did she d get it out i heard spencer cry from upstairs i can remember discovering what it was like to feel your heart breaking into the tiniest pieces and your hope disappear into nothingness as i heard the sound of his wails waver around he was only a baby of six months he d never know his father never understand what a wonderful man his father had been how much he had loved all of us he d never get to go flying like all the other boys i knew had he d never get to tell the boy next door how much better his own father was gabrielle closed her eyes her mind transporting her back to that fateful and extremely unwelcome day and all it sounds emotions passing seconds when she opened them again she saw kayla looking up at her in the admiration that dwelled in her own eyes so often and remus expecting her to go on when mum came come that night i remember looking at her face and seeing an expression that i couldntunderstand i worked out later that it was acceptance flashback gabrielle how old are you she asks i stared at her the first time she had ever called me gabrielle yet it seems so right for this i look back at her i am six years old mother i answer yet six doesntseem the right number she falls down and holds out her arms mother never done this that was always father but this is different the way she done it i run to her and her arms wrap tightly around me as if she has no intention of ever releasing me oh my darling look at you my angel she whispers into my hair dear dontcall me mother dontever call me mother oh gabrielle you re six years old cantyou be six years old again she asks i shake my head oh i knew it i did i knew it let me look at you she holds me out to observe i dontbelieve she ever seen me this closely you re beautiful arentyou yes you are your father used to tell me every night he d say our girls are beautiful arentthey mary i d always nod and until now i d never looked oh your father would say so many things about you he loved you dontknow if you ever felt it but before he sails away to the back of your mind keep this imprinted forever your father loved you more than life itself he loved you more than love definition contains arentyou sad mother i ask foolishly if i said was sad i d be wrong sad isntacceptable for how i feel she answers yet there are no tears in her eyes i know what she feeling there are no tears because tears arentenough to express the desolation our minds are undergoing she knows mother knows what i thinking and why i thinking she holds my face and says i always knew this would happen someday i donthave to go on do i not for you gabrielle when kayla was born your father and i were filled with joy joy that just dared to leap out of our hearts it indescribable really when we had you you were so different your cries were ever so quiet and when we looked at you both philip and i fell quiet there was something about you something that just closed our mouths and make us stare at you in complete awe when i found the words the first thing i said was gabrielle look philip it our little gabrielle when we had alethea we were frightened she didntmake a single sound but the healer assured us she was perfectly healthy when we held her she opened her eyes straight away and looked at us so earnestly your father said she was almost like truth itself so she was alethea mother pauses what about spencer i ask oh spencer it not that long ago is it no it isn t i remember hearing cries so loud that i felt rather proud and thought that my son he d quietened when i finally held him oh he made us laugh philip and i just laughed laughed for everything in the world i dontreally know why we called him spencer i think philip just chose the first name she looks at me oh do you think me foolish for telling you this i dontknow what else to say dear end flashback do you know what funny mum knew this would happen she told me she knew her husband would be taken away from her prematurely she fell in love with him had children with him made a home with him spent the only life she ever wanted with him knowing that and she wasntscared she wasn t not even that day not even when she wrote to you not even when spencer cried and looked around to see why dad hadntwalked in with mum like she usually did and why i was standing there instead i knew that she would do whatever she could from then on to never make us feel a hole in ourselves i knew the minute she walked through the door that i wanted to be just like her just like my mother she away so much of the time but she always send a note every day to each of us and it always says the same thing i love you gabrielle finished she looked around once more to see remus looking blank as if he really didntknow what to say or what to feel kayla had fresh tears rolling down her cheeks what what did you do remus asked kayla wiped away her tears and spoke again we have whinny she d always look after gabby alethea and spencer and i when mum was away but gabby had to grow up pretty fast i was thirteen gabby was six alethea was four and spencer was six months gabby and i had to practically bring them up that why they re so different to us they re much quieter because that what we did how we looked after them maybe we were wrong but they re okay they are arentthey gabby kayla asked her sister who nodded firmly of course they are they re perfect kayla nodded as well as if that was all the confirmation she needed after fifth year gabby took over almost completely because of the owls she cooked dinner helped whinny clean dressed alethea and spencer tucked them into bed and told spencer stories about his wonderful daddy all that and she was only nine i d never have been able to do everything she has and i so proud of her she looked to gabrielle who nodded dad always said that no matter how much i may be like him and no matter how much he wanted to believe you were like him as well he said that your mind was completely mum s he was right kayla smiled remus we ve told you everything there nothing more we could possibly say she gazed downwards and gabrielle quietly left kayla expected to hear remus disapparating or begin some guilt inducing lecture but she heard nothing she looked back up at him and saw that he had not moved but instead looked at her with eyes of an unknown expression he walked over to her and held her securely kayla felt so safe and protected she felt something she hadntfor the past five years her tears broke out again and she stood quite still in his arms just allowing his shirt to absorb her tears neither said anything but when remus felt the time was right he whispered i love you kayla didntlook up at him or look shocked surprised joyous she merely lifted her head slightly and whispered i love you too before burying her head in his shoulder again alethea simmons peered into the room through the bars of the banister and watched the young couple sadly and wished that one day that she could reach that emotional haven in which remus and kayla resided that very moment a n please review by the way did those review responses even get to you as for the pronunciation of adea it is aa di a i hope you liked this chapter disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea and anyone not in the books belong to me a n do you guys not like my story please review i d really appreciate it and also i not going to discontinue this if i dontget reviews this story is for my own satisfaction but i d really like it if you reviewed sixth sense gabrielle was sitting in a boat with three other girls all of whom she did not know or speak during the ride up after shivering in silence for several minutes and contemplating the events to follow a magnificent castle loomed overhead they exited their boats and huddled at the back alongside the other scared first years thu huddle moved slowly behind an intimidating woman and soon gabrielle took the matter into her own hands and strode ahead determined to speed up the pace and make the others feel less frightened once she had reached the front and was leading the others fell in step an old tattered hat was placed in front of them by a tiny little man they stared at it for a second and the older students waited expectantly suddenly a rip appeared at the brim and it sang i may look old and weary but i not what you see i not like any hat that you will ever meet most do not shout or speak only i can sing put me on your head i ll find your mind within four houses you will find here you must be sorted into one tis my job to do just that so dontyou start to fear bravery and chivalry are what you need to be in gryffindor while intelligence of highest kind is the key to ravenclaw cunning and pure blood breed ambition helps too this is what you need to be in slytherin those of kind and loyal hearts belong in hufflepuff indeed it is that which sets them far apart i have said all i could now it is the time to place me on your head so i can look inside the first years were in awe of what had just happened and were slightly anxious while professor mcgonagall produced a scroll of parchment get in line please the standing children obeyed immediately atkinson thomas a chubby fearful looking boy fell haphazardly out of line and slowly stepped up to the stool he placed the hat on his head the hat took several minutes to make its decision before it announced ravenclaw the sorting progressed and the line got thinner until finally somewhere between the s simmons gabrielle was called gabby sat on the stool and put the hat on her head aaaaah simmons i see from a ravenclaw and gryffindor history how very hard you will be to place how very much like your sister you are however and forgive me for saying she was sharp but there is more intelligence in your mind but like a true simmons that outstanding bravery holds its own but i know where you must be placed suddenly it burst out gryffindor she took a seat next to her sister and let out a breath she was met with four well done gabby and four hugs to go with them she was also met with a few winks from some new first year boys and smiled back at them dumbledore stood up and gave what she thought must have been the yearly announcements though she didntlisten to any of them and when the feast finally appeared she dug in heartily after eating it was time to go to gryffindor tower her home away from home for the next seven years a few seats away a black haired boy came to lily grinning hey evans wanna go make out agggghhhhh she screamed in frustration and if looks could kill james would ve been six feet under alright alright calm down just kidding but we do have to go with mcgonagall to our dormitories a n in this story it the prefects job to show the dormitories which is what its like in most books except for the third one fine potter she stood up smoothed her skirt and exited the great hall potter in tow as they made their way to mcgonagall office james struck up a somewhat mature conversation so how do you think you re gonna manage everything this year how do you mean well think about it homework classes head duties and throw all the stress of newts on top and you ve got a messed up year i guess but they made me head girl and if dumbledore didntthink i could handle it then i wouldntbe wearing this badge she was disconcerted but maintained a certain amount of hostility in her tone james smiled a sincere smile which she didntcatch she looked straight on well what about you how are you gonna manage evans you seem to forget i james potter i ve been doing this my whole life have you ever once seen me revise for a test you re right you know i forgot you are james potter still the same cocky arrogant stuck up boy i met in first year canteven hold up a decent conversation but she did not say it with the same fire and anger in fact she barely whispered but it got james thinking lily had had enough and since they had reached the office she opened the door and went in ignoring james completely the woman at the desk did not notice any difference in their behaviour towards each other however miss evans potter i sure you know why you re here dumbledore notified you in your letters about the dormitories it is my job to show you them then you must get to bed she said in a no nonsense tone she left her office immediately and the two seventh years followed after a while they came to a solid mahogany door in a part of hogwarts lily had never seen before james was less impressed he knew where everywhere was and almost 90 sure he d been here before magnum dormit came mcgonagall voice and the door slowly swung open revealing a beautiful dark green room lily assumed was their common room it had a 2 seater and 2 armchairs an inviting fire a nice big table and random paintings spread around this is your dormitory this is your common room and if you ll excuse me i assume you can find your own rooms its just i rather tired and have lessons first thing in the morning the professor yawned no problem professor lily replied sweetly the older woman smiled appreciatively and left by instinct lily immediately took off for the room on her left once she stepped in aside she was speechless couldnteven release a gasp the room was snow white with sketches of black and white lilies and real ones in a vase on her vanity table she walked over to the flowers and found a note congratulations and good luck thought you might like the d cor albus dumbledore lily smiled how did that man know everything she was just changing when someone knocked on her door potter i coming she put on her robe and went out hey did dumbledore do your room up to she nodded in response by the way how did you do that he asked the redhead what how did you know exactly which room was yours you get fascinated way too easily only by you but seriously you did that in first year as well the prefect didnteven need to show you your dormitory i dontknow it my sixth sense i guess i feel a calling coming from certain things or places i just know that where i supposed to be everyone has a sixth sense potter how come you ve never got a calling from my arms you know you belong there evans amazing you did it again goodnight potter she called icily turned on her heel and disappeared behind her door a n ok you know what to do review also wasntthe sorting hat song crap disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea and anyone not in the books belongs to me adea dress doesntbelong to me either it belongs to indus fashions oh and the lyrics in the scene

hope you like it and dontforget to copy and paste the link in the end note enigma unravelled there is no man so friendless but what he can find a friend sincere enough to tell him disagreeable truths edward bulwer lytton remus decided to stay for the following week his parents consented and in the simmons household when mary simmons wasntin gabrielle was in charge in charge of everything guests food cleaning outings everything she had the guest room prepared for remus immediately and even made a special dinner for him on the first night remus had his doubts but four years of practise had done the twelve year old well and his fears were soon eradicated remus spent a lot of time with spencer they did lots of things that spencer had never had the chance to do alongside remus spencer rode a broom for the first time and also learnt the rules of quidditch a task his sisters had always deemed daunting and had avoided for a year or so now remus stepped into the kitchen and was met with the now normal sight of gabrielle pouring over the stove stirring something that smelled delicious remus smiled need any help he said cheerfully gabby smiled back and looked relieved oh would you mind chopping those potatoes up for me i would but i have to do everything the muggle way and whinny clearing the basement it was a mess last week she chattered making remus smile again two days later remus was supposed to leave it was the night before gabrielle kayla and he returned to hogwarts it was also the day on which mrs simmons returned her arrival was set for the morning and his departure for the evening so they had a few hours overlapping in which they could briefly meet i home cried a voice spencer came running downstairs and for once nobody stopped him alethea slowly walked down the stairs after him kayla and remus came out from the living room and gabrielle came out last from her kitchen remus observed the woman at the door she was like the older version of gabrielle she had the same intriguing violet eyes the straight locks of midnight blue but instead of having an unearthly pale complexion she possessed a golden one this was mary simmons he watched her hug and kiss her children and saw that her eyes bore the same spark that every mother eyes did when she spoke to smiled at or even looked at her children prominent as that was especially combined with the familiarity that home brought to you something was missing he saw her stare at spencer in a peculiar way but she stopped after a second the look in her eyes when gabrielle hugged her was different to ones that were present when the other three did the same once the meetings with the children were over mary simmons sighed and looked at remus with an unreadable expression remus looked right back with neither a defiant nor an unnerved expression his expression was totally and completely him a few seconds later she smiled at him and revealed a beautiful smile beautified by the very fact that there was something decidedly missing in it i can guess who you are but i ll let kayla introduce us she said kayla smiled took her mother by the hand over to remus mum this is my boyfriend remus lupin remus this is my mum remus shook hands with mrs simmons politely hello remus lovely to meet you pleasure to meet you too mrs simmons mary if you please she said mechanically her perfunctory tone of voice surprised remus she didnteven look at him when she said it more about the room and then he realised what it was that her eyes were devoid of they contained none of the love that only your soul mate your true partner in life can provide without it her eyes seemed almost empty waiting rather hopeless however there was something strong in her demeanour something persistent something remus knew was the one thing the simmons children could always count on a mere hour before lily and james departure to kings cross and ultimately hogwarts they were rushing around trying to get everything done well not so much james just lily really james was rather cool about the situation and calmly ate his breakfast knowing lily was being ridiculous since the platform wasntfar away and they could apparate adam smiled at watching the two bicker and his approval of james increased james hurry up you re not eating fast enough we re going to be late she snapped glaring at him we re the heads i am not intending to start my last term at hogwarts by missing the train james rolled his eyes at his girlfriend hysteria really lily darling just how am i supposed to enjoy my breakfast and devour every succulent bite if you keep distracting me he said in a most infuriating manner he then speared a large bit of sausage onto his fork and proceeded to chew slowly irritating lily even more she screamed frustratedly rosalind and adam laughed the evans were unhappy that their youngest was leaving but they then remembered that it was her last term and after that she d be theirs for the summer before she planned to move out finally everything was ready and the two seventh years were set to leave they d sent their trunks to their compartments only moments before lily smiled sadly when she looked at her mother mum she said simply and hugged her tightly mrs evans had tears in her eyes oh mum don t it my last year look my last term now i ll be living off you in no time she joked rosalind laughed through her tears and kissed her daughter on the forehead lily then turned to adam and smiled brightly daddy adam smiled back and tried his best to not show his sadness lily he said simply lily hugged her father and he kissed her on the forehead as well and ruffled her red hair fondly james stepped forward and firmly shook adam hand and hugged rosalind who kissed him on his forehead as well thanks for having me it been great i loved meeting you james said sincerely rosalind smiled and waved a hand it was nothing on my part but a pleasure to have you rosalind said adam nodded in agreement and added look after our lily he and james exchanged glances and james replied depend on it that i will james then looked to lily shall we go you go ahead i ll be there in a second she said james nodded and waved once again before disappearing lily turned to her parents so final verdict rosalind eyes sparkled dontmake your sister mistake will you hold onto him if i find you ve let him go i will personally kill you lily laughed and hugged her mother again she then turned to her father with hopeful eyes remember one thing lily no one no one is good enough for my girls lily rolled her eyes now dursley was a mistake a large one on petunia part but i will say that james is about as close as they get and i ll admit i ve grown to rather like him adam said almost grudgingly lily eyes lit up and she hugged her dad thank you she squealed ecstatic that her father had approved of james okay mum dad i have to be off say hi to petunia for me and tell her i sorry i couldntsee her before i left and and take care and i love you and lily darling i love you too but they re expecting you rosalind said laughingly lily nodded waved and left in less than a second she found herself within the surroundings of kings cross station platform 9 she looked around to see a familiar yet nameless group of fourth years giggling at something or the other and a handsome red train standing before her she glanced at clock behind it indicated that it was currently half past ten lily grinned she was back in the wizarding world lily glanced around further and saw james standing further on with sirius remus and peter boo said a voice lily turned around to find adea staring back at her dee lily cried adea laughed doesntthis feel weird she asked lily nodded feels like the first day and yet we re leaving to start our last term at hogwarts let not talk about that came another familiar voice belonging to kayla simmons alongside whom stood jane swales lily directed her friends to the head compartment but adea declined promising that she would join them in half an hour at the least but she had fianc duties the girls laughed and rolled their eyes accordingly lily had to detach from them as well to perform duties of another kind head girl to be more precise but she intended to have it done within ten minutes there was ten minutes left until the train departed and lily and james had to make sure that no students lingered on the platform when she stepped out of the head compartment she found james waiting for her patiently for them to begin their battle so to speak please board now the train leaves in ten minutes that ten minutes the train leaves in ten minutes please board now lily voice called out tediously a nearby hufflepuff girl gave her a dirty look cantyou give it a rest lily eyes flashed dangerously and the girl immediately regretted it you think i want to do this the girl shook her head a part of lily felt rather satisfied get on the train sweetheart she jabbed her thumb in the direction of the train the girl and her boyfriend promptly boarded the train quietly the whistle sounded and after checking no one was left behind lily and james hopped into their compartment where they were met with sirius remus peter jane and kayla by the looks of it peter seemed to be emanating newfound confidence he looked at lily and smiled hey lily how was your holiday he said politely lily smiled back cautiously great thanks and yours there was still something there that lily didntlike but he was being nice and seemed slightly more bearable adea and waqar were in their own compartment and were enjoying themselves talking about anything and everything adea it your last term with them waqar started adea avoided his glance and said uncomfortably yes i quite aware what about it you know what i talking about he said adea couldnthide the guilt from her face with anyone else she could keep a blank face with ease but with waqar it seemed as though all her guards came crashing down i know it not right of me but every time i come close i dontknow something stops me at the last second adea explained waqar adamantly shook his head no it not right you re going to have to do it you guys have been friends for seven years this is your last term in which you ll all be together in one place you ve dodged it for long enough you will have to tell them he said making her feel if possible even worse i know i know okay i just i she trailed off knowing he was absolutely right i sorry to have to make such an issue of this but i know that if you leave without having told them you ll regret it it better you telling them than them finding out another way he finished with difficulty adea looked at him her dark eyes widened and clouded with disquietude what do you mean she asked him they held each other gaze for a fraction of a second waqar turned to look out of the window for a moment before turning back once again their eyes met i mean he started with deliberation exams are coming up and everyone going to be upset tense irate even you his soft green eyes conveyed quite simply the hidden meaning in his words adea mind was reeling i completely forgot of course especially this year oh lord it going to be even more of a hell she fell into a seat her face was blank and yet the imaginings of the future weeks seemed to make the forest green in her irises more prominent she turned to look at her oldest friend once more you you dontthink something will happen to me she asked waqar looked back at her you know i dontlie to you i really dontknow it possible they said if it gets too much you may be out for short periods of time adea filled in quietly waqar looked uneasy if it happened once was all he said adea thought back to that dreadful experience if i out at all then you will tell them for me wontyou she asked what if you re only out for a few seconds he asked not wanting to imagine it more than that adea shook her head no even then i d feel awful having to tell them like i d betrayed them how would i look them in the eye no but they d have to know so i ll tell them waqar assured adea smiled gratefully it not painful is it well obviously it is but you know i meant when you pass out or as you pass out rather he asked adea thought back again not really it only when you wake up it not so much painful as it is unpleasant your skin feels like it on fire she murmured adea thought of her three friends they were probably sitting up in the comfortable head compartment laughing together occasionally wondering as to when she would return unknowing to her condition at least they were happy for the time being if you want to join them go ahead waqar said if i was to go you d come with me and i dontfeel like going one of them will come in here after me i expect adea predicted waqar frowned dontfeel too guilty he said in hopes of raising her spirits but to no avail hm i just dontfeel like it anymore i feel sick actually she replied adea then took to staring out of the window watching the countryside fly past in a green blur occasionally accompanied by white supplied by the wild daisies that night it took adea a while to rid herself of her thoughts for they disturbed her attempts to try and sleep she knew waqar words would hold her until she finally told them as she listened to the soft breathing of two of her friends and thought of the third in her room her doubt and fears increased when she did finally sleep it was an unsettled slumber weeks flew the remnants of spring evolved to plant the buds of summer the sun shone brighter as the clouds reluctantly moved away to reveal it newts were only a month away and the seventh years had all spiralled into a revising frenzy the common rooms were no longer a place for friends to meet and students to socialise instead it had become a place of tension and nerves if a word was uttered slightly above a whisper you were thrown out lily considered herself very lucky she had her very own space unable to be invaded by anyone else and where she could be completely alone unless she wished not to she only ever left for lessons rounds and gave five minutes for meals james had expected this but still he found it irritating he was for some reason finding it harder and harder to stay focused when not in her company it wasntas if he had become that smitten little third year or the infatuated being he had been eight months ago it wasntas if he was lost without her there it was more sirius provided entertainment and brotherhood adea and remus provided the very essence of friendship loyalty and understanding peter provided hopeless reliability that no matter what happened even if they forgot him time to time pete would always be there even jane and kayla had their purposes in his mind kayla provided truth a dose of reality beautifully worded and full of verve even if what she had to say were not so pleasing jane provided mystery and hope sometimes when you talked to her she could make you forget select things like a child but lily lily provided something else and for some inexplicable reason james couldntsay exactly what she breathed life into the tiniest thing james admitted that yes kayla did that too they both possessed a certain vivacity that was probably why people made them out to be more similar than they really were remus always said that when lily and kayla stepped into a room it made all other girls common and undistinguished though there was something different rather more special in james opinion of course about the way in which lily did things though he suspected that remus thought the same of kayla if he had to sum it up somehow she provided the essence of life she made him think of things in ways he hadntdreamt possible lily could turn the most pointless topic into an intellectual debate just by tossing in a few sarcastic remarks and witty comments where they were needed her beauty was incomparable she was enigmatic though not as enigmatic as jane or even adea lily was not as compassionate as adea either lily was kind hearted but her famed temper didntfail her flaming locks james didntcare it made her even more gorgeous james was content with his lily she might not have been perfect but she was perfect for him he couldntsee himself withstanding adea and all her angelic goodness in a relationship for too long no he had lily and she was all he could ever dream of james was too proud to ever even consider falling for a faultless girl adea why are you so perfect james asked bluntly adea looked surprised her dark eyes peered at him in perplexity over her book after a moment she set it down and looked at waqar who was grinning she knew he would enjoy this conversation and would most definitely not help her out excuse me she asked in her gentle whisper james persisted onwards everyone has a fault it an unwritten law and yet adea qureshi you seem to have quite simply disregarded it he turned to waqar you ve been her friend for how long all her life seventeen years he replied proudly so you tell me what wrong with her i mean she beautiful smart funny at times kind and understanding all of these cantpossibly go together without there being something wrong what is it james asked waqar shrugged and looked towards adea grinning again she threw him a look of contempt i should think that my faults were glaringly obvious james she said sagely her audience marvelled at how even when the matter concerned herself she sounded like she was sharing a piece of her coveted wisdom you should think wrong then james retorted sharply adea rolled her eyes james almost all of this blessed school doesntknow my godforsaken name what does that tell you waqar coughed pointedly another look of contempt came darting his way uh you re paranoid james said unsurely waqar would ve laughed had adea eyes not so threateningly flashed at him i a coward i mentally unable to trust people and as far as appearance goes i freakily skinny she listed james raised his eyebrows the first one crap and you know it you re in gryffindor woman the second you might be onto something and the third one i ll grant you you my friend are what i believe is called extremely svelte that not a good thing with that he took adea fragile wrist in between his index and thumb and delicately as if were to snap it did look like it rather intended to and held it up there wasntan ounce of flesh well there must ve been but it didntfeel like it holding her pathetic excuse of a wrist was almost painful the sides of her wrists jutted sharply outwards and it felt as if they were trying to cut through his skin he then slowly placed her wrist back at her side and said simply you need to eat more waqar said nothing and adea sighed if i had a sickle for every time someone said that well well well sneered lucius malfoy he leered at jane she had been randomly roaming the corridors and had had the misfortune to cross paths with the blonde slytherin what have we here if he thought he was intimidating jane in the slightest he was sorely mistaken the girl rolled her eyes jane swales he said patronisingly jane sighed yes yes jane swales a k a the retarded mudblood you know malfoy it really is getting rather tiresome this little routine shall we call it the height of tedium she glanced at his cronies that tedium spelt t e d i u m it means malfoy cut her off with a glare they know what it means he said impatiently jane raised her eyebrows are you sure malfoy looked behind to find his cronies sporting blank and confused faces jane snorted think you re clever do you wontbe feeling that way for long swales malfoy threatened jane cast another glance at the small group behind him and looked back smiling no i quite confident that i will you always were a bold one malfoy said with distaste jane nodded understandingly i can see why that would be a hindrance makes it harder for you to bully me i suppose i sincerely apologise jane replied with a straight face malfoy withdrew his wand but jane drew hers quicker the cronies guffawed malfoy smirked oh is the mudblood going to duel me now jane rolled her eyes yet again well let see i holding out my wand you re holding out yours and we re pointing them at each other yes it does rather look that way doesntit malfoy laughed again you honestly think you can fight me i could do away with you in a second swales jane snorted again yes because your performance that day on the platform was spectacular malfoy the boy looked murderous jane was succeeding in distracting him your boyfriend wontalways be there to protect you swales especially now that he continued but jane tuned him out focusing on something else oh the idiot gone and fallen into the trap he always has loved the sound of his voice cantimagine why focus jane oh right yes his defences are low expelliarmus jane pointed her wand at malfoy and his wand came flying into her hand the cronies stood there with dumbstruck expressions and malfoy looked shocked tut tut malfoy forgotten the art of non verbal spells already have we dontwe sit our newts in a month better brush up jane teased malfoy advanced upon her but was stopped when he saw who was coming up behind oh no please continue malfoy it been a while since i ve given you a deserved black eye dontdeny me the pleasure came remus voice jane looked behind her and saw the pale face of remus challenging malfoy with his aquamarine eyes jane held up his wand tauntingly be as physical as you want malfoy but it three wands to those iq s jane said glancing once again at the cronies she smiled back at him i sure even they could work out who at an advantage here malfoy sneered once more and backed off his eyes never left the wand that now nestled in jane left hand remus smiled slightly as he and jane began to walk away when they reached the end of the corridor jane threw malfoy wand behind her carelessly and when she turned the corner she could be heard saying do you think it d be alright for me to burn my skin it just that well i was holding malfoy wand after walking a little further remus said very well done back there by the way i commend you and i a marauder remus said jane smiled a little and said thank you and they said you were modest one remus laughed and they both walked into the great hall for their lunch where jane took a seat by sirius and remus proceeded to tell him what had just happened after hearing what had happened sirius had laughed triumphantly and kissed jane and then remembered to look concerned oh you are okay arentyou did they do anything jane shook her fondly and said like i would ve let them sirius kissed her again and then looked to remus is she perfect or what the following saturday morning lily kayla jane adea and the marauders were enjoying breakfast a flurry of wings could be heard overhead the girls searched for their own owls but only saw adea owl mehak who was holding quite a long but floppy package several other students were watching mehak as well as she carefully descended adea got up quickly and whispered it the dress bring it down to your room and give mehak a small piece of toast before leaving lily looked with anticipation at the package now that she knew what it contained when mehak finally reached the table instead of perching on the table she landed on lily lap lily marvelled at the intelligence of the owl she had probably been sent orders to be careful with the package lily liberated mehak of her package and then fed the surnia owl a piece of toast once mehak had flown off in pursuit of the owlery lily rose and left with jane and kayla they briskly walked towards the head chamber and ran into lily room to find adea sitting patiently on the white bed lily laid down the package in front of her adea read the note attached to it out loud dear adea we decided on pink it not exactly what we agreed on but i know you ll love it and i know you ll look incredibly breathtaking in it i not your mother but i almost there and i know what makes my girl beauty even more noticeable than it is already love shahira aunty adea waited a moment lily had to abstain from ripping it open herself what are you waiting for dee open it adea glanced at her sharply i just ridding myself of expectations just in case lily sighed and had to wait a couple more seconds before her friend finally started to tear the packaging once the dress was out the girls collectively sighed adea stared open mouthed jane looked on dreamily and lily and kayla squealed oh my god it amazing adea that is the most beautiful dress i ve ever laid my eyes on adea stared some more before she finally cried i getting married in this i love you aunty the dress was light pink with shades of orange and red combined as well it was made with as adea noted when she ran her fingers over it a mixture of katan and raw silk a n if you feel you dontlike the sound of it i would ve given you the link but wontlet me so trust me it really nice so what do you think jane adea asked after noticing that one of her friends had not said anything jane thought before she answered i think this dress is perfect we couldntpossibly find a better one for you would someone mind calling waqar for me the black haired girl asked lily got up i ll do it i know the ravenclaw password the ravenclaw tower was not far from the head chamber she said the password baruffio clearly to the tapestry and entered she had always loved the ravenclaw common room since she d found out what it looked like in september it had cream carpeting and beautiful chenille sofas large mahogany bookcases in one corner filled with leather bound books and lined up against the wood panelled walls the grand looking stairs for the dormitories were of spiralling mahogany as well it didnthave the cosiness of hufflepuff common room the warmth of the gryffindor common room and it definitely didnthave the harshness of the slytherin common room but it had sophistication and it just looked like an intellectual space with its tasteful furniture and majestic fireplaces and staircases lily looked around and saw waqar talking with some of his friends she walked up to the group of seventh year boys and cleared her throat quietly waqar looked up at her and his eyes widened in surprise lily what are you doing here hey waqar she said brightly and then looked at his friends gibson walters goldstein she nodded politely at each of his friends an offered them small smiles i need to talk to you about the graduation ball lily lied smoothly over there she gestured to a corner near the bookcases waqar nodded and they moved away from his friends when they got to the bookcases waqar went into prefect mode what is it do you want me to get the decorations lily rolled her eyes at how gullible he was sometimes no adea dress just came in she wants you to see it waqar nodded and lily cast a glance towards his friends who were watching the pair curiously yes james needs to talk about the decorations we usually put you ravenclaws in charge of it she said loudly his friends did not look quite so interested lily rolled her eyes again she led waqar out of his common room and they headed towards the head chamber when they got into lily room they found adea and kayla excitedly discussing something and jane running her fingers delicately over the garments waqar smiled to see adea so happy she positively beamed when she saw him waqar look look it my dress isntit beautiful she asked elatedly waqar glanced at the exquisite dress which spread over lily double bed he imagined adea in it and smiled even more i think it great cantwait to see you in it waqar sat on the floor and leaned against the bed his expression became horrified as the girls moved onto his attire in the wedding what if we have his hair styled yeah i think a deep gold would work well no he has to wear a hat sort of thing so let forget about the hair what about shoes he has to compliment you adea waqar looked terrified and became even more fearful as he glanced at the dress and horrible images of him turning up in a light pink suit flew into his head oh lord no i am a man i am a man i am a man that right you show those girls a knocking interrupted his thoughts james head looked into the room and was surprised at the sight especially at seeing waqar there oh hello what going on in here then he asked looking around waqar sighed relief potter i need your help but james eyes had caught the dress and he stared at it in a puzzled manner what that he asked it adea wedding dress lily replied happily james looked shocked wedding wedding with who the other five exchanged glances oh you must know i sure lily looked at adea didntyou tell him she asked adea shook her head not initially but after a while i thought you must ve didntyou lily shook her head in the negative no i assumed he knew it never came up as such the conversing two looked at jane and kayla enquiringly kayla answered for both of them same while jane looked lightly amused james on the other hand was getting impatient tell me what what are you on about someone better tell me right now he ordered adea sighed resolutely james waqar and i well we she faltered a little she glanced at waqar and he was grinning again their childish bravery competition had been recommenced and she started with new vigour waqar and i are going to be married this november she said firmly and looked at waqar with a so there expression and he returned it with a shrug that screamed it was okay i suppose he knew it wound adea up when he didntfully commend her acts of bravery james looked like he d been struck married he repeated dazed he looked at adea and waqar when when did you engaged he tried stringing the words together and failed terribly but they got what he was saying well we ve been engaged of sorts since fourth year adea tried to explain the odd relations kayla took hold of it they were promised she said bluntly james eyes widened even more promised are you being forced james asked scandalised adea almost laughed at his expression but contented herself with an amused smile nothing like that we had the last say and if we had wanted we could ve pulled out at any given time during the past three years but we made it i guess she said simply james digested this information and said wow fourth year well if you re okay with it he trailed off and smiled but thought to himself so what were you saying waqar he asked waqar remembered his predicament prior to james entrance they re trying to co ordinate me he stated james looked suspiciously at the girls waqar elaborated styled hair gold and shoes james looked outraged have some mercy woman he said to adea waqar felt braver with an ally yeah i a man i refuse to have styled hair for starters he cried styled hair james repeated i not wearing gold waqar continued no sane man wears gold james reiterated the girls looked at the pair with their eyebrows raised and i will be picking my own shoes thank you that right the man wants his own shoes james cried the girls laughed waqar remember what you said on the train that day just pick something out and hand it to me the night before i taking you up on that but okay no styled hair adea said waqar groaned and james looked on sympathetically the bell sounded and it took but a minute for a herd to establish in the previously empty corridor every student milled out to become just another face in a sea of black remus tried to move as fast as was physically possible he kept his head down and didntlook around the corridor was not a place to look around and spot acquaintances not in between lessons anyway it was like a train that never stopped you had to just break the flow and walk out at your stop ugh he heard a feminine voice exclaim quietly beside him he took no notice even when she was shoved into his shoulder most probably by some hurried ravenclaw it was a perfectly normal occurrence and people states of comfort could not be considered in this regular scene the girl continued quietly to herself remus would not have eavesdropped but it really was useless in their forced position of closeness i wish i could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too i was told i was beautiful but what does that mean to you look into the mirror who inside there the one with the long hair same old me again today yeah the sound made his head snap up but the voice was already trailing away and when he turned his head to the right to take a look she d already been carried away he d seen black hair swing and contact a third year face before he lost all possible sight of her he tried to look around as much as he could but it was futile she d gone i know that voice it was hers i was this close i missed her again i might ve been able to ask her who she was and everything how annoying fate is so against this meeting i dontsee anything wrong with it may i throw in my knut worth if you must stop chasing after another girl you have a girlfriend forget that girl oh shut up remus continued onwards to care of magical creatures when he got there he sat on a table with the rest of the marauders he found it hard to concentrate on what professor kettleburn was telling them about could that girl be adea qureshi no it cantbe adea qureshi why not nobody ever seen her for the seven years we ve been in this school that isntgoing to change for me now so who could that girl be she could be anyone and anyway she couldntbe adea qureshi because mohsin says he knows her which means she must be in ravenclaw like we thought that girl is in gryffindor is there anyone who could know her remus looked around and his aquamarine eyes caught on jane for some reason the back of her head projected him into thoughts of kayla he remembered that morning when he asked whose books those had been all three of them had seemed slightly reserved and nervous could they know her he knew there were four beds in that dormitory although there should only be three kayla s jane and lily old one why was that a hand was waving in front of him moony remus shook his head and looked to see sirius staring back at him oh sorry you alright yeah yeah fine james and sirius exchanged glances but remus did not notice he was still rather lost in his thoughts he mutely carried out the tasks professor kettleburn had set them his mind still belonging to another realm after a while he turned to his friends have you two been in the girl dorm they both nodded in response and exchanged confused glances have you noticed how there an extra bed remus asked sirius frowned what do you mean i mean there jane and kayla and then there lily old bed as well but what the fourth one for sirius thought back to the room in question and realisation dawned on his face wow i never spared it a thought really but you re right i dontsee why there should be an extra bed unless no sirius trailed off intrigued remus nodded as if he understood what his friend had been thinking that what i thought as well it not like dumbledore to put an extra bed in there for no reason sirius commented remus agreed but they now looked at james to hear his opinion on the confusing matter james looked up and inwardly panicked within a second he calmed himself if there an extra bed in there what it to us there ll be a reason we dont have to know he said quickly calm down it nothing to get stressed about sirius said reassuringly but remus wasntconvinced and scrutinised his raven haired friend who quite deliberately averted his gaze once the bell had rung remus headed outside to find kayla for the twenty minute break they spent together he found his girlfriend resting her back against the trunk of her favourite tree she looked out upon the other students with an expression of icy indifference to her right lily evans the head girl could just be glimpsed between the curtain of red hair which fell forward as she concentrated on the book she was reading to kayla left jane swales could be seen lying on the grass reading a divination book upside down what remus hadntseen was a pretty asian girl dart round the back of the tree trunk to sit out of view of the approaching marauder remus sat down in front of kayla causing her expression to change instantaneously hey she cried and leaned forward to give him a small kiss james and sirius soon sat down as well sirius lay down next to jane and james put his arm around lily so we were just in care of magical creatures and we started to wonder the sound of james clearing his throat cut remus off mid sentence sirius and i started to wonder remus started again as to why there an extra bed in your dorm kayla masked her inner feelings very well she looked trivially amused and said what a random thing to think about remus persisted onwards determined to not be distracted yes but why remus asked kayla exchanged glances with lily their faces were arranged in very careful amusement and james was rather impressed i dontknow it just part of our dorm really kayla said remus raised his eyebrows well i can suggest to have it removed james but the girls cut him off with a synonymous no remus looked at them why what so special about that bed sirius asked completely confused lily shrugged we just want it to stay but you donteven sleep there anymore remus said all he got was a glare from lily he ignored it and said you know if we had it taken out you lot could have a lot more space we dontwant more space why not we just don t we ll be leaving in july what the point and we re too used to it lily argued reasonably exactly you re leaving in july so it ll be good to have your stuff spread out so it easier to pack remus said there really no point remus why not i cantunderstand why you didnthave it taken out earlier we ve learnt to live with it we cantimagine our dorm without our useless spare bed and it great for spreading our clothes out when we have dates or parties and stuff kayla said the bed stays remus we donthave to create a reason to your liking said a cool voice that had not spoken yet everyone looked at jane lily and kayla inwardly sighed with relief when jane used that tone it meant two things she was protecting one of her friends and do not argue this any further or you might be bodily harmed remus open mouth close immediately and an uneasy sort of silence fell upon them jane rose and headed back to the castle lily and kayla followed her they both threw dirty looks remus way james and sirius stayed sitting knowing now was not the time to be trailing after their girlfriends a thought occurred to james he waited a while until remus and sirius had left as well telling them that he d meet them later after they had left he looked behind the tree trunk and found a face wearing a perfectly angelic smile you were sitting here the whole time james asked incredulously yep adea replied brightly james shook his head despairingly that was close remus is getting seriously suspicious now yeah i know but donti have the best friends james ignored her question and said what relit the curiosity i got squashed against his shoulder and he heard me singing she said apologetically again james groaned sorry you know what you have to do dontyou james asked be more careful no stop singing james quipped adea stuck her tongue out the two of them talked and laughed for a while before they too got up and left to revise like they knew the others had lily shut the door to her room and walked into the lounge to join james on the sofa we have to take the prefects ideas and turn it into a spectacular graduation ball lily said james nodded and said yeah we ll do it later no way we are not going to be reaching the frantic state we were in at halloween we plan now we take the ideas to dumbledore and we have a wonderfully organised graduation ball that no one will ever forget without injuries lily said bossily james sighed and knew he was fighting a lost battle okay so what have they said i wasntlistening lily rolled her eyes and took out some parchments well i gave the prefects more responsibility and i rather proud james nodded the gryffindors want the hall to be lit by fairies the dance floor to be marble and the walls now this is complicated they want them so that they look like the normal walls but when you go near them they become like giant windows and you can look outside where there going to be rows upon rows of roses dahlias baby breath and how sweet is this lilies at this comment james coughed and said something which sounded suspiciously like kiss ups lily ignored him they want one wall to be different though one wall has to display flashing pictures memories from our seven years the hufflepuffs have once again come up with a fantastic menu food from all over the world here take a look at this she handed james a rough copy version of the proposed menu and started off again ravenclaws worked well with gryffindors they ve coincided to make it dress robes seventh years only except for prefects who can come but only with a date the slytherins want the hobgoblins again lily said the last part with a grimace james groaned no not again i wontlet them lily thought about it well we could change it to manic manticores she suggested and we ll tell the slytherins that the hobgoblins were unavailable james said lily nodded that ll work and scratched out the offending band from the parchment and wrote manic manticores instead are we done james asked lily shook her head almost we have to make a speech at this one it required both of us individually is that okay you dontreally have a choice james shrugged his shoulders moodily well that it now off to dumbledore office she got up and looked at james expectantly who sighed resignedly and rose as well they ambled to dumbledore office conversing lightly along the way james was annoyed that lily had interrupted his lazing around time a man has needs lily he cried what to sit around and do nothing lily asked sceptically exactly james retorted how productive she said she walked a little further on so that james had to catch her up but it only took a stride you re missing the point here james said oh right of course lily smacked her head theatrically and said monotonously i am very sorry james how awful of me i shall never stop you from sitting around and doing nothing ever again thank you i dontcare if you were being sarcastic which for the record i was lily filled in but james ignored her i shall still accept your apology as if it was real lily walked on again james went behind her and put his arms around her waist are you angry he whispered lily face took on the what the hell expression but james couldntsee that james why would i be angry that just stupid james let go of her oh you ve gone and ruined it you were supposed to say yes and then we could kiss and make up lily took a deep breath james how many times we ve been over this i not blonde and i not in hufflepuff she said patronisingly james grinned i know you re so much better lily smiled grudgingly as well see now for that you can have a kiss she stood on her tiptoes and gave him a small kiss they continued walking onwards talking about hogsmeade trips that would have to be set up and lily fought with james about letting the girls have two hogsmeade trips but james couldntsee the point but lily why james asked for the fourth time do you know how hard it is to shop for the perfect outfit lily huffed no i cantsay that i do well of course you don t so let me clue you in it hell fun but hell nevertheless i mean half of them will want to buy dress robes then some will want shoes and some will want to top up their make up supplies lily listed but james held up a hand okay stop that enough cantyou lot get that done in one hogsmeade trip he asked once again no no we can t it takes forever james please please please lily asked and forced her emerald eyes into an adorable expression james closed his eyes and sighed a trick he had learnt only recently if dumbledore says it okay then fine if not then no lily smiled at half achieving her motive when they got to dumbledore office and said the password pepper imps they found that the door to office was not as it usually was entirely shut instead it was open just a crack and voices could be heard inside there were two there was a flustered voice and one completely calm and rational one dumbledore of course this is the safest place for them to be millicent dumbledore calm voice cut through james leant closer to the door lily shook her head vehemently james we can t she mouthed james waved a hand and continued to eavesdrop dumbledore are you mad these families need to be put under ministry security immediately he cried the families certainly but the children will remain here until the summer holidays where you will put them under your security and then release them again for september 1st hogwarts is the safest place for them dumbledore said did you not hear me he wants the best of families we have the richest the most powerful the pure blooded he wants them gone the bones the prewetts the mckinnons he has designs for the simmons later on but they re not as important oh and of course the potters he wants them all dead the minister cried dramatically james froze his eyes widened lily was at a loss as to what to do my dear millicent i heard you accurately the first time and i still maintain that the children of those families shall remain in hogwarts under my personal security until such time as i let them go and if which i doubt but if voldemort as he prefers now wants to kill the simmons i suggest you send me the remaining two children alethea and spencer i think for kayla and gabrielle are already under my care though kayla not for much longer but all the same oh and i should like to have allegra potter transported to the castle as of september as well it imperative that she be allowed to do so dumbledore said in an admirable tone lily couldntsee the other man face but she knew that it must be one of shock at the mention of his sister james had tensed up further dumbledore you ve gone insane we simply cannot let these families be washed out you dontseem to be thinking for what best for the children but dumbledore cut him off you may call me mad and indeed insane but you will do kindly not to make insinuations of those sort i have devoted my life to this school and you know there is nothing so important to me as what best for my current and future pupils he said calmly but a kind of cool calm that she knew dumbledore voice adopted when he was unhappy i putting my foot down i the minister for magic and i inclined but dumbledore cut the minister off again as i have reminded you on countless occasions millicent you may be in charge of the goings on of the magical country but in hogwarts you have no such authority that lies solely in my hands and now i think it would be tiresome to continue this dumbledore finished the two seventh years heard a sigh i suppose i have no choice but to say as you wish now if you ll excuse me dumbledore i have things to attend to elsewhere millicent said curtly then on no account should you let me delay you further dumbledore replied politely lily and james had no time to hide and james didntlook as if he particularly wanted to the minister walked out and noticed the two james particularly he looked shocked as the boy in front of him stared defiantly back without a word the minister walked away hurriedly without a second look lily looked at james nervously who still hadntmoved and looked shell shocked one sentence kept running through his head over and over again and of course the potters he wants them all dead lily bit her lip james i lily started but james shook his head mistaking her just have the fucking trip lily he said but lily looked hurt no i didntmean i just wanted i she put a hand on his shoulder but james shrugged it off i get it look just go on without me i need to just go he said passively lily opened her mouth her heart ached for him and it hurt even more as she remembered that evening she had spent with his family but she knew he needed this and the more she clung onto him the more he would try to push her away so she nodded and watched him walk away feeling for the first time so helpless that it almost killed her with a reluctant heart lily walked into the room before her dumbledore didntlook surprised to see her miss evans sit down sit down you will want to discuss the graduation ball i presume lily merely nodded dumbledore looked at her for a second where james lily he asked quietly lily looked up at the headmaster not knowing what to say he he er he just he busy needed to think some things through lily finally managed dumbledore nodded understandingly and lily proceeded to explain albeit half heartedly the plans for the graduation ball all that week lily thought about james and became increasingly upset as he still refused to say more than two words to anybody though only lily knew why on top of that the exams were drawing ever closer and while her mind was stuck on james her mouth was continually ranting about exams i dontthink i ready do you know these are the most important tests we ll ever take they determine almost everything what if i get all t s even in charms what will i do where will i go i d have to go to a muggle uni and get a muggle degree and get a muggle job i dontwant to get a muggle job she cried looking at her friends for reassurance kayla looked annoyed adea resembled a ghost and jane kept glancing at adea lily kayla exclaimed what is the matter with you you re not the only one worrying about exams we all are i mean look at adea she looks as if she about to die the brunette jabbed a thumb over her shoulder but you dontsee her biting our heads off about it could you please just shut up she said thanks kayla adea said quietly kayla looked at her friend apologetically sorry i didntmean well i did but you know not in a horrible way lily spared a concerned glance for her best friend as well before returning to her previous state what do you mean can i please shut up how can you be so calm god i wish i could be like you what if i freak out so much that i completely mess up all of my exams she asked despairingly looking very possible right now kayla said tersely lily gasped oh my god she cried i need to calm down i need to calm down i need to calm down i cantdo it lily cried kayla abruptly grabbed lily by the shoulders and started to shake her lily get a grip you re losing your mind you re head girl for christ sake act like one she shouted at the red haired girl while continually shaking her jane intervened and prised kayla hands off kayla please refrain from manhandling lily she can give you a detention if she wants and lily take a few deep breaths inhale exhale inhale exhale now put it behind you let your mind be a mass of white space fresh and ready to absorb new things dontobsess over old things remember never dwell on anything so that it begins to consume you you came this close to letting it swallow you up jane said in a soothing voice lily took a final deep breath and smiled gratefully thanks jane i really sorry kayla she apologised kayla nodded it okay sorry i had to get aggressive i dontblame you if i was you i would ve slapped me the girls laughed and continued to walk onwards to the gryffindor common room they got to the portrait of the fat lady and went through the portrait hole after saying the password advento they were all too wrapped up in silent thoughts of exams and in lily case james that they didntlook behind them it was drawing near the seventh year curfew as it was a sunday night most people had gone upstairs to their beds james sat in the common room with a few of the older students he sat by the fire with that brooding expression that so often clouded his features as of late on entering the common room lily walked straight to him hey she whispered and sat next to him james didntlook at her but replied hey lily felt again as she had that day that great discomfort you experience when you know you are utterly useless in important situations where sirius and remus and peter have you talked to them her boyfriend still didntlook at her they re in our lounge not really james replied shortly have you told them about lily trailed off no oh lily looked at her feet as an awkward silence came upon them but the silence was cut short by an enquiry from kayla lily where adea she asked quietly lily looked around and remembered that she hadntseen adea come in where could she be she was right behind us the whole time jane was near the portrait hole and heard muffled sounds outside she stepped out of the portrait hole only to climb back in a second later wild eyed and frantic lily james come quick i found adea she cried and went back outside lily and kayla were worried now as well and james at finally looking at lily and seeing the concern in her eyes became worried too they strode over to the portrait hole and james stopped long enough to say nobody move just stay in here and then go to bed he ordered the remaining students in the room who now looked at the three seventh years confusedly when they first stepped out they heard cries come quick come quick somebody help her these cries they realised were being screamed by the fat lady kayla quickly quietened her down sssshhh shut up we re here the head boy and head girl are here we ve got it under control lily looked at the sight on the ground and screamed but was stopped by a hand covering her mouth and a firm voice in her ear don t you dontwant to attract too much attention there are too many questions involved lily stopped but her eyes continued to scream when kayla faced the sight her skin started to fade to a sickly yellow there lying on the ground was the seemingly unconscious body of adea qureshi she was sweating her arms were flailing and her head turned side to side almost violently it looked as if she was in a particularly horrific dream kayla fell to her friend side she held adea by the shoulders and shook her softly adea wake up wake up she whimpered but the girl didntstop and nor did she open her eyes lily knelt down now too adea say something what are you doing she cried kayla held the lying girl head in an attempt to stop it from moving stop it she cried but to no avail adea kept moving her head from side to side jane stepped back tears were rolling down her face and she would ve sobbed if she could find her voice but at that time it seemed impossible james saw this and said to lily jane has to be moved from here or she ll collapse too lily merely nodded so james took charge again jane go and get waqar now he on rounds tonight and according to his set route he should be at the library now that not far from here run jane nodded turned around started to run james positioned himself in between kayla and lily and picked up his friend lily and kayla followed him as he turned a corner where jane had gone not that long ago into a deserted corridor he conjured some blankets and laid adea down on them five minutes later waqar appeared jane in tow at first he looked concerned too but that was momentary and his face hardened he turned to james i need you to go and tell madame pomfrey we re coming soon as i ve done something about these three make sure you tell madame pomfrey the name she ll know what to do after that then stay in the hospital wing and wait for us waqar instructed james nodded and headed off in the direction of the hospital wing waqar then examined adea he put a hand to her forehead and noted that she was burning up and he remembered what adea had said in the train your skin feels like it on fire he remembered how her parents had handled this he turned sharply to kayla jane and lily you three stop it i ll explain it all in the hospital wing this has happened before you donthave to worry so much you re not helping her jane wiped her cheeks and took her own advice but taking deep breaths but it didnthelp for some reason waqar picked adea up and went down to the hospital wing with lily kayla and jane following after him quietly once they reached the hospital wing madame pomfrey scurried forwards looking at adea fleetingly put her down over there she pointed over at a bed beside which sat not just james but dumbledore as well lily found her voice long enough to be surprised to find her headmaster there as well professor dumbledore what are you but dumbledore merely nodded and said miss evans once adea had been set down dumbledore looked at the matron poppy you will need to excuse us for a minute and then you can get to work on miss qureshi he said madame pomfrey did not look happy at these arrangements but knew she really had no choice the dumbledore now looked at waqar expectantly making the others look at him in the same fashion waqar reached over to adea and removed a necklace from her neck it was a thick black string with some gold beads strung onto it at seeing jane expression waqar smiled and said it doesntdo anything it just a necklace jane nodded this necklace it has twenty two gold beads strung onto it keep that in mind okay the easiest thing is to get the worst over with adea she she has an illness a genetic disease which has a name i cantpronounce professor dumbledore will be able to explain it a better than i can they looked towards the headmaster who nodded gravely adea condition is due to a mutated form of the leglimency gene it needs a set time to develop properly otherwise you are merely left with what has developed adea was clearly not given enough time and she was born while it was only in its early stages she cannot penetrate others minds nor can she stop other people from penetrating hers because her gene was so underdeveloped she can merely tell when someone she has a certain mental bond with is unhappy dumbledore said and stopped again to let waqar go on kayla spoke up why is she so restless referring to adea continuously flailing arms and her head movements waqar sighed i suppose so far it doesntsound so bad quite cool even but there always a drawback she can tell when someone she cares about is unhappy because she gets an unpleasant warning it like a he walked over to kayla and thumped her on the arm not too hard kayla frowned and said ow what was you are kidding me waqar shook his head wish i was lily laughed but there was no mirth in it no no i sorry this is ridiculous dumbledore looked at the head girl whose eyes widened and she looked around so you re telling me that every time we re angry or upset or hurt adea feels a slight but actual pain waqar shrugged lily fell into a chair behind her kayla spoke again if she had this for so long how come she hasntbeen fainting all over the place waqar looked to adea who still had not gained full consciousness she learnt to deal with it it not been easy she done regrettable things and she gone through mental problems at different stages here waqar looked at james who looked like he just realised something sometimes though her body decides that it cantdo both things at once and so sort of gives way it doesnthappen often only when things get out of hand the worse you are the worse she is lily head was now in her hands back to this necklace have you never noticed it the girls exchanged glances and shook their heads it her own idea she calls it her reminder necklace each bead represents a person they re all the people she has a connection for lack of better word with they re in some sort of order of i dontreally know it makes more sense to adea he held the first bead this one is for her mother this one her father her sister me my mum and dad my sister my brother her brothers lily jane kayla her sister husband my sister husband my brother wife i know it sounds weird but it the kind of person she is she cares too much liyana my nephews and my niece gabrielle yes kayla even your sister and james nobody said anything so waqar carried on the problem with adea is that she nice and compassionate this kind of problem would be more suited to a slytherin who only cares for his own arse waqar forgetting that dumbledore was in the room her parents approach was for her not to make friends at all that why she was bullied terribly at junior school adea didntwant to do that when she came here so she came up with a new idea make a few close friends and then sort of live a half existence where only the people she chooses will know about her it stops her getting close to people without going insane he said everyone so tense about exams lily always in fits and almost everyone getting anxious at home because of the wedding she was okay i think but something must have sent her over the edge waqar explained lily and james exchanged glances it not life threatening and it doesntstop her from doing things i suppose it just annoying and inconvenient waqar said reassuringly he looked around and it seemed that they didnthave any more questions madame pomfrey was called back out and she set to work immediately she forced potions down the patient throat and performed cooling charms and finally let adea calm down promising that she should wake shortly they waited for a further hour and a half before some change in movement was seen in adea after madame pomfrey treatment her flailing arms and turning head had reduced to just twitching now they stopped moving altogether arms first and then head you could tell she d calmed down because her face had relaxed and she looked as if she was in peaceful slumber a few more minutes passed and she slowly opened her eyes the first person she saw was waqar she smiled at him and then put her hands to her face and ran them over the skin where am i in the she whispered hoarsely he nodded hospital wing he supplied adea suddenly remembered their deal that day on the train and turned over to see four faces staring at her blankly lily jane and kayla looked as if they couldntquiet word their thoughts adea looked ashamed and finally she managed i sorry this set them off seven years adea how did this never come up lily demanded it not that it never came up it just never seemed the right time the right time for what to tell your best friends quite possibly your biggest secret we ve been your best friends for seven years i ve told you everything and you never thought to give us the same amount of trust kayla cried waqar and james slipped out no i trust you of course i do i just i couldn t bring myself to kayla and i were in hysterics jane was crying do you know how it feels to see one of the people you care most about just collapsed on the floor looking like they re having a seizure adea held her head in her hands ugh she cried lily squealed as she remembered what her friend must be feeling i sorry adea cried kayla shook her head why though i was just sacred okay this is the reason i wasntallowed to make friends the reason my childhood was almost hell and i didntwant you to look like i d explode or as if i was an invalid she explained we d never do that lily said softly adea sounded like she was on the verge of tears but you couldntsee them really do you want me to get a mirror for your faces she sighed and looked downwards suddenly before anyone realised jane had wedged herself between kayla and lily and flung her arms around adea tears streamed from her silver eyes once again adea hugged her back and for the first time the girls saw her cry her face was hidden but her shoulders shook after watching the scene for a while kayla and lily joined in as well all of them shared a feeling of confusion which for some reason had just brought them closer a n sorry about this everybody i know it been ages but i hope you like it in answer to your question teresa hughes adea is of indian descent but not quite she is pakistani i chose that nationality simply because i wanted one of lily friends to be different and since j k rowling has already put two indian girls in the books there no harm in putting two pakistani people in my story right disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and anyone not in the books belongs to me a n guys this is the last chapter before the epilogue crying for yesterday the news of adea illness had shaken lily jane and kayla they spent their nights for the next week discussing adea childhood learning more about her and how everything had felt those eleven years in which they hadntknown her they also talked about how she d coped in the past seven years in more detail on top of everything lily situation with james hadntimproved by much although he was more prolific in his answers after the adea incident he was still distant with everyone what was worse was that he still hadnttold the marauders frustration was slowly replacing sympathy in lily mind she knew from experience that it would be easier for him and everyone if he just talked about it the problem was he just wouldn t all james ever did was go to lessons revise eat a little perform head duties and lock himself in his room and sleep lily still didntknow how to react and whether it would be okay to do what was on her mind and just shout at him or whether that would result in an unwelcome break up this continued for the next week and soon the saturday before the exams had fallen upon them people hardly spoke they just stayed cooped up revising page after page book after book spell after spell in a seemingly endless cycle the cycle did end however as the weekend fast drew to an end and the seventh years woke up to the morning on which their newts began their first exam was a written one history of magic lily knew she had revised well and that she knew the required information yet when time was up and the paper flew away from her desk she felt unsatisfied of course she still couldnttalk to james about it the break in between seemed like nothing as they went to the dungeons to perform their potions practical the practical required them to brew amortentia it was stressful especially under the critical eyes of the examiners but lily knew she had done alright when the smoke from her cauldron rose in spirals kayla however was not as sure her smoke was doing zigzags she stared at her potion willing it to spiral but to no avail no matter how much she silently pleaded with her cauldron the smoke would not spiral and though the scents were almost all right there was still the faint smell of mud among her desired ones after ten minutes of pleading with her cauldron she fell down onto her stool resignedly and held her head in her hands just wishing time would end afterwards lunch arrived nobody talked much their minds were plagued with exams even the marauders didntseem particularly bothered about james not speaking no one else was why should he have to the delightful lunch hour did not last and soon the seventh years were up again and off to charms theory this was one exam in which all four girls were confident they breezed through it and even managed small smiles when professor flitwick announced that time was up and summoned their papers the rest of the week inched by in a blur of stress and silence a few exams that stood out from the rest were the transfiguration practical in which a girl named sally winters fainted during saying the incantation to transfigure the given chair into a sheep the result being that the chair though still very much a chair had now sprouted a coat of wool and bleated every so often remus had reported to the others after his defence against the dark arts practical that lucius malfoy had had a bit of a problem according to remus the examiner had asked lucius malfoy to use his wand to pour water into a glass non verbally malfoy then closed his eyes and next thing anyone knew his examiner face began flashing different colours needless to say malfoy was not expecting an o before they knew it the exams they had been pressurised about for the past seven years were over and done with the seventh years were then faced with their last month or so in hogwarts their home away from home for seven years this cantbe right can it lily asked one day as she sat with her friends on the edge of the lake her shoes and socks sat beside her and her feet were settled in the water what is it seven weeks til the end of term no we have more time dontwe she asked looking round kayla smiled sadly and looked back at the magnificent castle behind her fraid not lils it all we ve got left with hogwarts the brunette said jane looked behind as well and started to converse with the castle oh hogwarts we ll miss you you wontforget us will you it wouldntbe fair seven years we ve had here you couldntpossibly forget us she reasoned her friends smiled quite used to her conversing with inanimate objects although hogwarts wasnta school or a building it was a part of their life what did she say adea asked jane who smiled she wontforget us she expects our kids running inside her in a decade or so jane recounted from her imagination lily laughed can you imagine our kids adea joined in yeah i can imagine jane child the purple haired girl looked intrigued oh she said yeah i see a girl waist length hair black with shocking pink streaks the other girls laughed at adea description same haunting beautiful silver eyes slightly larger though high cheekbones perfect nose same bizarre glazed expression do you see her adea asked her friends jane smiled widely and nodded lily spoke up oh i know kayla daughter gorgeous golden skin complexion hair like alethea s an outspoken intelligent child oh and adea s identical twin girls twins run in families you know oh and a little boy as well a miniature waqar she voiced the girls laughed and continued to talk about their future children who would roam the halls of hogwarts not unlike they had a few moments ago the morning of the girls hogsmeade trip had arrived that saturday every female seventh year and prefect had risen early to find an outfit and contemplate what colour they wanted to wear to the graduation ball on stepping into the lounge lily saw james sitting on the sofa as he did nowadays although on closer observation she saw something in his eyes it wasntthe normal glazed over faraway look his hazel eyes usually held now they were full of determination and something that seemed a lot like realisation she didntknow why maybe because she cared for james or maybe out of habit but she decided to tell james where she was headed off to even though she didntparticularly expect to him to respond james i going off to hogsmeade with jane kayla and adea she announced james looked at her the way he looked at her just then made lily stare his eyes were full of admiration fondness and something else she couldntmake out slowly he nodded she looked downwards turned and began to walk towards the door when he called out to her lily surprised at hearing his voice call her name she jumped and stared at him once more yes she asked hopefully james held her gaze a little longer and shook his head have a good time i guess he said quietly oh okay yeah sure lily replied she turned to leave again lily he called again yes uh never mind he said shaking his head once more she nodded and walked to the mahogany door as her hand reached out for the doorknob a bigger hand had taken hold of her wrist and before she could say a word she was being turned around she looked at james her eyes looked startled and were even more so when he leant in and kissed her when they broke away lily smiled brightly what was that for she asked james shrugged i haventkissed you in ages he said offhandedly lily laughed and kissed him again james who now wore a broad grin said quietly to lily thank you i know it not been easy for you to put up with me these past few weeks not everyone would ve done it i know but i i mean i um your welcome lily finished not quite able to say what she wanted as she thought about it she didntknow what it was she was having trouble saying to him she kissed him on the cheek and finally left their chamber once lily had closed the door behind her she began walking towards the entrance hall still happy at how james demeanour had changed all of a sudden she met her friends without saying a word she merely smiled okay ladies we have five hours to find four sets of dress robes we need to get shoes we need to get accessories possibly make up it a big job for five hours we must concentrate adea said lily laughed dee chill out we have another hogsmeade weekend i arranged it for you adea gave lily a piercing stare excuse me lily do you not understand the importance of this who said anything about buying this is the graduation ball this trip is all about searching next week is for buying we cantdo them both in one trip adea cried lily held her hands up in surrender okay okay i sorry i have seen the err of my ways honestly what was i thinking she quipped and grinned at jane adea and kayla didntcatch the sarcasm nor did they catch the grin as they led the way out of the entrance hall am i that out of touch that people find it weird to even talk to me how would you know it not like you ve let anyone talk to you to be able to find out lily she looked at me as if i was about to explode she looked so surprised when i said her name oh shit what will the guys say they ll want to kill me i ll have to tell them now oh yeah they re really going to kill you when they realise how long you ve gone without telling them shut up i dontneed that james ran a hand through his hair and left for the gryffindor common room as he climbed staircases and walked through numerous corridors he planned out what exactly he was going to say once he finally reached the common room and went through the portrait hole he found his friends huddled by the fire not an entirely unusual sight he joined them and all three of them looked up at him in confusion hey james said and smiled apologetically remus and peter smiled back and sirius positively grinned he got up and clapped his friend on the back welcome back mate james nodded listen about how i ve been acting but remus held up a hand it okay james you donthave to tell us he said placidly james frowned do you know why no but we figure you had your reasons sirius answered peter nodded tell us when you re completely ready to come out with it lily knows james said in a whisper sirius and remus shrugged we dontmind she would know i mean it you and her you guys are like almost married the latter said sagely james looked confused what but we haventeven said we love each other he reasoned it not needed though is it sirius said with you and lily it just sort of implied in just about everything you do you two are different jane and i have had problems and remus and kayla have had problems too doesntmean that we dontlove our girlfriends it just means we have to work harder to keep the peace but you and lily you just fit you know he finished james didntsay anything he thought on what his best friend had just said i guess we do i dontknow what i d do if we fought i couldntlive with myself i cantlive without her by my side did i just say that yes i think you did are you sure yes quite i couldnthave and yet you did i think i know what i have to do fine donttell me then okay i dontlike you that much anyway lils wear white whined kayla i want to wear black lily said i just think you should stick with green adea suggested change doesntdo one any harm jane said absently lily smiled thank you jane i glad someone on my side she said pointedly jane looked confused for a second before realisation dawned oh your welcome adea rolled her eyes as the kayla and lily resumed their juvenile argument over black and white being sensible she grabbed three beautiful sets of dress robes in lily size in the colours in question she walked back to the quibbling pair who hadntnoticed her absence it seemed that enough she whispered dangerously though it seemed as if she was shouting lily and kayla fell quiet immediately looking downwards you two are acting like children you are eighteen act it the pair of you adea reprimanded her friends looked ashamed while jane sifted through some nearby racks now i ve picked out some gorgeous robes for you lily in green white and black pick yourself she handed the robes to lily and saw kayla open her mouth to protest out of the corner of her eye kayla she warned the girl closed her mouth adea continued they re lily dress robes and she paying for it if she chooses a black set so be it lily smiled smugly and entered the nearest changing room she tried on the first set and examined her self nah these make me look kind of fat so those were out of the question and placed back on the hanger lily picked up the next pair hhhhmmmm these are slightly more promising she twirled in front of the mirror nah they re nothing special this is the graduation ball so those were put back on the hanger she put on the next set and gasped at her reflection perfect she stepped out to display the result to her friends who clapped quietly those are the ones you need to get lils adea said lily beamed and went back inside and put the robes back on their hanger to pay for them and give back the other two jane came back with a hanger in her hand she held up a set of robes up to her friends what do you think she asked the girls smiled and said definitely jane and lily were the last two who had needed robes having paid for their purchases the girls went onto the nearest shoe shop i feel like an ice cream come on dee can we stop for ice cream lily said and looked round to find an ice cream cart adea looked at her in an annoyed fashion lily we have a mission to complete she said as if stating the obvious the red haired girl rolled her eyes and used a new tactic what we canteven stop for say a double scoop of cherry and lemonade she said slowly knowing it was adea favourite the addressed girl looked slightly more lenient while kayla and jane watched on in amusement in a sugared cone and vanilla sprinkles on top lily continued her friend sighed and lily knew she d won the four girls took a small detour to buy some ice cream on acquiring their desired flavours they continued on to the shoe shop after the ice creams the four loosened up a little and even managed to laugh sometimes they wandered the streets of hogsmeade momentarily forgetting that in a few weeks they would no longer be able to walk together like this carefree and sheltered remus do you think jane and sirius will last kayla asked remus and kayla were sitting by the fire in the gryffindor common room kayla a head rested on his shoulder while his arm was draped around her shoulders the boy looked thoughtful truthfully i dontthink they will he answered but they love each other so much kayla argued they do cantargue with that but you asked my opinion and i gave it to you he concluded what about lily and james she enquired after a moment silence i think they re gonna last remus said without much thought and he felt kayla nod against him she hesitated with her next question d you do you think we will kayla asked quietly remus let the words float around in his head for a minute as he mulled them over do you want me to be honest he asked yes no i dontthink we ll last remus said solemnly kayla stayed silent for a few seconds before she added i think i agree neither said anything else for a while when i was about six i remember saying to my dad daddy will you always be around kayla started out of the blue he laughed and said no of course not i was rather shocked but comforted considerably when he added but i ll be around as long as you ll need me kayla snorted derisively before continuing well obviously that didntwork out for some reason i always connected his death to myself and that promise he made me after that i found it impossible to trust any male i suppose until you came along spending the past year with you has helped me overcome so many insecurities so many fears right now you re the one person who means most to me she finished contently and sighed the arm around her shoulders tightened its grip but if nothing to become of it why carry on remus asked clearly intrigued kayla smiled bittersweetly you ll laugh but i ve just remembered something my mum always says she mused i ll put it in her exact words kayla darling there are three things you need to do to ensure success in your life no matter where you are or what you do three things just three remember to always be five steps ahead of the future learn from your mistakes in the past but always live in the present the girl paused and closed her eyes for a moment it odd but the last one is the one people find most difficult most people while away their lives planning the future and dwelling on the past they forget about the present i dontwant to do that she trailed off and sighed again so i love you right now but i cantspeak for next year or even next month what to come will come but let see to today first remus filled in kayla lifted her head and smiled at him exactly she whispered and gave him a small kiss before putting her head back against his shoulder lily was busy writing her speech for the graduation day every day seemed to pass with increasing speed and the night before the ball was upon them while the other seventh year girls were busy catching up on their beauty sleep lily had other problems to tend to she looked up from her writing desk and glanced at the clock it read 7 00 she sprang up from her chair and rushed out into the lounge james was lying on his favourite sofa staring up into space lily was surprised that even in the hectic times in which they were currently wrapped up he still found time to sit around and do nothing james lily said snapping him out of his reverie and he offered her a small smile what are you doing she asked nothing he replied i can see that why are you doing nothing because there nothing to do james said with a shrug of his shoulders lily stared at him blankly you could pack she suggested dontwant to what about your speech have you finished it no he said offhandedly okay so how far have you gotten haventstarted it lily stared at him again james didntyou say you had problems with speeches lily asked i did because i do so why arentyou writing it beforehand well lily if you look at it my way there isntmuch need for writing it beforehand it not so much a speech as it is a farewell message to hogwarts and anything i need to say to hogwarts has no need for rehearsing i ll just say what i need to say and be done with it he explained sagely lily didntfall for his wise airs yeah sure whatever james when you have a breakdown up on that stage dontlook at me for help lily said as she rolled her eyes at his languor her eyes flitted to the clock again and she remembered why she had left her room come on we have to go and help set up in the hall james got up and stretched coming your highness lily rolled her eyes yet again but decided to play along we re already late lowly servant let go she said with a note of urgency she grabbed her james hand and led him out of the chamber they briskly walked up to hall and found the prefects assembled in the centre obviously in wait of the heads lily reached them and began her excuses sorry we re late the head boy couldntbe bothered to be on time the prefects nodded in response they didntseem too bothered a few smiled at the pair okay gryffindors you have to begin setting up the decorations for the memory wall ask the seventh years or call either james or myself ravenclaws your part in all of this is over so you can help the gryffindors with the decorations slytherins set up the area for the band and hufflepuffs run down the menu with us one last time then take it down to the elves and come back to organise where the tables are going to appear we ll help with the last part okay we have a long job in front of us and we all want to get out of here quickly so work fast lily ordered and turned to james who grinned at her no i donthave anything to add lily but thanks for asking he joked lily laughed oh sorry i get so caught up in being the head girl i going to miss it she said with a hint of sadness james looked sceptical what exactly are you going to miss the sleep depriving rounds the cheek of the younger students the hours of detentions we have to supervise for idiots who cantthink before they act he asked rhetorically while lily shook her head despairingly no the authority the feeling of power the satisfaction you get when you take off points and give out detentions she said mocking him james nodded oh yeah that i guess that was pretty cool lily laughed and gave him a kiss on the cheek before setting off to help with the charm work of the decorations the prefects and the head boy and girl worked steadily for the next couple of hours everything progressed smoothly and the only obstacle arrived in the form of the memory wall which was an excellent idea but as the gryffindors and ravenclaws soon discovered was an absolute nightmare to conjure it wasntlong before every ravenclaw and gryffindor prefect possible including the two heads were huddled in front of the wall in question the charm for the memories is simple enough lily mused yeah but how do we get it so that they reflect upon the whole wall remus asked and what about the illusion that not easy magic james said they stared at the wall for a further fifteen minutes contemplating different methods to achieve their goal all of which had a defect of some sort in it some of the prefects had taken a seat on the cold stone floor of the great hall we could do everything one by one estrella fonseca suggested lily head turned sharply to stare at the sixth year girl she looked intrigued elaborate she said simply all the prefects were now looking estrella she cast an unsure glance at them all and described her thought in more detail well instead of finding a way to do everything at once we could split up so say a couple of us go and find some books on how to perform the illusion part while the rest could stay here and take it on bit by bit so say insert the memories first then find a way to project it onto the whole wall then establish the parameters for the illusion by that time we ll be back with the books and we ll find a spell and practise it and then perform it on the wall she finished the seventh years exchanged glances that seemed simple enough i wonder why no one else thought of it james said little by little the wall furthered its progress the memories had been placed inside by lily and some other ravenclaws hufflepuffs were asked to help with this too in case they had any memories to share slytherins were deliberately excluded from that exercise waqar came up with an idea for the projection to reach the entire wall james remus and the other prefects helped place the parameters for the illusion by the time the parameters had been set up the six who had gone down to the library had returned with a couple of books they then spent the next hour or so flipping through the pages to find an adequate spell eventually after searching through numerous books considering many spells they hit upon one which seemed to fit their purpose the next task was being able to actually perform the spell successfully the sixth years had handed the job over to the seventh years but remained in the hall to watch the slytherins had long since finished their job and had left the hall without a further enquiry the hufflepuffs had insisted on staying to help lily thanked them but assured them that they had enough people working on it as it was and told them to rest for the night lily tried first by making an illusion of a goblet appear she pictured the goblet in her mind and shouted calumniorari immediately a goblet appeared on the floor she exchanged glances with james he reached out to the goblet and ran his hand through it nothing stopped him he grinned and brought his hand back again his hand felt as if it was just moving around in the air but looked as if it was penetrating through the goblet with a wave of her wand the imaginary goblet disappeared the prefects were smiling and looked hopeful but not for long guys that was just a goblet we need to have to do this for a whole wall the prefects went back to looking dejected lily imagine something bigger imagine a trunk james suggested his girlfriend shrugged and closed her eyes she said the incantation and a trunk appeared well half of it did lily slowly opened her eyes and stared at the unusual image before her oh dear she commented estrella bit her lip but continued being hopeful dontworry about it lily it was your first go try again she encouraged it took lily three more attempts to make an illusion of a whole trunk appear she continued to make the targeted objects bigger and slowly she began gaining more confidence with the spell until almost two hours later they finally reached the point of having to make the wall appear okay lily concentrate james said he too along with remus had been practising the spell but they had decided that lily would be the best person for this job not only did she have to make a colossal wall appear but she had to manage it so that the illusion would hold until a certain distance lily inhaled deeply and imagined the wall once she thought the picture clear enough she said calumniorari she opened her eyes to find nothing there a fifth year ravenclaw prefect ran further on to opposite end of the hall and called you can see about an eighth of the wall from back here lily frowned james put his arms around her it is something right he tried but it was in vain for lily perfectionist character was not satisfied over the next hour she tried countless times to achieve perfect results and got closer every time but she was getting tired james help me she cried helplessly how he asked i dontknow do something lily whined i wish i could waqar had been sat in a corner thinking over the situation he walked up to the head boy and girl why dontyou two try it together stand next to each other imagine the wall and maybe your combined magic will help something that big appear he suggested quietly james and lily looked at each other and he shrugged no harm in trying is there lils she smiled and shook their head i know you re tired but we have to do this so focus remus said lily and james shut their eyes and imagined the wall remus counted to three and both of them shouted calumniorari they reopened their eyes and saw a gigantic wall before them lily started laughing and hugged james who grinned back everyone looked relieved it was getting late waqar walked to the back of the hall and strode towards them he stopped at where they were standing and looked impressed you did it works just as it was supposed to thank god one of the other prefects cried everything was ready for the following evening the decorations were going to be disguised by the teachers for the following day until it was time for the ball finally the prefects dispersed and trudged back to their dormitories to partake in some well earned sleep lily and james made it back to the head lounge and sank down onto the three seater james lay down and held lily i am so tired james said me too lily replied but smiled feebly but we did it james she said proudly james nodded yeah they better watch out for us we re too powerful for all their asses he joked they stayed quiet and remained where they were and it wasntlong until they fell asleep ugh what time is it lily opened her eyes just a little and found sunlight pouring into the room streaming through the windows to which the curtains had forgotten to be drawn lily groaned and with an effort fully opened her eyes a quick look around told her that she d fallen asleep in the lounge another look told her she d fallen asleep in the lounge with james lily sighed as she discovered how unwilling she really was to remove herself of her current position it was comfortable and secure lily turned to look at james his hair was more unruly than usual his glasses were askew and yet his face held an almost contradictory look to his appearance he looked completely and utterly at peace lily smiled at seeing his face it weird but this feels right is that the word i want yes i think it is oh you again dontworry for the first time ever i ll agree it is rather nice james groaned and opened is eyes a little eyes a pair of green eyes the sight made him wake up a little more as he asked incredulously lily the girl in question smiled good morning she whispered james looked around and noticed that he wasn t as he had thought in his room he looked back at his girlfriend questioningly the lounge he asked lily nodded that spell really drained us i remember sitting down here but we must ve fallen asleep she concluded he removed his arm from lily waist and sat up it a saturday right he asked lily nodded come on we have to go see to a few last minute things i want you back here in ten minutes okay she ordered james grinned yes ma am lily hit him playfully before leaving for her room on entering lily glanced at her watch and found it was 10 o clock she quickly showered brushed dressed and tied up her hair and put on a minimal amount of make up after completing this flurry of activity she left to meet james in the lounge james was already there and the two set off for the hall immediately they reached the hall to find the seventh year prefects assembled in the hall lily and james met them and apologised for their unpunctuality the slytherins sneered but the others just shook their heads and the gryffindors confessed that they d only arrived five minutes ago themselves lily and james immediately began the last minute checklist everything was vouched for in the positive until they came to butterbeer order arrived about that started rosalie a hufflepuff seventh year lily looked at her with a questioning glance it late it was expected two hours ago we asked dumbledore if we could go see what the problem was and when we went madam rosmerta said she was short on staff and she d get it over as soon as possible the girl explained quietly lily looked panicked as soon as possible how soon is as soon as possible she asked rosalie shrugged i have no idea but she promised to have it over at least before 6 o clock lily eyes widened 6 o clock the ball due to start at half past seven lily exclaimed i know i so sorry the hufflepuff replied looking guilty lily took a deep breath no dontbe it not your fault it not even madam rosmerta s it her staff fault lily muttered james took charge okay i presume you ve instructed madam rosmerta to have it sent it over to the kitchens the hufflepuffs nodded okay go and tell the elves to be expecting it anytime if it hasntarrived by 5 o clock come find me in the head lounge and i ll take care of it apart from that if everything done you can go he dismissed the prefects dispersed and only he and lily were left already things are going wrong lily complained with a frown james shook his head it just one thing the butterbeer will get here i ll make sure of it james assured i wanted things to be perfect lily said as he hugged her they never are but i promise to provide you with the nearest thing james soothed lily looked up into his hazel eyes and found herself smiling thank you for being so great about everything she whispered you re welcome now go i know you ll want to spend the day being all girly with your friends he said lily laughed flounced out of the room after kissing james jane walked into the seventh year boy dormitory to see sirius on entering it she found her boyfriend sitting on his bed he had a letter in his hand and a sour expression on his face jane sat down nest to him what the matter she asked sirius hadntseen her come in and so was surprised to hear her voice he turned and looked at her and attempted to smile jane held out her hand sirius stared at it for a moment and then stared into her eyes before handing over the letter sirius we had a nice summer last year without you donttake the trouble of coming home again i ve heard your fool of an uncle has left some money for you make some use of it i hope you realise now that you will have to go out into the world without help how much you ve ruined your life you are or were rather a black you could ve had all the wealth you needed any post in the ministry you desired your name would be respected and known now you re nothing a disgrace to your family we had such hopes for you and you broke my heart you acted in the most ungrateful manner associating with mudbloods and muggle lovers and half breeds i ve heard from regulus that you date a mudblood i suppose no respectable pureblood girl would even think twice about you anymore furthermore consider this the last letter you will ever receive from your mother i do not much feel like taking pains to communicate with you be grateful for this your mother jane dropped the letter as if it burned she looked to sirius whose eyes held a mixture of fury hatred and disgust and even pain jane put a gentle hand on his shoulder sirius she whispered but was met with silence the silence told her enough did you hope for it to be different jane asked sirius looked at her once their eyes met hesitation came to an end i knew something like this would happen but at the back of my mind i think i sort of wished it wouldn t he paused a moment why me why do i have to be born into a family so heinous he asked oh you re not the only one almost every slytherin is cursed with a family like yours unfortunately for them they donthave someone like you to even suggest that the ideas they ve been fed since birth are even a little wrong jane argued she hugged and gave him a kiss jane then stared him in the eye and said rather defiantly i love you and whether you like it or not this mudblood going to be hanging around for a little longer sirius couldnthelp but smile he watched her lie down and look up at him i love you he said simply jane smiled and sprung up again excellent now if you dontmind i have a shower to take so if you ll excuse me she said sirius grinned jane gave him another kiss before gliding out of the room it was three hours before the ball for the female attendees the preparation period had officially begun they assembled in their dormitories and started the pre ball arrangements while the boys mused over how it could possibly take anyone three hours to get ready for anything lily had once again decided to get ready with her friends the dressing up part of an evening contributed so much to the overall enjoyment of the impending event that really it was unimaginable that she should do it alone in the last week before they left once again adea was busy running around picking out makeup for her friends to wear with their dresses and formulated plans for jane hair lily and jane meanwhile were doing their nails while kayla was attacking her eyelashes with her wand of course the responsibilities and frantic enquiries were left to adea for handling dee will you do my hair lily called yes lily of course i will what about mine jane asked i thinking on it as we speak what shoes do you think i should wear adea kayla asked i ll look at them in a minute but i thinking flats two hours later things had gotten a little more harried the girls sans jane were running in different directions tripping over and the occasional cry of shit or oh god help me could be heard as they stepped on heels of varying sizes and rejected earrings which had carelessly been thrown on the floor by jane or kayla adea was the first to finish then lily kayla was panicking jane was rather calmer adea and lily tended to both of them and their requirements lily unfortunately was left with kayla kayla anxiety induced lily and the two of them created quite an amusing scene for their other two friends who bravely kept straight faces and only wished they had a camera handy lily was wearing a set of gorgeous off white robes made of a wonderful floaty material it had a v neck which went down to a barely revealing and comfortable level a silver band brought the sides of the robes tight to her waist before they billowed out again her red locks had been left to cascade down to the middle of her back in their natural waves she had given herself a fringe which gave her look a nice edge in terms of jewellery she had chosen to wear the chain of freshwater pearls she had received at petunia wedding her shoes were of off white satin creased in certain places and had heels which were perfectly suited for dancing her make up was light and understated adea wore robes of georgette in a shade of dusk pink a wide belt of satin went around the middle which accentuated her tiny waist perfectly the length was above average but not ridiculous and created a nice train she was wearing a necklace of pink sapphires with matching earrings adea had curled the ends of her hair and put half of it up since neither she nor waqar were fond of dancing she could afford to wear heels of a much more painful height she had chosen shoes which added a good 3 inches to her tiny height of 5 3 adea had opted for her trademark dark eyes accompanied by soft gold eyeshadow jane was wearing robes of midnight blue satin they were sleeveless and extended to the edge of her shoulders and v neckline identical to lily s they were neither loose nor form fitting and finished off just past the knees she wore a silver chain with a diamond locket and small diamond studs her hair was jet black with cosmo blue streaks and had been forced into angel curls and a swept to the side fringe she wore flat shoes like kayla fashioned on the style of ballet shoes with a ribbon which tied around the ankle jane too had chosen dark eyes and made them appear smokier than adea s a light pink blush could also be seen highlighting her cheekbones kayla wore extravagant robes of lavender silk in the place of sleeves stood three thin straps on each shoulder the robes were full length and like lily robes a small plum coloured band tied around the waist before the robes billowed out once again half of her natural chestnut brown curls had been pinned up and she had decided on very light make up her shoes were flat and of plum satin and she wore a necklace of amethysts the four friends were ready for their entrance lily was to go down first then jane then kayla and lastly adea lily descended the staircase like she had at halloween attracting attention james grinned broadly at the sight of his girlfriend she walked over and looked at him expectantly beautiful james managed and this seemed enough for lily james offered her his arm and the two exited the gryffindor common room in high spirits it was now jane turn as she made her way down sirius eyes became fixated to her once she had reached him he attempted to speak i you i mean jane smiled absently and said that just what i wanted to hear sirius laughed and together they left the room kayla now glided down the staircase the sight of her made remus smile he d always had a way with words so when kayla reached him he said breathtaking isntenough for you kayla beamed and he led her out adea turn arrived but no one knew waqar waited eagerly and smiled as he heard her familiar footsteps he waited for her and said what do you want me to say silence would be perfect then silence you shall have the two friends then left the common room side by side lily and james led the way into the hall and smiled at hearing the gasps behind them they walked to the side of professor dumbledore who waited until everyone was seated to begin speaking welcome to this year graduation ball i admit i dontbelieve i have ever attended a graduation ball as spectacularly presented and for that we must thank the head boy and girl and the prefects for their efforts the students applauded until dumbledore began again and now i know you wish to hear me no longer and so i have the pleasure to introduce to you the manic manticores a huge roar of approval erupted as a slow tune started up and now if our head boy and girl would lead us into the dancing lily james if you will james led lily onto the dance floor they positioned themselves right and began to dance gracefully to the music james leaned in and whispered so what d you think it perfect she whispered back other couples had now joined them but they didntnotice come on let go to the wall i think you ll like this memory james muttered and they danced towards the illusion as they approached the wall lily noticed that it was displaying a scene containing her first year self and james it was the time james had first begun to like her and funnily enough it showed lily screaming at him lily laughed oh god i remember that she said yeah good times james said lily looked up at him and said who d have thought you and me together james chuckled and said as if stating the obvious i did lily stared at him a little longer and then put her head against his shoulder on a nearby table sat adea and waqar quietly observing seven years waqar began seven years of being invisible how do you feel he asked adea thought about it rather good for seven years i haventbeen hated or disliked or bullied or teased it feels pretty good she answered they shared a smile and began talking of other things jane looked at the other couples and suddenly felt like dancing too she turned to sirius and said would you like to dance the boy looked amused arentguys supposed to ask girls he enquired not in my books jane replied sirius batted his eyelashes jokingly well then i would be honoured he said in a high pitched voice jane rolled her eyes and led the way to the dance floor remus and kayla were dancing close to the memory wall but hadntpaid it much attention they were too content with the company to want anything else kayla noticed some fairies flitting in the distance the decorations are amazing she commented i think i allowed to take some credit remus said making her smile kayla finally turned to the wall and was surprised it showed her in her third year before her father death just laughing it was her genuine laughter where her cheeks flushed and her eyes began to sparkle what that doing there kayla asked remus looked too and grinned it one of my favourite memories he said casually and held her closer the ball raced with time complaints were seldom the hufflepuffs had once again produced a fantastic menu containing a variety of excellent food the music was of course brilliant and the butterbeer remained safe lily had charmed it to not admit foreign substances however when time is being spent with pleasure it likes to fly and so before they knew it midnight had fallen and lily and james had to call an end to the ball and request that everyone return to their dormitories a request which was not met with eager ears after seeing everyone out lily and james proceeded to the head chamber james had fallen unusually quiet and lily was doing all the talking it was great wasntit she asked he nodded we did well didntwe he looked at her and watched her eyes sparkle and glisten with contentment his mind became even more resolute in its goal upon reaching the lounge james finally spoke up i need to talk to you before you go about some things lily stared at him for a second and immediately took a seat in the nearest armchair eager to listen and understand james sat down too and with and deep breath began i know that after the conversation we heard between dumbledore and bagnold i haventbeen the most communicative person i ve thought a lot about everything for the first week i just kept denying it all but it dawned on me that it probably going to happen i will be murdered i ve gotten quite used to it now lily heart ached oddly at hearing him say that i know it going to happen so i started concentrating on how i can make my life better what should be my priorities who should be my priority who is going to make me happiest before i die and it always came down to one person he looked lily square in the eye you that was it i knew if i had you with me i d the die the happiest of wizards and i realised exactly how much i actually love you it a feeling that become so much a part of me over the weeks that i sort of overlooked it but it clear as ever i love you he glanced at her expectantly lily was suddenly struck by the depths of his hazel eyes she stared at them and found herself saying i love you too when she thought back on it lily realised that she like james had sort of dismissed it it had become so much a part of their relationship james smiled slightly and continued i was hoping you d say that i thought more about it and came to a conclusion to be happy is one thing to be satisfied another i want to be both when i die i want to know i ve done everything possible i dontwant to miss anything most importantly i dontwant to have to spend a day without you without knowing you re beside me in everything i do and i beside you for everything too lily inwardly gasped james speech was taking a frightening turn and she wasntentirely sure she wanted to know what was around the corner lily i dontwant you to think i ve rushed into this decision because i haven t it all i ve thought about all i think about i know we ve only been going out for four months but if i feel like this there nothing else to do with a another meaningful glance he got down on his knee and lily gasped out loud will you marry me as she looked at him say this lily noticed the underlying hope in his eyes she looked at them for a moment but reached a decision of her own get up james she whispered james obliged and sat down with a worried expression why does that sound as if you re planning to say no he asked hesitantly lily sighed and voice sounded as if she was on the verge of tears because i am james you dontexpect me to go through with this and it got nothing to do with weak feelings dontthink that for a second but but i just cantlet you marry me we re eighteen eighteen that too young we haventeven left school james you may love me now but i know you ll meet a girl a thousand times better than me somewhere out there and when you do i dontwant to be in the way of your happiness i dontwant you to rue the day you met me i dontwant to be an obstacle i wouldntbe able to live with myself if i was the source of your unhappiness i dontwant you to ruin your life because you were scared of dying alone james you re an idiot if you cantsee that that what this is all about you re afraid just like happiness and satisfaction fear and unhappiness are two different things i cantlet you suffer from them both james i love you i really do but because i love you i cantsay yes for your sake lily got up abruptly and headed straight for her room james hadntmoved he couldn t he couldntargue and reason because he couldntfind the words his stomach had taken a nauseating plunge his thought process had taken an icy pause and his heart beat slowly but loudly lily reached out for the door handle and her eye caught on a piece of crumpled scrap parchment at her feet this immediately set her mind reeling thoughts and memories she d buried suddenly resurfaced and she remembered the dream that dream she d had back in december which she had deliberately forgotten her sister the baby that letter it came back now more clearly than before and one line seemed to echo throughout her restless mind killed both your sister and her husband james potter lily stood rooted to the spot for several minutes before she finally started thinking rationally it never did seem like just a dream this has already been planned this is what i have to do if i dontnow i ll have to later it going to happen i canthelp that lily turned on her heel yes she said firmly james looked up and stared yes you ll marry me he asked yes i think i will lily answered you think lily stared at her boyfriend and shook her head no i will i will marry you she said mechanically she felt a headache coming on we ll talk in the morning i need to sleep she said abruptly went into her room changed and collapsed onto the bed lily woke the following morning to another enchanting day the weather was identical to that of the day before light fought the white of her curtains birds could be heard in the distance the trees were as alive as ever of course today she was in her own room and there was no james james oh god lily mumbled the tired smile slid off her face and was replaced by an expression of dread the previous night events hit her like a ton of bricks one sentence particularly struck her i will marry you lily groaned oh god i engaged she looked at her hand but found no ring she rose and put on her dressing gown after brushing as quickly as she could lily padded out into the lounge but saw no james a glance in his room told her he was still sleeping james lily whispered she moved closer james she called and prodded him he made a slight sound and opened his eyes lily he asked she nodded james sat up and lily sat down too about last night she started but james held up a hand i was being stupid we ve only been going for four months and you were right i was afraid of dying alone but lily shook her head no i said yes willingly and if the offer still stands then she trailed off james looked ecstatic you mean you will he asked lily nodded but you need to know something lily proceeded to explain her dream to him which had visited her again last night so that why you changed your mind james said lily looked guilty i do love you though she said james smiled i dontwant you to do this if it just because of a dream he said but lily shook her head no you see it wasntjust a dream it was more than that i just think if i dontsay yes now i ll say it later so really i just saving time she explained if you re sure you re going to have to give me some time to get used to it and comfortable that all lily said of course lily whatever you want but you might want this he went to a drawer and took out a small black velvet box lily gasped as she saw the ring inside it was gorgeous it was very elegantly styled a white gold ring set with a cluster of princess cut diamonds lily stared in delight at the ring and made james grin you want it he asked lily looked at him and nodded mutely james slipped the ring onto her finger and she flung her arms around him oh this makes it so official she cried happily and kissed him she broke away mind if i kept this to myself for a few days so the whole thing can be just mine for a couple of days lily asked of course again whatever you want james said this doesntmean i completely okay with everything it just sweetens the deal a little lily stated with a grin i know he replied lily hugged him again and went back into her room to change the week passed in sadness and remorse the seventh years spent most of their time outside and by the arrival of the last day only the slytherins seemed upbeat james and lily had kept their engagement well hidden and managed to conceal it from their friends lily had spent the week contemplating her situation and was gradually coming to the conclusion that the dream must ve been real and the engagement she found was not as restricting as she d imagined though she wasntentirely comfortable with it she couldntdeny that the idea of being james fianc e wasntgrowing on her they couldntdelay the arrival of the last day and it had arrived to their dismay without fail the seventh years had been gathered in the hall for their own personal farewell before the whole school joined them to hear dumbledore speak lily and james were of course required to make their parting speeches and hopefully bestow wisdom throughout this past year as you know i ve been your head girl it been no picnic i ve shouted myself hoarse on several occasions interrupted more rendezvous than i d like to remember broken up more fights over quidditch than i ve had nightmares and handed out an unimaginable number of detentions began lily in august i was ecstatic at finding i had been awarded the position of head girl an honour i thought by the first week back i wanted to march into professor dumbledore office and throw the badge back in his face no offence professor it was a nightmare however as the year moved on so did i i began to appreciate my duties a little more each round became a learning experience i stopped many fights and though i was furious almost always i still marvelled at how many people would risk black eyes and broken bones for their house the rendezvous were annoying and yet i smiled inwardly at what i would call young love i sure teachers have a different take on the term though at times the love was presented to me in a more explicit manner than i would ve liked and here she glanced at kayla and remus it was still cute most of the time aside from the learning experience there were the added benefits of a beautiful room and a bathroom of my own which after six years of sharing with two other girls was greatly appreciated i also had a big lounge of my own okay i had to share occasionally but the company wasntawful which brings me to the purpose of this speech if when i leave today someone asked me what was the one most important thing i learnt this year my answer wouldntbe the learning experience of the rounds though it has been great nor would it be anything i learnt in a classroom with all due respect professors to be honest with you the most important thing i learnt this year is how to accept the beauty of people i d be lying if i said that in september i was a wonderful person that i was all that is good never judged a book by its cover etcetera the truth is i was for lack of better word a cover judge first impressions meant everything i was so wrapped up in what i saw on the surface of people that i never stopped to think that there might be something behind i didntknow that you couldntreally understand a person until you d stripped them of their mask lily smiled at james who winked at her i ve since discovered that we all wear a mask we might not realise it though whether that mask hides a more or less beautiful person is a different matter i ve learnt that no matter how much you may love a person you can never really know them until they re ready to let you in and sometimes that the hardest thing to do lily smiled in adea direction as of today we re all embarking on a new journey in some respects a new life in a year time you may not remember my name i certainly wontremember all of yours but to me we ll always be connected by the seven years we ve braved together in between these very walls and so as this chapter of our lives ends i d like to wish you all the best for the next one thank you lily concluded and sat down with flushed cheeks as she heard the loud applause james squeezed her hand and got up to deliver his own speech once he stood up lily was surprised to see him pull out a piece of paper i ll warn you all now though i have an abundance of talent in other areas speech making is not one of them james cleared his throat before beginning one thing that strikes me most about my years here and what i d like to focus on for now is the fact that i never really appreciated hogwarts until this year and like lily i ve learnt a lesson that i ll never forget though mine doesntsound nearly as impressive i ve learnt the skill of true observation to take everything in because otherwise you might just miss the object of most value coming back to hogwarts i d never actually looked at it until this year the beauty of the castle the icy grounds in winter the numerous trees even the whomping willow my eyes were opened by two people one of their names i sure you can guess the other is someone i sure we ve all wondered about at some point of our hogwarts days i d like to tell you a bit about adea qureshi i not going to show you who she is or tell you what she looks like i just want to tell you about who she is if i had to sum adea up i would recite a long list of adjectives that would apply to her pretty funny intelligent kind caring and on and on it would go i met adea purely by chance i was bored one night at dinner my friends were preoccupied out of desperation i forced myself to look harder for someone interesting one face intrigued me i d never seen it before and so i walked over and introduced myself and so began our friendship she taught me to learn more about myself as a person she helped me to polish my principles and views she helped me discover the differences between the many emotions the most important thing that she did for me relates to the first person i sure you re all aware of mine and lily story and were just as astonished as i was when we finally began going out the reason for lily accepting what must ve been my 1000th attempt was the fact that i was a changed person a change i d made for the better and that i wholly attribute to adea qureshi lily and adea friendship and the former affection opened my eyes to the essence of beauty not the kind you see in people but the kind you see everywhere else prior to this year i had been blind to it i started to respect my teachers my class mates and even the younger pupils for the first time i accepted responsibility and found that it wasntquite as repulsive as i had thought it to be i began to notice how remarkable hogwarts is how genius accommodating and brilliant it is hogwarts would mean very little to me if i hadntbefriended adea qureshi even in the short time that i ve really known it hogwarts has come to mean almost as much to me as my home hogwarts has a life a character that no other building seems to possess and for that only hogwarts itself can be thanked and so my advice to you as head boy is that when you walk into a room for god sake look carefully dontbe entranced by what seems to be the most interesting object because sometimes it the least visible that are most prized thank you james finished to a large round of applause lily beamed at him and said teasingly what happened to not rehearsing it james grinned back and said i never said i wouldntplan it to which lily only rolled her eyes soon the younger students entered the hall and dumbledore assembly began lily looked around at the familiar faces some friends some enemies some enemies who were now friends she reminisced about how many laughs she had shared with the castle how many tears and how many memories tears didntsurface now but inside she was bawling later on as lily and james ordered the students to board for the last time and joined their friends in the head compartment she found she couldntstop one tear from breaking through her barrier just one tear one tear for hogwarts one tear for seven years one tear for the birth of magic in her life lily sat on the velvet seats discreetly fiddling with her ring james had his arm around her and smiled at her making her look up so when do you want to tell them he asked next week after we ve told our parents and had it okayed and everything she replied after some thought james nodded in agreement that probably best sad he asked after another moment lily thought longer on this half and half any crying that needs to be done is going to be done right here when i leave that platform i want to welcome the possibilities of tomorrow and leave yesterday a memory well said james answered lily thoughts began to swim around her i glad you re here or else i d be bored james laughed glad that all i good for he joked lily smiled too god i have no idea where i going she commented more to herself than anyone else james ran a hand through her titian hair and said but i ll make sure you get there the end a n sigh so it over last one before the epilogue no sad farewell notes yet dontget your hopes up i ll leave that for the epilogue but guys would you be extra nice and try and leave me a review so i can achieve the 100 anyway dontforget to come back for the epilogue disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea and kayla and anyone not in the books belong to me a n so here it is the epilogue wow how sad is this well for me anyway the farewell note or whatever you wanna call it is at the bottom so read first epilogue welcoming tomorrow and so ends the story of four friends each girl unique and from a completely different walk of life each with a different temperament and yet when they finally parted there were no four friends quite so close no i dontmean that day at king cross when i said finally parted they had a little time together after that but not too long lily fulfilled her promise she d shed her one tear and all trips to memory lane were ended and saved for another rainy day in the foreseeable future on the platform the potter and evans families met on good terms and each member was delighted with the others much to james and lily advantage the parents were informed on the evans side there were nothing but blessings the potters needed more convincing however and so lily was invited to spend a week at the manor and all doubts and fears were thus eradicated lily and james were two halves of a whole she was good for him and her influence on him was more than visible and did a lot in her favour after informing the parents came the daunting task of informing the friends and for some reason telling their friends seemed more terrifying than telling their parents kayla adea jane and the marauders were assembled at lily house for the explaining the meeting went something like this kayla and remus were sat on a sofa quietly talking adea and jane were seated on chairs and sirius was on the floor resting his head against jane knees peter had been unable to make it sirius and remus promised to fill him in on whatever was to be revealed in the gathering while remus and kayla talked and laughed the other three looked on expectantly james was standing in front of them waiting patiently for lily to appear it was 10 o clock and lily hadntbeen given time to get ready after waiting a further five minutes she appeared in the living room with a nervous smile on her face finally kayla cried and got up to hug her lily laughed in a way that matched the expression on her face perfectly she hugged her friend back and then hugged jane and adea then she went to stand by james who gave her a reassuring squeeze of the hand before she started okay what we want to tell you is really important so listen before you talk i know you ll be tempted lily glanced at sirius who was glancing out of the window staring at her neighbour who was gardening confusedly jane smacked him around the head lily rolled her eyes sirius will you listen it important she asked he nodded lily now looked at james to continue he swallowed before saying okay well you know the night of the graduation ball well after we got back i sort of well proposed to lily four mouths instantaneously opened but lily was too quick and help up a hand before they got a chance to say something hang on let him finish she said james continued after a bit lily gave in and said yes and so well you know we re engaged now silence no one said a word their five friends exchanged glances and then lily spoke up we didnttell you right away because we wanted to make sure our parents were okay with the situation before telling you but we ve had their consent and now we just need yours she finished sirius was the first to speak he got up and clapped james on the back and hugged lily congratulations mate he said to james and then turned to lily congratulations to you as well lils you guys are gonna be perfect together oh and i hope you can cook because you know i cantand well he trailed off and lily laughed at the implications remus was next to speak congratulations you two you ve done the right thing there couldntbe two more suited people in the world james thanked him and lily beamed that what she had wanted to hear lily looked at jane whose eyes were glazed over jane lily said jane looked at her and said abruptly do you think you ve thought this through lily was a little taken aback but nodded nevertheless do you think this is the right thing to do do you have any doubts jane asked lily thought a little longer on these questions but finally said yes and no jane smiled affectionately well that all i wanted to know congratulations lily sighed in relief and hugged her friend excitedly all eyes turned to kayla who looked a little doubtful well kayla what do you think lily asked anxiously kayla looked around and bit her lip i hate to seem the bad guy but i dunno lils she voiced lily looked crestfallen she had counted on the support of all her friends kayla got up to face lily head on i know james is for you you two were practically sculpted for each other i know it i can see it at the same time but you ve been going out for like five months that not enough and you re eighteen i mean come on guys i just think you should ve waited a little longer gotten to know each other more and what not lily smiled sadly and was greatly tempted to tell her friend about her dream but she didn t kayla this is me you re talking to dontyou think i ve thought about all of that do you honestly think i ve rushed into something as important as this she reasoned kayla looked lily hard in the eye of course not kayla conceded and hugged her redheaded friend lily beamed and hugged kayla back when they broke away kayla shook her head dontknow what i was thinking of course you wouldnthave rushed into this it you you never rush into anything lily smile grew wider if possible jane and adea exchanged smiling glances james caught the exchange and cleared his throat sirius remus why dontwe go meet adam and rosalind lily parents james suggested the boys walked out of the room and the girls could soon hear james call hang on i ve left my wand in the living room you go on and appeared before them again in a minute lily rolled her eyes smooth kayla quipped shut up james replied and they all turned to look at adea she looked back at them and then sighed ah well knew it was coming do you think we re doing the right thing lily asked adea smiled at her nervous friend now i not one to oppose marrying young the others smiled at the witticism but i with jane do you think you re doing the right thing adea asked in reply to lily question james and lily exchanged glances yes i ve had a couple of weeks to think on it and i think i am doing the right thing lily answered confidently adea shrugged well then that all that matters isntit she commented lily looked ecstatic and flung her arms around her pretty best friend yes thank you thank you thank you she squealed adea rolled her eyes and laughed at lily enthusiasm behind her back james winked at her and left again to join remus and sirius lily james jane sirius kayla and remus joined the order of the phoenix a few weeks afterwards adea had been advised not to get involved as dumbledore reckoned she wouldntbe able to handle it very well the prophecy involving harry was revealed to dumbledore not long after that and lily and james had to move up their wedding as a consequence lily began her healer training at st mungo that september while james began auror training the evans died soon after lily and james wedding and slowly throughout the following year all of the other evans and potters were murdered as well we all know what befell lily and james potter on that fateful halloween night their son harry is still living and i sure we all know enough about him waqar and adea got married in november as had been planned soon adea began work in the obliviator headquarters while waqar worked for the international magical office of law a year later adea gave birth to twin girls named khuwayla and chandni in the following four years adea also bore two sons who were then named aayan and talal jane achieved her goal and was given a post in the committee for experimental charms and began working late that august sirius began work in the department of magical games and sports jane and sirius decided to albeit reluctantly break off their relationship once sirius became lily and james secret keeper sirius decided to go into hiding and they thought it best that they werentgoing out so he wouldnthave jane as an additional emotional burden they had promised that once voldemort had been defeated and there was no danger they would resume their relationship after sirius was taken to azkaban jane spent two weeks at home grieving eventually she married oscar lovegood who was the editor of her favourite magazine the quibbler they had met when she was leaving work one day and he asked her if it was true that bagnold had retired because a wrackspurt had made a nest in his head though to herself no one compared to sirius ten months into their marriage jane gave birth to a girl called luna nine years after that while jane experimented with some charms at home for work one went horribly awry and resulted in her untimely death remus and kayla continued dating for a while after sirius arrest remus could no longer handle their relationship james loss still meant something to him and the thought that sirius his best friend and james most trusted had turned his back on his oldest friends and deceived them all became too much for him kayla meanwhile had to cope with the loss of lily and felt it her duty to spend as much of her time as possible in being of use to her remaining two friends to do this and also manage to maintain adea secret was impossible together they decided to break off their relationship and parted in friendship kayla then began to work in the department of international magical co operation like her mother she married an italian wizard whom she had met on one of her trips abroad she had a little boy called philip and a girl who she named aurelia after jane died kayla finally snapped she practically withdrew from the world and almost became a recluse she may not always have understood jane and yes she teased jane but at the end of the day jane had been her best friend jane was different you couldntfind another quite like her it just made everything harder two years after jane death adea sought out her greatly changed friend after almost six months of reasoning and arguing kayla finally began work again and came out of the shell she had drawn into to this day kayla cantlook at harry and luna on platform 9 without freezing up and feeling as if her thoughts have been doused with the iciest water and so now only two of the original four live fate had more macabre plans for the other two but their friendship lasted strong and impenetrable to their last moments and even now when two of their number are missing kayla and adea are still the best of friends just as they were all those years ago when they met for the first time in the gryffindor dormitory there it is the actual end now i ve told you their story and how it ended so who am i i dontsuppose it crossed your mind that someone must ve been telling this story it was told to me by my mother and now i ve told it to you i chandni mohsin and this was my duty to let you know on a parting note and to round this all off i d like to say something my mother told me at a very young age we re all going somewhere we just have different ways of getting there a n oh my god it over now gone i just want to say that i had always planned for jane and sirius to eventually break up and when i first started to make up jane character i centred it all around the fact that she was to be luna mother a special thank you to cheesytrees and zippyfoxwho have been absolutely fabulous with constant reviews but of course i love all you guys disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea and anyone not in the books belong to me a n donthave much to say except please review after you ve read this thanks the girl at dinner the first week of term went by fast without james and lily having to do very much it was saturday and james had no one to sit with at dinner the full moon was drawing near and so remus was sleeping peter had his own little feast upstairs and sirius had an appointment with some girl in a broom closet james had not wanted to spend dinner watching peter pig out so he decided to down to the great hall surely someone would sit with him he was a marauder as he walked in many girls tried to catch his eye but he wasntgoing to sit with a bunch of mindless females he was just walking down one side of the table when he spotted a girl he d never seen before sitting all one she looked to be in sixth or seventh year and was probably new him being head boy it was his duty to make new or neglected kids feel more at home he took a seat across the girl hey you new james asked no i ve been here as long as you have the girl replied softly how come i ve never seen you around before dunno guess you missed me oh what your name adea qureshi the girl had carried the conversation without looking up once but now decided that it was only fair she knew what it was like trying to speak to a person who didntseem to be paying attention james looked taken aback your adea qureshi he asked in a tone of incredulity that my name the adea qureshi the fifth contender beside me evans sirius and remus i guess i could be referred to as that you re in gryffindor when no one knew who you were i just thought you were in ravenclaw or something i just as much in gryffindor as you are dontyou have friends she chuckled you re tactful yes i have friends potter but they re preoccupied with what she looked up and sighed in exasperation lets see well lily catching up on her potions kayla out somewhere with her sister and jane is wandering around the corridors said she needed to be alone wait wait wait so you re friends with evans lily my best friend yes how come i didntsee you in her compartment on the train well i was there maybe you didntlook around she emphasized the last word wait something coming to me no damn i was sure i d remembered you for a second there god potter i know i invisible but am i really that invisible i was sitting in the corner with a book covering my face and i was also the one who one that bet against kayla flashback no it mine james muttered resentfully simmons turned around before you rub it in here your money all hail you you were right dee again just like you said and she pulled a galleon out of her pocket grudgingly when are you going to learn i always right sweetheart the other girl broke off there as she suddenly realised she had brought light upon herself she reddened slightly as she inaudibly whispered sorry i ll just take this continue and she pocketed the galleon and disappeared behind her book a n this is done from how james would have seen it not how i ve written it end flashback i remember now uh huh and they fell into a comfortable silence james watched the mysterious girl across from him eat hey you know we re fri are we friends well anyway my heart belongs to evans but you really are stunning you know yes i suppose we are friends i know your heart belongs to lily and thank you i hope you dontthink i talking to you just for this but adea cut him off but why doesntlily like you i was wondering when this was coming she smiled james looked at her guiltily she reassured no dontworry i dontmind remember you didntknow who i was when you talked to me so you didntknow at this james relaxed first of all what do you know about lily well i know she has a sixth sense and that her favourite class is charms he announced proudly she told you about that huh well what else do you know i uh and uh she uh well uh he finished looking crestfallen exactly i sorry james lily is my best friend and i dontwant her hurt unless you re willing to get to know her i canthelp you adea said sympathetically but i love her his voice rising you donteven know her she whispered angrily james opened and closed his mouth but nothing came out adea calmed down you re infatuated not in love fine i ll get to know her what do i have to do first tell me what lily thinks of you that easy she thinks i snobby cocky arrogant and big headed he listed so what we have to do is reverse all of those hey i ve tried having mature conversations but she is one stubborn bitch do you mind that my best friend and she told me about those conversations from what i heard they werentcompletely mature how do you mean well the first time didntyou say something like oh i the great james potter i never need to revise for a test may have said something along those lines he mumbled feebly and the second time you mocked her sixth sense something she very proud about mind by saying something about her belonging in your arms do you see the problem he winced and suddenly remembered something lily had said you re right you know i forgot you are james potter this one line echoed through his head he looked at adea determined tell me what i have to do i ll do it strike up another conversation be her friend dontmess up should i go now no she still stressed about potions give her 5 minutes and she ll start stressing about transfiguration and that your cue wow what how did you know what she going to be stressing about when he questioned awe invading his eyes everyone has a sixth sense potter james had d j vu you re too weird that exactly what evans said last week so what yours i can pick up negative feeling and its like i know when its going to happen by the way you might want to leave now the transfiguration stress is going to start any time now he nodded and was about to get up when she solemnly added could you do me a favour sure anything this conversation never happened in fact i never happened ok what why please just do it tell no one about me he nodded confusedly got up and left a n short chapter yes i know but basically this was just to get james and adea friendship going please review disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n hey come on i am a frequent reviewer and i would appreciate it if people gave the same courtesy to me this chapter is dedicated to miss jayme thanks so much for reviewing i really appreciate it now on to the next chapter his saviour james walked into the head chamber utterly perplexed why would someone want to be invisible but hey if she was willing to help him then he should respect her choices he decided to talk to lily about it he walked into the room and found the redhead bent over some parchment and a textbook hey evans need any help not from you damn he thought this girl must really hate me he went in through the best friend door maybe you could help me he asked sincerely what is it potter make it quick uh huh its about your friend adea lily head snapped up and she turned to him with wide eyes how do you know about her he was about to say what is she forbidden fruit but he bit his tongue no i saw her at dinner alone i had no one to sit with and she looked like a she had a brain also i head boy and i thought she was new you talked to dee she let you talk to her how on earth did you even notice her she asked shocked yeah cantbelieve i missed her she an amazing person yeah she is but how can you know you spent one dinner in her company well it the mystery that draws you in lily smiled he was absolutely right she remembered her first time on the train when she had no one to sit with she looked to the fire and remembered that day flashback oh god this train is so big and so full who the hell am i supposed to sit with there so many people a young lily thought she made her way down the train and found a compartment containing a girl i cantsee her face i wish she d put that book down she cantbe that bad and she said out loud excuse me i cantfind a compartment would you mind if i shared yours oh finally she putting the damn book down woah she pretty her dark eyes searched lily for a moment before saying first year yeah me too come sit thanks lily took a seat across from the girl god she so quiet it scary and as if the girl could read her mind from behind that book she called dontbe scared i a quiet person wow she so so what the word i lily evans by the way the girl sent her another appraising look this time taking the whole of her in she closed her book and smiled a small smile adea qureshi she whispered i like her i dontknow why the redhead smiled a large true smile while the other girl thought and so begins a long friendship but lily didntknow that a n except for the last bit this is obviously written from lily pov end flashback yeah you re right she smiled again she turned her head back to james you guys are close huh he asked it like with you and black i dontagree with everything she says but she my sister yeah she good looking too she could have her fair share of guys lily laughed and cut in but she doesntwant her share is she swinging from the other door he asked awkwardly god potter no she likes guys in fact no forget it she had been about to reveal something big but decided against it how come she wants to be anonymous lily laughed bitterly she asked you not to tell right i wish she d stop that idiocy she muttered sourly but why he continued isntmy place to say when she trusts you enough she will tell you do you know of course what about simmons and swales jane may know but kayla definitely doesntshe doesnthave that level of understanding lily thought for a minute and james was lost in thought too in fact for the first time ever he actually wasntthinking about lily in her presence she finally spoke up listen in the meantime just respect her and dontsay anything but what if i talking to her and sirius comes and she ll hide she muttered so fast it was almost incoherent she ll what she will hide potter but how trust me it ainteasy hiding from a marauder potter for god sakes you think all those times you come up to me that she never there 95 of the time she there potter but when someone comes she turns away takes out a book anything wow trust me if she doesntwant to be found she wontbe found she was sitting in our compartment that day but you totally looked over her she good i guess listen that map you have he looked shock to find that she knew about their map yes potter i know about the map and i know about remus too and i dontcare having an invisible friend helps she picks stuff up just give me the map potter still in shock james went to his desk and pulled out a piece of parchment she took it from him turn it on what qureshi didntshow you how to turn it on she thought that the marauders should have some secrets so she wouldnttell me just turn the damn thing on james took it back alright alright keep your hair on and he silently muttered i solemnly swear i am up to no good lily raised an eyebrow but let it pass she said find dee on your map for me he searched the map where was she he went over two more times she must have snuck out of the grounds he remarked casually lily smirked please potter adea even more law abiding than me but this map shows everyone he said slightly panicked lily smile grew wider potter you made this in first year correct he nodded when you learnt everyone name he nodded gain yes i remember and you didntmiss a single person impressive then you modified it to erase those who d left and those who d entered so i ll give you credit you thought of everything it remarkable but you missed one thing james widened his eyes in question how did she manage that we scoured this castle it was impossible we made a list the head boy and girl approved it do you think they knew potter she a freaking genius in lessons sure its undecided because we re in a tie in a battle of wits and logic she d outsmart us every time james was amazed but he let it drop at that in lily eyes he had redeemed himself by 0 0001 he d accepted and respected her best friend her sister oh what the hell if i dontask him this ll take me all night hey potter can you help me with this transfiguration only we need to rounds and transfiguration isntmy best subject it yours so and it pained her to do this please james was about to say something when he heard adea voice be her friend dontmess up sure evans what no pratty comment no cocky smile he winced no evans you wanna learn this or what half an hour later lily had mastered the spell and it was time to start their rounds it pained to be nice it really did thanks potter i guess their eyes met for a moment for lily it was awkward for james it was an eternity but he ended it with yeah sure whatever we have to go mcgonagall gonna have our heads they left the chamber and started their rounds gryffindor seventh year girl dormitory jane was sitting at their vanity table experimenting with her hair kayla was reading jane eyre and adea was having a shower kayla put her book down let have a sleepover she squealed jane contemplated this idea yes i need to get in touch with my shallow feminine side exactly should i go get lily but at this point adea walked out in her red bathrobe and said i think you ll find that more than a little impossible jane and kayla exchanged looks and why would that be she on a nightly round with potter today although no in fact we could get her to come jane looked confused what what could get lily away from her beloved head girl duties adea changed and magically dried her hair swales just trust me when have i ever failed you at this kayla grimaced you know for such a quiet person you sure are conceited adea smirked oh i wouldntcall it conceited more embracing what god given me and with that she exited in her red silk pyjamas and slippers she walked around for a while when she heard a couple of voices and hid behind a corner what are you doing out this late evans ease up they re kids you ve experienced a night time stroll that uuhhhh may have turned into something a little more he raised his eyebrows suggestively lily blushed well if the night time stroll gets ahem out of hand again then you have to take it upstairs understood yes lily yes lily good 5 points from hufflepuff and i will allow you to continue your stroll in your common room if you leave now adea heard the two strollers leave and then james voice honestly evans why d you get so worked up so what if they were making out well i better than you potter i still at a loss at to why dumbledore made you of all people head boy she fumed adea knew james was this close to going back to square nothing assuming of course that james was at square one so she stepped in lils she cried as she panted making it look like she had just run man i a good actress she thought to herself she winked at james which went unnoticed by lily wow that girl a saint james thought while lily spoke dee what up you sound you ran the whole way yeah practically did searched everywhere 15 flippin minutes i ve been going round here she lied she didntlike to lie but she knew that lily was bound to forget about her argument in a second so what did you want to see me about kayla having a sleepover come on lets go dee come on you know i d love to but i have rounds today and since potter too thick to do them without me lily turned her head to glare at james and adea used this opportunity to mouth that your cue lily turned around again oh i sure potter wouldntmind right i mean he knows all about quality time with his friends you know like once say every month right potter both lily and adea smirked identically james looked at both of them you know this is blackmail right this is very wrong adea adopted a businesslike manner agreeing may aid your shall we say campaign she stressed james eyes widened with realisation but lily looked confused on the other hand evans i ll channel your spirit and i promise i will crack down on the slightest felony he smiled and adea mouth dared to twitch but she refrained from smiling lily scrutinized james something not right here but hey i want a sleepover with the girls and potter letting me go ok potter if you insist dee let me just go back to my room and grab some stuff you wait here ok her friend nodded as soon was lily was out of earshot james turned to adea oh sweet angel from the highest heavens how can i repay you adea rolled her eyes first of all never use that line with lily i a cool headed person but she a redhead she ll come outright and slap you and second watch your temper she started it he whined but she not trying to impress you it vice versa remember you are so lucky i was here if i know lily she d have blown that way bigger had she been able to run her course thank you thank you thank you and by the way why are you in your pyjamas and how the hell do you not get noticed in such an outstanding colour though he thought it best not to insult his saviour so he corrected of course you look breathtaking in it yes i thought so as for your questions your welcome i in my pyjamas because we are about to go to a sleepover and i have my ways james brightened we as in i can go adea smacked him no you dolt we as in lily and i how you got to be a contender let alone head boy just then lily appeared so what did you guys talk about james was at a loss as to what to say lily had never spoken to him politely as in without an ounce of indicated hostility potter and i are in business and i dontdiscuss my dealings james looked upwards thank you god for this girl adea said hey lils sweetie do me a favour you go ahead i need to talk to potter about something ok she turned to the bespectacled boy as the redhead disappeared into some corridor fyi potter an arrangement of starlillies and tulips would be appreciated send them with my owl mehak and with that she took off for the gryffindor tower james thought out loud that girl knows everything why cantmy friends be that smart and he went off to steal some flowers from the greenhouses a n again pleeeeeease review did you guys like this please tell me disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n hey i not going to ask for reviews because it doesntseem to be working so if you want to review then it would be my pleasure to read it meeting james in the girl dormitory four girls were preparing for their sleepover hey jane could you nip down to the kitchens and grab us some food no she ll get caught chorused two stern voices all the more reason to do it then be back in two and jane went quietly down and exited the gryffindor common room moony moony moony sirius whispered hoarsely remus flung a hand in the air and rolled over oh hey simmons were you looking for remus oh he sleeping right now but and the sleeping boy shot up fast as a bullet and looked around hurriedly but only found his best friend smirking sirius what the hell is wrong with you its 2 am he moaned exactly and simmons wouldntbe up at this time would she but you still fell for it you great prat remus reddened slightly but tried to look indifferent well since you re up lets go get something to eat no i just did prefect rounds until half past one without any help and i not hungry you are he gave sirius another dirty look shut his hangings and fell asleep sirius merely looked on call yourself a best friend he muttered darkly sirius wandered through the corridors for five minutes until reaching the painting he tickled the pear and walked in he waited for elves to rush to him but when none did he looked around to find them in another service he strode over to the huddle of elves good evening i terribly sorry but would any of you talented cooks like to be of help to me and he gave them a charming smile an elf called wailer turned around oh master black how silly of wailer nots to notice how mays i helps you sir oh wailer my usual night snack will do all the elves ran off onto the depths of the kitchen to fulfil both visitor wishes sirius turned around to find that odd girl he d met on the rain that day swales right the girl acknowledged his presence oh my sirius black remembered my name i could just die she replied sarcastically i can see why you and evans are friends they were met with an uncomfortable silence what are you doing here anyway i was just hungry you sleepover she finished shortly a wave of guilt suddenly overcame sirius and he couldntunderstand why but he remembered that day on the train he looked sideways and could tell that jane didntwant to be standing there next to him hey listen swales about that thing on the train i sorry ok jane was shocked sirius black apologising so maybe he isntas insolent as i thought no dontbe stupid but he saying sorry you mean it you re actually sorry jane asked he met her gaze inwardly he gasped what amazing eyes fuck how do you have eyes that colour are they even real are those eyes real he looked mortified what oh god i said that out loud didnti he asked quietly still lost in her eyes jane noticed wow i think i know what those bimbos are always going on about there something about him no stop thinking that yes they re real she replied awkwardly and looked away sirius now took the rest of her in i ll never meet another person able to pull of that hair and shit she got curves who knew pyjamas could be so tight but a comment from her broke off his thoughts so where are those elves do you think sirius realised she was right hey elves we re sorry but we really need to be heading back so if you could just hurry up and suddenly all the elves rushed back oh master mistress we are ever so sorry to have kepts you waiting here your food and they handed over the food to the two seventh years jane walked immediately out sirius brisk walked to catch up with her hey we re headed in the same direction mind if i walked you up she felt a blush come on oh no black going to think i one of his fan club or something sure whatever you re evans friend dontyou care about getting caught why should i if it bugs professors i all for it sirius laughed wow could she get any more perfect you re something else you know that he commented laughingly the girl turned away they walked the rest of the way in silence occasionally turning around to sneak glances at each other eventually after what seemed like an eternity a very awkward eternity they reached the gryffindor common room they looked to each other and jane carefully avoided his gaze er so i guess this is your stop huh sirius drawled yours too jane said pointing at the boys staircase he nodded she couldnthelp it just one glance a few seconds couldnthurt me right jane looked into his eyes and both got lost all over again no i cantlet this happen to me it not going to sirius black cannot make a fool of this girl she broke eye contact and bounded up the dormitory stairs wow that girl got something else something i cantgrasp she unachievable but wait is she yeah she is she different she isntlike the other girls then finally realising it was 2 45 am he went upstairs laden with food back in the girl dormitory oh god finally jane where the hell have you been jane blushed the elves took ages she said quietly but kayla persisted oh really what the blush for then the other girl turned around immediately what blush there no blush i dontsee a blush do you see a blush she babbled lily smirked no but i do see crimson whoever knew getting food could be so embarrassing her and kayla sniggered adea spoke up so swales care to tell us what happened or are we going to have to force it out of you you re off your rocker

other girls groaned come on dee we haventdone that since second year yeah do you remember we d gather round every month and talk about our crushes and almost every time we d have a different one how ditzy were we they laughed reminiscently a n can you laugh reminiscently adea spoke up again come on guys pleeeeeaaase she whined with her puppy dog look alright alright kayla grinned evilly i know let start with jane no she said it so forcefully her friends looked shocked why what are you hiding lily eyed the girl suspiciously oh you know my crushes are always so boring adea raised an eyebrow if you donttell us we have other more cruel ways of getting it out of you jane gulped adea personal favourite was the tickling charm oh god they ll find out anyway but is he a crush oh what the heck ikindalikesiriusblack she mumbled lily and adea looked confused but kayla had caught on sirius black huh so that who you met in the kitchens jane looked up fearfully who said anything about kitchens the brunette rolled her eyes jane you never blush you re expecting me to believe that you ve liked this guy for a month or something and decide to blush now lily and adea were trying very hard to keep a straight face and jane looked sheepish damn you and your perceptiveness what can i say it a gift kayla said complacently lily had gotten over her giggles and was now looking sceptical so what about you simmons what about me lily rolled her eyes oh you mean riiiight oh that easy remus lupin she said coolly she was met by a what she looked sideways at her redheaded friend what the matter lils it not that big unless wait you dontlike him do you lily waved away her question it was unexpected is all the other two agreed jane sat up want me to set you up please don t dee pass the popcorn would you jane was known pretty much all around school for her chaotic matchmaking attempts so lily what about you lily took some popcorn and munched on it thoughtfully dunno hogwarts guys get quite boring after a while but you know daniel mckinnon not looking too bad this year i agree but you know emmeline would murder you if she found you saying that adea added oooh why well from what i ve heard she has this major crush and she quite the protective one you know the other girls nodded what about you dee like anyone the atmosphere tensed up adea was from an asian family and even though arranged marriages at a young age had been almost terminated some still existed they werentlike the oldern days when the couple didntget any say or only met on the wedding day the more modern arranged marriages comprised of two teenage kids who ve known each other for a long time and get on getting engaged and married when they were old enough with stable jobs of course the couple got the last say in everything adea was engaged she was engaged to boy named waqar mohsin he was also a seventh year but in ravenclaw adea and waqar had been friends even before hogwarts they had gotten engaged in fourth year and even though she d agreed she hadntexactly been ecstatic about it oh you guys know the scene waqar is really sweet i kind of warming up to him now the other three sighed with relief kayla looked up does being engaged mean you canthave crushes not really but i donthave one because i mean what the point and its not as if he bad looking right right i happen to know that many of the younger ravenclaws happen to fall for your tall dark haired light eyed mysterious man adea laughed aaaaawwww how sweet so what about potter lils how the head situation lily stuffed a whole load of marshmallows in her mouth fuf a mimit jane looked disgusted lily swallowed oh god you know potter he so irresponsible just earlier these two third years were like snogging in the corridor right so i like trying to tell them off and potter just stands there telling me to ease up and that they were doing nothing wrong if i left him to do everything he d reverse half the rules in a second lily was more interested in kayla situation hey kay thanks hun the brunette looked surprised what for lils remus is a great friend and i know girls like him but you re the only one i can think of who d like him even after knowing about you know actually that part of the reason i like him i mean a guy who knows how to put up with that much responsibility and be able to laugh it off i dontknow it kinda pulls you in and plus he like a 10 for fitness all four of them giggled the morning after lily spent her day with the girls they hadntbeen able to spend time together like that since the summer what with the colossal amount of homework the teachers found amusing to give they spent the whole day getting food from the kitchens laughing doing their hair for no reason etc lily decided to leave her friends and go take a bath in the heads bathroom after fifteen minutes she walked out to find james in the lounge hey where ve you been all day the raven haired boy enquired with my friends what it to you she snapped james looked hurt but let it pass geez i sorry i cared about where you were and was just making sure you were ok lily immediately felt guilty oh god i such a bitch he was only being nice sorry about that she said sheepishly it ok i pretty used to it but you know it gets to you every so often lily was blushing now shit what ve i done he seems more human i guess i sorry ok god you really know how to make someone feel guilty dontyou james smirked so have fun last night yeah so how were the rounds last night james grimaced channelling your spirit is hard lily smiled oh my god she smiling at something i said wow i love her smile there a sight you dontsee often the spitfire smiles james quipped shut up potter she joked james shot her a smile please call me james well while we re on introductions hi i lily james was in a daze she wants me to call her lily so we re friends yes james i guess we are they spent the next couple of hours just getting to know each other laughing at jokes and just having fun later that night as she got into bed lily thought potter has two completely different sides to him and one makes a really good friend a n some people may think i ve unravelled adea too soon but she got way more to her than this also anyone who thinks this new friendship between lily and james will last is very very wrong disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n you know what to do potter back james rose early the following morning oh man sirius is going to flip when he hears about last night he took a shower exited the chamber and made his way to the great hall goooood morning padfoot james said brightly sirius scowled as he piled food onto his plate why are you so cheerful is it your life goal to constantly give me unnecessary headaches he snapped woah calm down just came down to tell you what happened last night between evans and i sirius froze and looked up what do you mean i broke the ice sirius looked ready to jump over the moon no you didn t james looked smug give it a week my friend and evans will be mine james bragged sirius punched the air well done mate but i guessing you re still in the friends phase yeah but i telling you i have her in the palm of my hand what went unnoticed by the two boys was that a certain redhead had heard the whole conversation lily evans left the hall very quietly oh my god what a jerk he only interested in my company if i making out with him if he thinks me being friends with him meant i was succumbing to his so called charm he got another thing coming in fact we re not even friends anymore he doesnteven like me that much he wants me because no one else can get me i need to talk to dee and she tore up the girls dormitory stairs dee dee adea jane jaaaaane kayla kaaaaayla oh my god where the hell are you guys you d better not be at breakfast woah vesuvius dontexplode on me what up lils kayla called as she walked out of the bathroom her hair wet and looking very fresh hey kay where dee she and jane got up early to visit hagrid for a sec oh well i guess i could tell kay i mean she great if you want to bitch about someone in fact that just what i need maybe i could talk to you then kayla sat down of course you can you know that it about potter ah i see kayla smiled as lily set about explaining the previous night events and then this morning i went to breakfast right i saw potter went to say hi and he was telling black all this crap about oh i have her in the palm of my hands and give it a week and she ll be mine what he didntrealise is that i heard him that little shit that little chauvinistic macho shit kayla cried in outrage i know lily yelled in agreement god this feels so much better you can always count on kay for bitching even if she doesntknow what she bitching about first things first lils do not do you hear me do not tell potter you heard him give him the cold shoulder embarrass him he ll never know what hit him kayla said seriously lily looked sceptical but i want to scream at him of course you do sweetheart but i thought that maybe i should go mention no names whatsoever just scream randomly at him what do you think lily smirked yeah i like that idea better thanks kay this means a lot to me you know i know sweetie and i sorry about this lily smiled at her friend it not your fault but i just so pissed off i mean we really got along we only talked for a couple of hours but for those hours i really thought i d made a good friend lils you dontlike him do you no no it not like that it was more like waqar and adea before fourth year except not quite as close completely platonic at least for me but he obviously had other plans kayla hugged her friend aaaaawwww lils forget him and when we re done with him he ll realise what a great friend you are to lose hey what going on in here came a voice both girls turned to see their friends walk in bitching session jane looked interested and adea just rolled her eyes ooooohhhhh who are we bitching about to today girls jane said as she joined them on the bed adea went to put her scarf away potter should ve known lily shook her head no today it different jane looked quizzical how so and once again she explained the situation bastard jane exclaimed adea froze that idiot that complete idiot should ve known not to trust him he is so getting it now he hurt lily i told him not to hurt lily she looked up and heard kayla say yeah so i going up to potter mentioning no names and just yelling on lily behalf i ll let kayla have her moment then i going in and giving him a piece of my mind she thumped her trunk and the other three girls looked up you alright dee lily asked concernedly huh oh yeah couldntget this stupid thing to close guys we ve missed breakfast and we re like 15 minutes late for history of magic and adea frowned lily evans you are head girl what has gotten into you you never miss a lesson i know but we only ever revise from the book not from the classes and binns wonteven notice yeah i guess you re right jane lily and kayla went back to the original conversation i ll go at lunch outside the great hall ok lils make sure you re nowhere in sight or he ll figure it out fine with me kay i have halloween to plan i more than a little behind schedule i spending lunch catching up adea looked concerned arentyou having lunch i ll go to the kitchens or my wonderful friends could bring some up since they are the best in the whole wide world of course she finished with a smile fine the rest chorused it was about 12 o clock when kayla spotted him there he is oh god no he with remus no kayla simmons you have to do this for lily for lily for lily donthate me for this remus she took a deep breath before storming up to james just remember he a sexist pig who upset my friend nobody upsets my friend and gets away with it lets go you she shrieked james looked confused as he turned simmons he turned to sirius and remus and signalled them to back off he didntneed to tell peter who was already hiding behind remus for protection oh god he going to hate me no focus on the imbecile in front of you yeah that right it me and potter you are in deep shit what i donteven know what you re talking about i ve never so much as said two words to you unbelievable potter how dare you i cantbelieve you you think you re so high and mighty no respect for people felings whatsoever you pretend to be all nice and sweet and then you go and trample all over them kayla why are you shouting at him you ll get in trouble he head boy called a defiant voice and the screaming girl turned around oh i dead now i am such a bad example gabrielle continued her older sister looked apologetic gabby trust me i not being out of order or anything jane could you please just take gabrielle aside and explain james spoke up yeah swales and while you re telling the runt explain to me as well gabrielle looked murderous what did you call me james opened his mouth but got cut off no forget it i dontcare if you are head boy i can see why lily hates you so much you re a prat honestly you try and be nice and stop someone from getting totally humiliated and you canteven get a nice word back she huffed and she stepped back and motioned for kayla to continue you know what else i not doing for myself i going to do this for anyone who ever felt heartbroken because of this prick almost every girl in the corridor said yeah or tell him kayla simmons i ve never even been out with you dumbass when did i say i was doing this for myself do you know how many girls you ve upset or have you lost count because i wouldntbe surprised if you had let me tell you something potter you canttreat people like dirt and you cantrefer to females as objects because we re just as much human as you are i suppose you have a little bet going on with black over there probably something like how many girls you can sleep with and then ditch get over yourself i hate you dontever think about hurting another person close to me ever again got it she finished and was met by applause from all the girls as she ran down the corridor followed by jane and gabrielle james looked dumbstruck as he turned to his friends what the hell was that about sirius shrugged but remus looked pensive check with lily i have a feeling she knows what this is about lily james said was bent over a desk she looked up her usually sparkling green eyes stone cold what do you want james was really confused now oh god what did i do no it must be the stress i haventdone anything simmons just screamed at me for no reason know anything about it lily did her best to keep a straight face no but i glad she did but but she she completely humiliated me in front of like 50 of the female population of hogwarts i glad potter now they ll know what scum you are james looked hurt lily what wrong why are you calling me potter what happened to james i thought we were friends i thought we were friends too potter what so what the hell is this drama about lily shook her head answer me this potter what happened to james oh well only thing to do in these situations because she obviously isntgoing to tell me lily i really really sorry is there anyway i can make it up to you lily laughed but instead of filled with warmth it was filled with bitterness and hate what a jerk take a deep breath dontfly off the handle get out she whispered james was stunned that line always works what why i said sorry yeah you re right tell me again what are you sorry for she watched james struggle and redden and felt immense satisfaction oh you you know that that thing that that you know he faltered lily shook her head again you re unbelievable you donteven know why i upset maybe that sorry thing works with the girls you usually have hanging off your arm but not with me i ll tell you one more time get out james backed out of the mahogany door what have i done did you see her eyes yes i saw her eyes and i have never felt worse in my life he walked around the castle contemplating not really caring where his feet were taking him as long as they were moving hey called a deep voice adea turned around and smiled hey you by you she meant waqar mohsin waqar was 6 2 in height had longish dark hair tanned skin and soft green eyes he was a keeper on the ravenclaw quidditch team and also a prefect he was a friend to all the girls meaning lily adea jane and kayla adea and waqar had known each other all their lives and had been best friends when they came to hogwarts he was sorted into ravenclaw she in gryffindor and the two found themselves friends but not to such a degree as previously now they were engaged of sorts more like promised to each other however what waqar hadnttold anyone was that he loved adea he hadnttold her because he didntwant her to feel guilty and convince herself to love him back it didntwork like that so instead he just made their situation easier for her to handle did you see the corridor incident waqar asked adea chuckled no i passed what the matter he asked she averted his glance ever since they d been little she could never lie to him or at least lie well nothing hah as if come on chop chop spit it out waqar demanded adea pretended she hadntheard him as she gazed at the ceiling hmm waqar looked at the girl shrewdly this has something to do with the corridor incident doesntit no dontbe daft look me in the eye and say that again adea rolled her eyes and looked back you are so annoying maybe so but you haventanswered my question adea sighed in resignation idiot boy and repeated exactly what lily had told her in the dormitory by the end of it all waqar looked indifferent and adea was slightly miffed dontyou care now he rolled his eyes of course i care go find potter huh go on that what you need to do but he doesnteven know yes he does dontlie to me you were going to do it anyway go and he watched her go off into the corridors watch yourself potter she may be quiet but you do not want to get her angry a n hey if you dontlike waqar please tell me disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n hey everyone i actually donthave anything to say so just read and review i guess the last two james eventually decided to go up to the astronomy tower and do some stargazing clear his mind work out what the hell was going on etcetera hopefully the astronomy tower wontbe ahem occupied but when he got there he only saw one silhouette not two he or she seems to be doing just what i want to do they wontmind i ll be quiet he tiptoed in hello called a faraway voice swales oh no not another one of evans friends great but wait she always like on another planet she wontremember come here often he replied yeah i have a connection with those stars riiight yeah uh huh he turned towards the window and she turned around to him lily was very upset today james looked uncomfortable uh yeah in one quick movement jane had his arm twisted and pinned behind his back and used her other arm to put him into a headlock potter if you ever ever upset her again you re dead and now she tried giving him a clue never refer to her as anything but a human being even if you think nobody listening because chances are somebody is so never talk about her like that not even to black james who was in considerable pain and humiliation just nodded she let go now i going to leave and you re going to sit here and think about what i said james slightly more confident after she d released him said stubbornly what if i want to leave you will sit here and think about what i said she said sounding more forceful and if possible more menacing she continued or i will make you and trust me it will be a lot more painful than that little stunt a second ago got it he gulped and nodded she turned and left the tower as she was walking past sir cadogan portrait she crossed paths with adea who looked slightly agitated jane didntstop astronomy tower the other girl nodded thanks lily was sitting in the head lounge when she heard a knock lily it jane can you let me in lily muttered hari ankhain the doors swung open and allowed jane entry she was grinning so what the password green eyes cantbe why is that i tried breaking in here last week and i tried green eyes of all the things why did you try green eyes duh lily because you sleep here and it like one your most striking features so even if you hadntset it potter would have done so it aintgreen eyes well it is just a slight variation how come dee knows the password because dee wontuse it to break in while i out in my defence i ve just come back after making potter suffer pain ah i see let me guess it adea turn now right that right saw going up there to have a go at him now they exchanged glances and burst out laughing and jane sputtered adea having a go that good adea finally reached the astronomy tower clever she may be but physically fit she was not she was hopeless she couldntwalk around for more than 20 minutes at a time she was thin but only because she never ate very much panting she went to sit next to james who seemed not to notice her wheezes once she d regained her breath she turned to him with a cold look potter he jumped but relaxed when he saw it was adea hey qureshi she didntsay anything she just gave him the death glare he spoke up can you tell me what going on with your friends so far simmons and evans have blown up at me and swales had me in a headlock a n dormant fierceness remember you really dontknow do you you are unbelievable dontyou start on me i bloody well will start on you i told you not to hurt lily and i didn t he defended bloody hell potter the hall this morning breakfast chats with sirius black ring a bell ok but no one was there well they were just not any of you i ve told you before potter maybe you didntlook around she emphasized the last word again something had just occurred to james no she couldnthave that impossible it was just sirius and me what do you mean she laughed bitterly please no donttell me she heard lily heard the whole thing you prat shit so that why she been giving me the cold shoulder and why you re friends are intent on kicking the crap out of me no because it d take a lot more than yelling and a headlock to kick the crap out of you james looked surprised quite the little bitch arentwe when it comes to my friends yes potter i need her help i cantwin evans over without her listen qureshi adea even i sorry ok but look at it from where i standing i made friends with evans evans the girl i ve loved since first year whose eyes haunt me no matter what i do the girl i dream about every night who occupies my every thought when i in the same room as her i forget all else and when i not in the same room as her every little thing reminds me of her and suddenly she was talking to me without so much as an ounce of resentment you cantimagine how i felt i felt as if i was on top of the world and never coming down and i a guy i have to boast it what i do adea who had softened hen he d said the part about lily eyes now chuckled she took one look at the stars you certainly know what to say dontyou james looked at her with pleading eyes i an idiot i know that seriously i know you say it just infatuation and you re probably right but to me it feels like so much more i need her i really do and to get her i need your help i know how close you two are like sisters right and i really sorry but please please help me he turned to her with a pained expression on his face she however did not turn around like most people would she continued to look at cygnus for no particular reason defeated james turned to gaze at orion nearly ten minutes later adea spoke in barely a whisper i will help you not because you claim you need her no because she needs you james looked shocked beyond words but still she gazed at the stars not once turning round dontbe surprised you two will get together i can feel it and it ll turn into more than either of you could ever imagine she said and at this she got up and exited without once turning to glance at james a n still donthave much to say leave a review please disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n this chapter is going to be crap and i going to edit chapter 6 however much i can because i think we all agree it quite crappy also this chapter is dedicated to themaraudersaremine if you re reading this could you please point out my mistakes so that i can correct them that girl it was october the 15th kayla and adea were studying for the history of magic while lily was frantically trying to get the halloween feast events in order jane who had done her fair share of studying decided to take a walk around the grounds one of her favourite pastimes as she walked into the entrance hall she crossed paths with gabrielle who had her nose deep inside some defence against the dark arts book any closer and you might as well jump in simmons the young girl looked up her forehead creased in an anxious frown what oh hey jane she muttered absentmindedly jane raised an eyebrow uh yeah hey are you alright this time gabrielle didntbother looking up hmmm oh well i have this dada test and i really need to study let me guess this is your first test since you started school right well yeah and obviously i want to do well yes been there gabrielle my friend in 4 years time you will look back on this moment and kick yourself for getting worked up on something so unimportant when in fact owls are just around the corner gabrielle looked apprehensive please dontscare me in advance jane chuckled come on bookworm i think you ve revised enough you re joining me for a walk no seriously i donthave time for a chat i never talk on my walks and you can use the time to test yourself without the help of your book and with that jane shrunk the book and stored it in her bag and dragged gabrielle out they walked around jane observing every aspect of the beauty surrounding her and gabby muttering hurriedly under her breath they walked around for 5 minutes until reaching the lake but both girls stopped when they heard some very excited giggling jane pulled gabrielle behind a bush what going on gabby asked jane looked to the first year and back to the two people at the lake that s sirius black she stated gabby peered through the bushes to find sirius black whispering something into the ear of a girl who must have been the source of the giggling yeah it is why do you care she looked at jane shrewdly jane stared back promise not to tell anyone not to tell anyone at all gabby shook her head good otherwise i d have to hurt you and i in seventh year anyway i kinda sorta like him gabby suddenly donned a look of pity as jane went back to peering through the bush but who that girl with him she muttered abstractedly the younger girl looked again this time more closely and recognised the girl wait i know her estrella salgado she a sixth year gryffindor she helped me out with charms once she actually quite but she trailed off noticing the murderous glare jane was giving her and continued with a different angle bitchy oh my god that slut she said feigning disgust jane approved the statement and added dontsay that your sister would kill me as an afterthought i hate her no wait i hate him damn i have nothing on that girl she could be the next bloody miss england or spain that girl spanish isntshe gabrielle nodded in affirmation i almost sure of it she watched the two before her draw closer and turned away come on gabby suddenly i dontwant to walk anymore and you need to revise lets go gabby nodded again this time piteously as she got up to leave gabby yes jane dontlook at me like that please he just a guy that all but she repeated under her breath yeah just a guy kayla and adea were sitting in their dormitory still scouring through their history of magic books jane stepped into the room and adea lifted her head slightly and followed jane with her eyes until she jane collapsed on her bed adea closed her book and cautiously walked over to her friend bed i think it safe to say something up wanna talk jane continued to stare upwards at the ceiling though her mind was noticeably elsewhere i thought something happened that night between us jane mumbled kayla who had closed her books as well now looked at adea quizzically who said this is about black isntit jane looked to her friend who noticed the silver eyes were now clouded with an aura of pitiful confusion and nodded can we wait until lily comes back please why kayla replied jane chose not to reply but adea did she needs time to think we can wait a bit nearly fifteen minutes later an agitated redhead walked in oh my god oh my god oh my god i ll never get this finished halloween gonna be crap then everyone will hate me including dumbledore then i ll lose my head girl badge and then and then she muttered hysterically kayla rolled her eyes and adea almost burst out laughing lily darling calm down how about letting potter and the prefects do some of the work but he going to mess this up this can not be messed up this is the first chance i ve had since september to prove to professor dumbledore that i capable now adea rolled her eyes first of all potter head boy for a reason he wontmess it up secondly you re head girl for a reason you dontneed to prove yourself to dumbledore he already knows your capable oh and lastly take a deep breath and get a grip we have bigger problems to deal with she said indicating jane lily took a deep breath and her expression went from hysterical to concerned they silently fought over who was going to go up first and eventually decided to go together facing jane while she was upset wasntalways safe they sat down on her bed and adea began tentatively jane what happened jane looked at them one look at her eyes made them wash over with sympathy and anger what did that berk do i i was walking on the grounds with gabrielle and and well we came to the lake and heard some giggling right the others nodded not quite sure of where this was going anyway i noticed black out the corner of my eye and i pulled gabrielle and hid behind a bush well i looked and he was there with estrella salgado whispering in her ear and when we left they were about to kiss lily looked in thought estella salgado hmmm she sixth year isntshe nice girl always willing to help the younger ones quite pretty too she finished but this time jane just sighed miserably while adea shot lily an exasperated look adea shook her head and continued you wouldntusually care how about you tell us what happened in the kitchens that night jane sighed again and looked defiantly up at the ceiling i was i was in the kitchens and then well he walked in and told the elves to get him food anyway at the time i was a little pissed off that he was there then he seemed to remember me and i shot him a sarcastic comment and i think a few minutes later he apologised for the whole train incident anyway i asked him if he meant it and then i turned to look at him and we sort of well met each other gaze and i swear time stopped then he goes are those eyes real i was a little confused but i pretty sure that was when i started to like him anyway i just said yeah and looked away the elves came back gave us our food and i promptly left to avoid any more awkward situations i must have been walking for like barely two seconds and suddenly he offers to walk me up because he was going there too well when we got to the bottom of the dormitory stairs i met his eyes again and both of us got lost again anyway i was the one who left first and i pretty sure he was still looking when i got to the top so you can understand cantyou lily and adea sighed but kayla rolled her eyes and debated with herself before saying what was on her mind jane i know you feel awful but and here she received two reprimanding looks but she persisted you have got to know by now that one these moments dontreally mean a lot to black kayla how can you be so blunt cantyou see this is rather sensitive no lily she right i shouldntbe so upset i acting like one of his fan club i going to forget about him in fact we re going down to dinner right now and i going to prove to myself and all of you that as of now i couldntcare less if he going out with that girl she took a deep breath and walked out but the other three huddled i think that means we cantsay her name now yeah dontcross her on this god knows what she could do in a frenzy just follow her example estrella salgado is now that girl right they all nodded and ran after their friend to accompany her into the hall on entering the hall all the girls except jane who was rather determinedly looking ahead scoured the hall for sirius black and found him sitting with estrella he was obviously saying something funny because when they sat down they could hear her say sirius stop it my sides hurt and i need to eat at which he whispered something in her ear and the girl blushed kayla decided to test her best friend black and that girl look like they re having fun dontthey lily adea started banging their heads on the table but jane put potatoes on her plate completely undeterred yes they do rather dontthey adea looked sceptical of the response but lily was rather surprised woah not many people could manage that only jane could get rid of a crush on demand meanwhile adea thought differently note to self kill kayla when jane not around jane can act as nonchalant as she wants but inside i can see it killing her kayla however was quite pleased with herself see i knew jane could do it all she needed was a test and now we have confirmation quiet quiet now the room fell silent ok so you re here because little miss prim and perfect james said pointedly while lily rolled her eyes and she put on an obviously fake and sickly sweet voice why donti take over from here potter alright the prefects looked on amusedly what potter was trying to say in his own obnoxious and insolent little way was that i thought i could handle managing halloween on my own at this she noticed the prefects looked slightly disgruntled but for the life of her she couldntremember why suddenly something flew into her mind flashback ok so about halloween we ve had a meeting with dumbledore basically we need to get the whole thing in order ourselves potter saying the prefects broke out in whispers i analysed potter this was halloween no no way was potter going to ruin this no no no i mean the prefects they re too young to understand the importance of this and i going to carry this out by myself wait potter hey guys you ll love this how about i do everything i see potter raise an eyebrow one of the ravenclaw prefects shouts why why is she questioning me she should be glad this means no work for them heeelllllloooooo uhhh because i thought you guys wouldntwant to help out you know use your time doing stuff you actually want to do potter cut me off idiot no because she thinks we re going to mess this up i look him in the eye he isnthappy who cares no potter you re going to mess this up another prefect speaks up hey we can help with this this is our job we have to help you i looked him in the eye and i know the boy is starting to regret what he said you re right and i telling you to have fun while i do the work and you know what get out meeting over all of you go now potter crosses his arms as the prefects run to the door you canttell me what to do evans deep breath nope not gonna happen james potter get out right now before i go any further and hurt you where you do not want to be hurt i making my way towards him he paling and yes he gone the great twat end flashback lily blushed oh yeah and i sorry for thinking you werentcapable enough to help me i really sorry the stress was getting to me and i wanted to really prove myself you know in fact forget it you wontunderstand she broke off and indicated for james to start off again but when she looked at him he defiantly crossed his arms and smirked cruelly lily eyes flashed but she took a deep breath and turned to the prefects again please accept my apology and can we get on with it since there only like 2 weeks to do all of this a n it is now oct 16th

rule out the possibility of fancy dress lily smiled observant good yeah i forgot about that you re absolutely right but the rest is up to you when none of the other prefects objected she allowed them to go she didntnotice that james had stayed behind but he wasntthe only one lily she turned and smiled hey waqar i just wanted to say that i understand what happened about the whole halloween thing she smiled grew wider adea is so lucky to have a guy like him she got up and hugged him not realising that james was still there waqar briefly hugged her back listen i have to go now but come and talk to me if you need to ok and with that he left james had watched the entire thing and even after waqar had left was growing steadily jealous but adea had told him to be hostile to begin with so mohsin your new boyfriend now he sneered she turned oh you re still here answer the question she glared at him speechless i i how dare you order me around like that no he not my boyfriend he is just a friend which is way more than i can say for you she seethed at this he winced but he didntwant her to know she d got him you know what i sick of you evans oh and by the way i sorry about what i said about you at breakfast that day he said knowing she knew which breakfast he was talking about she studied him and said apology accepted in a resigned voice well yeah then good james struggled in a stubborn and childish tone lily raised an eyebrow as he stormed out now what the hell was that about how did he know that not important well yeah it is but i mean he apologised but he shouted when he said it does that mean anything that not true what not true he didntshout when he apologised just the bit before it yeah you re right so why was he still acting angry you only have to go and ask him you know he most likely going to be in the lounge mmmmmm i guess you have to do it you know that fine i ll go and she sped off to the head chamber upon reaching it she found the head boy sitting in an armchair and staring into the fire potter he didntturn but her voice had snapped him out of his daze what do you want well i was wondering why you re still mad at me i mean you apologised i accepted so i mean i dontwant to be your friend but i was wondering if the whole apology thing would help you stop being so difficult at meetings james sat and mulled it over well i mad at her because adea told me to there nothing else to be mad about at her for i guess why would adea want you to act mad at her for in the first place i not sure it is a little weird and i mean if i trying to get her to like me then why should i be mean are you sure lily hasntdone anything for you to be mad at realisation hit james like a ton of bricks of course why didnti think of this before she wants lily to feel guilty for all the humiliation and pain she caused me he thought about all the names lily had called him and noticed that he didntneed to feign anger and now because the real thing was bubbling under the surface he looked at the face that had caused him pain and more than a few sleepless nights evans i not mad at you for all the things your friends have done on your behalf but then why he held up a hand to stop her took a deep breath and ploughed on i angry because of all the anguish because of you i have liked you for so long now yet every time i ask you out you find a new harsher way of rejecting me have you never noticed the hurt in my eyes when you say no in your colourful ways do you think i dontget affected by someone who i very head over heels for constantly telling me how arrogant how conceited how big headed how egotistical how snobby how cocky how immature i am you know what i ll admit i do act conceited and immature around you but if you re so great then why dontyou see through my fa ade why dontyou observe what i like around my friends have you ever once asked why i hex slytherins i used to hex them for no reason but since sixth year that changed but no evans you wontbother to look beyond what you see you re too narrow minded any reason to have a good shout at me you donteven care if you re being fair oh and as for big headed why dontyou take a look at your own superiority complex take halloween you were so bloody scared that everything was going to go your way because the rest of us were too dumb and clumsy so you had to do it yourself but at this he was cut off because lily who had tears rolling down her cheeks half way through his speech obviously couldnttake anymore and ran out of the chamber sobbing but for the first time james didntfeel guilty at all he felt a little satisfied lily ran into her friend dormitory still sobbing and was immediately hailed by her friends lils what wrong what happened this is about james adea mused the other two looked up at her in awe and how do you know that she shrugged lily nodded it it is about h him she cried what did he do he said he mad at me for all the things i ve ever done to him h he r really grew up in in my eyes to tonight kayla gasped wh what do you mean she asked kayla wasnta massive fan of change lily not hating james it just couldntbe he made me feel like such a callous bitch the crying girl said lily held her arms out to jane the most motherly out of all of them who in return hugged her and rocked her to and fro soothingly it ok sweetheart you just let it all out as lily started sobbing again h he said i was the conceited one i was too n narrow minded kayla face hardened even more that it potter so getting it the hallway stunt that was nothing no lily cried kayla softened but was still confused lily looked at her with her red eyes and her tear strained cheeks and shook her head dontyou see he was right spot on i do have an amazingly large superiority complex jane looked her in the eye no dontyou dare believe a word that bastard said jane cried lily shook her head again dee what should i do adea looked up huh just ignore him best you can just leave him alone if i know him he ll ignore you as well i think it best for both of you if you didnthave to encounter each other unless necessary for a while you obviously canthandle it i mean look at you lils she advised lily nodded solemnly and looked around hey guys can i stay here tonight she asked in a hopeful tone of course you can you know there always been a free bed for you here lily smiled through her tears what on earth would i do without them later that night when everybody was asleep a certain charcoal haired person took out her diary and headed for the common room october 26th 11 51 pm dear diary have you ever felt like you ve been pushed into a pit but it bottomless you keep falling deeper and deeper faster and faster and there no way of getting out i never thought such a feeling existed until today i can feel myself almost ready to collapse i feel more walls of protection guarding my inner self i can feel my heart but only very faintly as if it subdued i only felt a small sense of attraction towards him but if that the case then why am i so crushed he found himself an amazing girl she estrella salgado she of spanish descent she has gorgeous dark brown angel curls for hair tanned skin and i think brown eyes but i not sure lily says she really nice she perfect i have nothing on her with my charcoal hair pale skin and frankly creepy and possibly haunting silver eyes i used to love my eyes no one else has them but after seeing him with her how can my eyes be that great he obviously prefers hers i dontknow why i so jealous and why i feeling so cheated we werentgoing out it not as if he two timing me i shouldntcare but i do and i canthelp it i hate this feeling i cantcontrol it i ve always had control over my emotions i could sop myself being angry happy upset with the snap of a finger i ve tried that but it hasntworked i tried to act apathetic over the whole thing but i tell you when kayla tested me over dinner i had never wanted to cry so much never i cantbelieve i ve let myself fall for that idiot he ll never look twice at me kayla right moments mean nothing to sirius black she my best friend but never have i wanted her to be so wrong about something i cantwrite anymore i have to go snowflake xx writing in her diary was the one time when jane felt she should always use her given name she closed her eyes and allowed angry confused heartbroken tears to conquer her face three hours later she still sat there contemplating eyes closed but mind alert three boys walked in looking very unkempt her eyes flew open and she found herself looking into the eyes of the person who had been the topic of all her thoughts jane looked straight back into his eyes but felt her tears start up again with that she got up and ran up the stairs crying silent tears a n how was that disclaimer harry potter belongs to j k rowling only jane adea kayla and any other characters not in the book belong to me a n ya know i love reading reviews just thought i d put that out there hint hint now i warn you short chapter coming up so i ve followed it with a reasonably long in my opinion one what goes around comes around what was that all about sirius asked the other two shrugged the boys retired to their dormitory for the night well morning if you want to get technical as the first rays of sunlight peeped through his hangings sirius lay in bed awake and reflecting i should feel great i mean i do feel great donti i mean estrella she amazing she hot got a great body stunning eyes she smart and kind a good kisser she the whole package so why does this feel wrong there a hole in there somewhere and for some reason it grows bigger every time i with her sirius sirius are you up called james tiredly yeah i up are you sirius called back only just but mate if you re thinking then it may work better if you didntsay random things out loud shut up i didntsay anything out loud uhhh yeah you did james said in a patronising tone right whatever no seriously mate i not kidding you god knows what you were going on about but what i heard was great great body package and hole in fact now that i think about it do i want to know james joked get your mind out of the gutter you twat i was thinking about estrella sirius said what salgado yeah what about her james asked unsurely dunno something about being with her seems wrong you know well you know you have been going for a week it is officially the time to dump her a n jerk yes i know i dunno mate seems a bit harsh don t you think sirius commented who are you and what have you done to my best friend you re sirius black this is what you do anyway she smart she ll probably be expecting this you re right yeah what the hell gotten into me yeah i think i will dump her thanks prongs glad to be of service aaaaaanyway you might want to get up now in case you hadntnoticed it isntthat long til breakfast sirius groaned he hadnthad any sleep at breakfast estrella salgado sat with her sixth year friends in an extremely bad mood she knew what was coming she and sirius black had been going out for exactly a week and like all the other girls she had half heartedly hoped that he would see more in her than any of his other girls but that wasntgoing to happen and she knew it rae you have to eat something a friend advised no i dontfeel like it estrella replied stubbornly listen you knew this was going to happen everyone does yes well that didntstop you from not eating when it happened to you in third year did it she barked her friend shut up and looked away estrella immediately regretted her words listen i really sorry for snapping at you but i ve had a great week and i dontwant it to end she felt a tap on her shoulder she took a deep breath and met her fate with a large sparkling fake smile hey siri sirius wore an expression of guilt hey estrella he replied though not quite meeting her eyes what up sweetie estrella asked though she knew exactly what was up sirius continued to take great interest in the floor uuuumm rae i mean estrella we need to take a walk grab some toast and here james muttered and some tissues sirius glared at him but estrella seemed not to notice he turned back to her come on lets go she nodded took another deep breath and followed her boyfriend soon to be ex boyfriend out of the hall a few seats away two girls had watched the entire scene one very happy and the other pretended though failed dismally not to care hah i knew it what day is it today hmmm wednesday yep it been a week that the break up walk that is kayla simmons announced to her best friend right and so jane said indifferently kayla shot her a look dontgive me that miss i in love with sirius black if you re not squealing and throwing a party inside bob mi uncle the sides of jane mouth twitched as she played around with her pancakes kayla rolled her eyes go on let it all out squeal giggle etcetera etcetera etcetera kayla said sarcastically a n i thinking the king i with that sentence for some reason jane dropped her fork hugged kayla and squealed yes yes yes and let out a fit of giggles you d better get black to ask you out soon i losing my best friend in all of this squealing giggling so not you kayla said jane let out a huff of mock indignation well just for that and she let out a fake squeal and hugged kayla once more with that they got up and left early for their lessons meanwhile down by the lake squeals and giggles were most definitely not crossing estrella salgado mind you want to think more along the lines of wails and tears although they were walking in silence at that particular moment finally sirius stopped abruptly and turned estrella to face him okay well estrella if it makes you feel any better i dontfeel all that great doing this she nodded solemnly a n for goodness sake woman its not the end of the world wait i contradicting myself arenti listen i ve had a great week and everything you re a great girl you really are i mean you re perfect tears started to roll down her cheeks so why are you breaking up with me she whispered tearfully it got nothing to do with you but you see i was going out with you but i like someone else and that not fair to me and it definitely not fair to you you deserve a guy who thinks the world of you and is willing to give you way more than i could estrella nodded again and looked away so sirius could not se how much this was affecting her so you must understand why we have to break this off he received a sob in reply and took it as a yes well we have to get to lessons come on let me walk you up to the castle and they made their way back up in reasonable silence often broken by a sob or two from the crying girl as they were about to part ways in the entrance hall estrella wiped away her tears as best she could and asked in a quiet voice siri sirius he turned one one last thing who the the girl sirius sighed jane swales estrella sadness was immediately replaced with rising anger you picked jane swales over me his face hardened and his eyes changed from their smoky grey to stone cold pits yeah and so what if i did she snorted and they say you have good taste he shook his head disgustedly you re right i must have bad taste i went out with you didnti and with that he turned and made his way to ancient runes lily sat in her ancient runes class not taking a single word of what being said she sat staring out of the window quill in her hand so purity would be miss evans enlighten us professor cummings enquired this seemed to snap her out of her reverie she shook her head huh what several people snickered i asked you what the word for purity is shit purity purity think think uuuumm i dontknow she finished lamely professor cummings sent her a stern look well i suggest you look at me because i guarantee you ancient runes can not be learnt by studying clouds are we clear yes sir he turned and continued with the lesson lily tuned him right back out but this time kept her eyes on the board so far her week had been pretty good well last week lily would ve thought so anyway this week lily now knew exactly what potter thought of her the same potter who had persistently asked her out since first year the snobby conceited arrogant prick was now her superior and she didntlike it one bit in truth james speech had showed her that she was just as bad as she made him out to be in fact little by little as the week progressed his words had affected her so much that lily had started to believe she was inferior to everyone that she didntdeserve to be head girl or get good grades that the slytherins had a right to call her what they did that she didntdeserve her friends and sometimes at the worst that she didntdeserve to be a witch why have his words affected me so much it because he never said something insulting to you before he only ever worshipped the ground you walk on yeah so well you re not used to potter hating you in fact you like the fact there was always someone who thought you were heaven on earth no i didn t that not true you sure well it isn t right right i mean a potter free week must be like heaven to you yeah well no but it not because he doesntlike me anymore it because of what he said so we re back to the original question which was why did his little speech affect you so much oh yeah you re right maybe you dontdeserve those grades you re quite slow i am arenti seems like it no shut up shut up that not true it isn t yeah well what goes around comes around doesntit yeah but that saying doesntwork for me and potter doesntit think about it i donthave to yes you do for all the insults you ve thrown at him and the many times you ve hurt him he come right back at you and used it against you to make you feel insulted and hurt like never before just then the bell rang signalling the end of class this left lily 30 minutes til the next class she got up from her seat and muttered what goes around comes around on her way out she met james hazel gaze they held it for a few long seconds but soon lily felt her tears well up in her eyes and dashed out before they had time to come out meanwhile sirius was rather enjoying the luxuries of being single obviously the news of his status had spread through the girls like wildfire so naturally he had another fawning girl following him the minute he turned into a new corridor as he walked down the great hall corridor to go have lunch by now at least 25 girls in tow plus the 2 hanging off his arms someone shoved past oi watch where you re alright but he trailed at the sight of who it was jane stood there her silver mirror eyes only giving him a perfect reflection of himself but no clue as to what she was feeling he brusquely pulled away his arms from the two who were clinging on hey swales did you hear i broke up with salgado black the quibbler probably cares more than i do he was hurt he tried in vain to search her eyes but they like only a moment before were too glassy to see anything but her pupils she then tore away from his gaze and sped down the staircase in front of her which sirius could ve sworn hadntbeen there a minute ago he shooed away his groupies and ran down the stairs after her hey hey swales she continued walking jane she stopped and turned around what do you want black maybe i didnttell you i broke up with salgado because i like you she looked surprised for a second but it didntlast any longer and she replied coldly now it was sirius turn to be shocked well well do you want to go out with me jane paused before answering no quite frankly what do you mean sirius cried jane looked sympathetic oh dear you ve never faced rejection have you he opened his mouth but had nothing to say on the matter because in all honesty he never had faced rejection she continued listen black it not enough to like me if you want me to be your girlfriend you re going to have to understand me first and have that certain level of sensitivity i require in a guy also i cantgo out with you until you can look me in the eye and promise you wonttire of me within a week can you do that sirius looked at her defiantly but kinda ruined his front by nervously shifting from one foot to the other i i won tire of you jane shook her head look me in the eye sirius at this he looked up and found himself unable to carry out the simple task she d assigned him i thought as much she said jane waited for an answer and when it seemed apparent she wasntgoing to get one she turned on her heels and started to walk away jane she turned around again listen you said i need to understand you yes so how about we just be friends sirius offered jane paused and remembered what had happened with the whole lily and james scene but she shook her head and smiled friends sounds good he grinned at her ran and put his arm round her shoulder the two friends then turned right back round realising that they hadnthad lunch but both thought the same thing friends sounds good for now a n ok that not too bad i guess and also i think next chapter i ll work on the whole remus kayla front
