 november 19 a good night sleep apparently had been enough to mend aislinn headache as she was in the staff room the following morning for the meeting severus was a bit surprised to see her come in scooting in the door and seating herself only seconds before the clock chimed 6 00 the appointed time for the meeting to begin he d always marveled at her ability to cut time so close he was either ten minutes early or late but never precisely on time as she almost always was and as dumbledore began speaking as soon as the clock chimed severus noted that aislinn had a quill and parchment out taking notes another astounding ability in his opinion as the meeting droned on severus found plenty of time to study aislinn after all he knew the issues being brought up by heart teachers needed to be more conscientious about being in the corridors during passing periods aislinn eyes were bright and clear perhaps too bright and clear in fact he wondered why dumbledore was requesting that they all please ascertain that demerits were awarded only when deserved aislinn was studiously not looking at him but then she was also not looking at jordan was that because she was avoiding eye contact with either of them or was she simply engrossed in the meeting she had half a page of notes already but from his vantage point severus wouldnthave been sure if they were notes about the meeting or about the position of venus or lines of poetry speaking of notes severus scrawled a note to himself as did the other three heads of houses when dumbledore said he needed a count of the students who would be staying over the christmas holidays as the usual business wound down to a close one by one the other teachers began offering up their own concerns and complaints sometimes often in fact these supposed staff meetings turned into individual gripe sessions to which the entire staff was subjected just now for instance flitwick was on about something that concerned no one in the room except himself and dumbledore and within seconds there were signs that everyone was growing impatient severus shifted slightly and watched as aislinn began an absent minded doodling on her parchment he couldntsee precisely what she was drawing or if she was drawing anything in particular but just based on the way the end of her quill swirled and dipped he thought it likely that she was making whorls of some sort she was entirely oblivious to him looking up at dumbledore and flitwick now and again but mostly engrossed in her doodles when flitwick and dumbledore finally reached a decision on whatever it was they d been talking about minerva piped in with a complaint that was at least more generally relevant though severus was sure it was aimed primarily at him favoritism she was accusing ran rampant through the corridors and she for one was tired of seeing it it was one thing for students to use that as a handy excuse but when it was blatantly obvious severus tuned that lecture out entirely even if she was looking at dumbledore with occasional glances to madame pomfrey severus had no doubt in his mind that she was speaking to him and you know as well as i do that there is a bloody good reason for me to show favoritism to the slytherin students he thought defensively besides how many members of the staff are quicker to take points from slytherin and slower to award them give it a rest severus knew for a fact that his two and five points at a time were nothing to the fifty points at a time that mcgonagall awarded to and docked from the students she watched most closely how many times had malfoy been docked twenty five points for something absurd how often had potter and company been awarded fifty points for managing to not get killed despite breaking a rule if she wanted to talk about favoritism she could bloody well talk to herself with some degree of amusement severus noted that aislinn was looking decidedly abashed could she possibly think that the little lecture was being directed at her that was an intriguing possibility though one that severus dismissed out of hand after all he had noticed that she was responsible for close to half the points awarded to slytherin that he did not award himself though he wasntsure there was a significant difference in how many she awarded the other houses it was almost laughable really aislinn ichalia could completely stop dispensing points and it likely wouldntaffect the house standings appreciably though the students never seemed to notice that he wondered idly if she realized it probably he conceded she isntstupid after all she very shrewd in fact awarding all those points no wonder the students respond so readily to her she rewards them well but as the rewards are so evenly dispensed it almost as though they dontexist not really the sort of thing he would expect from a gryffindor usually more something he would expect from slytherin and a variation on his own technique he awarded points to few people and took them away almost dispassionately and never enough to amount to anything anyway the horror stories of gryffindor losing fifty points at a time whenever they had potions class was a myth blown out of proportion severus could remember maybe ten days in the history of his career at hogwarts when he d affected any one house points by fifty in either direction when minerva finally wound down from her soapbox severus breathed an indiscernible sigh of relief madame pomfrey managed to get the next word in and severus did make notes of what she said there was a rash of colds going around apparently and all teachers were asked to please send students to her as soon as it became obvious they had colds as she was tired of having to cure bronchitis because a student had spent three weeks sneezing and running a fever before deciding it was bad enough to seek help with she also spoke directly to severus as though suddenly remembering something she d been intending to talk to him about i running low on a number of the potions i use for general aches and pains she was telling him do you think you will have the opportunity to mix some of them if i give you a list or shall i place an order severus frowned for a moment and considered give me a list he told her and i ll let you know whether i can accommodate you or not she nodded and severus glanced at aislinn who had stopped doodling and was studying him rather intently yes he thought that goes for you too ask me and i ll keep a supply of that on hand he didntknow of course whether she was considering asking him about the headache potion but he liked to think she was he liked the idea of her coming to him and meekly begging that he keep her supplied with something for the pains in her head in fact he liked the idea of being able to help with those headaches whether she asked it or not and he decided then and there to enlist pomfrey help in the matter if anyone could insist that someone take better care of herself it was the formidable school nurse filch was piping up next complaining about the dungbombs being set off in the corridors in the evenings he was certain that it was harry potter but severus as much as he wished he could lay the blame at potter feet actually rather suspected a certain hufflepuff he closed out the remainder of that discussion and put his mind to an enticing fantasy about slipping something into jordan mickery tea nothing truly harmful of course but something that would keep him say running to the bathroom all day would be amusing it was not of course something severus would actually do but the idea was almost enough to make him smile and almost enough to make him scowl and you re supposed to be a mature adult he scolded himself not some misbehaving adolescent surely you ve outgrown any affinity you ever had for pranks as it happened severus had never really had much of an inclination towards pranks pranks by definition were anonymous acts of mischief and severus preferred to be recognized for what he did and mischief wasntreally his style either if he were going to do something it was usually for revenge and revenge was sweeter by far if the person receiving was blatantly aware of it for another half hour the meeting droned on and finally at 7 30 it adjourned and not a moment too soon if the reactions of hooch and sprout were any indication after all the meeting had lasted half an hour into breakfast and those two were notorious for thinking they had to have their meals precisely on schedule as severus gathered his notes though a rumbling in his own stomach reminded him that he was hungry as well and he wasted no time in getting to the great hall no one did in fact except aislinn and jordan mickery severus found himself reconsidering his stance on pranks any thoughts severus might have entertained about laxatives in teacups were cut short by his entrance to the great hall where he found that in the absence of adult supervision half a dozen fifth year students four of them slytherin he noted with a certain degree of resignation had found pleasure in levitating a terrified looking first year high above the teachers table severus long legs and determined stride had brought him to the hall before any of the other teachers so his was the singular pleasure of dealing with the vapid antics of students with too much time on their hands with a grimace the potions master backed out of the great hall again retreating silently and unnoticed by students who were having entirely too much fun taunting the poor boy or in the case of a few brave souls defending him to notice that anyone had entered three of the teachers were approaching now and he held up a hand to indicate that they shouldntspeak and while sprout looked a bit put off the rest of them stood back as severus opened the doors again this time with a bang that echoed through the room silence descended and the first year boy began a quick descent as well as the ones who had found it so amusing to elevate him seemed to forget it was a human their wands were holding up rather than a feather severus whipped out his wand and pointed it at the boy shouting an incantation and catching him just before he hit the table holding him there severus closed his eyes and silently said a brief prayer of thanks to whichever was the deity that had kept the other boys from losing their concentration a second sooner snape lowered the boy slowly to the ground his dark eyes glittering angrily as he passed the slytherin table bestowing a frozen glare on the lot of them i hope he said dangerously that there is a suitable explanation for this he shot a look at the first year and sighed inwardly a hufflepuff of course and the two students involved in the stunt who were not slytherin were ravenclaws pity that he wouldnthave the chance to deduct points from gryffindor in front of mcgonagall face for such an act well mr murphy severus let his eyes settle on a black haired gray eyed boy who was very nearly as tall as he was no explanation the boy shook his head and severus moved his gaze to pin another one to his seat mr arnold again there was no answer and severus moved his eyes to the next student then the next and the next none of them it seemed had an explanation draco malfoy however had a smirk on his face that the head of slytherin itched to wipe away mr malfoy he asked suddenly his voice dropping to a shade more deadly draco smiled the smile of a boy who was confident he was safe from punishment by virtue of his name yes professor he asked his voice the model of respect severus however was far from convinced draco malfoy had picked up the worst of his father habits but fell somewhat short of the charm his father oozed that boy could learn a good bit from lucius severus thought as he watched the malfoy prodigy i not sure he doesnthave more to learn than i did there were few left at hogwarts who realized it but as a boy severus had been greatly influenced by lucius malfoy who had a silken way of sweeping people along with him charismatic charming a natural leader who looked like a king even when he was on his knees at the dark lord feet lucius had left a life long impression on severus one that had begun long before severus was in service to the dark lord severus oh no he thought burying his head deeper into his pillow god if you exist please dontlet that be if god existed he apparently didnthave much sympathy for eleven year old boys who were crying into their pillows and praying that no one noticed the mattress sank a little and severus stiffened as he felt a hand on his back what wrong severus there was no mistake about it now the smooth voice belonged to lucius malfoy a sixth year prefect whom severus admired greatly lucius had been quite kind to him since his arrival at hogwarts intervening when he was being teased relentlessly taking a moment to show him the way to his classes giving him a few words of advice on how to tell when the stairs were about to change so that he wouldntbe caught on the wrong floor of the wrong wing if severus had ever had an older brother he imagined that it would have been something like having lucius around severus however had not had an older brother nor any brothers at all he was an only child which while lonely was probably for the best severus had never wished for a brother or sister he wouldntinflict his family on anyone not even someone he hated nothing he whispered trying valiantly to stop crying but not quite able to muster it there was a lengthy silence and he might have thought that lucius had left him to his misery except that there was still a comforting hand on his back it was the first time he had ever considered that someone might not be about to abandon him slowly his tears began to subside and at length he trusted himself to sit up hoping that his eyes had dried sufficiently to not embarrass him further in front of the older boy there was something in severus that desperately wanted to please the prefect and something that screamed that being a bawling little baby was not the best way to go about that as he lifted his head though his cheeks were still damp from the tears dry your eyes lucius suggested calmly offering him a linen handkerchief severus took the handkerchief still trembling slightly waiting for the older boy to start laughing at him the laughter however never came it would be several years before severus understood that there came a point in a man life where he realized that tears were not a reason to ridicule anyone let alone an eleven year old boy th thank you he hiccuped complying with lucius suggestion which while polite had been firm as severus tended to his tear streaked face lucius rose from where he d been sitting on the edge of the bed and walked away carefully studying a poster on the wall across the room intently not noticing the younger boy humiliation that had been the first time that severus had ever truly realized what kind of man he wanted to grow up to be a man like lucius malfoy calm and composed at all times icily distant and indifferent smoothly poised and coolly detached yet always formally polite severus had grown up in a small dirty flat his father a drunkard his mother desperately needy he d spent his short life trying not to anger his father as that always ended disastrously his mother once a beautiful woman was either unable or unwilling to defend severus from his father so he d learned at an early age to take care with what he said and did in the man presence he d learned to hide in his small filthy room and to keep quiet amusing himself by reading books that no child should have even had access to he d been like a little sponge soaking up information and he d spent weeks on end with his father wand practicing illicitly of course he shouldnthave been doing any such thing but no one in his family ever paid him much mind and there was no one about to guide his interest away from the curses and hexes curses and hexes he d always dreamed of being able to use on his father as payment for the hellish life he lead now lucius was speaking and severus looked at the handkerchief still clutched in his hands frowning a bit at it was he supposed to give it back to lucius he certainly didntthink he would want a handkerchief back after some sniffling kid had snotted all over it but he folded it and set it on the bed so lucius could make that determination for himself tell me what is the matter severus this time the prefect tone was firm and unyielding and severus had no more inclination to ignore him than he would have had to ignore the headmaster still he didntreally want to talk about it either it stupid he muttered under his breath and lucius laughed softly if you really thought that it would not have upset you so the older boy said reasonably turning his head to one side as though trying to find a better angle from which to consider the still sniffling boy severus looked at the blanket on his bed tracing a fold with his finger he did think that it was stupid and what was more he was sure that lucius would think it was stupid and he felt stupid for letting it bother him but one glance at that calm aristocratic face told severus that it would do no good to protest lucius had eyes like glaciers and even at seventeen he had mastered an icy look that demanded obedience it was why he made such a good prefect no one even wanted to cross lucius malfoy they they just said severus sighed heavily they said my da a drunk he admitted finally they said he a worthless pile of rags did they lucius had stood again and walked over to the window moving the curtain aside and who are they severus severus frowned and looked at his hands james potter and sirius black he replied quietly lucius had clasped his hands behind his back and was staring outside james potter lucius repeated slowly and sirius black black at least might have some room to talk he is after all a pureblood at least potter however lucius clucked his tongue a mudblood and a blood traitor why severus do you let what they say bother you black eyes glittered behind a fresh sheen of tears because it true he whispered lucius turned around a smile on his face that didntwarm his eyes and what has that to do with anything he asked your father and yes severus i know who your father is he had the potential to be anything he wanted he squandered that potential true enough but what does that matter even the best orchard will sometimes bear rotten fruit he was walking across the room again and severus eyes followed him as though attached with a string whatever else he may be though your father is a pureblood as is your mother and you severus are not trapped by their erroneous and unfortunate decisions they gave you a powerful gift the only gift you need from them and that my boy is a bloodline that reaches back before recorded time you take that gift and never look back severus you decide what you do with it because it is your birthright and that is something that the likes of james potter will never be able to claim wide eyed severus watched as lucius came back to stand before his bed he wanted to believe the pale haired prefect really he did but it was hard but if everyone judges me by my father he began but lucius raised a hand and cut him off they will not he said firmly i will tell you something severus if you promise not to spread it around severus nodded awestruck at the grace with which lucius moved the finesse with which he spoke my own family he said with a hard smile is not perfection incarnate to the beginning of time not two hundred years ago the malfoys were barely better than common peasants the blood wasting away and all but spent but my grandfather great grandfather who was the last of the line and the family last hope made it his goal to be better than the family dictated he worked hard severus and he was determined and he kept the estates from falling to ruin and he made himself worthy of marriage back into the blood and he saw to it that his children and grandchildren were properly schooled and educated by the time my grandfather was a student at hogwarts the malfoy name was respected again and no one dares suggest it was ever anything else now severus nodded slowly understanding gleaming in his eyes but it was an understanding entwined with doubt but i dontknow how to to what lucius asked smoothly that right what is it you dontknow how to do anyway severus thought for a moment then frowned a bit i dontknow how to act and to to talk right and to he fumbled clumsily for words to express what he meant i dontknow how to be like you lucius however seemed to understand inherently what severus could not say well he said sounding as though he were contemplating i suppose that you really need just find someone to model yourself after someone you respect and would like to be like the headmaster perhaps there was a subtly sneering emphasis on headmaster and severus bit his lip he liked dumbledore dumbledore was always nice to him always had candy for the students always made them laugh lucius however did not seem to be as fond of the headmaster as severus was no he whispered hesitantly half asking i not sure that i want to be like dumbledore lucius rewarded him with a smile that apparently had been the right answer hm perhaps professor flitwick then severus shook his head immediately this time no he said more convinced who would you choose then lucius asked and severus thought quickly not wanting to sound like a pathetic little snit saying you lucius maybe professor nicklin he suggested and lucius smile broadened nicklin was defense against the dark arts professor and head of slytherin house likely the best choice he commented smoothly so you keep your eye on professor nicklin lucius suggested and dontworry about what james potter and sirius black say i think the time will soon come when they will suffer the consequences of their actions and when that day comes severus you will find that you are the victor not they lucius malfoy had been instrumental in bringing most of the slytherins to voldemort aid for at least a decade and severus had been included in that after all it was never nicklin he d modeled himself after but malfoy there were very few indeed who remembered severus snape as the uneducated terrified little brat he d been his first year at hogwarts by his second year he d been making progress towards learning to talk and act like the admirable lucius malfoy severus was aware that draco knew that his father held influence over hogwarts in general and slytherin in particular but he wasntsure if the youngest malfoy had any idea how much influence lucius had always had over the potions teacher personally malfoy why did you allow this to happen severus voice was smooth and silky and he could tell by the look of doubt that flickered across the delicately boned face that his question had hit a nerve with draco possibly because i learned that tone and that calm from your father i had nothing to do with it sir i was sitting right here the whole time you can ask i dontneed to ask severus replied evenly i want to know why it is that four slytherin students were involved in a dangerous prank while a sixth year prefect sat at the table with them and did not so much as lift a finger to stop them by the time he d made his way to the teachers table severus had added another day to his tally of times he d deducted more than fifty points from a single house in one day he d taken ten points from each of the prefects present and to his delight found that meant that gryffindor lost the most fifty as all six of their prefects were there severus was uninterested in the fact that all had been part of the group trying variously to order the slytherins down to disarm them and it had been a gryffindor who went in search of the teachers his own house had lost forty points though which soured his mood slightly after all there had been two slytherin prefects present and four slytherins involved two ravenclaws and four ravenclaw prefects the three hufflepuff prefects however did not lose any points for inaction as even severus couldntquite bring himself to deduct points from the victim house when it was obvious that the hufflepuffs had been outraged over the incident to begin with he did however take five points from each of the hufflepuff prefects for general ineffectiveness he made a biting comment about being unable to leave the students alone even for the time it took them to eat breakfast and implied that perhaps the entire school should receive detention not of course that he had any intention of actually doing that the paperwork alone would be enough to deter him and dumbledore would never allow it the rest of the staff would protest of course but severus was feeling contrary enough by now to not be particularly concerned with any of them professor sprout of course had been close on severus heels and awarded her own house thirty points for their lack of retaliation severus wasntsure that was a behavior worth rewarding but left the herbology teacher to her rat killing and madame pomfrey had fussed over the victim who was crying and snuffling and carrying on until severus thought his head was going to explode from the commotion and mcgonagall had glared at him for taking points from gryffindor and when it came right to it he still thought that he was justified after all prefects should be able to keep the students out of trouble in the absence of teachers and then just as severus finally made it to his place at the table the doors to the great hall opened again and dumbledore appeared with jordan mickery and aislinn ichalia close on his heels and mcgonagall would have no delays in telling the headmaster everything that had transpired and in short severus never did manage breakfast which put him in an especially sour mood for the rest of the day september 1 with the setting sun came the shrill whistly of the hogwarts express and there was a flutter of last minute activity as the teachers took their places in the great hall assembled on either side of dumbledore severus found his chair near the middle of the table and frowned towards the end trying to catch a glimpse of the dark haired aislinn who had developed a disturbing habit of popping up wherever he was he d still not managed to work out who she was and he suspected she knew that it was beginning to drive him marginally insane and he suspected that she was enjoying it twice he d tried to trick her into revealing her identity by asking questions but the little vixen had outwitted him both times always seeming to know instinctively when he was prowling for answers she d left a number of clues lying around and much to his irritation it had taken him three days to realise that she was doing it on purpose offering him a tantalizing hint he had made his first discovery at lunch one day when she made a comment that had left him certain of her age twenty seven it would seem and he had gone straight back to his office to find class lists from his first years teaching at hogwarts but there was no aislinn and no ichalia that evening her subtle off handed remark had led him to believe that she was slytherin though he was certain she would have remembered her if she had been a day later though he found himself wondering if she was actually a ravenclaw who had been a student at the same time he was then she led him to believe that she was a gryffindor who had graduated maybe five years ago and then he thought perhaps she had been one of the students who had visited hogwarts during the triwizard tournament he had finally devided she was leading him along and enjoying his chasing of hints that were no more hints than what dumbledore had said and if he were entirely truthful he was intrigued by her even as she drove him to the brink of distraction he couldntremember the last time anyone was able to befuddle him as thoroughly as she had and he was quite enjoying the challenge on some level but he still wanted to know who she was and it irked him that it was the beginning of the term now and he was no more sure of her identity than he had been a week ago he watched her as she talked to the other teachers lively and animated her hands gesturing expansively as she elaborated on some point that had flintwick in tears from laughter from the way she was beaming severus assumed that laughter was the desired reaction to whatever she was saying his eyes lingered on her for a moment more despite his overall lack of success in discerning who she was he had noted a few more things about her for one she was not quite so tall as he had originally thought she simply had a penchant for shoes with a three to four inch heel on them that made her seem to tower without the shoes though she still came very close to looking him in the eye which was almost unnerving few men looked severus snape in the eye and he d never known a woman tall enough to do so he had also found that her eye color seemed to change from day to day they ranged from an enchanting shade of peacock blue to nearly black to almost silver to a shade evocative of midnight whatever color they were though they sparkled constantly except when she didntfeel well this he had stumbled onto quite by accident as one morning her eyes had been that lovely blue laced with just a smidge of green and shimmering like the ocean and a few hours later they appeared clouded and hard as iron she had admitted that she had a splitting headache and in a fit of altruism or something like it he had brewed her a subtly calming potion that could be added to a cup of tea and he d sat with her while she drank it as she took the cup from him and sipped so trustingly he immediately found himself thinking that he could provide her with a tea laced with veritasserum but it seemed simply wrong to betray her trust so and for no reason other than to satisfy his own curiousity he had also noted in some distant portion of his mind that noticed such things that she was stunningly beautiful how he had failed to notice it before was beyond him but four days after he had left her in the infirmary the afternoon she sat sipping the potion laced tea he had brewed for her headache it had suddenly hit him that she was extraordinarily beautiful he justified his dismal lack of observation by telling himself that he had first met her with her hair hanging around her face and sitting in an unglorified heap atop a pile of rubbish he insisted that there was no way he could have known that those volumous blue velvet robes concealed a curvaceous body that had shocked him two evenings ago when he found her and minerva talking over a glass of something that looked suspiciously like whiskey to his eye that was so untrained in these things and she had a smile that was so bright that it outshone the sun perhaps a voice in the back of his mind suggested she is not so very beautiful after all perhaps she simply acts like a beautiful woman and therefore becomes beautiful that was a thought worth mulling over and he had done so at length over a glass of sherry after all she was too tall to look entirely feminine and her nose was rather small giving her something of a child like appearance half the time her face was certainly not the model of ideal beauty it was too round and she was always a bit flushed as though she d just run through the halls and if he were entirely honest there were lines at the corners of her eyes and mouth which again made him wonder how old she was anyway and that hair of hers the first several times he d seen her it had been up not withstanding the very first encounter when it obviously had been up but did not survive her fall nearly as gracefully as she had but when he did finally come across her with her hair down he was surprised that it was not as silky as he d first thought she had enough hair to make three wigs out of and she had laughed and told him that she wore it up because it was the only way she could trap it into order he believed her after seeing the wild cascades of curls that spilled over her shoulders and to her waist and he d very nearly laughed when she batted it out of her way one day with the indignant accusation that it was attacking her none of this took awy from her beauty though only made it curious to him that someone who while attractive could hardly be considered the ideal of beauty and yet held eyes wherever she went as surely as did a veela the doors of the great hall suddenly burst open startling severus out of his thoughts and he turned his attention to the students entering the great hall filing in and separating to their tables he smiled tightly to the slytherin table as the students took their seats and noted with some pleasure that a few of the gryffindors were looking askance at him he had spent long years cultivating a reputation that preceeded him every year he had to do very little now to keep the students convinced that he was cruel and heartless his first years were always the recipient of a great many detentions from him and few of them ever forgot that he was fast to award detention and fast to deduct points from a house and that fear often lingered with them through their years at hogwarts the din in the hall reached a high level as the returning students found their seats and greeted their classmates if there was one thing that never ceased to surprise him it was the noise that students were capable of severus had always been quiet as a boy as a teenager and as a man so he could never understand how students could be so loud he resisted the urge to massage his temples a sudden hush came over the hall and the doors swung open again admitting a double line of first year students severus caught himself shaking his head slightly every year they looked a little younger to him some day they were going to come in in strollers and it wasntgoing to particularly surprise him he sat through the sorting ceremony marking with interest who went to gryffindor and who to slytherin and noting with half an eye the hufflepuffs and ravenclaws and he kept miss ichalia in his peripheral vision trying to discern a favoritism towards one house over another if there was more enthusiasm for anyone he thought it was for the students who looked the most frightened when the sorting was over minerva tapped her goblet with her spoon to catch everyone attention and dumbledore stood to address students and faculty the first announcements were what were expected welcome to the new students and keep out of the dark forest and donthex each other in the corridors between classes all of this went fairly quickly giving severus a moment to study his new slytherin charges as head of their house he knew that he had to be alert for possible trouble from them and he could already tell that one of the girls was going to be a problem not five minutes into the headmaster speech she was making eyes at two of the boys sitting across from her severus made a mental note to have a chat with her and as you can plainly see we have new teachers to welcome to hogwarts this year first i would like to introduce our newest divination teacher whom some of you seventh years may remember from your own first experience at hogwarts professor ichalia severus head turned back to aislinn who had stood and was waving to a girl at the far end of the ravenclaw table who was waving furiously at her at the back of the hall a murmur was slipping through and severus strained his ears to hear what they were saying the murmur mounted and finally he could pick a single name out of the whispered rush hannah hannah carlisle that was the consensus the students apparently assumed that miss carlisle had married and that was why she was now mrs ichalia and for a moment severus considered that but she d made no mention of a husband and wore no ring on her left hand and he had not heard of a mr ichalia living anywhere on the premesis it was a swift conclusion on his part that she was not married and it was just as wel that it was swift for realisation slapped against him beating all other thoughts out of his head hannah carlisle he did remember her and his eyes snapped back to aislinn no hannah whoever she was she had been one of the banes of his existence grating on his nerves very nearly as badly as that potter brat did as he watched her he mentally subtracted years and replaced her velvet blue robe with a simple black one and let her hair fall in messy tangles around her face tangles that were forever getting caught in the fire under her cauldron how many times had he been forced to put out flames because that little dunderhead couldntremember to bring a ribbon or something to class he had threatened to cut her hair all off the fourth time it happened and after six times he had taken to having the detention slip already written out by the time she was a second year he d learned to have a string for her which he dropped unceremoniosly on her desk every day and for which she always thanked him as though he was showing her some kindness she had been a gryffindor and a teacher worst nightmare a quick mind that she used for everything in the world except lessons and studying a mischievous streak a mile wide and an mouth that never closed even when she was in detention she d been prone to chattering to him or mumbling as she read merlin beard that girl was a teacher now god help them all december 10 professor professor snape severus stopped his determined stalk and turned around lifting an eyebrow at the brave ravenclaw who had stopped him yes he asked affixing the student with a glare worthy of a gryffindor i the student paused and looked momentarily doubtful of the intelligence of his actions then barrelled ahead some of the other second years and i were wondering if we could he swallowed hard if we could schedule a time with you for some questions and answers the student was trailing off and appearing to seriously doubt the idea which had undoubtedly seemed such a good one before it actually came time to implement it i see severus said silkily moving slightly just enough to set his robes aflutter the effect was precisely as he d anticipated the ravenclaw looked like he was about to wet himself from fright and how many of you are there who have not been paying attention in class the student paled but lifted his chin determinedly we were paying attention sir but severus shook his head slightly i did not ask you whether you were paying attention mr flanagan he whispered smoothly i asked how many of you there are if you wish to bother me to repeat what i have said in class already it is obvious that you were not paying attention the boy took a visibly deep breath eleven sir eleven students severus was actually mildly impressed that they had the foresight to organize a study group and to request some time with a teacher all together but he had little intention of letting them know that and how long do you think it will take the eleven of you to learn what you did not learn in class flannagan opened his mouth eyes flashing indignantly and severus mouth curled into a sneer as he waited for the boy to protest again ravenclaws however were fast learners and nearly as canny as slytherins three hours he asked smoothing all defiance from his voice severus nodded slowly very well mr flannagan seven o clock sharp tuesday evening in the dungeons and if you find other students who wish to attend they may the boy looked immensely relieved and grinned thank you sir he called and turned all but running back down the corridor severus shook his head slightly and wondered what the students wanted extra information about it would help if he could spend a few moments referencing page numbers as he certainly preferred to tell the students where to look and have them find information themselves rather than simly offering it to them on a platter but then assuming the students were ravenclaw it wasntlikely they would be asking questions that were so obvious ravenclaws were notoriously studious and while there was the occasional student who didntapply himself as fully as he could they certainly knew which of their house members to ask for additional help he doubted any of his students would come to him for additional help if there were any other feasible option thus it stood to reason that there would be little by way of preparatory work that he could do to make the process easier oh well he thought dismissively severus knew he could teach any of his classes off the cuff and teach them well he was after all a potions master not just some loon hired to teach it he continued his path to the slytherin tower where he intended to look in on his charges and assure himself that they were aware that the extended curfew applied only to those who intended to use it for studying as he stepped into the common room though he frowned at the scene there was substantially less talking than he had anticipated but also very little reading or writing or anything else of use everyone was instead staring at the entrance to the girl dormitory and severus took a deep breath before turning his eyes to that portal as well there were parts of his position as head of slytherin that he utterly detested and one of those parts was keeping the girls in line the boys were sufficiently scared of him and fundamentally familiar at least the girls on the other hand were a complete mystery and a mystery he had always felt required more monitoring than the boys and once or twice he d had the unhappy distinction of being the adult figure to coach a crying girl through one or another important phase in her life severus did not feel he was precisely qualified to be instructing girls on the finer subtleties of womanhood and from the attention everyone was paying the girls dormitory he was afraid he was going to be called upon tonight to do some unpleasant task involving the girls to waylay some crisis of vast magnitude his concerns were quickly aliviated though as the door from the girls dormitory to the common room opened and one miss aislinn ichalia stepped out severus eyes narrowed suspiciously he d barely seen her for more than five minutes at a time since the night he d returned from a summons by the dark lord what was she doing here now he wasted no time in asking her ah miss ichalia his voice had taken on some of the smooth disdain for which he was famous with the students thankfully not falling into the uncertain worry that tended to plague him when he was alone with her an unusual place for a gryffindor he commented almost mildly aislinn stopped suddenly her eyes widening a fraction but the expression was quickly replaced by a broad smile nonsense professor snape she replied i haventbeen a gryffindor for some years i am merely a teacher and as such i do have the right to go wherever i choose in this castle that wasntquite the truth of it but it was close enough and severus had little intention of revealing to the students that there were places that were off limits to the faculty then what brings you here he asked pointedly opting for a different tactic her smile broadened across her face but seemed to leave her eyes all together another privledge of being on the other side of the big desk now isntit professor i am no longer obligated to explain myself to you she was stalking across the common room now and severus noted with vague interest that she traded her robes for a full lightweight skirt that brushed her calves tantalizingly when she moved and emphasized the curves of her hips hips that swayed alarmingly as she stepped gracefully through the room it had something to do with the height of the heels she was wearing that much hed worked out but he didntunderstand how it worked the higher her heels though the more her hips swayed and tonight the spikes that elevated her were four inches or better he was sure he pulled his eyes firmly back to her face and i miss ichalia have the right to know what is going on in my own house tower she opened her mouth again as though to argue but to severus pleasant surprise she closed it and lowered her head slightly as though conceding the point very well professor she replied i was visiting with a student he looked at her skeptically for a moment which student he asked glancing towards the dormitory again and why any hint there had been of submission about her flitted away that professor is not a topic suitable for discussion in a common room if you wish a report i will deliver it to your desk he frowned at her she was baiting him and he knew it but he couldnttell if she was aware he knew it or not on the one hand if it were something for which she d felt the need to deduct points from slytherin he would find out about it in due time on the other hand if she were simply making an informal visit to one of the slytherin students pressing the issue might well turn the informal visit into one with more action taken he thought carefully for a moment torn between curiosity and a certain degree of indignation that she would walk into his common room and still maintain that she was queen of the bloody castle and a desire to let well enough alone he studied her carefully but there was no glittering of her eyes and once again he noted that her smiles were nowhere near those expressive orbs she was not perhaps strictly toying with him a word with you miss ichalia he asked and a murmur swept through the room reminding severus that he had a student audience in private she looked again for a moment as though she were going to protest but glanced at the students again severus looked at them too and noted with some alarm that all eyes were on them for the love of merlin he begged silently just back down for once in your life aislinn perhaps to his surprise she did just that very well she conceded he gestured to the door and she didnteven glance back at the students before she slipped out of the portrait hole severus however did look back and noted the smirks on a number of students faces he cast them a warning look and not a word was said but as he followed aislinn into the corridor he heard someone making the comment she about to find out that once a gryffindor always a gryffindor and gryffindor is not welcome in slytherin common rooms severus didntbother to correct the boy who d said it though he had no intention of anything of the sort he had mostly wanted to get her out of there before she made a fool of him again a task she seemed to delight in where did you have in mind for our private word her voice interrupted his thoughts and he glanced around his initial reaction was to suggest his office but in all honesty he didntwant to go back down to the dungeons for what he anticipated being a ten minute conversation then again he didntparticularly relish the idea of taking her to his personal rooms either there were not however all that many choices presenting themselves readily and with a slight sigh he resigned himself to the unpleasant options he had my own rooms are nearby he suggested or we can go back down to the dungeons i dontexpect this discussion will take long aislinn nodded and glanced down the corridor and he wondered if she was thinking the same things he was the dungeon was a long walk for a short conversation but she didntseem terribly keen on his personal rooms either finally though she sighed softly i would really rather not go back to the dungeons tonight she told him he nodded and gestured down a corridor they walked in silence past a few intersecting corridors then he touched her elbow to indicate they d reached their destination he spoke his password softly though she d suddenly found a polite interest in a tapestry across the corridor perhaps he wouldnthave to change the password now after all aislinn she turned back to him and preceeded him into the room pausing a few steps inside and to the left of the door lumos he said as he closed the door behind him and all the candles sprang into light casting a soft glow over the austere sitting room he glanced towards his bedchamber and noted with relief that the door was closed then gestured towards a chair have a seat he invited crossing to the sideboard against the back wall would you care for something to drink tea sherry no thank you she replied politely the surge of disappointment he felt must have touched his face because her lips quirked into a half smile you said yourself that this will be a short conversation she pointed out reasonably he nodded of course he removed a glass for himself and momentarily considered vodka but settled for sherry then i will be brief what were you doing in the slytherin tower she smiled briefly i told you severus i was visiting a student why he took a drink of his sherry as he seated himself and she shook her head slightly then drew her feet up to tuck them under herself then seeming to think better of it put them on the floor again that really none of your concern she told him bluntly and his eyes narrowed was the student in question a slytherin he asked pointedly and she gave him a level look i was under the impression that most of the students who live in slytherin dormitories are slytherin am i wrong in this assumption the look he gave her said clearly that he was not amused and her look said clearly that she was not impressed by his scowl it was a visit for personal reasons severus just leave it at that he considered that for a moment he knew he could pursue the issue and if he really wanted to he could insist she tell him but she had insinuated that perhaps it was something he didntwant to know personal reasons that phrase when coupled with his female students brought to mind any number of things he didntreally want to know or to think about and he doubted seriously that aislinn was unaware of that she was after all a very perceptive young woman and yet knowing that about her he wondered if it was a ploy on her part after all that would be a simple way to deter a man from asking more questions wouldntit he tried for a moment to convince himslef that she wouldntuse the possibility of feminine mysteries to deter him from asking more questions but he couldntreally convince himself of that a frown crossed his face very well he conceded but i have a question for you then and what is that she asked why were you not slytherin she looked momentarily taken aback and stared at him thoughtfully for a moment as though trying to decide whether or not to grace him with an answer he took the opportunity to elaborate you have a drive and determination and great skill he said softly sipping his sherry again and a shrewdness that i do not remember from your days as a student which makes me wonder if i was blind to it or if it is a quality you have developed since you left hogwarts regardless you are in possession of all the traits that slytherin prizes so why is it that you were sorted into gryffindor aislinn laughed a bit how should i know how the sorting hat decides these things she asked my mother was slytherin my father was ravenclaw his father was gryffindor and his mother hufflepuff my mother parents were slytherin and ravenclaw i think perhaps i have the longest line of hodgepodge houses of any student who ever attended hogwarts this last was a dry comment and severus exhaled briefly in a soft snort of laughter indeed it was a keen observation most of the families who had long lines of students at hogwarts were slytherin then the sorting hat did not waffle over you he asked softly taking another sip of his sherry aislinn smiled no severus the hat barely settled onto my head before declaring me gryffindor my mother was hardly thrilled when she found out but i dontknow that anyone else in the family so much as noticed severus twirled his glass thoughtfully between his thumb and forefinger it uncommon for a pureblood not to be sorted into slytherin he commented noncommittally she lifted an eyebrow perhaps the sorting hat realized that i am not precisely a pureblood then she suggested and he nodded he hadntthought she was by virtue of the fact that he knew next to nothing about her family but he d entertained the possibility that she was after all he wasntso conceited as to think he knew every witch and wizard who had ever lived my grandparents were all witches and wizards she said with a slight shrug but that as far back as the line goes really not something mother discusses very much severus nodded again and took another sip of his sherry wondering idly how long she would talk if he didntinterrupt her she had always been prone to talking and it seemed that age hadntdone much to stay her tongue she didntdisappoint him mother has it in her head that another generation or three will see our family as esteemed as the malfoy or goyle she was saying and i ve never been able to convince her that however she tries to solidify the line our family will always have something like forty fewer generations of magical ancestors than those others she doesntseem to understand that concept a note of criticism had slipped into her voice and again she moved as though she were going to tuck her feet under her but stopped many families seek to solidify blood lines severus commented noncommittally yes aislinn sighed softly i know she stretched her fingers studying them carefully she had such great hopes that i would be the key to the establishing of our family but severus prompted she smiled bitterly but i turned out to be somewhat less than ideal for the challenge she replied offering not a bit more information than he already had severus sipped his sherry again but apparantly she had learned a bit of restraint over the years as she offered no more information he was quiet for the moment debating whether or not to pursue the question with her his curiosity warring with his desire not to look like he cared too greatly at length though curiosity won out may i ask why not he asked softly aislinn snorted softly it a long story she told him i have the time he replied she was quiet for a moment and he thought she was going to tell him to sod off and mind his own business which he did not doubt he deserved but after a pause she leaned back in the chair and closed her eyes does your offer for sherry still stand she asked he raised an eyebrow and set his own glass aside then stood and moved over to the sideboard and poured her a glass after delivering it into her hand he seated himself again and watched as she swirled the amber liquid absently in the glass she held it up to the light for a moment looking at it and for a moment he considered telling her that he hadntpoisoned it but she sipped it before he could open his mouth thank you she said quietly still studying the glass he sipped his own sherry and waited after a moment she began speaking you might remember i told you i battled cancer when i was a child she asked and he nodded frowning slightly well the treatment for it had a rather unpleasant side effect she said quietly she tipped her head back and emptied the contents of her glass down her throat i sterile she told him you cantbuild a family from a daughter who canthave babies somehow he d been expecting a more elaborate less blunt explanation but he felt his heart ache softly for her just the same i can imagine that your mother was not overly pleased he speculated rising to refill her glass she smiled humorlessly hardly she affirmed in fact it a bit ironic when i first began showing signs of the disease mother ignored the symptoms she didntwant anyone in the wizarding community to know that her daughter had a dreadful disease and i suppose it was easier for her to deny it if she didntknow either it was my father mother who finally took me to a muggle hospital because that would be easier to keep from my mother and it was my father who signed the paperwork to have me admitted mother she paused and emptied half her glass again would have likely let me die as it happened though she was content enough to leave me in a muggle hospital where no one was likely to discover my condition she dipped a finger into her glass and ran it softly along the rim a high pitched ringing suddenly filling the room the doctors said that had they caught the disease sooner the treatment would have been less intense and perhaps the results not so drastic i dontthink she said ten words to me since then severus took another sip of his sherry watching her over the rim of her glass go and comfort her said a soft voice in his head now is your chance he didntknow what to do or say though so he did and said nothing she said nothing but finished her second glass of sherry fairly quickly severus rose to refill it but she shook her head and he nodded and sank into his chair again it seems a bit harsh he said finally treating you so for something that was not your fault aislinn shrugged she prefers to pretend i dontexist she said bluntly particularly since she had another daughter when i was halfway through my time here severus raised an eyebrow and his mind began churning piecing together information the seventh year students remembered her from when they were first years which meant it had been seven years since she d left hogwarts and her sister was born when she was halfway through so around her fourth year which would have been eleven years ago and that meant your sister is in slytherin he concluded aloud she stared at him for a moment then suddenly started laughing you didntknow that honestly severus i thought you were being obtuse this evening and i thought you kept calling me miss carlisle to tell me that you knew amber was my sister she shook her head slightly and raised her empty glass to her lips then frowned at it as though suddenly realizing it was empty i wonder which one of us won that one then severus however was too busy staring at her amber carlisle the girl he d been watching the first day of school the evening of the feast the one he d had to chase to her dormitory so often the one who always talked back to him in class and had such an engaging smile and a penchant for detention that girl was aislinn sister he took a deep breath and shook his head clearing his thoughts i suppose i should have expected that he conceded but i must admit that i had no clue aislinn shrugged just as well mother would probably prefer no one knew she and i are related there was something of a warning in that and severus nodded slowly frowning as his mind worked past the shock that aislinn had a sister who was one of his own students and a slytherin at that he found himself suddenly reassessing aislinn earlier comments to him trapped by her name was she suddenly he thought he could see that he stood and went back to the sideboard pouring himself another glass of sherry and bringing the bottle to refill her glass as well try to make that one last more than two minutes he chastised then returned the bottle to its place he moved his chair a bit closer to hers and seated himself again she gave him a slightly grateful smile thank you she said quietly and sipped a silence fell between them but it was oddly comfortable a simple matter of two people sitting in comfortable chairs with sherry and a mutual understanding well severus at least knew there was a mutual understanding though he doubted aislinn knew it slytherin he began quietly taking a deep interest in his glass has one very serious fault though if you repeat that i will deny i ever said it aislinn lips quirked into a smile there is such a great emphasis on being of the right family which is unfortunate it the one thing a person cantcontrol the situation into which he or she was born severus took another sip it took me better than fifteen years to realize that he confided and i still not likely to say it when many can hear it but being of the right kind of family has so little bearing on anything cesspools of inbreeding he commented softly and a general weakening of ability overall aislinn was watching him as though entranced perhaps she was i didnthave the right kind of family either he confessed quietly pureblood yes but hardly the nobility that the malfoys and crabbes of the world have cultivated he watched her face for any sign of malice but there was none a bit of curiosity perhaps but nothing more i ve never heard you speak of your past she said softly taking another sip of sherry he sighed i suppose there isntmuch i wish to remember september 2 and furthermore i expect even the most mentally challenged dunderhead in here to scrape at least an acceptable on the owl or you will have my crash severus stopped talking and scowled up at the ceiling through which the sounds of chairs scraping against stone floor could be heard as well as a general degree of panic and excitement he cleared has throat and tried to put hannah he refused to call her aislinn now that he knew who she was out of his mind hannah and her foolish clumsiness careless and he cleared his throat and picked up where he had left off my extreme displeasure for some of you rattle rattle bang he looked up at the ceiling again and sighed bloody hell but he hoped no one was getting killed up there for some of you this will be our last year together for many of you i would expect as i take only rattle crash bang crash creeeeeak shatter bang severus slammed his hand onto his desk and hissed at his students your instructions are on the boards do try not to blow anything up while i go check on miss ichalia he waved his wand at the board and the instructions to a fairly benign potion appeared and he stalked out of the room his robes billowing behind him up the stairs again and across the corridor around the corner he stalked until he had come to a halt in front of hannah classroom he didntbother to knock before he flung the door open letting it bang against the wall can you possibly make a little more noise he hissed through clenched teeth there are those of us who spend our class periods trying to teach having exhausted his biting comments severus took the opportunity to look around and regretted the remarks it was not as he had believed hannah who was making the noise but peeves gleefully throwing books and chairs across the room hannah stood directly in front of him her arms crossed and a sour look on her face as he floated through the room doing somersaults while clapping two erasers together leaving little clouds of chalk dust all over the room peeves severus snapped and the poltergeist stopped mid air upside down to look at him hello snivellus the ghost said with a grin with considerable effort severus ignored that that was what that blasted potter and his sidekick sirius had called him snivellus it was usually enough to set him seething but he was determined to keep his temper he folded his arms i am sure that the headmaster will be pleased to know that you have been disrupting classes he spoke softly and certainly the long standing agreement to allow you to remain here will be unaffected by such behaviour peeves drifted down slowly until he was eye level with severus which might have been mistaken for submission had the potion master not been savvy to his ploys thblblblblp peeves blew a loud wet raspberry and skittered off laughing and rattling the armor as he went by severus bent down and picked up the book peeves had dropped and handed it back to hannah that was the closest she would ever get to an apology from him threaten to report him to dumbledore severus advised turning on his heel and mean it with that he closed the door hard and stalked back to the dungeons muttering under his breath about the poltergeist by the end of the day severus had suffered through no fewer than three classes with gryffindor students and his mood was sour enough to curdle milk one hour until dinner time and then hopefully he could manage a few moments peace and quiet until his first detention of the year arrived a gryffindor no surprise there who had thought himself above the rules regarding the lighting of fires under cauldrons dinner time was always one of severus least favorite times of the day as the students always all seemed to be overly active and loud at the end of the day he had never dreamed that he would become one of the worst paid babysitters of all times with that happy though sustaining him he mounted the stairs and wound his way to the staff room hoping for a moment or two completely alone to his dismay or perhaps his enjoyment depending on which part of his brain one asked the staff room was not already empty hannah carlisle he could not bring himself to think of her as aislinn ichalia not now had draped herself over a wingback chair her head resting against one arm her feet dangling over the other her eyes closed severus shut the door softly and approached her slowly watching her it was an easy enough task for him legilimancy and he slipped into her mind partially out of idle curiosity and partially because she was there and he could memories flashed before his eyes disjointed and fleeting one ending abruptly and another cresting before the first had even died perhaps most disturbing were the pages and pages of text that seemed to be rolling in her mind which he could actually have read had they stayed still long enough for him to focus on any particular word he frowned slightly as she seemed to shuffle through book after book and then as suddenly as the thoughts had begun they stopped good afternoon to you too professor snape she said without even opening her eyes he was momentarily taken aback and had she opened her eyes at that point she might have noted that he d had the grace to look slightly abashed good afternoon miss carlisle he replied curtly moving to a vacant chair and seating himself opening his book onto his knee ichalia she corrected and he looked at her again her eyes were still closed your pardon he asked and this time she did open one eye through which she regarded him skeptically my name she said slowly enunciating each word is aislinn ichalia i have not been hannah carlisle for quite some time she closed her eye again well whatever you prefer to be called i must confess i have a difficult time with nicknames i he trailed off as she had reached behind herself her eyes closed again and he found his eyes following her hand to her handbag which she opened reached inside of and removed her wallet she tossed it in his general direction what this he asked open it she invited opening an eye again this time he noted that her eye was slightly clouded and he thought perhaps she had a headache again and was not simply being impolite take your pick she told him passport credit cards magic license look at any of the my name she emphasized slowly is aislinn ichalia she closed her eyes again and he thought momentarily that she was very trusting to leave her wallet in his hands with her eyes closed out of curiosity he did open it and sure to her word card after card in it said aislinn ichalia with her photo on them fine he sighed snapping the wallet shut and leaning forward to drop it on her stomach miss ichalia you may call me aislinn if you like aislinn then whatever your name is i donteven know how i bloody well got into this conversation he readjusted his book and went back to reading but he kept one eye on her she didntmove she didntopen her eyes she didntput her wallet back in her purse she didnteven bat away a fly when it landed on her nose after a moment he sighed are you feeling all right miss ca ichalia he amended hastily as her eye opened a crack it closed again when he corrected himself i have a headache she replied in the same tone with which she might have told him it was nearly dinner time severus was of the opinion that most people fished for sympathy when they did not feel well but there was no indication that hannah he still couldntthink of her as aislinn even if he did manage to make himself call her that was fishing for anything he had asked a question and she had supplied an answer he was quiet for a moment too but he couldnthelp watching her noticing that her brows seemed to be knitting tighter together with every passing moment i d have a headache too if i had all that text in my head he thought that little glimpse had provided him with a surprise he d always known that she was bright even when she was a student in fact he d often thought that had he not had the duty of teaching her he might have liked her in a way that was entirely proper for a teacher to like a student of course and she had been infuriating even then with an odd ability to quote the previous evening reading assignment with a distant look in her eyes as though she were reading from an unseen page perhaps he decided that was precisely what she was doing he closed his book there is still some of the potion i made the other day he commented sounding himself rather as though he were talking about something of no importance would you like a cup of tea he asked she opened both eyes this time and grimaced as though suddenly assaulted by a too bright light thank you she nodded and took a deep breath severus had the impression that she was steeling herself for something and as she swung her legs to the floor and stood he realized with alarm what it was he stood and took a few steps to her side clutching her elbow to steady her as she swayed alarmingly from side to side perhaps i didntmake myself clear miss car ichalia sit down and i will make you a cup of tea you wouldntknow how much potion to add and you d probably poison yourself this last was muttered mostly under his breath after he had already guided her back to her chair he spent a few moments gathering the cup and added two tea bags then poured hot water over it there was always hot water in the staff room as most of the staff liked a cup of tea whenever they could get it while the tea was steeping he opened a cupboard and pulled down a small bottle of clear liquid and added a few drops to the steaming tea the steam carried an aroma redolent of peppermint across the room and he half turned to ask her if she wanted sugar in the tea luckily this was one potion that was not affected one way or the other by the presence of other ingredients at least not once it was properly cured his words never made it out of his mouth though and he dropped the spoon he had been stirring the tea with and moved over to hannah placing a hand on her back miss carlisle he asked forgetting to address her as ichalia she was leaning forward her forehead resting on her knees in such a feat of flexibility that severus was afraid she had fainted she lifted her head though when he spoke and he noted that her eyes had become even more opaque and grey aislinn she rested her head on her knees again severus felt his lips twitch aislinn he repeated do you need to visit madame pomfrey he hoped that this was not going to become a pattern his ushering her to the hospital wing every time they met he hadntthe time for such nonsense i fine came her muffled reply but he noticed that she was clutching her ankles now and her knuckles were white from the effort are you sure he asked quietly she lifted her head again and he noted that her lower lip was trembling slightly if i went to the hospital wing every time i had a headache i d live there she told him pointedly and sank her head into her lap again he winced inwardly and uncharacteristically he squeezed her shoulder softly before returning to the tea would you like sugar he asked thank you no came the muffled reply lemon no thank you mint she lifted her head again and this time her eyelashes were damp nothing in it thank you she whispered he picked up the teacup and moved back to kneel in front of her before she could put her head in her lap again drink he commanded holding the cup to her lips and her fingers curled around the handle of the cup her hands were shaking though and he found himself wondering what kind of pain she must be in and what could cause such a headache if it was indeed only a headache she drank his hands steadying hers around the cup and then when she sat up straighter he placed the cup aside and dragged another chair so he could sit directly in front of her eye level how often do you have these headaches he asked quietly her woeful smile said all he needed to know most days she replied reaching for the cup again his hands followed hers and steadied the cup once again then perhaps i should make more of this potion he said softly or perhaps you should visit madame pomfrey no she leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms across her stomach watching him warily for a moment almost as though she was afraid he was going to somehow force her to the hospital wing hannah he began and grimaced as he realized he d done it again aislinn she corrected her voice firm my name is aislinn he nodded my apologies he said softly aislinn madame pomfrey is a he suddenly found himself staggering back as she swung her long legs up and over the arm of the chair wriggling away from him i am not going to madame pomfrey about a she was swaying alarmingly again and he stood reaching for her arm but she took a step back no she whispered donttouch me i fine if you ll excuse me and she was groping for the door handle and then stumbling into the corridor leaving severus to stare after her after a moment he stood shaking his head and picked up the half empty tea cup if you were going to frighten her off couldntyou at least have waited until she finished the tea he asked himself disgusted with his lack of tact it was obvious that she did not want to go to the hospital wing and who are you to tell a grown woman what to do he was still in the midst of scolding himself when the door opened again he looked over his shoulder and grimaced slightly at the look on minerva face severus do you know what was wrong with aislinn why yes minerva i do actually she was sitting here minding her own business and i had to go poking my what was it the marauders used to say my abnormally large nose into her business no the potions master knew just what to do for a headache and was intent on telling her in minute detail and forcing her to accept it whether she wanted it or not when it was reasonably clear that all she wanted to do was lie in that chair and not be interrupted so finally in a fit of pain and frustration she went barreling out of the room crying i think that pretty much covers it aloud he spoke barely above a whisper she had a headache october 28 the bell rang signaling the end of classes for the day and the doors to the dungeon burst open students spilling out like a wave of black giggling and chattering excitedly the last two weeks had been building towards a crescendo and now with halloween and the celebrations accompanying it lurking only three days away there was a sense of excitement that pervaded the corridors and left everyone feeling marginally dizzy aislinn was to her irritation not immune to the excitement and mounting sense of anticipation though she could honestly say that her reasons were a bit different from the students for the last two weeks she had been trying to find a moment to talk to severus but that man was not only greasy but he was slippery too as soon as she thought that she felt ashamed of herself but it was the truth on both accounts just because she had determined that she was going to be kinder to him didntmean she was suddenly no longer of the opinion that he could do with a good hair washing for the last two weeks he d managed to avoid her always being just far enough ahead of her that she couldntcatch him always excusing himself from the staff room just as she arrived never sitting idly in his office short of going to his private chambers to look for him an idea that did not appeal to her on any level she couldntsee how she was supposed to get him alone for five minutes to talk and that was all she wanted to do to talk to him well she might want to do a little more than talk though precisely what seemed to vary considerably according to how irritated she was with his evasive maneouvres sometimes she wanted to hug him and sometimes to slap him but it was a short private conversation that she wanted badly enough to keep pursuing him even after he d made it abundantly clear that he didntwant to talk to her she felt that she owed him an apology which was simply absurd as she kept reminding herself for the interpretation she d left with him she had let her pride carry her away with that one as soon as she d seen that moon she d known that he wasntgoing to appreciate having his soul laid bare but she had not been willing to pretend that he was right that she couldntfind anything worth noting she just wanted to talk to him she nearly missed him when he came bursting out of the dungeon in those black robes and with a stack of books in his arms he could almost have passed for one of the students to a casual observer very casual as it happened there was little doubt that he was twice the age of the oldest students if one looked at his face and even his robes didntlook anything like the students robes she took off after him severus she called lifting her voice above the din of the students he didnteven look over his shoulder at her severus she called again increasing her own pace but he was outdistancing her despite the fact that she was running professor snape she called again louder this time and breaking into a run this time he did look over his shoulder at her and she knew that he saw her he did not stop though and did not slow she sighed exasperated and set off at an outright run to try and catch up with him shoes with three inch heels however are not ideal for running on the uneven floors of the dungeons and a most unlady like curse escaped her mouth as she fell loudly enough that students stopped in their tracks to stare at her severus also stopped and turned looking on the verge of ignoring but apparently changed his mind go on his voice despite being barely above a whisper sliced through the students and sent them backing away from her except for one hufflepuff seventh year who was still inquiring as to whether or not she was injured severus came to a halt directly behind him i said go he said softly and the boy eyes widened but he nodded and stood when they were alone in the dungeon corridors snape knelt beside her and moved the edge of her robe to expose her ankles which one hurts he asked it was aislinn turn to feel a bit exposed which was utterly ridiculous as it was only her ankles the left she said softly and he took her foot in his hands then moved in front of her stretching her leg out and gingerly removing her shoe and frowning slightly at it he said nothing though as he placed the shoe aside and gasped her foot in one hand and her leg in the other and applied a slow gentle pressure extending the ankle she drew her breath in with a hiss and dug her fingernails into the floor to keep from whimpering he moved her foot one way and then another and finally let go i dontthink it broken he said decisively likely just sprained he edged closer to her taking her hand do you think you can stand if i help you he asked quietly and she nodded bracing her hand against his he stopped her from rising though perhaps you should take off the other shoe as well he suggested and she blushed faintly that she hadntthought of that of course she said with as much dignity as she could muster given the circumstances she slipped the strap off her ankle and edged the shoe from her foot and he took it from her placing it carefully beside the other shoe she struggled to stand and gain her balance trying not to depend too much on him he barely looked strong enough to hold up a small child let alone an adult his hand was surprisingly steadying though and as she took a hesitant step she was grateful for that as she could not put any pressure at all on her left foot he frowned a bit and looked at the stairs then shook his head it might be prudent miss ichalia to go to my office and i will go to the hospital wing and get some additional help she started to protest that she didntneed to go to the hospital wing and was perfectly capable of getting upstairs by herself but she thought better of it and nodded of course she conceded the last thing you need is to create more of a hassle for him good way to get his attention the process of limping across the dungeon to his office was a slow painstaking one taking much longer than it normally should have by the time they reached his office both were thoroughly exhausted and he left her standing near the door holding onto a shelf for support while he moved a chair over for her to sit in as soon as she was settled he breathed a sigh of relief perhaps he ll be even more relieved when you re out of his office entirely she thought bitterly he didntsay anything though as he moved another chair in front of her and waved his wand at the seat a soft cushion appeared and he placed her foot on it are you comfortable he asked and when she nodded he continued then i ll be back in a moment he turned away from her and was halfway out the door before he paused and looked over his shoulder again please he said silkily donttry to stand and he was gone professor snape severus looked over his shoulder and affixed a stern look on the hufflepuff who had been the last to leave the dungeon what is it mr hill he asked not slowing down the boy fell beside him looking uneasy yet determined is professor ichalia all right he asked worry edging his voice severus mouth tightened though mostly out of the knowledge that he could fall face first down the stairs and none of his students were likely to notice and those who did notice were likely to laugh they certainly wouldntbe asking if he was all right she ll be fine he replied tightly and increased his pace the quickening turned out to be unnecessary though as the boy slowed and veered away seemingly content with the answer he d received taking the steps two at a time severus swept to the hospital wing and burst in through the doors poppy looked up startled then finished what she was doing before coming to stand before him yes severus she asked as he came to a halt hannah has fallen again he said testily and at the look of confusion that crossed the nurse kindly face he closed his eyes with an air of long suffering patience aislinn he amended poppy eyes widened good heavens she said bustling to a cupboard is she badly injured severus shook his head a sprained ankle i believe but in a fair amount of pain well where is she he closed his eyes again wishing for the fifth time that hannah had had the sense to sprain her ankle somewhere more convenient and less requisite of an explanation the dungeon he replied opening his eyes just in time to see the flicker of surprise across poppy face where precisely severus scowled i shall be more than happy to show you he said but madame pomfrey was having none of it nonsense she said firmly you tell me where she is then go find someone to help carry her back upstairs now where is she after a few more feeble protests severus decided it wasntworth the effort to argue with her she in my office he replied and then turned on his heel to head to the staff room when he reached the staff room and opened the door three heads popped up to look at him dumbledore mcgonagall and jordan mickery the defense against the dark arts teacher snape spared a special glower for mickery out of principle so far he d yet to find anything to not like about the man except for the obvious fact that he had the job severus wanted for himself dumbledore cleared his throat softly are you joining us severus or just holding up the door severus forced his eyes away from mickery and put the man firmly from his mind hannah has fallen again he announced schooling his voice to a dispassionately informative tone she is in the dungeon and i hoped to find someone to help with the process of getting her upstairs again who mickery queried just as minerva asked is she hurt her sharp eyes softening a bit and yet holding him in a way that made him think she was somehow blaming him she hurt her ankle he said ignoring mickery who had looked to dumbledore for an explanation which was provided in a soft voice i dontthink it broken headmaster will you mickery stood and waved dumbledore down dontworry about it i ll help severus turned a displeased scowl to the man but at a warning look from dumbledore he turned sharply and stalked back towards the dungeons he reached the dungeons several steps ahead of mickery but he had only a few seconds with madame pomfrey and hannah before mickery appeared behind him just long enough to ask how is she she going to live i sure but likely not in those shoes again any time soon well severus said that isntnecessarily a bad thing ahem three sets of eyes swivled to hannah who was looking rather adorably indignant i am contrary to popular belief apparently still conscious and quite capable of answering questions about myself am i finished madame pomfrey she asked pointedly and severus mouth quirked into a tight lipped smile as poppy crossed her arms staring the younger woman down i think we will take her back to the hospital wing poppy said speaking over hannah head again much to severus amusement she doesntseem to have developed a scrap of sense since she was fifteen the abashed look that crossed hannah face met by a stern look from poppy said that there was something significant about that statement but severus didntknow what it was he also wasntinterested in revealing his ignorance to the matter so kept his mouth shut i suppose we should have brought a stretcher he commented looking about but that swaggering imbecile stepped forward waving severus away nonsense severus i ll be more than happy to carry her up myself he said with a smile that was too friendly for severus liking if miss ichalia does not object that is absurdly severus found himself hoping miss ichalia would object but she was smiling back at the defense against the dark arts professor thank you jordan she said and severus wondered if he was imagining the velvet caress her voice gave his name as mickery bent and slipped an arm under her knees his other behind her back and lifted her easily severus found another reason for unjustified hatred the only thing that soothed his irritation and only slightly was when he heard a soft question from the other man what happened when you were fifteen severus wait aislinn sighed frustrated wishing all these people would go away and leave her alone so she could accomplish what she d been trying to do when she tumbled over her own damn feet he paused and looked at her one eyebrow raised saying nothing and that silence spoke volumes she was afraid she took a deep breath and gestured for him to come over and somewhat to her surprise he did just that i d like a word she said pointedly and poppy suddenly stopped whatever it was she was doing fussing with a bandage it seemed to look at her jordan eyes were also on her as were dumbledore when had he and minerva arrived mcgonagall was looking sternly at snape yes he asked and she rolled her eyes alone she asserted and to her fury his mouth quirked into a slight sneer if you haventnoticed we are not precisely alone here if you want to say something severus she was sitting up now and that caused an uproar a scampering of activity as jordan suddenly remembered he had some pressing appointment and made his goodbyes though not without giving her hand another squeeze which was almost enough to make up for the fact that he was there to begin with she d be blind if she didntthink he was handsome poppy was insisting in no uncertain terms that no one was driving her from professor ichalia bedside until that ankle was properly wrapped and the patient was settled dumbledore had a hand on her shoulder and was whispering something that was lost on aislinn as she focused her attention on snape who appeared to be receiving the sharp edge of minerva tongue for some reason unbeknownst to aislinn enough aislinn blinked she didntthink she d ever heard severus raise his voice and it seemed to have surprised everyone else as well i will come back this evening miss ichalia and you may have as many words as you like in the mean time i think there are more than enough people here and i am going to reduce that number by one good afternoon there was an air of finality to what he had said and with no further ado he turned sharply on his heel and stalked out of the door leaving aislinn lying there blinking at his back silence and stillness permeated the room for a moment uncomfortable and palpable and then dumbledore cleared his throat well i canthelp but say that i am forced to agree with severus if there is no reason for my presence when no one rushed to invite him to stay he nodded then i bid you all a good afternoon he patted aislinn hand and smiled i will come check on you this evening he assured her if there is anything you need be sure to let me know and i will see to it and with considerably less drama but no less finality than snape he left the room as well leaving the three women alone well i must say that you know how to draw attention aislinn minerva commented dryly to which aislinn gave her no response save a level look what was all that about aislinn collapsed back against her pillows again and draped an arm over her eyes the beginnings of a headache whistling behind her left ear i dontknow what you re talking about she said obtusely had her eyes been open she likely would have seen minerva and poppy exchanging skeptical looks minerva patted her arm i ll go find your nightclothes she said abandoning the topic of the little outburst from a moment ago much to aislinn relief twenty minutes later aislinn was wearing amethyst silk pajamas and a rose colored dressing gown her swollen ankle propped on a pile of pillows at the foot of the bed the sounds of dinnertime drifted into the hospital wing but she ignored them much as she ignored the throbbing in her ankle and the hammering in her head she closed her eyes trying to imagine herself somewhere else somewhere more comfortable and less sterile merlin beard how she hated medical units she d almost succeeded in imagining herself in a garden when she heard the doors open and soft footfall on the stone floor probably severus she thought dismissively and tried to gather the courage to open her eyes and let the spear like light wedge into her brain are you asleep came a soft query in a voice that was too tender to belong to snape she opened her eyes and her mouth formed a small o as recognition seeped over her jordan she gasped struggling to sit up but he crossed over to her bed quickly and placed a hand on her shoulder donttry to sit he said softly glancing over his shoulder if madame pomfrey thinks i disturbing you she ll run me out and that provided she doesntwring my neck first aislinn smiled a bit and cast her eyes to the foot of her bed wishing she was dressed more appropriately i er she faltered as her eyes drifted back to jordan and his emerald gaze muddled her senses oh he said his grin widening a dimple appearing in his cheek i nearly forgot he held out his hand and a dozen white roses suddenly appeared which he offered her to brighten your bedside she laughed delightedly as though she d never seen anyone conjure flowers before in truth she d never seen anyone conjure flowers for her and she did love white roses thank you she said taking them and burying her face in the fragrant blossoms inhaling their perfume deeply they re beautiful she laid them gingerly on the bedside table her smile still broad and patted the mattress near her knees have a seat she asked and to her delight he did how your ankle he asked and she shrugged dismissively it hurts she replied a bit sheepishly but i ll live he smiled it a shame you injured yourself so near the dance he said in a tone that would have almost passed for casual but made her heart lurch anyway i was rather hoping i would be able to steal a dance or two sunday night aislinn smiled much more broadly than she really felt poppy says that if i stay off my foot i should be walking again by the feast and i dontsee much difference between walking and dancing do you he laughed and her heart melted in that case miss ichalia you had best work hard at staying off your feet i will be most disappointed if i donthave the pleasure of your company
