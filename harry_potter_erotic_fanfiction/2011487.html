 special note march 6 2006 this story is currently undergoing massive editing i have taken down most of its chapters to do this i will be putting them back up slowly but surely thank you to all reviewers and sorry to all those who were upset by my tearing down of the story i tried to e mail everyone who sent me a pm e mail or confused review but i dontthink i succeeded again i very sorry hopefully the story has improved however anyone who has read it before will probably not need to reread it the basic plot remains the same the prank war author notes this story takes place during seventh year for the trio and will contain spoilers it does use things from the fifth book but i for one am sad to see sirius go and am going to keep him alive there will probably be a bit of sexual suggestiveness in here as well as swearing but most of it going to be plain old fun several things are different from the books in this story in addition to sirius still being alive please do not ask me for an explanation as to how he escaped the department of mysteries an au fic where sirius is alive means at least in this case that sirius never died in my world other differences include that mcgonagall is younger only a year or two older than the marauders james potter sirius black remus lupin and peter pettigrew both harry and ron are prefects and voldemort is dead as are lucius malfoy and the majority of the death eaters i ll try and remember to stick a warning in an author note if i change anything else along the way nothing from hbp any revelations such as snape being a half blood and being evil etc will be used unless otherwise noted in author notes summary harry and the others are enjoying their last year of school by taking part in one of the most time honored traditions at hogwarts the seventh year prank war the war with voldemort may be over but the war with malfoy is just beginning and when malfoy plays a horrible joke on hermione the gryffindors swear revenge disclaimer i dontown what i dontown including but not limited to harry potter and its universe p s the story starts in late october just a few days before halloween prologue professor mcgonagall ended their lesson early and turned to face the gryffindors her expression stern i am well aware that it is time for seventh year prank war she said her voice cold a few people exchanged guilty glances or mischievous grins already having pranks in mind for years the staff and i have been trying to do away with such nonsense as a prank war between the houses but the whole thing amuses the headmaster greatly as such i have a few words of caution mcgonagall cantstop us so she lecturing us ron whispered to harry and hermione eagerly harry nodded to himself this seemed just the sort of thing the unconventional albus dumbledore would allow that would drive the teachers to the brink of insanity first of all pranks are punishable if they are against school rules damage school property and or especially if they are dangerous anyone initiating a dangerous prank will be subjected to far worse than detention am i clear several students nodded second i highly discourage this activity performing practical jokes will make you a much bigger target for receiving them and while dangerous or otherwise harmful pranks can land you in all sorts of trouble it doesntmean that you cantbe hurt if someone wishes to execute one at your expense so be careful she hesitated pinching the bridge of her nose beneath her glasses finally she sighed watch your back we are gryffindors and as such we are usually on the receiving end of slytherin pranks which are usually very nasty and quite frankly a reason to always be on your guard and hold your tongues slytherins can be quite vengeful hermione sighed and ron and harry winced draco malfoy was certainly going to use this as an excuse to do his best to torture them ravenclaws are not to be crossed either they are clever and can create frighteningly elaborate jokes that can leave you in a most uncomfortable position mcgonagall continued hufflepuffs too can be tricky they arentafraid to work for what they want they feel a strong sense of loyalty and justice and they have a determination that baffles many i remember people talking for years about amos diggory revenge on some slytherins and members of the bones family have caused havoc for hundreds of years and of course do not discount your fellow gryffindors it is rare that gryffindors act out of petty revenge but gryffindors are quite daring and some will do anything for a laugh yes mister weasley i talking about your brothers and dontsmirk mister potter i nearly strangled your father and his friends for a few of their actions when they were at school here and your mother was quite an annoyance herself head girl or not she looked at hermione as she said the last bit hermione fingered her head girl badge nervously when the bell rang the whole class was talking about their professor warning i wonder what your mum and dad did to mcgonagall harry ron mused as the three of them headed for the great hall i d die to know mcgonagall was a grade ahead of them and she came back to teach their seventh year i believe harry said or maybe she was two grades older i cantremember well we ll ask sirius next time we see him so what are we going to do to malfoy ron asked eagerly no idea just yet maybe we can contact lupin and sirius they ll have some ideas people say the marauders were just like fred and george maybe worse i ll write to fred and george too they might even send us some stuff from the joke shop at a discounted price you guys hermione said timidly maybe we should just leave malfoy alone the two stopped to stare at her in shock what roared ron we could get in trouble i could lose my head girl status and you both could lose your prefect status think what our parents would say how can you be chickening out this is the perfect excuse to really lay into malfoy harry said amazed the three entered the great hall for dinner and sat down arguing back and forth over their food and pumpkin juice they didnteven notice malfoy and his lackeys crabbe and goyle standing behind them until malfoy knocked over hermione goblet harry caught the cup before it could topple to the tablecloth oops malfoy snickered and stalked off that was lame harry said frowning snape was staring at him they re going to talk to him hermione told him but if that the only thing he can think of he not worth it you see he probably had something really nasty in mind but realized snape was watching ron argued hermione was about to reply when lavender brown sat down next to them and raised her goblet a toast she said cheerfully to the start of a beautiful war they all clinked glasses and drank even hermione who was scowling so lavender continued what are you going to do to the slytherins half the gryffindors and probably most of the rest of the school already have bets on you three getting malfoy and pansy parkinson everyone saying that between your little ongoing fight with the slytherins and your connections to the weasley twins you ll kick ass dontdisappoint us either i ve got ten galleons that you guys will have the best prank hermione started to roll her eyes and think up a good lecture about rules but suddenly she felt incredibly sleepy i think i ll go up to bed been staying up late studying for ages she couldntsuppress a yawn want us to come with you harry asked concerned hermione had been fine a few seconds ago no finish eating i fine hermione got up and left and ron and harry began discussing ideas for the prank war with lavender parvati patil dean thomas seamus finnigan neville longbottom and ginny weasley they were all so intent on their conversation that none of them noticed professor snape stumbling sleepily out of the great hall chapter nine why one should never give an owl canary creams after a few minutes of waiting for madam pomfrey to come back they heard voices in the hall and looked up hoping she d returned with dumbledore they received quite a shock when the weasley twins walked in instead fred george harry said surprised but pleased how ve you been hey guys george said all right you we re hanging in there ron muttered giving hermione a quick glance what just happened in the great hall guys fred asked eagerly everyone was all stunned silence or whispers or laughing slytherins neville told us you were up here um harry said trying to think fast why didntyou two answer my letter ron asked quickly changing the subject i was beginning to think something had happened to pig right about that fred said guiltily hermione looked from fred to george and back to fred forgetting the spell she asked what have you two done now harry and ron froze cringing george stared at hermione in disbelief and fred looked like it would have been less shocking to sneak up and hit him with a cinderblock before harry or ron could explain fred recovered from his surprise and grinned mischievously sure hermione he told her i d love to have sex with you of course i always figured you d prefer beds but if you d rather do it in the library well who am i to argue all the color drained from hermione face she looked over at harry in terror who nodded confirming her worst fears by turning to the twins and saying er guys malfoy cast a spell on her do you want to have sex in the library is all she can say damn fred said not the least bit embarrassed as opposed to hermione who was turning gryffindor scarlet knew i shouldnthave gotten my hopes up shut up fred ron snapped as george snickered anyway why didntyou write us back harry asked fred and george trying to head off an argument between the twins and ron and trying to take the focus off hermione who looked like she wanted to feed herself to a manticore oh well see we wanted to fred began we have lots of good ideas you see george said but when pig arrived we were trying to convince someone to taste a canary cream and the idiotic excuse for an owl swooped down and ate it george finished so harry said suspiciously well canary creams arentmeant for owls they re meant for humans fred explained it caused a few side effects george added carefully what the hell have you done to my owl ron shouted we didntdo anything george said in alarm he the one who ate it and as far as we can tell he fine shouldnthe have molted by now harry said worriedly if he was human he would have george said sadly but as he an owl he been in our shop ever since it happened fred said it been a real killer for business he enormous almost as tall as hagrid and you know how hyper he is why didntyou tell me ron demanded we had no way of sending you a letter did we fred said we ve been really busy and we gave our owl to mum since errol useless and the post office in diagon alley has been in shambles ever since that one death eater attack they still haventrebuilt it how long would it have taken you to apparate to hogsmeade and run up here ron asked angrily what could you have done it would have just upset you george said though no one bought his brotherly tone even if we thought it would have done any good to come tell you it not a good idea to leave the store too often when there a hyperactive canary the size of a baby whale in it why didntyou bring him back ron yelled what were we supposed to do ron teach him to apparate try shoving him in the fireplace to use the floo network we actually did try that one but it didntwork but now we re having a bigger fireplace installed next month just in case anyway we had to wait for the ministry to approve a portkey and that took a month ron demanded hey you try explaining to the department of magical transportation that you need a portkey to take a seven foot tall canary to hogwarts fred replied indignantly not very many people will automatically approve something like that you know they actually sent the department of magical law enforcement over to see if we were trying to obtain a portkey illegally george added mind you once they heard pig squawking at them all happily they called for reinforcements thinking it was a trap and we were trying to ambush them with a herd of hippogriffs we spent the night in a holding cell for that one you know fred said irritably we explained at the arraignment but they still wanted a full investigation and everything once they stopped laughing that is they couldntunderstand why we d have a giant bird and why we d want to take it to hogwarts so now we owe bill money for posting bail george continued with a sigh and we almost got in deep shit for violating the ban on experimental breeding they were sure that how we d done it plus we had to halt our inventing to figure out what to do fred said sulkily we thought about shrinking him but we were worried that eventually he d turn back into an owl and be too small to ever see again will you two ever go more than three minutes without being complete whack jobs hermione said to fred in exasperation just as ginny walked in um ginny said glancing from hermione to fred in confusion i not asking it a repeated phrase spell harry told her so far she asked me ron malfoy madam pomfrey and fred to have sex malfoy ginny exclaimed oh no it was really bad hermione moaned ginny blinked okay hermione you know i love you but there is nothing creepier than you looking at me and asking me to sleep with you in the library hermione cringed and harry patted her knee comfortingly anyway ginny said my friends said you guys brought hermione here they said it was something about malfoy but they didntreally want to say what hermione sighed pitifully harry leaned over to give her a quick hug dontworry hermione we ll get him for this harry told her yeah and now you have us for suggestions fred added and if worse comes to worse i hear hagrid got a giant canary we can sick on malfoy george said cheerfully ron glared at him so fred went on tell us all about hermione waking up naked next to snape hermione fumed silently throughout the search for her cure by the time she got it her anger with ron had reached the breaking point how could you tell them about that were the first words out of her mouth when she could finally say something other than the repeating phrase i wanted them to know how serious it was ron whined so you told them that hermione screamed at ron all the way back to gryffindor tower while harry and ginny tried to calm her down with fred and george following and laughing hysterically hermione finally stopped when they reached the portrait hole only because the rest of the school didntknow about malfoy first prank she was still plenty mad and stormed up to her dormitory ginny following to do damage control mental that one george said in reference to hermione this is all your fault ron snapped at fred hey how was i supposed to know that you dontwant her to know that i know what you know fred said reasonably what george said blankly first you turn my owl into a canary and then you piss off my girlfriend ron yelled ron it been a long day harry said wearily it was now almost midnight and they d spent the entire day in the hospital wing hermione will calm down okay she was just pissed off about accidentally hitting on malfoy in front of the entire school yeah i cantsee where she d be upset by that george deadpanned let just discuss ideas for the war harry continued hermione will be fine come morning the weasley twins had such incredible ideas that harry and ron eventually started taking notes one and a half rolls of parchment and two and a half hours later they had enough ideas to keep malfoy down for about three years the twins left around two in the morning and harry and ron went upstairs to sleep both of them anxious for the next day hermione did calm down by the morning as harry had predicted but parvati and lavender made a few rude comments about the library to hermione and she refused to go into the great hall for breakfast harry ron and ginny grabbed a bunch of food and headed out onto the grounds to discuss their news ideas from fred and george by the time they split up for classes harry ron and hermione to care of magical creatures and ginny to herbology they had decided to wait until sunday to pull their next prank on malfoy as the first quidditch match gryffindor versus slytherin was on saturday unfortunately the prank war had to be put on hold after the match as harry angry at crabbe for hitting ginny with a bludger had retaliated by grabbing a gryffindor beater bat and whacking a bludger straight into crabbe gut the force of the bludger knocked crabbe right off the end of his broom and onto malfoy whose nimbus 2001 wasntable to hold the extra weight the two of them went crashing to the ground some forty feet below and between the impact and the crushing of malfoy bones from crabbe landing on top of him malfoy got stuck in the hospital wing harry week of detention was well worth it the only real upset was that ginny had to share the hospital wing with malfoy and crabbe overnight but malfoy was still unconscious and crabbe was too stupid to engage in any verbal sparring matches it took malfoy six days to regain consciousness and three more weeks before he could be released when pomfrey finally let him go it was mid december before the gryffindors could get started again however the prank war was thrown for a major loop it was a friday and harry ron and hermione were on their way back from the hospital wing where they d all been having scales removed from their faces and arms when they noticed a large crowd in the entrance hall the three of them hurried forward it was something akin to when umbridge had fired trelawney or when fred and george had escaped hogwarts students had formed a large circle and in the center were two people harry ron and hermione couldntsee shouting at one another even as harry ron and hermione pushed through the throng of students for a better look the two people in the middle of the circle began yelling loud enough for them to hear over the whispers and laughter of the crowd you re so pathetic ginny shouted you re such a bitch dean thomas shouted back ron who was almost to the front of the students went very still then he surged forward with a bellow that could have scared a troll harry and hermione had both become rather used to this sort of thing over the past few years it had become even more of a problem as ron had gotten taller and stronger and harder to stop even as other students leaped out of ron way in shock and fear harry and hermione leaped at him hermione jumped on ron back and wrapped her legs around him slowing him down long enough for harry to get in front of him and hold him back dean was beyond startled at ron abrupt appearance well that wasntsurprising really few people werent startled when a six foot two muscular guy came running at them with a girl riding his back and another guy in front looking like he was trying to stop a freight train however dean recovered quickly seeing ron was stopped for the moment dean turned back to ginny with a scowl oh look he snarled big brother here to stick his huge ugly nose in where it doesntbelong you shut your mouth about my brother ginny said contemptuously why should i all he ever does is nose around him and the rest of your stupid brothers running around and snorting like bulls dean shot back dontstart in on my brothers ginny shouted you re the one who wouldntstand up to ron stop acting like ron ended our relationship news flash i didntdump you because ron overprotective i dumped you because you re a prick no you dumped me so you could go whore around with other guys dean roared harry dug in his heels as ron surged forward again slowly harry was inched forward towards dean and ginny but neither of them was paying attention to harry ron and hermione both had drawn their wands callistiaro ginny screamed montreavi dean yelled at the same time green light met blue and fused into a bright golden ball of energy it was a rare thing in a duel few cases had occurred throughout history a new spell was formed and it would become a battle of wills of wands not unlike harry battle with voldemort in his fourth year to see who would escape the spells effects and who would be hit by them dean caved first his arm buckled and he decided to cut his losses and run diving to the side in an attempt to get out of the path of the spell unfortunately harry ron and hermione had been right behind him the energy ball hit hermione with enough force to knock her off of ron and she went flying back into the crowd straight into draco malfoy who d been watching the fight with interest end notes this chapter is where i got the idea for my spin off fic which has the same title as this chapter well review if you d like to i working on getting everything back up guys sorry for the wait author notes i d like to apologize again for the excruciatingly long time between updates i d also like to remind everyone that nothing that happened in half blood prince is being used in this story no revelations about snape being an evil half blood no mention of what happened during the summer after fifth year and sirius is still alive for the purposes of this fic he did not die in order of the phoenix i would however like to point out that half blood prince characterization of hermione is more in tune with how i ve always seen hermione hermione didntchange in hbp it just that the darker less moral sides of her character werentas subtly written i ve written a huge rant about that on my livejournal the link to which is in my bio once again sorry for the wait and thanks to those of you who reviewed side note this story had been nominated for a reader choice award in the romance category on hogwarts the forum the link to which can be found through the profile of fatcatinahat it a wonderful site too by the way i recommend it anyway huge thanks to her chapter ten dumbledore assistance the smirk faded from malfoy face as hermione came flying at him hitting him hard in the stomach and knocking him down people scrambled over to them to check on either malfoy or hermione including harry ron and ginny mione are you okay ginny exclaimed as she rushed over harry and ron on her heels dean completely forgotten what is the meaning of this a cold voice shouted from the direction of the dungeon entrance it snape someone yelled run another person screamed the spectators scattered like pigeons avoiding a speeding car even the slytherins were quick to exit knowing that snape vendetta against malfoy had recently put slytherins in a less than favorable light in his eyes within seconds the only people left in the entrance hall were snape harry ron hermione ginny and malfoy hermione sat up on malfoy legs not that she cared and looked around rather dazed ouch she murmured her eyes narrowed and she looked around for dean but he had already fled the scene she struggled to her feet and was pulled back down again by a thin gold chain which was attached to her left wrist by a cuff like a slender manacle it was tight and less than half an inch thick and a similar cuff was fastened to malfoy right wrist oh no she breathed alarmed she pointed her wand at the chain finite reducto diffindo she yelled she harry ron ginny and draco all began shouting spells at the chain attempting to break it but to no avail step aside snape barked at harry ron and ginny let me see snape crouched down next to hermione who was kneeling on the floor next to a terrified malfoy snape picked up the chain and examined it closely then tapped it with his wand saying an incantation for a spell that would command it to reveal its secrets nothing happened this cantbe good ron said slowly gee weasel do you think malfoy snapped professor he stopped uncertain if snape would help him or not what do we do hermione asked snape fearfully dontworry miss granger snape said fighting the urge to laugh at the disgusted look that appeared on malfoy face we ll go see the headmaster dumbledore can fix this dumbledore can fix this hermione kept repeating as she followed her professor and her friends to dumbledore office hermione and malfoy were walking as far apart as possible roughly nine feet five for the chain two for her arm and two for his if i want to hear you repeat something i ll use a spell mudblood draco hissed no one else heard him including hermione who continued to chant the same line hermione it ll be okay ron said as they approached the gargoyle guarding the office entrance hermione seemed to snap out of a trance she lunged forward and grabbed the front of ron robes staring up at him with a wild look on her face draco stumbled from being jerked towards ron and had to take a second to steady himself what if dumbledore cant fix it hermione demanded breathlessly panicked what if he cantget it off what if i have to stay like this forever there no key ron there not even a keyhole what ll i do what ll i do i ll have to stay chained to draco forever how will i bathe how will i study how will i date or get married or apply for jobs or do the normal life things how will i help you save the world oh god what will i do ron who wasntvery good with emotion or with strange outbursts from the sanest of them all looked at harry for help harry however knew all too well that contrary to popular opinion dumbledore was human and there were some things even dumbledore couldntdo he was just as worried as hermione even if he hadntthought so far ahead about the horrible possibilities as harry wracked his brains for something comforting to say ginny stepped forward hermione she said seriously her face perfectly straight if we cantfigure out how to get the chain off then we ll just cut off malfoy arm okay hermione was so far beyond rational thinking by this point that ginny statement cheered her greatly instead of making her laugh of course we ll just cut off his arm and then i ll be free she thought in relief she smiled weakly released ron and stepped onto the spiral staircase only slightly less worried but definitely more hopeful harry ron hermione ginny draco and snape filed into the headmaster office sitting down in front of his desk in conjured armchairs dumbledore was seated behind his desk with a calm composed nature as if he didntnotice how unusual it was to see the six people together or he didntsee the chain dangling between hermione and draco might i ask what happened dumbledore said to snape calmly there was a duel from what i can tell snape said and miss granger and mr malfoy were hit by a combined curse did you happen to get a good look at the duelers dumbledore asked with a small smile no headmaster snape said trying not to smirk at draco furious expression which was worth letting dean thomas off the hook can you fix it professor draco asked impatiently knowing it would be fruitless to contradict snape no dumbledore said in an infuriatingly calm tone i afraid not albus snape growled in an angry exasperated tone the gryffindors all turned to look at him curiously but before anyone could ask what snape meant draco started yelling what do you mean you re afraid not draco burst out in a near hysterical tone you have to get it off you have to what happened to all that greatest wizard in the world crap i chained to granger here fix it there has to be something we can do hermione exclaimed even more worked up and on the verge of tears i will do what i can dumbledore assured her i will search for a solution it will take a lot of hard work but i sure we can eventually eventually ron exploded jumping up how long is eventually they cantstay like that what are they going to go to the bathroom together share a room he could kill her in her sleep shut up ron harry snarled everyone turned to look at him shocked excuse me ron growled how can you take malfoy side draco stared at harry wondering the same thing and then he saw the furtive glance harry gave hermione who looked suddenly horrified and scared of course harry wasntsticking up for draco he d just been trying to sooth hermione nerves which ron rant had expounded i not taking anyone side harry replied in exasperation i just trying to stay calm ron would have none of it calm how can you be calm when hermione chained to a death eater ron roared shut up draco was on his feet with his wand raised at ron before he knew what he was doing he was shaking his eyes wide with rage his face flushed he longed to use the cruciatus on ron to make him suffer blind fury was clouding his vision he couldntsee anything but weasley startled face couldnthear couldntthink he felt a hand on his shoulder squeezing comfortingly draco snape murmured draco it okay draco felt himself cooling down as though he was literally being submerged in ice water snape was standing beside him giving him an understanding look snape was there for him prank war or not snape understood snape knew what it was like even more than draco did i knew it ron spat at snape and draco you re both murdering scum the incantation for a vile curse was half formed on draco lips when snape suddenly lunged forward his arms outstretched to throttle ron ron yelped and leaped back away from snape who ran right into the thin gold chain and got tangled in it draco and hermione were yanked towards him the two of them landed on top of snape with a painful thud ron seized the opportunity to storm angrily from the office hermione are you okay harry asked dropping to his knees and helping her untangle herself i fine she groaned rubbing her arm professor snape pushed himself to his feet now that hermione was clear that horrible little he began menacingly starting for the door severus dumbledore said in a warning voice please sit down you three miss weasley if you could ginny was already on her way out the door i ll talk to him headmaster she called over her shoulder hermione sighed and watched her go as she harry draco and snape sat back down the last thing she needed right now was for ron to get pissed off and stop talking to her and harry as he was undoubtedly going to do he hadntunderstood why harry had told him to shut it and now that ron was angry it was going to be a long time before he listened to reason not that ron would want to spend a lot of time with her while his least favorite classmate if not least favorite person was tied to her wrist ginny will know what to say harry told her reaching over and taking her hand hermione smiled at him gratefully as she laced her fingers with his thank the gods for harry he was always there for her always trying to cheer her up as i was saying dumbledore said quietly the solution will most assuredly be found but it may take some time therefore we shall have to make a few arrangements such as draco said considerably calmer now that snape had tried to comfort him even if the professor was upset with him they were still on the same side and that had always meant a lot to draco your classes for one dumbledore said how long do you expect this to last hermione said in alarm i mean cantwe just be excused for a few days or something the look on her face made it clear that she wanted no such thing it was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that hermione would request to be let out of classes i do not know how long this predicament will endure dumbledore told her gently it is best to try to spend your time the way you would normally or as close to it as possible we shall rearrange your schedules to make certain you can make every class and allow you to still complete your respective prefect and head girl duties where will we sleep draco demanded how will we use the bathroom where will we eat for crying out loud i am afraid it would not be prudent to dine at the slytherin table dumbledore said so you will have to take your meals with the gryffindors that not fair draco said sulkily but he knew damned well that no slytherin would take kindly to having hermione in their midst hell there were very few slytherins who wouldnthex her for approaching the table especially now that the war had isolated slytherin so severely fair or not it is necessary dumbledore replied as for where you will sleep i suppose we shall have to remodel a guest room hogwarts has guest rooms harry repeated in surprise hogwarts has sixty seven guest rooms hermione said automatically then why didntbeauxbatons and durmstrang stay in the castle harry asked they never have traditionally hermione explained they were a tad too worried about sabotage and espionage regarding their champions for the tournament and as such remained out on the grounds hogwarts did the same at durmstrang or beauxbatons that part of why they dontjust floo or apparate into hogsmeade and just take a school carriage onto the grounds and why they dontbother with portkeys their travel vehicles double as accommodations when hogwarts is a visiting school we travel in you know granger you donthave to show off about everything draco interrupted rudely shut up malfoy miss granger mr malfoy please dumbledore interrupted there are guest rooms in gryffindor tower where harry interrupted across from the fireplace hidden behind that one tapestry of the gryffindor lion hermione told him every common room has them you want me to stay in gryffindor tower draco demanded shrilly you want him to stay in gryffindor tower harry repeated looking just as stricken you want him to stay in gryffindor tower hermione whined you want him to stay in gryffindor tower snape added trying to fight off a laugh indeed i do dumbledore said calmly there is no reason to put you in hufflepuff or ravenclaw and slytherin is out of the question given current events i do not think it wise to put you elsewhere in the castle either and most of those rooms do not have private baths anyway now has anyone seen the chain no i dontthink so harry said i couldntsee it until hermione got up and that was after everyone left then i think it best to keep it a secret if asked you shall tell everyone that you are being forced to spend time together as part of the punishment for let see what would be a good excuse ah i know an elaborate ongoing prank war dumbledore eyes twinkled as hermione and harry blushed and draco rolled his eyes snape smirked an invisibility spell on the chain should keep anyone from finding out severus would you do the honors scowling snape got up and tapped the chain with his wand it appeared to vanish but both hermione and draco could still feel the metal cuffs upon their wrists now then dumbledore said i afraid i have urgent business to attend to i d advise you both to walk and sit as close as you can so that no one becomes entangled in the chain miss granger i believe you can show mr malfoy your new room i ll have dobby redecorate it and move your things the password for the wall is friendship tell it to the portrait on your door also and then change it to one of your choosing friendship cantwe change it to love and bunnies draco muttered irritably why that an excellent idea mr malfoy dumbledore said smiling benignly i ll have it changed before you arrive he paused one more thing i do hope that you will use this opportunity to get past your current feelings for each other do make an effort no one in the room took that seriously probably not even dumbledore love and bunnies good one malfoy hermione said rudely as she and harry followed snape from the room draco a bit more reluctantly oh shut up granger draco snapped as they rode the spiral stairs downwards make me malfoy hermione retorted if you insist draco reached for his wand only to look up and find harry wand two inches away from the spot right between his eyes snape conveniently hadntnoticed and was now walking ahead down the hall not looking back glowering draco took his hand from his wand harry hermione draco and snape approached gryffindor tower and stopped outside the fat lady portrait you will be all right from here wontyou snape asked hermione i dontthink i could stand being around so many gryffindors at once yes i suppose we ll have to ah stop you know hermione said trying to find the right words to convey her message without coming right out and saying it yes of course temporarily snape said quickly good bye miss granger and i warning you draco you had better behave yourself snape swept off down the hall harry hermione and draco watched him go none of them very eager to enter the common room this wontlook too weird hermione muttered sarcastically to harry glancing at draco you two go straight to the room i ll tell everyone what happened or most of it anyway harry told her putting his arm around her and giving her shoulder a comforting squeeze dontorder me around potter draco snapped fine malfoy harry said rolling his eyes you stay in the common room and have a nice long conversation with all your favorite gryffindors how that draco glared at him but didntargue the three of them turned to the fat lady password she said giving draco a suspicious look odiamos serpientes hermione said what the hell what kind of password is that draco demanded one that a slytherin wouldntfigure out harry said coolly as the fat lady swung forward harry climbed through then hermione and finally draco the silence was more complete than it had been in the great hall during the repeated phrase spell fiasco no less than thirty people were sitting in the common room and every last one stared in open mouthed shock what draco said defiantly hermione swallowed and turned to harry is it too late to just cut off his arm she whispered end notes i dedicating this chapter and the whole story to freyja silverwillow who is not only one of my closest and coolest friends but also a damn good author i suggest that everyone go read her fics even if you dontlike the categories she writes in i can guarantee that you ll love her stories the prank war probably would have died off completely long ago if it hadntbeen for her most of my ideas in later chapters come from freyja and they re some of the better parts well thanks for reading y all hope you like this a note about relationships final reminder this will be a hg dm story will never be a hg ss story and will contain bits of hg ow and possibly hg hp chapter eleven love and bunnies draco glared around the common room his head held high a rebellious glare on his face what he demanded as all the gryffindors turned to stare no one answered and rolling his eyes he looked at the fireplace and then at the wall opposite it where a large banner of a gryffindor lion was hanging draco marched over to it ignoring everyone in the room the invisible chain around his wrist was jerked tight and pulled at hermione arm until she followed well he demanded as hermione came to a stop next to him the entire common room was still watching him it was starting to make him nervous well what hermione said tell it the password hermione grinned slyly i seem to have forgotten the password malfoy do you remember it dontplay games with me you filthy muh he stopped chairs scraped paper rustled and miscellaneous books and items slid off of laps and onto floors as every single gryffindor in the common room stood up black looks on their faces draco knew that hermione didnthave very many close friends in gryffindor but he also knew that if someone like him dared to say something mean to her in her own common room the gryffindors might as well be an army of crazed lovesick devoted fans saying it was a bad idea to cast slurs about ancestry in a common room full of muggle borns half bloods and blood traitors was like saying voldemort was just a little misguided as draco looked warily around the room harry stepped forward his wand half raised in an almost lazy fashion go ahead malfoy harry said quietly see how many people will back you up here he grinned his eyes gleaming dontplay games granger draco corrected himself irritably glaring at harry i not playing games she said calmly i just cantrecall oh i remember now how could i forget you picked it yourself her voice carried clearly through the silent common room love and bunnies harry cracked up along with the rest of the common room as the banner of the lion rolled up and the wall began to dissolve and open into a hallway much the way the brick wall behind the leaky cauldron became an archway leading to diagon alley i love you mione i really do harry called love you too harry dear hermione called back over her shoulder as she led the way through the entrance torches sprang to life up and down the hall which wasntvery long and only had three doors and one floor it looked like any other hallway in the castle though the side closest to the common room curved around the base of the tower directly in front of them was a door with a portrait of a young witch snoozing against the base of a tree excuse me hermione said to the witch in the painting as the wall behind them slid closed the witch jerked awake we re supposed to be staying in here i believe yes yes you must be the two kids but arentyou supposed to be chained together the woman said speaking very fast no dontexplain i dontreally care i was having a really good dream password love and bunnies hermione repeated while draco glared at her the headmaster said you d be looking to change it the witch said yes how about hmm prank war seems fitting enough hermione said thoughtfully draco rolled his eyes prank war it is the witch said and a loud click sounded and the door swung open slightly g night the witch said and promptly went back to sleep taking a deep breath hermione grabbed the door surely she could handle this malfoy wouldntbe able to prank her while chained to her as she could blame it all on him with ease and they were in gryffindor tower which meant she was relatively safe and it wasntlike she couldnttorment him thoroughly for this ooh the fun she pushed open the door and stepped inside draco following the room was done in mostly neutral earth tones and the occasional red or gold accent with two dressers and two desks against one wall against the other were two beds roughly three feet apart with nightstands next to each the far wall curved like the tower and was lined with a couch and four armchairs a small coffee table was right in front of the couch and between two armchairs was a door which presumably led to the bathroom between the dressers was a large closet where all of their things had been stacked including crookshanks carrying basket and draco owl cage it was one of the prettiest rooms she d ever seen what a dump draco said with a snort hermione looked straight at him what a dump she said looking him up and down pointedly draco glared at her angrily making a silent vow to kill dean thomas at the earliest available opportunity ginny sighed as she headed for the common room she d just wasted a good deal of her time trying to get ron to listen to reason and had only succeeded in having a huge shouting match and telling him to go bugger off before storming out of the room she paused as she neared the bottom of the boys dormitory staircase listening but all she heard was silence raising her eyebrows she picked up the pace how could i forget you picked it yourself hermione voice could be heard easily the entire common room must have been silent love and bunnies laughter sounded as ginny reached the common room and she could hear harry and hermione exchanging words she entered the room just as the wall slid shut she gave harry a confused glance which he returned with a weary smile before turning to address the gryffindors in the room i suppose you re all wondering what malfoy was doing in here well of course you are harry said as ginny jaw dropped malfoy here well dumbledore has unfortunately found out about a few of the pranks hermione and the evil slytherin git have been pulling so he went on for a while about letting the punishment fit the crime and then ordered them to remain in each other company until they ve learned to get along you re joking exclaimed seamus if only harry said with a sigh they have to stay in a guest room together and they have to attend classes together and everything else no word on how long it ll be either so malfoy has to join her for all of her classes and he ll be eating meals with us that just sick parvati patil said in disgust yeah whatever happened to punishments where only the person involved had to deal with it lavender brown said irritably the common room broke out into annoyed mutterings as ginny made her way over to harry raising her eyebrows at him he nodded at the wall and called love and bunnies ginny gave him a strange look before realizing it was a password with the wall opened up for them who came up with that ginny asked quietly so as not to be overheard malfoy believe it or not harry said with a mischievous grin they approached to door across from them and prodded the painting to wake the witch password love and bunnies sorry it been changed harry frowned it has um let see mudblood ginny guessed harry glanced at her in surprise what malfoy may have picked it no hmm maybe hermione picked it how about malfoy is an ass hole malfoy should jump in the lake er no one messes with a gryffindor slytherin sucks i hate malfoy hermione are you in there open the damn door ginny sighed damn i feel so bad about this and just when the prank war was getting good ooh the door had swung open revealing malfoy and hermione in the middle of a heated argument get out of my room potter draco snapped as soon as harry entered it my room too and harry and ginny can stay for as long as they want to put up with your stupid ugly face ooh good comeback granger are you five years old how long did it take you to think that one up about as long as it takes to cast the impediment jinx on your ass she pulled out her wand her eyes flashing go ahead and try i sure dumbledore would love to hear about it good luck explaining that you didntdo it when we re sharing a room forget you malfoy look if we re going to be trapped together and everything can we please just ignore each other and get through this without fighting oh like that ll work but you know what go ahead and ignore me i ll just watch and take notes notes on all the things you lot do like that will help you it not as if i have some sort of secret life where i break every rule rules about sleeping with teachers for example draco interrupted with a sly grin hermione laughed now was as good a time as any to break the news about snape after all it wasntlike she d be able to continue the charade while chained to draco i cantbelieve you actually bought that are you stupid or what ginny said cracking up what kind of idiot would really believe snape and hermione would do anything together we planned the whole thing just to freak you out harry said grinning it been pretty hysterical i must say even snape thought so you joined forces with snape draco said incredulously no hermione did if you want to get technical harry said shrugging who cares it been really funny watching you freak out wish we could have seen you vomit but dontworry snape via hermione described it in detail all we ve really been doing once we put up the silencing charms around his office is talk about the next major prank we re going to pull on you hermione added you expect me to believe that you said that did that it was all fake even the hickeys draco demanded what hickeys harry asked confused oh no hermione thought cringing in horror before forcing her expression back to one of smugness determined to play the hickeys off as part of the joke harry didntknow and neither did ron and with ron pissed at her and harry trying to support her despite how tough it was bound to be now was not the time to tell them it was all fake malfoy she began but malfoy wouldntbe deterred now he d caught the brief panic on her face and seized upon it the hickeys snape put on her malfoy said with a cold grin as harry eyes grew almost comically wide the same day pansy put you in the hospital wing oh did granger forget to tell you about that he lying hermione insisted am i draco said mildly gee did she ever tell you exactly what she said to him potter the bit about doing it on his desk did she tell you about coming out of his office with her shirt half off you re lying harry said uncertainly her whole neck was covered in hickeys potter her whole neck there no way hermione and snape would actually harry trailed off his brow wrinkling into a frown hermione had flinched as if as if she was remembering something horribly disgusting hermione harry demanded suddenly what you dontactually believe him do you hermione said but while her tone was convincing and her expression next to outraged she was blushing and her shoulders were hunched slightly a dead giveaway that she was lying hermione harry repeated in disbelief hermione and ginny the only ones who knew the whole story gave each other half panicked looks before glancing away but not before harry saw them you two really are keeping stuff from me arentyou harry demanded you actually let snape give you a hickey hermione harry multiple hickeys draco corrected him smugly oh what do you know hermione said contemptuously you really thought i was sleeping with snape how dumb could you be draco face flushed part of him didntbelieve it had all been a ruse surely snape wouldnthave done anything that intimate for show the man hadnttouched a human in years unless forms of violence counted but if draco said he didntbelieve she d been faking it and he was wrong the gryffindors would just laugh longer louder and harder donttry to change the subject granger draco sneered deciding to ponder this freakish revelation at a later date and focus on the important things in life like annoying and upsetting potter come on talk if you re all just playing games about snape then why did you enter his office without a mark on you and come out looking like you d been attacked by a toothless vampire yeah why did you hermione harry said angrily hey i know you re not trying to take malfoy side but you re getting close to it anyway hermione snapped who are you going to believe me or him gee i suddenly dontknow who to trust harry shot back harry everything i ever did in snape office was just to mess with malfoy you know that hermione exclaimed yeah and what all did you do exactly could we hold our private conversations some other time ginny cut in pointedly like you know when malfoy not here please hermione added softly giving harry a pathetic look and appealing to harry friendship and the protective side that all guys have when one inflates their ego enough while acting helpless and or scared it worked harry sighed and nodded fine but dontthink you re going to get out of telling me the real story eventually he growled she nodded i will just just not now oh come on i was just getting started for example potter did you know that she has pictures of herself partying with a bunch of muggles dated just last summer now you re pushing the credibility harry said with a snort pansy found them when she was returning hermione things to her room and showed them to us draco continued ignoring the interruption they were interesting you stole my photogra hermione began furiously before she could stop herself no we didn t but thanks for proving they exist he said nastily pansy made copies of them with a spell and brought them to show us but since they were copies they didntlast long i d told her not to take anything and she knew better than to go against me but the copies were so interesting i almost went back for them most of them dated last summer all of them completely motionless like muggle pictures hermione was with her parents last summer ginny interrupted quickly really because it looked like she was partying with random people on the beach and in a hotel room they were my muggle friends i hadntgotten to see them since the summer before fourth year of course i was hanging out with them hermione snapped and it not like i was doing anything wrong maybe you should let potter be the judge of that hermione glared at him this is ridiculous what i tell harry is my business not yours dontthink i dontknow what you re doing you re trying to get me to say something incriminating in front of you so you can run off and tell someone and i not going to fall for it actually i just wondering how much potter doesntknow about you did you show him your tattoo hermione rolled her eyes already prepared for this one that was a temporary tattoo in that picture malfoy it washed off in a few days really because it was still there when i dumped you in snape bed she froze you re lying she blurted out just a little too late whoa whoa hold up tattoo harry asked faintly i do not have a tattoo hermione insisted quickly yes you do you canthonestly expect harry and me to believe that hermione has a tattoo ginny said loudly draco cocked his head at her do you really not know about it weasel or are you trying to claim you dontfor potter sake hermione would tell me if she has a tattoo you re right harry said suddenly she would tell you ginny okay okay look hermione yelled in a panic this is getting us nowhere we re just going around in circles malfoy makes some outlandish claim and then it on her back draco cut in gleefully just above her ass it a dagger with a rose on the hilt and a stem wrapping around it off to one side down far enough below her waist that muggle clothes would cover it harry gave hermione a stern look is that true she sighed harry please not now please not now i having a terrible day and i just i just want to wind down and not think about malfoy and how bad these next few days are going to be and how much damage he could do i ll tell you i promise whatever you want to know just not now harry nodded his expression softening slightly hermione looked utterly exhausted and worried and upset he didntwant to add to her unhappiness not now besides he knew it was a bad idea to make hermione spill her guts in front of draco it okay he said grinning at her weakly i ll wait hermione gave him a relieved smile draco rolled his eyes you really are pathetic potter he sneered shut up malfoy harry snarled you know what you re harry hermione interrupted please let just try not to fight all right malfoy stuck here let just ignore him and he can ignore us fat chance granger and we ll go back to normal once this stupid spell over hermione finished i so sorry mione ginny said quietly i didntmean to hit you with hey it not your fault hermione said waving her hand dismissively yes it is draco said indignantly it hers and thomas s where is that bloody bastard i ll kick his oh shut up malfoy hermione snapped if anyone got a right to be angry it me excuse me i chained to a mudblood and rooming with gryffindors what next huh will i have to hang around with weasel too oh god ron hermione exclaimed having forgotten ron upsetting fight with harry during all the upsetting fights she d just had with draco ginny what happened with him er well that bad huh harry said with a sigh he planning on strangling about fifty people ginny said including malfoy harry and dean oh and snape and the guy who invented chains and me actually as i told him he was a huge prat who needed to go to madam pomfrey and have his head removed from his ass harry and hermione smiled and draco looked mildly impressed oh and then he said he was going to kill that guy who we get the point hermione said wearily all right so is he mad at me no ginny said not yet harry muttered bitterly he ll come around harry he always does hermione said soothingly aw isntthat sad everyone all worried about their friends not liking them ignore him hermione half yelled as both harry and ginny made to retort angrily we re not going to let malfoy get to us okay because if we do then we re going to snap and end up in detention or expelled or in azkaban or on the run with an escaped hippogriff like sirius and buckbeak what draco yelped sirius black set that hippogriff free no we set it free harry said grinning me and hermione then we gave it to sirius black where have you been malfoy harry please dontbait him hermione pleaded let pretend he invisible okay just an annoying overly talkative ghost come on let go to the library we can get some research done i not going to the library draco protested i staying here no you re coming to the library harry said grabbing hermione chained hand even if i have to drag you or march you there by wand point ginny added do the words bat bogey hex ring a bell draco flushed slightly remembering the curse she d put on him in umbridge office fine he snapped then gave them a cool smile that made them exchange nervous glances they left the room harry and hermione in the lead followed by draco and then ginny keeping her eyes trained on him carefully as the wall slid open to let them back into the common room full of gryffindors draco stopped in his tracks causing ginny to nearly run into him and hermione to nearly dislocate her shoulder conversations around the common room lulled and stopped at the sight of him and by the way granger draco said once he had everyone attention speaking loud enough for everyone to hear and grinning widely at them i still want to know how you got that tattoo on your ass chapter twelve in the library snape entered his private chamber and sat down in the nearest armchair his hands shaking what weasley had said had hit him hard he had been trying to put the death eaters behind him all that he d done all the people he d hurt and the death of lily his first real friend whom he d met back in diagon alley while shopping for his school supplies all those years ago part of him still wondered if there had been a way to save her if there had been anything he could have done the prank war had for him been a break from his past from the regrets and the bitter thoughts that plagued him and now not only was the prank war probably over but he d been forced to remember his past for the first time in a long time snape found himself wishing he had someone to talk to someone who would listen he ran through the small list of people he could count as friends but no one seemed right just now albus would listen and then offer some wisdom and snape had a feeling he might try to smack the headmaster if albus played the sympathetic wise man right now minerva was a possibility but snape wasntsure she was the right person to go to for a conversation about all the heinous crimes he d committed the only other person in the school who didntcurrently think he was an asshole was granger and even if he didntthink having a real heart to heart with her was laughable he d never be able to chat with her chained to draco malfoy if only wait snape was surprised it had never occurred to him before the one person alive he still liked who knew exactly what it was like to pretend that the death eater activities were anything more than sickening his one real friend that had been in almost the same situation as he had who was just as grief stricken and unhappy and bitter of course he muttered marching over to the fireplace and grabbing his box of floo powder if one person would listen would empathize would understand it would be her hermione froze her eyes wide with horror oh no she wailed silently god not here i ll never hear the end of this she forced herself to get it together and spun to face him angrily for the last time malfoy she snarled i dont have a tattoo yes you do granger donttry to deny it draco said smugly a rose with its stem twisted around a dagger i saw it with my own eyes gasps and whispers were breaking out all over the room you did no such thing hermione said shrilly yes i did he retorted gleefully come on granger at least tell me how long it been there or if nothing else why you chose to put it on your ass there is no tattoo on my ass hermione fairly screamed she drew her wand angrily at that point harry grabbed her arm again and began hauling her towards the portrait hole with a laughing draco being pushed after them by ginny they were forced to stop outside the portrait hole as draco was laughing too hard to continue walking and collapsed on the floor shaking hermione hands twitched into claws and she started towards him harry quickly holding her back he grabbed the chain pushing her gently ahead of him and dragging draco along for several feet until draco got enough control over his laughter to stand and walk with them oh that was priceless draco said fairly skipping down the corridors behind them absolutely priceless i feel so much better now ooh there are so many things i could do from here sleeping in the gryffindor common room tied to granger and now everyone knows about her tattoo damn it malfoy learn the value of intrapersonal communication if you re going to talk to yourself or at all do it in your head hermione snapped she looked completely livid as she stormed down the hall hurry up she added as draco just chuckled god i need the library i really really need the library going to have sex there are you draco said mischievously hermione whipped around to face him come on herm ignore him remember harry said soothingly malfoy is just an annoying fly an evil ugly annoying fly one day we will swat him one day soon when we re better able to hide the evidence hermione giggled and ginny laughed outright what would i do without you harry hermione said fondly lacing her fingers with harry and ignoring draco faked retching noises probably get into a lot less trouble harry said lightly as they continued towards the library and speaking of trouble he went on tomorrow saturday why dontwe go visit hagrid and see how he coming with pig what ll we do with malfoy hermione asked biting her lip shut him outside the door of course or feed him to pig we could always say it was an accident ginny piped up nah hagrid might get into trouble harry said sadly but last i heard pig was doing pretty well anyway he now just a seven foot tall owl hagrid trying to figure out if it safe to use a shrinking charm or not hagrid has a seven foot tall owl named pig draco said curiously completely forgetting that his company wasntexactly friendly they ignored him and he rolled his eyes the four of them finally reached the library where more whispers greeted them after all it wasntevery day that draco malfoy went wandering around with harry potter hermione granger and ginny weasley draco considered mentioning the tattoo again but didntwant to overuse and in doing so wear out his best form of entertainment so he decided to save it for a better time besides he didntwant to get kicked out of the library especially since it was really his only hope of getting granger off his arm unable to split up well draco and hermione werentable to and ginny and harry werentgoing to let hermione deal with draco on her own it took a rather long time to get a good selection of books hermione thought carefully about each book and read its summary while harry glanced at titles and picked them up if he thought they might be useful ginny managed to find a few things here and there but kept seeing things about interesting curses or other spells and adding those to her pile forgetting their mission for a moment they thought draco had a system as he was methodically selecting texts but then they realized that he was simply pulling every third book off the shelf they chose a table at the back of the library away from the majority of the students and the librarian desk and began sifting through books draco started humming still pleased with himself about calling hermione out in the common room but none of the gryffindors found his humming too annoying hermione was feeling much better with harry and ginny by her side harry was too concerned about hermione and ginny was too guilty about the duel to complain about draco every so often the three gryffindors would comment on something they read or say a paragraph aloud to see if the others thought it was helpful but they made little to no progress ooh chained to another no this is for some weird love spell un ojo del gato oh wait this is in spanish to destroy chains no wait it for non magic chains guys listen to this to make your enemy sexually attracted to rabbits ginny hun even if i wanted to use that now isntthe time to learn sorry still you gotta admit it would be funny let me see that book weasel sod off malfoy keep looking gin i know we ll find it hermione said the library never failed us before except over that gillyweed thing harry muttered but smiled innocently at hermione glare and quickly returned to the nearest book oh look this says um no coma las colas de la rata why do i get all the spanish ones have a french ginny said laying one of her books on top of his and an italian draco said absently adding another tome to harry pile and grabbing one of harry for himself draco was silent for a few moments as he looked through it hmm wait i think we have a winner man and woman bound by golden chains of love that cantbe right hey who slipped me the book on love potions god who writes this stuff i bet it some monk sitting all lonely in the cloister or whatever dreaming of the glory days before he took his vows harry chuckled then froze realizing he d just laughed at one of his worst enemy jokes oh god we ve got to look faster he said desperately pulling a large stack of books closer i tired draco whined i want to go to sleep so go ahead harry hermione and ginny said in unison each thinking how nice it would be to have him stay quiet i not sleeping here the smell is too creepy the library does not smell hermione exclaimed indignantly looking for all the world as though he d just horribly insulted her it does too it has that old book smell dust and knowledge and forgotten power that was almost poetic ginny said giving him a nervous look and edging her chair farther away from his draco rolled his eyes whatever weasel listen let just what are you four doing back here barked madam pince the librarian nothing all four answered truthfully which looked twice as suspicious donttry to pull a fast one on me madam pince said irritably all of you out what why we re just looking at books ginny protested right madam pince said casting a pointed look at draco and then harry she glanced down at the books and i suppose you ve a perfectly innocent reason to be looking up curses and love potions that one was an accident draco said firmly putting the love potions book in front of harry you heard me out and leave all these books here grumbling harry hermione ginny and draco got up and filed out of the library great hermione moaned now she wontlet us back in there together well we ll just have to check stuff out and look at it in the common room ginny said determinedly and if she wontlet us check out what we need we ll get other people to check it out for us neville done it for me before dontworry anyway i sure dumbledore will have a word with her soon hermione sighed i chained to malfoy ron pissed at us and now i ve been kicked out of the library could things get any dontsay that harry and ginny interrupted at the same time you ll jinx yourself ginny added besides draco said cheerfully you forgot now everyone knows about your tattoo shut up hermione snapped harry gave her a shrewd glance but didntsay anything about it come on let go back to the common room might as well get some sleep it been a long day and i ve got a lot of homework to do tomorrow draco wrinkled his nose not looking forward to sharing a room with granger let alone a room in gryffindor tower he d been avoiding thinking about it now there wasntmuch he could do but face it he d have to sometime though hopefully it would be over soon it was a saturday tomorrow so they wouldnthave to face classes any time soon surely it wouldntbe more than one night they got back to the common room to find it mostly empty the majority of the gryffindors were either out gossiping with their friends studying in the library or sleeping are you going to be all right hermione ginny asked worriedly as they stopped in front of the wall leading to the guest rooms hermione nodded trying to look braver than she felt i ll be fine gin yell if you need me ginny said and hermione gave her a rather forced smile as ginny reluctantly disappeared up the girls dormitory staircase harry however didntbudge hermione do you want me to stay with you he blurted out i mean so you wonthave to be alone hermione bit her lip not wanting to burden harry but not wanting to be alone asleep in the same room as draco she knew draco wasntstupid enough to curse her while she was tied to him but she didntwant to take that risk she d done plenty to upset him recently and she suddenly recalled the way he d looked at her outside snape office all those weeks ago staring down her shirt part of her was terrified of draco given his past but she knew that if dumbledore thought there was even a small chance of draco hurting her they wouldntbe sharing a room without supervision i dontmind harry continued softly watching her expression as she argued with herself hey i mind draco protested angrily one of you is bad enough harry and hermione ignored him um are you sure harry she asked tentatively harry nodded and grinned at her reassuringly i ll be right back i just need to get some stuff besides it not like i have a lot of people in my dorm i want to hang out with right now he added darkly hermione gave him a relieved smile knowing that he d much rather sleep in the same room as ron and dean than draco even under the circumstances hell he d probably prefer to sleep in the same room as an angry blast ended skrewt and yet he still wanted to support and protect her potter is not sleeping in my room draco snapped as harry ran up to his room yes he is hermione said calmly no he isn t hermione grinned scared malfoy scared of potter ha so there no problem then hermione said coolly there is too a problem where he gonna sleep anyway the couch in my bed probably hermione said rolling her eyes she and harry had slept in the same bed before at the end of fifth year when harry had come to grimmauld place he d been really upset believing sirius to be dead hermione had gone to his room to comfort him and she d ended up holding him for so long that they d fallen asleep together she d continued to sleep in his bed curled up with him for the rest of the summer neither saw it as anything more than a strange sort of extended hugging she still did it sometimes when he was upset and didntwant to be alone their friendship was too strong for them to see each other as anything more than friends draco however looked shocked hmm well at least i ll have something else to tease you about come morning hermione glared at him come on malfoy you really think anyone going to believe i slept with harry my boyfriend best friend well i d say most everyone believes you have a tattoo and that hard to believe too draco retorted he grinned at her come on granger tell me when you got it would you shut up about my tattoo she snarled ooh so you admit it do you finally i not admitting it i dontknow what you re talking about it there granger you know damned well i ve seen it right there he reached over and poked a spot just above her butt causing her to shriek and slap at him donttouch me admit it then you ve got a tattoo hermione harry had emerged from the boys dormitories in record time wearing his pajamas and carrying his book bag which was stuffed full of clothes and other overnight items you okay yes she said glaring at draco she sighed let just just get some sleep fine draco said cheerfully oh there just one tiny problem though what hermione said exasperated i have to go to the bathroom important you will miss something if you do not read the note below author notes until recently i was unaware that we arentallowed to post song lyrics into our fics and used some lyrics myself therefore i removed the lyrics this makes the story slightly less funny in places especially later on i hope to soon have all of my work up on another site that allows lyrics and when i do the link will be in my bio and an announcement will be in my author notes some chapters in the future will be so completely changed by the removal of the lyrics that i wontbe able to post more than half a chapter on this site but i ll put up warnings and a link to another site when that happens i apologize for this i d written those chapters before i realized i couldntuse lyrics chapter thirteen shut up malfoy this is really stupid you know shut up malfoy hurry up in there will you granger shut up malfoy the private bathroom draco and hermione were to share was rather large and the toilet was surrounded by walls like a public restroom stall so there hadntbeen much of a problem with using it the shower however had created quite an annoyance stop jerking my arm around shut up malfoy i have to wash my hair malfoy get over it why do you bother it looks like crap anyway ow potter shut up malfoy it had taken them ages to figure out how hermione and draco were going to shower or get dressed and undressed for that matter they had no idea how to take off their shirts and robes over the chain hermione who was usually so quick to find a solution had begun to panic and consequently was unable to think of anything harry however had remembered the spell ron had used to trim the lace off of his dress robes in their fourth year and had suggested something similar which calmed hermione down and sent her into research mode half an hour later they had a spell that could cut their shirts open allowing them to take off and put on their outfits and then all they had to do was repair their clothing later with a simple charm draco changed into his pajamas without a hitch but hermione insisted upon taking a shower before bed she knew from experience that her hair would be twice as unmanageable if she didntlet it at least partially air dry harry used threats both by words and wand to get draco to turn around so hermione could get undressed and hop in the shower hermione had been beyond nervous about showering with five feet separating her wrist from draco s so harry had been forced to stand inside the bathroom his wand aimed right between draco eyes while draco arm was yanked back and forth as hermione reached for various bottles and scrubbed herself clean draco annoyed angry and tired kept up a steady stream of comments harry occasionally accidentally hit or kicked draco for saying something especially rude draco spent most of the time glaring at harry who was watching him suspiciously making sure draco didnttry to peek or make any threatening moves it was getting really late not only had there been the clothing problem but they three of them had had scores of arguments you people are really paranoid you know that draco said irritably to harry hermione had been in the shower for over an hour the castle water supply was bewitched to make sure no one ran out of hot water and during the entire time harry had been watching him carefully gee i wonder why harry said rolling his eyes his arm was starting to cramp from holding his wand up for so long um herm are you almost done yeah she said and then proceeded to spend another twenty minutes in the shower at last she shut off the water but made no move to come out hermione harry called as the minutes stretched um could you hand me a towel harry come on out and get one yourself ow shut up malfoy harry grabbed a nearby towel and threw it over the shower curtain to hermione trying not to laugh at the resigned look on draco face as draco arm was yanked back and forth once again hey harry er how am i supposed to get dressed draco rolled his eyes it nothing i haventseen before granger he called smirking shut up malfoy it something you ll never see again harry growled and cast a summoning charm to get hermione nightgown underwear and wand and throw them over the shower curtain this is so embarrassing she moaned from inside the shower they could hear the ripping noise as she cast the charm to rip open the strap on her nightgown to get it on her head followed by a repair spell at last she pulled back the curtain her hair wrapped up in the towel nice nightgown draco said smirking hermione glared at him she wasntmuch of a clotheshorse and only had a few nightgowns this was the only one she had that was currently clean and while it was almost ankle length it also showed a bit of cleavage and was rather clingy although surely you ve got something better i mean i already know you re a fan of black lace ow draco rubbed the back of his head and shot an annoyed look at harry ready for bed harry asked wearily lowering his wand standing in a bathroom for nearly two hours while draco made wisecracks wasntexactly his idea of fun quite the opposite really he now had extra motivation to make sure he was never sent to hell hermione nodded reluctantly glancing at draco out of the corner of her eye and the three of them headed for the bedroom after a thirty minute fight over who got which bed they finally settled in to sleep harry lay on the edge of one bed glaring at draco while hermione curled up against harry chest falling almost instantly asleep dontyou two look cozy draco drawled lying on his stomach on the other bed and glaring back at harry you and granger do that a lot none of your business malfoy harry snapped he knew perfectly well that other people ron included thought his tendency to share a bed with hermione was odd but it had never meant anything to him it was no different than falling asleep while sitting on the couch together or something and he found her presence beyond comforting harry and hermione were above having a relationship they were too good of friends so that a yes then draco said smirking does the weasel know shut up malfoy who would have thought granger was such a little tramp behind the scenes she is not harry said hotly as far as he knew hermione had only had two boyfriends ron and krum and had never gone very far with either of them still there were plenty of rumors about her mostly due to slytherin animosity and reporters speculation about hermione being the ex girlfriend of not only quidditch star viktor krum but also the boy who lived both harry and ron had started becoming increasingly upset when overhearing rumors about her not only was she their closest friend but harry was sick of being asked about his relationship with her and ron was sick of people thinking his girlfriend was a whore sure she isn t draco snorted between you the weasel krum and snape i still cantbelieve you fell for that harry said with a snicker what an idiot say what you want potter but i know what i saw she came out of his office covered in hickeys and the little weasel saw it too how would you know what ginny saw harry retorted you saw her face when i mentioned it draco said she knows and the two of them kept it a secret from you whatever ferret boy shut it scar head make me dumb ass dontmake me make you shit head loser mudblood death eater draco felt his blood boil after the fight with ron he swore he would to keep his head when someone called him that but he couldntstop the rage that ignited within him draco grabbed for the chain and yanked on it hard pulling hermione forward and forcing harry to be pushed off the bed as well harry landed painfully on the floor hermione on top of him she awoke with a start and looked up confused while draco burst out laughing harry grabbed for the chain and jerked on it with all his might draco grabbed at his pillow and blankets uselessly in an attempt to stop his fall as harry pulled hermione out of the way draco landed next to them with a thud potter you little shit draco yelled punching harry hard in the arm harry responded with a jab to draco eye and the fistfight began hermione pleaded with them as she was jerked back and forth from draco punches and dodges the two boys were oblivious to her as they took out seven years of frustration on each other eventually as draco got harry in a headlock and harry used the opportunity to continuously ram his fist into draco gut hermione grabbed her wand petrificus totalus hermione yelled and draco legs and arms sprang to his side he toppled over face up at the foot of hermione bed thanks harry panted straightening up and glaring at draco prone form petrificus totalus hermione shouted again and harry found himself meeting the same fate as draco the two boys stared up at hermione as she loomed over them glowering at each in turn i ve had it with you two she yelled i need to sleep and i going to sleep and you two are going to get over yourselves until i get this stupid chain off let me assure you both right now that i know more curses than flitwick and mcgonagall combined and i wonthesitate to use them you two will behave do you understand me neither of them could move anything more than their eyes but harry jerked his up and down nodding as best he could she took that as an affirmative good night she said irritably grabbing draco feet and dragging him close enough to her bed for her to climb into it and lay down boys honestly she muttered before closing her eyes and falling back asleep usually the full body bind didntlast too long but hermione had overdone it in her anger it was almost daylight before either boy could move a muscle which gave them plenty of time to seethe and to realize that hermione could be way too scary when she was angry hermione awoke perfectly rested to find herself curled around harry once more he must have gotten back in the bed once the spell wore off draco however had fallen asleep after about two hours of petrifaction and was still slumped against her bed she nudged him with her foot she had to pee and she couldntdrag draco all the way to the bathroom draco started awake wondering who dared to touch him and looked up in confusion remembering the previous night he looked up hermione was sitting up kicking draco gently but insistently in the side struggling to lean over harry the chain was trapped beneath his arm at least she was pretty sure it was under his arm she couldntsee it which made matters more difficult stop it draco snapped drowsily go back to sleep i have to go to the bathroom use the bed draco told her too tired to do anything but lay down on the floor potter wontmind honest come on i canteven get out of bed without stepping on you she whined step on me and die fine i ll just lay here and sing in french do you know how to sing jingle bells in french sing with me now on marchent dans all right all right he moaned sitting up anything to shut you up thank you let me wake harry does potter really have to be there draco whined if i have to be awake i prefer him unconscious hermione ignored him and started to shake harry harry harry wake up harry groaned but didntwake up harry harry eyes opened a crack he looked up at her smiled and promptly pulled her to him then rolled over until he was on top of her harry hermione exclaimed potter draco yelled as the chain tugged his arm up and across harry back need more sleep harry murmured nuzzling his face into the pillow beside her head harry harry you have to wake up potter you have until i count to three before i avada kedavra you harry opened his eyes confused malfoy he asked sleepily looking up and back at draco go away i sleeping he muttered closing his eyes and laying back down still sprawled across hermione harry get up she said shrilly as draco struggled to reach his wand which was still under his pillow on the other bed harry sighed finally seeming to come back to earth what he groaned he sat up and nearly broke draco arm in the process draco was forced to dive over harry and he landed on the bed on the other side of harry and hermione damn you re still here harry said wearily giving him a strange look as draco landed on the bed causing the mattress to bounce slightly yeah well i not enjoying it either draco said angrily the door opened just then and ginny bounded into the room then stopped staring around in surprise harry was sitting on hermione draco was lying next to them and all three of them were giving her an annoyed look she grinned am i interrupting something she asked innocently ginny hermione wailed sorry couldntresist hey gin harry said tiredly climbing off of hermione how goes the rumor mill tell me in the bathroom hermione said interrupting ginny and nearly leaping off the bed ginny followed the three of them into the bathroom curiously this is one of the weirdest things you ve ever had to do you know she commented idly as she inspected the spacious bathroom yeah i never thought i d be taking malfoy to the toilet hermione said wearily as she emerged from the bathroom stall and went to wash her hands hey ginny harry asked as hermione walked back over to the stall to let draco use the toilet can you stay here while malfoy showers ginny stared at him what i dontwant to leave hermione alone with him but if you re here i can go use the main showers while he using this one then we can get down to breakfast faster harry explained that way she wonthave to wait while i shower too you dontmind do you hermione hermione shook her head sure harry ginny said and harry left gratefully draco sleepily stumbled into the shower and hermione and ginny sat outside the shower stall chatting idly there a lot of talk floating around ginny told her mostly about harry a few people saw him come in here in his pajamas with you and everyone seems to know that he and ron had a fight let me guess i broke up with ron and went out with harry yup then everyone speculating about what you did that dumbledore found out about some people say it was the quidditch goal post prank ginny raised her voice to make sure draco could hear her clearly and some say after i accidentally knocked you into him you two had a huge duel and dumbledore found out who won the duel hermione asked with a smile well the gryffindors think it was you and the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs will probably think the same thing but the slytherins will most likely insist it was malfoy yeah well who cares what they think exactly hermione shivered slightly in her nightgown hey ginny could you go get me something to wear she asked sure ginny said leaving and returning several minutes later with hermione best skirt and cutest sweater ginny i not wearing that hermione said nodding at the sweater as she changed into the bra underwear and skirt why not ginny demanded it looks so cute on you it shows more than my bra does i vote you wear it shut up malfoy both girls shouted at the shower curtain come on hermione why buy cute clothes if you re not going to wear them i dont buy them my mother buys them and then sneaks them into my luggage please no fine ginny said with a pout and returned to the bedroom she came back to the bathroom three times with fashionable sweaters none of which hermione would wear by the time ginny returned with a sweater hermione could agree to draco was already out of the shower dressed and in the process of styling his hair with gel harry arrived dressed and groomed as hermione and draco were in the process of brushing their teeth both of them fully clothed while ginny hovered behind hermione eyeing hermione bushy hair with longing come on hermione it would look so cute if we smoothed it down a bit groh hermione said through a mouth of toothpaste was that a yes ginny asked hopefully hermione spat in the sink no please let it go gin she looks fine harry said ignoring draco derisive snort but if i could just for heaven sakes gin i not a barbie hermione said exasperated what a barbie ginny asked blankly muggle doll draco said absently expecting his reflection in the bathroom mirror carefully the gryffindors turned to stare at him how do you know that harry demanded draco narrowed his eyes and scowled at him i took muggle studies my father made me that right i forgot you were in that class hermione said vaguely can we go down to breakfast now draco snapped marching out of the bathroom hermione had to throw her toothbrush back on the counter as she was half dragged away after feeding crookshanks and bundling up in cloaks and other winter gear the four of them set off for the great hall ignoring the whispers from students they passed walking once again with harry and hermione in front and ginny following draco draco had fallen into a sullen silence none of the others knew why but they didntexactly care you re getting really good at that hat making harry remarked as they headed downstairs hermione knit hats now looked almost store bought she was wearing one at the moment i just wish some of the elves had picked them up hermione said sadly having found out the previous year that not only had the house elves refused to touch them but they had refused to clean gryffindor tower well you made dobby really happy at any rate ginny said and the elves forgave you harry said you lot are really weird draco muttered not understanding their conversation wait dobby we used to have a house elf named dobby wonder whatever happened to him hmm bet father killed him your father killed your elves hermione demanded in shock occasionally he killed a lot of stuff draco said dully and moved around her to continue walking harry hermione and ginny exchanged glances but none of them said anything as they approached the entrance hall someone cleared their throat and said um ginny they all turned to see dean thomas staring at them sheepishly he backed away slowly as every last one of them drew their wands and glowered at him er i just wanted to apologize to you gin dean mumbled and to you hermione i just i lost my temper and then when i saw you go for your wand i panicked i know how good you are i i ll understand if you re still upset but i sorry guys i really am ginny bit her lip go on without me guys she told harry and hermione i ll catch up with you later excuse me draco spat as harry and hermione started walking forgetting the fact that he would rather die than fight on the side of harry hermione and ginny he added are you insane it four on one let kick his ass shut up malfoy harry hermione and ginny said in unison draco looked ready to attack dean himself but mcgonagall entered the hall just then and he thought better of it harry hermione and draco went into the great hall together and sat down at the gryffindor table draco casting a longing look at his fellow slytherins the other gryffindors ignored them entirely every gryffindor walking into the hall cast draco a poisonous look and sat down as far away from him possible just as they were tucking into breakfast someone plopped down next to hermione and they all looked up in surprise wood harry said what up oliver wood who d been teaching defense against the dark arts since the beginning of term after sustaining a major injury that had forced him to take a leave of absence from the puddlemere united quidditch team grinned at harry over hermione shoulder just thought i d come see how you were doing he said casually dumbledore told the staff what really happened you all right hermione hermione blushed and didntmeet oliver eye which didntescape the notice of harry or draco harry frowned oliver had joined the order of the phoenix in the summer before their fifth year and had hung around grimmauld place with them on many occasions harry had begun to notice something strange about oliver and hermione though he d never been able to put his finger on what and had been too distracted by the war to care very much however since oliver had become the dada teacher things had been very off between them hermione never lingered after class to talk to oliver like harry and ron did and when she came to quidditch practices she left early if oliver turned up to offer his expertise oliver had become closer to them all during the war and yet he and hermione so friendly with each other during the days at grimmauld place barely spoke anymore harry forced his features into a blank expression draco looked curious enough about why hermione seemed so uncomfortable as well as can be expected hermione told him you i good oliver said smiling at her warmly she gave him a more nervous sort of grin oh here these are your new schedules he said handing hermione and draco each a slip of paper dumbledore asked me to give them to you oh and hermione have you seen snape hermione head whipped up and she finally looked oliver in the eye what makes you think i ve seen snape she asked suspiciously nothing oliver said hastily it just well the twins might ve um sort of you know said something the last time i was in diagon alley he went on in a rush about you and snape forming an alliance told you about the prank i pulled on her didntthey draco said with a smug smile shut up malfoy harry and hermione yelled five points from slytherin oliver snapped for what draco retorted rudely you just admitted you pulled a prank oliver said coldly keep talking and you ll wish you d never heard of hogwarts draco returned to his breakfast irritably and oliver grinned i love being a teacher oliver said with relish really beats the hell out of being a student did the twins really tell you hermione said desperately how many people have they told not many oliver assured her just you know bill and charlie and lee and angelina alicia and katie hermione sighed heavily and um tonks oliver added and she moaned and put her head in her hands oliver patted her back soothingly then quickly stopped at harry shrewd look dontworry about it okay it not worth getting upset over anyway have you seen snape no one seen him since yesterday right after he took you to dumbledore office and he not answering whenever one of us knocks on his door mcgonagall broke into his room she what harry hermione and draco interrupted in surprise she well she good friends with snape except when it quidditch time and she knows him well enough to be able to guess most of his passwords so she went in there this morning and said it doesntlook like he slept in there last night poppy you know madam pomfrey i trying to get used to calling the teachers by their first names she said he was supposed to start brewing some more pepper up potion today hmm hermione said well i haventseen him since last night either i sure he ll turn up he in his forties for crying out loud he probably isntused to leaving a note if he goes and visits a friend for the weekend hermione this is snape we re talking about oliver said wryly he doesnthave friends and he hasntdisappeared for the weekend since before you know who died well i wouldntworry about it harry said he ll turn up or maybe he quit who knows he added hopefully oliver grinned one can wish he an absolute nightmare though he been a tad nicer recently really still a jerk just less consistently you know anyway i ve got to go i need to eat some breakfast and get straight up to my office i ve got a huge pile of papers to grade wait is there any news on a cure hermione asked for the chain thing no not yet we talked to a few witnesses so we know what curses combined but we re not sure what they combined into or how to counteract the effects minerva and i are especially working hard on it though oliver said we re both fully aware of how likely it is that one of you will kill the other but everyone in on it and flitwick is wracking his brains i sure we ll get it off soon oh have you guys heard the rumors that have been flying around like what harry asked that hermione dumped ron for you that she turned malfoy into a pumpkin during a duel in the great hall that she killed snape what hermione exclaimed well no one has seen him oliver said with a shrug and all anyone knows is that he showed up right after you two got hit by that curse and now he gone there all sorts of crazy gossip floating around and the entire student body has somehow found out about your tattoo hermione what harry roared draco chuckled an eager look on his face as he waited for the coming argument and the explanation as to just exactly how the defense against the dark arts professor knew about a tattoo on hermione ass everyone in the great hall turned to look at the group curiously hermione and oliver stared at each other in horror oliver blushing a bright red and hermione unbelievably pale harry eyes were wide with anger and disbelief he was glaring at the back of hermione head you didnttell him oliver asked hermione faintly shut up hermione hissed um well y you see oliver stammered he gulped and rubbed the back of his neck it s um it like this harry uh bye and with that oliver jumped up from the table and ran out of the hall without a backwards glance draco burst out into loud guffaws and hermione stared after oliver not daring to face harry and unable to believe that he d abandoned her to deal with the mess he d just caused pasting the best i m your best friend and you love and cherish me expression on her face that she could muster she slowly turned back around well harry snarled when at last she was facing him not only did you lie to me but you showed him your ass shh she hissed as whispers broke out all over the hall no i well okay i harry please don t bye deciding she might as well follow oliver example she jumped up from the table ran around to the other side where draco sat grabbed him by the back of the robes and started to haul him out of the hall as fast as humanly possible oh no you don t harry shouted and raced off after the mortified hermione and the laughing draco chapter fourteen the puffed up prat hermione get back here harry bellowed as hermione dragged draco out the front door and out onto the grounds harry please calm down hermione wailed dashing past a group of second years going for a stroll i am calm harry roared so loudly that the second years jumped and scattered as he approached i can explain hermione yelled though she seemed to have no intention of doing just that as she was running as fast as possible away from harry you had better harry shouted stomping after her hermione granger stop walking right now hermione who had accidentally run straight for the lake and could go no farther without introducing herself to the giant squid finally stopped and turned to face him giving draco the opportunity to collapse on the ground and shake with laughter harry stopped about three feet from her close enough to grab her if she tried to run again which wasntlikely with draco on the ground and in no state to stand let alone run hermione harry said coldly you ve always kept secrets from me and ron at first i wasnttoo worried we ve all got our secrets but this is getting old the time turner lupin being a werewolf rita skeeter now it snape and tattoos and oliver bloody wood the gods only know what else you ve kept from me but i swear hermione you had better tell me what the hell is going on right now hermione hung her head i i really sorry harry i you re right i shouldntkeep secrets from my best friends but well it embarrassing really this tattoo and i didntreally think it was a big deal i got it last summer okay since when are you the type to get a tattoo harry demanded incredulously i not it just harry did you know i have friends what are you talking about i am your friend no other friends friends from before hogwarts in the muggle world a whole group of them but we didntget to spend very much time together once i started going to school or even talk much it not easy to find ways to send letters to muggles via owl without them getting suspicious but well the point is this summer when it was finally safe to go back to my own house and be with my parents and my friends i went out with my friends and they ve grown up harry they re not eleven anymore like they were when i left the last time i saw them except for this past summer was before fourth year how does this lead to a tattoo well we talked a lot about being friends forever you know about how no matter how far apart we were we d always be friends and and we were partying a bit nothing major a few drinks some music but one of my friends suggested we should do something to show that we were friends we talked about t shirts but someone else said we should do something really permanent and they wanted to do a blood brothers sort of thing where you prick your finger and mix your blood with your friends harry asked yeah horrible idea really what with all the muggle diseases but with me being a witch there magic in my blood so i couldntdo it anyway without breaking about six laws and then someone got the idea for tattoos and you said yes harry demanded incredulously i well harry things were different that summer i d just saved the world i was so euphoric and proud and yet things were so off i kept thinking about how i d move on to this future in the wizarding world and leave the muggle world behind and there i was surrounded by that world and all the people i d grown up with i wanted a sign that it was a part of me i wanted a sign that for heaven sake shut up malfoy go on harry urged get to the part about wood everyone thought it was a good idea and i gave in we all got matching tattoos we wanted something strong and beautiful and hey rose dagger it just worked i dontknow how it happened i was mortified afterwards absolutely mortified and i swore i d never tell anyone but ginny found out when i came back to grimmauld place for your birthday because we were sharing a room for the rest of the summer and everything and and that what happened i sorry i didnttell you it just i sorry okay harry said taking a deep breath and trying to rein in some of his anger attempting to calm down now that she was being honest with him let move on when exactly did oliver see it um hermione looked even more reluctant to answer this and even cast a glance behind her wondering if meeting the giant squid would be so bad after all well do you um well do you remember the quidditch world cup the summer before our fourth year my you get awfully busy during the summers draco choked out shut your mouth harry screamed his barely controlled temper bursting free draco started to reply and then suddenly his mouth clamped shut and his lips exploded outward what on earth hermione said staring down at his lips which were so big they wouldnthave been out of place on grawp draco made a strangled startled noise in his throat and then his nose burst out over his lips as though both nose and mouth had been magnified quickly followed by his ears eyes and slowly the rest of his head mmph draco screamed as his head now almost as big as the rest of his body began to rise off the ground harry and hermione stared in horror draco started flailing his arms and legs his body rising to follow his head within a few seconds draco was completely airborne drifting away on the light winter breeze back towards the castle and as he lifted higher so did hermione arm oh no harry whispered flashing back to the day he d blown up his aunt marge knowing he was going to get in deep trouble for this harry hermione yelled snapping him back to the present draco was starting to lift her off her feet like a large helium balloon preparing for the inevitable hermione jumped up and grabbed draco legs clinging tightly so she wouldntbe dragged through the air by her wrist this seemed to slow draco down but only slightly he was still rising higher and higher hermione harry exclaimed and made a running leap grabbing her around the knees he d hoped it would bring draco back down but harry and hermione simply werentheavy enough potter draco screamed finally able to speak again but his voiced was as enlarged as his head what the hell did you do lean towards the castle hermione shouted we ll climb in a window dontworry i think i know how to deflate him harry called knowing nothing of the sort but determined to try before they floated off into the wild blue yonder or over the wild blue ocean he wasntchained to draco hermione would dangle but harry would die no hermione yelled we re too high we ll fall and dontget your wand out you might drop it harry groaned knowing she was right but not liking it anyway they were now thirty feet above the ground which was too risky to jump injuries he could handle but if he landed wrong like say on his neck he could end up with some incurable problem or worse dead and there would be nothing madam pomfrey or st mungo for that matter could do besides he couldntjust leave hermione to fly off into the sunset with draco and that chain made it impossible for them to rid themselves of him without also riding themselves of hermione which was a real shame in harry opinion gargoyle gargoyle draco shouted as they approached a nearby tower aaaaahhhhh swing to the left harry did his best to throw himself to the left without letting go and they inched past the sharp stone wings of a gargoyle narrowly avoiding it there lean that way hermione shouted where harry demanded as neither he nor draco could see her point harry could only see up her skirt and draco was having trouble moving his enormous head there that open window harry began to swing back and forth trying to sway their strange little group to the window above them so that he could hook his legs on something and anchor them and then inside the room pacing around in front of the window he saw one of the four people responsible for this whole mess oliver wood harry didntcare what secrets oliver was keeping and how they concerned hermione and just what oliver had done with her during the summer of the quidditch world cup and how he d seen the tattoo she d gotten this past summer all he cared about was getting down wood help oh no not oliver hermione moaned quietly above him oliver looked around in confusion before spotting draco inflated head outside the window which slowly floating past higher and higher but getting closer hermione clinging to draco legs with her eyes tightly shut and finally one arm firmly around hermione knees and the other reaching for the window was harry oliver dived for the window missing harry hand but grabbing harry leg and yanking oliver braced one foot then the other against the wall beneath the window ledge pulling with all his might fighting the hot air balloon force of draco head what the hell is going on oliver demanded as he tugged harry legs into the window harry was finally drawn inside enough for oliver to seize his waist pulling even harder while harry tried to haul hermione closer i ll explain later harry grunted straining with the effort of holding on oliver pulled harry inside far enough that his feet touched down grab hermione and hold her so i can turn around and get a better grip harry told oliver oliver reached out and grabbed hermione foot i got her harry let go of hermione legs and turned around reaching for her again but before he could grab her hermione shoe came off in oliver hand freeing her completely from his grip and causing something of a rubber band effect hermione oliver yelled as he landed hard on his back still clutching her shoe harry made a wiled grab for her but missed nearly falling to his death out the window hermione screamed as she and draco shot upwards like a rock fired from a slingshot aaaahhhh draco yelped too busy trying to get his hands up to push them away from a tower they were zooming straight for to let out a proper yell oliver damn him hermione wailed i knew as soon as he became a teacher here shut up granger i so do not care draco yelled as his head scraped the tower i canthold on much longer hermione whined wishing she had just cut off his arm at the beginning of this whole mess then harry would never have found out about her accidental tattoo and ron wouldntbe angry and oliver never would have let slip that he d seen her tattoo god if she didntfly off to her death while clinging to draco legs she was going to be in so much trouble suddenly hermione felt something wrap around her ankle and she shuddered to a halt so abruptly that she nearly let go of draco legs looking down she saw a thick rope of blue light tied securely around her ankle and leading back down to the window of the defense against the dark arts office about forty feet below she could just make out the forms of oliver and harry both pulling hard on the magical line from inside oliver office i take back the rude things i just said about oliver hermione breathed in relief thanking every god she d ever heard of for oliver wood knowing that the spell anchoring her was too advanced for harry to know he wonderful he awesome he s i still dontcare granger draco said wearily relaxing slightly and trying to calm down now that they were about to be rescued inside the office harry and oliver were pulling the conjured rope back inside the classroom slowly foot by foot which was by no means easy hermione and draco when combined werentexactly light and between the wind and draco head determination to see the world from a bird eye view tugging them back to the window was made even harder just a thought harry grunted but i don t think malfoy s gonna fit through the window we ll handle that when hermione s safe oliver panted harry take the end and tie it to something heavy oliver took over the pulling on the rope straining a bit more but holding his own having always been well built harry grabbed the end of the magical rope from which oliver wand was dangling and looked around for something weighty enough to anchor hermione and draco while harry and oliver tugged them all the way inside hurry harry oliver said i think his head getting bigger harry eyes finally rested on oliver large mahogany desk and he dashed forward and began tying the rope to one of the legs as fast as he could without damaging oliver wand okay it tied harry called and headed back to help oliver and promptly tripped over the blue light rope smacked into oliver and sent them both flying to the side hermione felt a slight jolt but didnthave time to wonder about it before she shot up into the air again she could hear two shocked yells a loud crash of breaking glass and an anguished cry of my desk from below a strong yank on her leg nearly pulled her off of draco and she found herself falling at an alarming rate she closed her eyes certain that this was the end that somehow draco head had deflated and they were going to go crashing back to the ground then they were flying upward again as though they d bounced off some invisible surface and only when they bumped gently to a stop did hermione open her eyes and glance around they were hovering in the air some twenty feet away from the wall where oliver window was and below them fifty or so feet down half sunk into the ground was a large wooden desk which she assumed was oliver s hermione harry bellowed from the window you okay oh i just fine harry hermione yelled i just grand hold on hermione harry shouted gee do you think potter draco screamed his voice echoing around the grounds i coming mione shouted a new voice and hermione looked around in bewilderment zooming towards them on a broomstick was ron a determined look on his face ron she called happily draco groaned ron stopped his cleansweep next to her hovering in midair and giving her a lopsided grin i leave you alone for two seconds and look what happens he said shaking his head you dontknow how happy i am to see you hermione cried on the verge of bursting into tears in relief she wanted to throw her arms around him but knew letting go of draco would land her in a world of pain ron looked at her her head in between draco knees clinging tightly to draco a thick blue cord of light wrapped around her ankle her hair was even bushier than usual windblown as it was and the look on her face could only be described as pitiful ron actually had an urge to go aw he looked up at draco who was doing his best to look down but found this rather difficult due to the buoyancy and size of his head climb on ron said maneuvering the broom beneath her and letting her drop down onto it she released draco legs then quickly grabbed hold of his ankle letting him go put a strain on her wrist and had caused draco body to tip and float sideways oh thank you hermione said breathlessly leaning back against him ron put his arm around her waist and she laced her fingers with his her other hand holding tightly to draco ron pointed the broom at the ground and down they went hermione with her eyes tightly shut she wasnta big fan of flying and had already had more than enough of it for one day by the way malfoy ron called that a nice look now your head matches your ego both bigger than they should be hermione giggled feeling pretty close to happy she had ron the crisis was averted and in some strange roundabout way she secretly thought the accident with oliver desk and window served him right for letting slip that he d seen her tattoo they reached the ground but were at a loss as to what to do not even hermione knew how to literally deflate someone head and they couldntjust walk into the castle the broom power and the anchoring weight of the desk were all that kept them from floating off still they couldntfly far while trailing a huge desk what now ron asked hmm hermione said thoughtfully giving the desk an appraising look hermione pulled out her wand madam pomfrey was having a nice normal patient free day she hadnthad to treat any students for anything injury or prank war related since the scales she d removed from harry ron and hermione and she was enjoying her most peaceful weekend since the year started she was sitting in her office her feet propped up on her desk mug of soothing chamomile tea in one hand and an old issue of witch weekly in the other when she heard the voice of her most frequent patient i am so so so sorry hermione the groan that left madam pomfrey lips could have come from a dying animal rather than an exasperated nurse wearily putting down her tea and magazine she stood and turned to see just what horrible fate had befallen harry potter now and gaped at the sight before her ron weasley and hermione granger were climbing off of a cleansweep nine just inside the door hermione looking bedraggled and ron looking rather amused standing apologetically next to hermione was harry who looked like he felt horribly guilt about something oliver wood was standing near the doorway looking torn between running he kept shooting worried glances at harry for some reason comforting hermione and checking the condition of a large mahogany desk which was covered in grass mud and broken glass tied to hermione ankle by a pavorian spell and blocking the bottom half of the door blocking the top half of the door was an abnormally large head which couldntseem to get through the door all madam pomfrey could really see of it was a lot of blond hair but it didnttake long to figure out just who the head belong to as the owner right arm was stretched towards hermione left no doubt connected by an invisible chain that it i ve had it madam pomfrey said irritably if you lot dontgraduate on time i quit end notes readers who ve been with this story from way back when will notice a few major changes in the tattoo and oliver tales i wanted them to seem more plausible and i doing my best to get them that way i hope it still as funny as it was back then chapter fifteen return of the weasley twins hermione enjoyed the rest of the afternoon immensely harry felt horrible about putting her through the whole ordeal not only did he refrain from asking a single thing about oliver the tattoo or snape which was due to both guilt and ron presence but he kept doing little things for her and being a complete sweetheart ron was also being extra nice partially because he d just patched up his friendship with harry and partially because he was feeling a tad guilty himself mostly for letting her deal with malfoy on her own oliver stayed only shortly acting awkward for the most part before at hermione assurance that she was fine rushing off to deal with the desk coolest of all however was that after removing half the wall to get him into the room and then repairing the wall with very cool magic all around malfoy had been tied to a hospital cot and ordered not to speak while madam pomfrey tried to find a cure if he d blown up all of you this would be a snap madam pomfrey said wearily but i not quite sure how to deflate just the head the antidote would shrink all of you not just your head hmm harry ron and hermione looked at each other and burst out laughing all of them thinking of a mini draco with a normal sized head draco glowered but didntspeak not wanting to interrupt madam pomfrey search for a cure madam pomfrey finally found the cure shortly before dinner she came out of her office held up a large thick book on wizarding medicine and exclaimed triumphantly all we have to do is cover his head in the antidote potion and sprinkle on some cinnamon what draco yelped so in addition to her friends attitudes and draco being ordered to be quiet hermione got to watch him seethe while his entire head was covered in a bright pink potion oliver walked wearily back towards his office his muddy beaten up once beautiful desk floating along behind him he had loved that desk a lot and now it was going to need a heck of a lot to restore it as if the desk wasntenough he also had to deal with the fact that once harry guilt wore off harry would certainly want to know just how oliver knew about that tattoo and it didnttake a genius to realize that neither harry nor ron would be too happy with the details oliver really didntwant to upset harry he owed harry a lot if harry had never won the quidditch cup for gryffindor oliver team never would have gotten any recognition in the professional quidditch world and getting onto puddlemere would have been that much harder besides which he counted harry as a friend harry ron and hermione really even though hermione had been really awkward around him ever since he d started teaching he d been looking forward to seeing hermione again and had been thoroughly disappointed that about her dating ron but had done his best to get over it now if harry and ron found out just what oliver and hermione had done in the past chances were harry and ron were going to have major issues and oliver didntwant that for him or for hermione he was so lost in thought that it took him a second to realize someone was talking to him two someones actually fred and george weasley oliver what are you doing fred asked looking from oliver to the floating desk curiously oh nothing oliver said quickly what are you guys doing here heard about all the interesting stuff going on george said promptly well technically we thought we would come check on pig and get a free breakfast fred admitted but then we ran into ron down by hagrid hut and he told us all about what been going on fred continued you know the prank war snape hermione malfoy and now this chain thing he told you everything even about the tattoo oliver exclaimed his jaw dropping what tattoo george said frowning i dontrecall anything about a tattoo do you fred fred shook his head and the twins turned to look at oliver expectantly heh oliver said gulping he wanted to kick himself of course ron wouldnthave mentioned the tattoo ron didnteven know about it well darn i i dontknow what they were talking about either i was hoping you guys could fill me in the twins did their simultaneous skeptical eyebrow raise which was really rather creepy oliver felt a sudden urge to back away slowly round the nearest corner and run like he d never run before oliver gave them his best innocent smile and they simultaneously crossed their arms over their chests oliver knew instantly what was coming the twins were preparing to drag oliver deepest darkest secrets from him if oliver didnteither crack and explain or crack and make a break for it well i have to get my desk back to my office oliver said hastily and quickly turned tail heading in the opposite direction as fast as he could without running fred grabbed his arm before oliver could get far however your office is the other way oliver he said firmly yes why dontwe walk you to it so you dontget lost george said grabbing oliver other arm oliver sighed and allowed himself to be led back to his office by his old friends admitting defeat knowing he was as beaten as his pitiful desk note to self he thought wearily i need to develop my ability to make a good exit madam pomfrey kicked harry and ron out of the hospital wing shortly before the seventh years curfew and they both promised to come back early in the morning hermione spent a couple of hours studying for her exams harry had offered to bring her up some books which started monday and then settled in to get some sleep smiling at draco gigantic pink face and hair before closing her eyes her eyes flew open two seconds later however as she heard a cry of mione before something large and heavy landed on her stomach oof she groaned and looked up to see fred weasley lying on her fred what mione no oof george jumped on the bed too the twins grinning at her exasperated look what are you doing here hermione demanded came to collect you asked me to have sex with you in the library remember fred said as though this was the most obvious thing in the world hermione glared at him and draco let out a snort of laughter fred and george turned to see where the laugh came from and both recoiled at the sight of an enormous pink floating ball in the shape of draco head watching them aaahhhh george yelped having instinctively backed away and fallen right off the bed what the hell is that fred demanded putting hermione in between him and draco just in case that would be draco malfoy hermione said her lips twitching in amusement at the look on draco face which looked even funnier from the angle she was being held in as fred used her as a human shield jesus christ hermione what did you do to him george asked curiously standing up and looking at draco warily you ve got to teach us how to do that fred said eagerly no doubt looking for joke shop merchandise i didntdo it hermione said with a giggle it was harry and madam pomfrey madam pomfrey is in on the prank war wicked hogwarts really has changed first snape now pomfrey hermione laughed at the startled yet pleased looks on their faces and began to explain having too good a day to be annoyed by their comments and jokes and found the twins to be quite good company especially as draco shot glare after glare at them probably having his sleep disrupted and not liking the subject matter which was pretty much all about the ways she harry and ron had tortured him including the recent floating head incident if there one thing malfoy didntneed it was his head inflated anymore than it was george joked shifting slightly on hermione bed the twins and hermione were all sitting cross legged on her cot chatting away tell me about it hermione said smirking a little still the only bad thing about it was that ron left in the middle of our conversation with him george said he was venting all about the prank war but just when he was getting to the good part why he was so angry at harry namely we heard someone scream which apparently was you when harry and oliver let go of the chain fred interrupted and ron went flying off to the rescue george finished it was this whole cheesy hero scene fred added the scream of a damsel in distress the look of determination settling on ickle ronniekin face and then whoosh he goes soaring off on his broomstick hermione giggled picturing the scene as if viewing it in some old fashioned muggle film then she frowned wait neither of you seems shocked about me being chained to malfoy we already knew fred said with a shrug who told you hermione demanded but neither twin noticed her sharp tone oliver of course oliver i ll kill him hermione thought furiously yeah strangest thing we talked to him earlier today and said that ron had told us everything george began mischievously and oliver just sort of blurted out even about the tattoo so of course we had to know more and when oliver tried to run for it we dragged him back to his office and beat the story out of him fred finished cheerfully as though this was a perfectly natural thing to do told us what dumbledore said about the fight in the office and then told us a bit about trying to haul you through the window and with a little um encouragement he told us that apparently harry was so pissed off about you keeping secrets that he accidentally inflated malfoy fred leaned closer to her eagerly one of which has something to do with you having a tattoo oliver wouldntsay much like how he knows about it george added but we can guess that naturally so we figured the important thing was why you of all people have a tattoo and came up here to get the story out of you fred finished with a gleam in his eye there is no tattoo hermione insisted folding her arms over her chest and glowering over at draco who smirked back at her though the effect was rather diminished by the pink potion no fred said narrowing his eyes at her tell me are your knees still ticklish and your feet george added grinning and your stomach and the back of your neck hermione stared at them in horror she had spent a lot of time with the twins over the years especially while cooped up in grimmauld place for the past few summers when harry was still on privet drive as ginny spent a lot of time with bill her favorite brother and hermione and ron spent a lot of time arguing which often ended in one of them storming off in a huff the twins were often fun to hang out with she usually needed a laugh during the dark times with voldemort and often hung out with them even when ginny was available and ron hadntgotten hermione angry the five of them spent a lot of time together also being the only teenagers in the house the twins were part of the reason oliver had gotten closer to harry ron and hermione once oliver had joined the war effort the twins had discovered quite a bit more about her than they should like the fact that she was one of the most ticklish people on the planet you wouldntdare she said uncertainly want to try us fred said pleasantly hermione looked from fred to george nervously before she could come up with a good response the twins launched themselves at her fred got her ribs george got her knees and hermione started shrieking with laughter oh haha stop i ll hahaha quit it gonna talk no hahaha knock it off how about now no oh hey o okay i ll talk haha stop i ll talk stop after about seven minutes of hermione promising to tell them everything the twins finally let up hermione having laughed too much to give them a proper glare told them the whole story much more than she d told harry and found it wasntas upsetting as telling anyone else would have been the twins thought the story was just as shocking in a funny way as ginny had found it only they seemed to well respect her for it that hermione would do anything as rebellious as get a tattoo even if she wouldnthave gotten it under normal circumstances was a thing of awe and something that deserved a pat on the back as much as it deserved teasing so it a sword with a rose wrapped around it george said as hermione ended her tale why d you choose that hermione shrugged it looked really pretty and dontyou dare ask if you can see it she added seeing both twins open their mouths with eager evil sort of expressions on their faces apparently she d guessed their intentions correctly as both promptly shut their mouths and glanced at each other with mischievous grins i dontknow i was sort of high on the rebellion just then my friends were all about teenage stupidity and i d just thrown the entire world for a loop and we wanted something pretty but something that showed our friendship was strong something tough i was actually the one who suggested it i just seemed to fit me the dagger seemed to symbolize being a fighter and the rose seemed to soften it make it look pretty and poetic and sort of thoughtful like you fred said his face too straight to be serious then he smiled broadly so only one question remains then what exactly happened that oliver saw it hermione blushed furiously i not telling not even if you tickle me until i forty i will never ever tell anyone understand the twins looked at each other shrugged gave hermione enough time to think they were going to let it lie and then dove at her tickling her mercilessly once again before hermione could give up and spill the story madam pomfrey emerged from her private quarters just off the hospital wing what are you doing in he oh no she moaned at the sight of the weasley twins who had not only put plenty of people in the hospital wing during their years at hogwarts but had been a real handful whenever they became her patients hi madam pomfrey did you miss us george said cheerfully as he and fred sat up what are you doing here she whined sounding a lot like an unhappy student we re having a pajama party cantyou tell fred said casting an illusion on his clothes to make them look like incredibly silly pink and white bunny pajamas complete with floppy eared fuzzy bunny slippers george followed suit came by for a visit and dumbledore said we could stay madam pomfrey shook her head just just keep it down and get some sleep will you she muttered turning on her heel and retreating to her room the twins grinned and turned back to tickle hermione some more but their absence had given her time to draw her wand and both of them knew better than to try anything oh fine then fred said sulkily but there are other more effective ways of making you talk yes and we ll use them just as soon as we figure out what they are george agreed hermione laughed go get some sleep you two i tired where are you staying in one of the guest rooms to tell you the truth we hadntplanned on it no george said that was a line for pomfrey actually so she wouldntkick us out we were just going to drop by visit a few people eat a decent meal told you we should have taken the time to learn to cook before moving out of mum house fred muttered and then head home but we may as well stay yeah george continued he glanced around mind if we stay in the hospital wing with you though we d have to wake dumbledore up to get a password for a spare room besides i never get tired of looking at that he jerked his head at draco pink head which was shrinking but still pretty large unless you want to give us the password to your room and we can crash in there fred said with a grin the day i give you two my password is the day i install bear traps around all the entrances hermione said dryly go ahead and stay here i dontmind it actually kind of nice to not be alone with malfoy attached to my wrist while we re on the subject of nice things want to have sex in the hospital wing since you never followed through on the library fred asked waggling his eyebrows suggestively oh shut up fred hermione laughed pushing him off of her bed chapter sixteen seven years of pent up anger harry and ron came by bright and early on sunday morning along with ginny who d been filled in on the previous days events and expressed her deepest regrets about missing the whole thing oliver also arrived feeling obligated to check on hermione well being although thankfully the twins had already left to go visit other friends and as such werentthere to try and get either hermione or oliver to talk draco head was almost back to normal though he was covered in globs of congealed pink potion and thoroughly grouchy i brought you a spare change of clothes ginny told hermione cheerfully holding out a skirt that hermione never wore because of how short it was and a low cut tight sweater along with a bra underwear socks and robes hermione rolled her eyes but accepted them without complaint and they turned to figuring out how to draco and hermione were going to shower in the hospital wing bathroom showering was even worse for hermione than it had been during her first night chained to draco draco kept involuntarily floating up to the ceiling which meant he could see over the curtain so he had to be watched carefully by harry ron and of all people oliver who as a teacher was given the task by madam pomfrey while she tended to a fourth year whose legs were covered in large green blotches hermione showered as fast as possible constantly glancing up to make sure draco wasntlooking in on her and nervously watching the edges of the curtain embarrassed about having harry ron and oliver there by the time she was ready to come out ginny had gotten the bright idea to temporarily blind draco which needless to say he wasnthappy about but he couldntdo anything as oliver approved the idea and then banish the other guys from the room so hermione could towel off and get dressed even with draco unable to see and harry ron and oliver gone hermione threw on her clothes in record time even deciding to forego wearing robes which she later regretted given the stylish skin showing outfit ginny had picked out hermione was forced to let ginny toy with her hair as it was completely unmanageable from not showering the night before and from having to be blown dry by the time ginny got her hair dry and the two of them could agree on a style two braids which was simple enough for hermione but looked cute enough for ginny draco head was regularly sized once more and he was able to scrub off the last of the antidote in the shower he was thoroughly pissed that ginny had gone through his trunk in order to bring him fresh clothes but as there hadntbeen any way for him to get clothing without showing off his pink head to half the students at hogwarts and ginny completely ignored his ranting he soon gave up on berating her and showered quickly harry ron hermione ginny and draco left the hospital wing dropped off draco and hermione belongings and headed down to breakfast saying good bye to oliver who muttered something about grading papers and hurried off to his office along the way to the great hall they found the twins who were on the third floor cordially greeting peeves who had abandoned his pursuit of terrorizing some second years in favor of reuniting with his fellow pranksters miss you i do peeves said sadly no one else appreciates the art of mischief the way you did dontworry peeves before we go we ll pick out a nice promising first year and train them in the ways of the practical joker fred promised solemnly before the twins followed harry ron hermione ginny and draco down to breakfast they all chatted away during breakfast except for draco who apart from being sulky was rather sleep deprived it isnteasy to sleep with an enlarged floating head you know hermione dug out the schedule she d gotten from oliver not much of it had changed really the sixth and seventh years had fewer classes as they were permitted to drop courses and as such most of the classes had students from all four houses instead of just one or two save defense against the dark arts charms and transfiguration which were arguably the three most important courses and few people had dropped them because of the war hermione had already been taking potions arithmancy charms and herbology with draco and they both had dropped history of magic and astronomy so it only took a little rearranging to make sure that they could make all of their classes she would still get to spend most of her regular classes with harry and ron who were in six of her eight classes and would only have to split up with them during transfiguration which she was now attending with the slytherins and hufflepuffs so that she could attend draco muggle studies after breakfast they went down to hagrid hut after threatening draco until he followed them sullenly ron staring morosely at pig who was currently six and a half feet tall fully owl and as hyperactive as ever judging by the way he flapped his wings and attempting to affectionately nip draco who panicked and nearly wet himself draco behaved himself as they chatted with hagrid until lunch time only letting out the occasional snort or laugh he actually seemed rather interested in the interior of hagrid hut having only been in there once and having been rather distracted at the time as he was hiding from some of hagrid blast ended skrewts with the majority of the fourth year care of magical creatures class fred george harry ron hermione ginny and draco eventually made their way back to the castle for lunch and hermione was just reflecting on how nice and incident free the day had been if you didntcount the whispers and stares she d received during breakfast thanks to draco and the rumors when they reached the great hall entrance and stopped dead while plenty of students were sitting at the ravenclaw hufflepuff and gryffindor tables both the slytherin and staff tables were entirely empty run hermione yelled certain that there was about to be some horrible school wide prank and that the slytherins had somehow managed to keep the staff away harry ron and draco turned right around with her thinking the same thing but neither twin moved and ginny grabbed hermione arm dontbe ridiculous herm she said calmly either the entire slytherin house is getting a stern talking to or someone did something to their dormitory or them and the staff has gone to sort it out yeah that what i d say fred said giving the hall a critical look as though checking for hidden traps me too if they were going to do something to the hall they d want to be here to see it george added are you sure hermione said uncertainly hey if anyone would know it would be us fred assured her and they went inside to eat a good portion of the gryffindor table seemed to have been reserved for them as no one else in gryffindor really wanted the pleasure of sitting next to draco malfoy lavender and parvati approached them after they d sat down however both smiling brightly at hermione who had to bite back a groan whenever there was a rumor about hermione lavender and parvati had a tendency to get her alone and gang up on her and had apparently realized that they werentgoing to be able to do so until hermione was sharing a dormitory with them again hi hermione lavender said sweetly how are you fine thanks you hermione responded coolly hoping they d go away soon enough good parvati said lavender nodded did you hear about the slytherins hermione someone booby trapped their dormitory they cantget in or out without sprouting red and gold fur all over their bodies fred and george both began whistling innocently grinning as they did so hermione shot them an amused look while harry ron and ginny giggled and draco glared the teachers are all down there trying to fix it lavender added at least according to rumor they are she gave hermione a significant look shouldntdumbledore be able to fix that pretty easily harry asked frowning he should be able to but they caught another fugitive death eater who everyone demanded at once someone named mulciber lavender said indifferently anyway as chief warlock of the wizengamot dumbledore felt obligated to go to the ministry and talk to some of the people there do you know who caught him draco asked yeah it was some female auror with a funny name nympha something to thanks for the update lav hermione interrupted knowing lavender hated that nickname and hoping that using it would get lavender to get to the point hermione was interested in mulciber capture but they had more reliable sources than lavender and parvati for that sort of information more importantly hermione wasntsure it was a good idea to let draco hear such information you re welcome we ve um heard a few rumors about you too hermione parvati ventured carefully if they have anything to do with a tattoo or snape they re false she said irritably lavender and parvati looked like they wanted to say more but figured that harry ron and ginny all of whom had stony looks on their faces wouldntallow them to annoy hermione into giving any more answers and the two girls left disappointed hermione rolled her eyes i will be so glad when i donthave to share a dormitory with them anymore she said what rumors about snape and tattoos were they talking about ron asked confused he hadntbeen in the room when draco had brought up the hickeys and he hadntbeen in the common room when draco had mentioned the tattoo and having spent the previous day mostly alone or in the hospital wing with hermione he had yet to hear anything about it the one about the tattoo on hermione butt fred said promptly unaware of ron ignorance in the matter hermione choked on her pumpkin juice her eyes wide duh ron what other tattoo would they be talking about george said what tattoo on hermione butt ron demanded oh where have you been weasley draco said jumping into the conversation with relish everyone in school knows about that thanks to me although i do believe wood and the little weasel already knew he watched with glee as ron neck and ears went red i suppose potter tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber are the only ones who ve gotten the full story on it though excuse me ron said glaring around at fred george harry ginny and hermione dontworry weasel draco added making sure to get one last comment in to piss ron off she kept everyone in the dark about the hickeys snape put on her neck so dontfeel too left out ron eyes widened and a look of such utter rage came over his features that hermione scooted away from him slightly without another word ron jumped up and stormed angrily from the hall i ll go talk to him harry and ginny said in unison both jumping up we ll come too fred and george added quickly realizing their mistake and knowing that their only chance of survival was to run for it but harry put a hand on each of their shoulders and forced them back into their seats oh no you won t harry said firmly you re going to stay here and face hermione wrath harry turned and ran to catch up with ginny who was hot on ron heels we re really sorry hermione fred said desperately as the furious look on her face grew to resemble ron s we didntknow he didntknow george added we wouldnthave mentioned it if we did yeah we wouldntdo that honest if they hadntadded that word hermione probably could have calmed herself down however honest was the word that snape had used when waving a tequila bottle at draco which had gotten ginny thinking that draco thought hermione had had sex with snape which had probably given harry the idea to make malfoy think hermione had had sex with snape if that hadnthappened hermione never would have let snape put hickeys on her neck which had not only been disturbing but was probably about to ruin her relationship with ron who could have gotten over the tattoo but would probably never forgive her for something like what she d done with snape which he would never understand therefore hermione status as a taken woman was about to be in serious jeopardy and all because of the word honest and in part because of the weasley twins we wouldntdo that to our brother or you we mean it fred insisted as hermione black expression darkened even more it might be a good idea to note that hermione brain could be compared to an office building one part of her brain was devoted purely to information filled metaphorically with filing cabinets and manned by a less emotional version of herself so it wasntthat hermione didnthear the weasley twins pleas it was simply that she couldntbe bothering with listening at the moment as such the comments were filed away in a little folder marked weasley twins and stored in the cabinet labeled people to eventually forgive right in between cornelius fudge and the guy who invented high heels fred and george saw hermione go for her wand and both quickly waved their own before shouting protegara which the information devoted part of hermione brain recognized as a highly advanced complex shield charm that blocked out the majority of unfriendly spells for a good five minutes and had been taught to fred and george by the order of the phoenix when the twins had left school and joined up she turned to the logic and strategy area of her mind and realized that the spell only blocked curses not sharp instruments hermione reached for her fork and knife and found only spoons next to all of the plates within six feet of hers she d been so busy glaring at the twins that she hadntnoticed that in anticipation of just such a reaction they d stolen every fork knife and serving utensil in the immediate area spoons are weapons too exclaimed the strategic part of hermione and she picked hers up glancing around for ammunition determined to get fred and george even if she had to do it muggle style ah ha mashed potatoes standing and scooping up a heaping spoonful of the delicious potatoes no doubt made with slave elf labor which made her even angrier hermione aimed the potato side of the spoon at fred he had to die first as he d said the evil word honest drew back the tip until her spoon was bent at roughly a forty five degree angle and let go with a faint ping the mashed potatoes went soaring through the air through the invisible magical barrier surrounding fred and splattered on his forehead while fred was still trying to process this event through his shock another glob of potatoes smacked george in the face and then quite suddenly hermione logical side only slightly warped by fury cut through again this is all malfoy fault and so a third much larger scoop of mashed potatoes smacked the laughing draco malfoy full in the face draco froze stunned a look of disbelief on his face as though he was completely unable to fathom that anyone would dare fire a lump of potatoes at him the look on his face seemed to satisfy her anger somewhat because she smiled as she stared coldly down at him slowly ever so slowly draco turned to look at her his face utterly blank and suddenly every horrible thing that had happened to him over the past two months came bubbling to the surface snape the only teacher who liked him staring at draco the way snape stared at potter furious snape supposedly shagging granger granger undressing draco and putting him in women underwear ernie macmillan pointing his quidditch team off in different directions to make sure everyone knew draco was tied to the goalpost snape telling lies for weasley and granger draco waking up floating over the lake staring down at the tentacles of the giant squid completely covered in red and gold stripes draco walking into the dormitory and getting hit by flying chimp feces being bitten viciously on the arm by the chimp itself before racing from the dormitory the bludger that hit crabbe causing draco to be crushed between crabbe enormous body and the ground then the duel between dean thomas and ginny weasley he d been looking forward to seeing someone else give weasley hell and the next thing he knew he was chained to granger sharing a room with granger and potter having his head inflated being called a death eater the fistfight the petrifaction the with a strangled yell draco arm shot out grabbed his goblet of pumpkin juice and threw the contents at hermione face she winced wiped her eyes picked up the entire bowl of mashed potatoes and smashed the food into his face like a clown would a pie even as she took the bowl away leaving a mashed potato mask on his face draco was squeezing a bottle of mustard at her squirting quite a bit on her leg he couldntaim too well thanks to the potatoes until hermione snatched the bottle and returned the favor wiping the potatoes out of his eye area draco turned away his arms up for protection and looked around for something messy there about two feet out of his reach was a bowl of beef stew draco jumped up and dove across the table hermione taking the opportunity to unscrew the lid on the mustard and dump the rest of the contents on his head fred was pushing the bowl of beef stew farther away so draco leaped on the table and snatched the bowl he turned around to toss it at hermione but found she was already behind him standing on the table and holding a dish filled with buffalo wings she overturned it on him the bones smacking him and the sauce leaving little reddish brown stains wherever they hit go hermione yelled neville longbottom from down the table get him shouted ernie from the hufflepuff table hermione catch called anthony goldstein and in a move that would have made harry proud hermione caught a bottle of honey thrown by the ravenclaw prefect she quickly dropped it however when a wave of hot beef stew went flying at her she only just turned her back in time i ve got ten galleons on mione to win fred yelled mashed potatoes still clinging to his forehead he and george had long since abandoned the table in an attempt to save themselves hermione retrieved the bottle of honey yanked the chain to pull him over onto his back put her foot on draco chest to hold him down and began to pour draco grabbed her ankle and tugged causing hermione to lose her balance and land hard on the table his arm was jerked forwards as she fell and he quickly sat up to avoid any unnecessary pain then saw a bowl of ice set out for those who preferred iced pumpkin juice just past her head he hopped up and ran for the bowl only to have his legs knocked out from under him by hermione he landed on his back his head right by her knees and an idea struck him just as she prepared to stand hermione suddenly found draco sitting on her stomach his legs pinning her arms down to her sides his fingers groping at her knees and tickling hermione burst out laughing struggling to get out from under him i ll teach you to piss me off draco yelled as though he was torturing her in the worst way possible rather than tickling her go for the eyes mione george shouted hermione did just that her legs flying up and smashing draco in the face knocking him back on top of her and giving her the chance to push him off she rolled over and knelt on his back to keep him down colin and dennis creevey shoved a platter of pork chops down the table to her and she grabbed a fistful of them holding tight to keep from dropping them dripping mushroom cream sauce all over draco back as she moved towards his collar draco writhed his attempts to dislodge her becoming more and more violent as she shoved pork chop after pork chop down the back of his shirt eventually she jumped off standing at the ready as draco got up flinging the last two pork chops at him and watching them momentarily stick to him before flopping off unfortunately she was now out of weapons draco knew he needed every second to get one up on her and rather than remove the pork chops from his shirt he dove for the closest bowls that hadntbeen destroyed by their little tickle pork chop fight a bowl of cherries and another two of sugar hermione went for the sugar at the same time but only managed to grab the white sugar draco still had the brown he seized the front of her shirt pouring both cherries and sugar down it hermione squealed at the thoroughly odd feeling and seeing her guard was down draco snatched the white sugar from her she just had time to squeeze her eyes shut as an explosion of sugar hit her sticking to the pumpkin juice on her face and hair from draco original attack booooo shouted fred and many of the students booed along with him go for the hair mione go for the hair george yelled saving that idea for later hermione went for the ketchup instead draco saw it coming and was able to duck the ketchup squirting all over his already stained back he started running along the now empty table hermione chasing him by now the gryffindors had all abandoned their plates fearful of getting caught in the crossfire and were standing by the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables snacking absently on the other houses food while they cheered for hermione hermione stopped dead however when she saw draco swoop down and lift up a dish of tuna salad this is for snape he yelled flinging it at her head hermione ducked the lip of the bowl grazing her sugar coated hair a narrow miss she reached down and grabbed a bowl of egg salad its contents splattered against his hip no this is for snape hermione countered feeling that if anyone had any right to be angry about anything involving snape it was her this is for potter draco sent an apple flying at her head ow this is for ron hermione replied with an orange ow this is for the goalpost a pear ow this is for the vanishing spell a grapefruit ow this is for that quidditch game a fistful of blackberries ew hermione complained as they exploded against her she picked up someone abandoned plate of spaghetti this is for that illusion spell ha ha that was a good one ugh noodles and meat sauce clung to draco torso and he reached for the creamed corn this is for hovering me over the giant squid oh that was so much ack the corn splattered against her stomach this is for looking down my shirt kill him mione fred cut in from the sidelines waving around a chicken leg he d pilfered from the ravenclaw table for emphasis suddenly the impromptu food fight was just a way for the two of them to take out the past few months hell the last seven years worth of pent up anger and frustration they were no longer worried about damage or messiness or what would hurt the worst or stain the most when it hit all that mattered was that they kept throwing this is for slapping me draco squirted chocolate sauce on her ooh that was fun this is for calling me a mudblood cheese slices one of which stuck to draco forehead this is for actually looking decent at the yule ball what does that have to do with anything i had to listen to pansy insecure bitching about it this is for petrifying me all night this is for seeing me naked kill him a lot mione fred roared at that point go for the throat george added angrily this is for getting me detention in the forbidden forest this is for making ron vomit slugs it was quite possibly the most entertaining fight in hogwarts history hermione and draco who had to stay relatively close because of the chain were doing their best to throw things from an odd angle and mostly one handed they were screaming at the top of their lungs taking no notice of the interest of the rest of the school yelling about everything that they had ever done to one another this is for the chimps this is for buckbeak this is for freeing buckbeak this is for that repeated phrase spell draco started laughing at the memory and in a fury hermione turned around to find more food to throw preferably something horribly messy just as she spotted a huge dish of chili draco leaped forward a chocolate cream pie in one hand as hermione bent over to grab the chili draco scooted to one side of her holding her down at the waist with his free hand and flipping up her skirt to reveal her backside look tattoo tattoo he screamed gleefully to the hall at large dozens of people burst out laughing and many craned their necks for a better look while experiencing their first feelings of appreciation towards draco hermione sword and rose tattoo was plainly visible for all to see a few inches below the waistline of her skirt fred and george wrestled colin creevey camera away from him and fred began pushing the button frantically trying to get as many angles as possible as hermione struggled against draco arm then to add injury to insult draco took the chocolate cream pie and slammed it against hermione butt an inhuman howl sounded no one could tell if it was rage embarrassment or some other emotion but it made just about everyone in the hall jump everyone except draco who calmly sucked some pie filling from his finger then quite suddenly he found hermione foot connecting with his jaw argh he yelled in pain and anger and then screamed as a tsunami of chili slammed into his stomach he forgot all about holding hermione down trying to get the burning spicy concoction off the bits of skin it had touched he didntget to attempt this for long however as hermione spun on him intent on clawing his eyes out on strangling him on torturing him to death as slowly as possible she was no longer aware of her actions her emotions had taken over and the only conscious thought she had was one word repeating over and over kill chapter seventeen the coconut concussion once again ron was beyond enraged and harry and ginny hadntbeen able to calm him down ron was furious with all of them with hermione for her actions and with harry and ginny for not having told him less than twenty minutes after they d chased ron as he stomped out of the great hall harry and ginny were returning to the entrance hall guess i moving in with hermione for a while harry said glumly ginny patted his arm i d come too but there not enough room do you hear that harry paused frowning it sounds like cheering are they having a feast i dontthink so ginny said confused i mean we were only gone for a few she trailed off harry what if the slytherins what if there really was some other reason they werentin the hall harry looked at her his eyes wide and then they both dashed down the marble staircase making a beeline for the doors to the great hall just as they reached the entrance augh harry harry went from running flat out to being flat on his back in the blink of an eye harry harry are you okay say something ginny shrieked kneeling over him ow harry muttered irritably in response he sat up rubbing his forehead where a large red mark could be seen ginny glanced around for the offending object as harry squeezed his eyes shut trying to force the pain into recession there rolling to a stop behind them dripping milk as it went a large crack along one side was a coconut ginny said lifting the object up puzzled what kind of weirdo would throw a coconut at you wouldntit be easier to curse you harry glanced over at the coconut in confusion then hoping to find the culprit he lifted his eyes to look into the great hall and his jaw dropped open the coconut he could safely assume had been thrown by hermione who was standing on the gryffindor table covered in bits of food and glaring at a laughing draco malfoy who was standing with his back to the entrance as harry and ginny watched in morbid fascination hermione spun around and bent over and draco scooped up a pie held hermione down with one hand grabbed the back of her skirt and yanked it up look tattoo tattoo harry stared in disbelief squinting in an attempt to see he could just make out the tattoo which was only a few inches long on the right side of her lower back so that what it looks like harry said dazedly in shock from the sight and still woozy because of the speeding coconut oh god i knew i should have brought her jeans or something this morning we ve got to ginny started to stay then stopped in horror as draco slammed a pie against hermione rear end flashbulbs were going off like mad thanks to the prank war few students who owned cameras left their dormitory without them and the whoops and jeers were deafening as harry and ginny got back to their feet hermione braced her hands against the table and threw her leg up in a strong kick draco stumbled and started shouting as the chili hermione threw burned his hands and the warmth started to soak through his shirt then hermione was on him forcing him down to the table clawing scratching punching howling and above all looking like some crazed monster perhaps a breed of fruit demon i got mione harry called to ginny as he jumped on the table behind hermione threw his arms around her back and yanked her off of draco draco was on his feet in an instant but found ginny wand right between his eyes he settled for smirking at the three of them especially hermione who was still trying to kick and hit him even as harry dragged her as far away from draco as possible draco coolly dodged her flying fists and feet fred george help harry yelled struggling to hold her down he was usually a lot stronger than hermione but he d recently taken a blow to the head and between hermione adrenaline and her magic both of which were lending her strength he was having trouble let her go harry i ve got money on this fight come on she was just about to kill him if you two donthelp him i swear i ll tell mum about angelina and ginny stopped there was no need to go any further as both twins were diving onto the table fred grabbed one leg george the other and carefully the three of them climbed off the table and carried the struggling hermione into the entrance hall draco and ginny following it okay hermione harry grunted trying to sound as soothing as possible while fighting to keep her from getting loose fred and george set her legs down once they d reached the entrance hall and ginny waved her wand at the doors to close off the great hall and give them a bit of privacy it gonna be okay i swear i ll let you kill him i ll even help just not where there are witnesses come on mione george added remembering that she was still mad at him and fred and judging by the food scratches and bruises on draco they wanted her calm it okay you guys are such amateurs ginny said rolling her eyes she adopted a frightened tone hermione there a teacher coming hermione snapped out of it immediately where draco rolled his eyes looking disgusted at hermione fearful expression god you re such a draco they turned at the top of the staircase leading to the dungeons was a tall thin blond woman staring at them with interest mum draco exclaimed in surprise and a bit of fear what are you doing here oh i came to see dumbledore he sent me an owl to explain that er draco is that cheese on your head draco reached up and removed the cheese slice from his head um well long story mum so dumbledore sent you a letter explaining about me being chained to granger narcissa blinked looking startled but then nodded yes er is this chain invisible or something yeah yeah dumbledore wanted to keep it quiet so you re going to be chained to her for how long draco frowned until they find a cure i not sure oh dear narcissa said worriedly how will you come home for christmas would she mind coming along draco and hermione looked at each other in horror um we really h haventdiscussed that mrs malfoy hermione squeaked we re hoping to have this resolved by then i ll have a talk with dumbledore in that case narcissa replied smiling well draco you seem to be in serious need of a shower and a change of clothes so i think i ll go visit severus i ll stop by the great hall at dinner time all right sure mum draco said she smiled i would hug you but i wouldntwant to embarrass you in front of your little friends everyone flinched and fred started to say something but ginny held her hand over his mouth or ruin my robes for that matter i ll see you soon draco dear bye mum draco said untucking and pulling his shirt away from him in the back to let the pork chops tumble out and plop onto the floor as narcissa headed down the stairs she passed oliver who gave her a quick smile before continuing into the entrance hall where he stopped and gaped at fred and george who had a bit of mashed potatoes on their faces and food on their hands from holding hermione legs harry who had beef stew on his shirt from struggling with hermione ginny who was holding a cracked coconut in one hand and aiming her wand at draco with the other and draco and hermione who were covered from head to toe in bits of food what the hell happened to you lot oliver demanded we ll tell you later fred said cheerfully and hermione glared at him furiously is that sugar on your head oliver asked hermione looking at her face and hair the sugar granules had stuck to the pumpkin juice and were coating most of her head and seeping into her braids harry ran his finger across hermione cheek and then licked his finger yeah it sugar hey that really good he leaned forward and ran his tongue across hermione forehead harry hermione exclaimed shocked sorry harry said quickly looking just as startled with his actions as she was you should taste what she got in here fred said and promptly reached into her low cut shirt and pulled out a handful of chocolate and brown sugar covered cherries hermione let out a noise somewhere between a shriek and a growl and started towards him harry grabbed her arm are you trying to get yourself killed ginny hissed at fred hey it didntseem like a bad way to go fred said handing george one of the pilfered cherries and eating one himself isntthat colin camera around your neck harry asked nodding at george yup he letting us borrow it we told him we ve been developing a few things to copy and edit photographs and he said we could take it as long as we sent him a copy of everything and made sure to give the camera back harry tightened his grip on hermione as she glared at george furiously listen oliver said glancing behind him at the entrance to the dungeons i dontknow what happened but i willing to bet it not a good idea for the teachers to find out about it snape just got back and apparently he knows a way to fix the common room damn george muttered because sirius black pulled that same prank you guys hermione said to fred and george in exasperation knowing that the twins spent an awful lot of time hanging out with sirius and had gotten a lot of advice from him the point is oliver went on hurriedly before the twins could reply the rest of the teachers are on their way oh god hermione wailed uh oh ginny said crap we ve got to draco began but harry cut him off right this is what we re going to do ginny do you know where the slytherin common room is yeah how draco demanded but everyone ignored him good harry said head that way and curse yourself but good stall them as long as you can burst into tears if you have to i on it ginny said and walked off dyeing her skin blue as she went and muttering a list of gruesome curses she knew fred george you guys know any spells that will clean up the great hall harry went on yeah of course george said the twins had a great knowledge of charms gained from the order of the phoenix and from researching joke shop items and of course from being hogwarts finest practical jokers okay get in there fix what you can and try and convince people not to say anything when the teachers come in after that go talk to ron why fred asked you re the only people he not really pissed at yet harry said he figures you thought he knew about everything which is why you didnttell him at least i assume that what he thinks anyway you re our last shot at it all right george said shrugging oliver harry continued take draco and hermione to the nearest bathroom to get them clean and make sure they dontkill each other oliver nodded too worried about his friends to remember that he was a teacher and should be the one giving orders and punishments too for that matter what about you harry hermione asked unhappy with the arrangement and wondering if it might be a better idea to have the twins come instead of oliver no of course it wouldntbe what was she thinking they were well them i going to go see madam pomfrey and make sure that coconut didntgive me a concussion he replied rubbing the bump on his head while looking at the streak he d made in the sugar covering hermione head all right guys let get going fred and george headed back into the entrance hall fred handing something to harry as he headed for the hospital wing and something else to oliver as he accompanied hermione and draco to a secret passage that would take them up to the prefects bathroom it wasntuntil she saw oliver bring his hand away from his mouth that she realized fred had handed them each a cherry okay hermione said as she oliver and draco entered the prefect bathroom once this is over i going to dumbledore and demanding my own bathroom oliver smiled while draco rolled his eyes oh stop complaining granger draco said taking off his shirt a couple of stray pork chops fell off in the process draco dropped the filthy shirt to the floor and paused wait how are we going to get fresh clothes er i suppose i could go get some oliver said slowly uncomfortable as he was with the situation he didntwant to leave hermione alone with draco wait hermione said panicked she didntknow what draco might do if they were left alone together all she knew was that draco was ready to strangle her and probably would the moment her back was turned she d made him far too mad to risk it and she wasntsure she wouldntkill him if given the chance um i know can you get in touch with the house elves oliver hermione had read in hogwarts a history that the teachers could summon an elf on demand oh yeah sure let me just we need a specific elf hermione interrupted knowing that the majority of the elves were still rather cautious around her thanks to s p e w and wouldnttouch clothes on a human request anyway the elves did the laundry but they never handed humans clothes nor took them from humans elves avoided touching clothes if at all possible they saw clothing as something offensive and fearful and handled them carefully with magic we need dobby the weird one with the funny clothing oliver said confused hermione nodded okay dobby come just like that dobby appeared with a loud cracking noise what can dobby do for you sir he asked oliver then promptly forgot him when he caught sight of hermione miss herminie dobby said happily you know hermione oliver said knitting his brow of course dobby knows miss miss is making dobby his hats miss herminie is a close friend of harry potter and is just as kind as great as oh god draco muttered dobby squeaked and turned to look at draco young master malfoy draco stared at the elf who was bundled in various clothes and wearing about thirty knit hats wait dobby our old house elf dobby is that you yes sir dobby said harry potter has freed dobby sir i thought my father killed you draco said shocked wait what potter freed never mind tell me later okay i ve got to get this shit off me we need some clothes and towels dobby hermione told the elf they re all in our room though think you can go get them of course miss dobby will be right back er please make sure you get me jeans okay no skirts hermione said feeling as though she d never wear a skirt again with all the trouble they had caused in the past two days dobby nodded and disappeared draco smirked dobby returned a few moments later with two very mismatched outfits neither draco nor hermione complained however as they needed to get back to the dorms and didntreally care what they were wearing as long as it wasntcoated in sugar mustard honey or some other sort of food will miss require anything else dobby asked no thanks dobby hermione told the house elf gratefully i really appreciate this anything for harry potter greatest friend dobby squeaked draco rolled his eyes at the harry potter comment thanks a bunch dobby he said without even the slightest hint of sarcasm you re very welcome young master er sir dobby said looking proud of himself draco smiled enjoying your freedom dobby oh yes sir dobby said nodding so hard his ears flapped will you tell maddy i said hello yes of course draco said thanks again dobby nodded and bowed before disappearing once again hermione started sorting through her clothes dobby had brought her a pair of jeans a one piece swimsuit a blouse a sweater two pairs of underwear a bra a necktie and about seven other articles she looked at draco pile which was much less haphazard hey how come he brought you normal clothes she said in indignation she frowned come to think of it why were you so civil to each other i thought you two hated each other she hadntbeen paying attention to dobby interaction with draco at the time preoccupied as she was by other things including everything from oliver to ron anger to the pie filling and cherries me and dobby hate each other draco snorted why would i hate him you actually dont hate him hermione said shocked mind your own damned business draco snapped he turned and looked at the tub as did hermione unfortunately the prefects bathroom didnthave showers it had one nice big bathtub which wasnta problem usually as the people who used it were often alone and when they weren t they were with someone who was allowed to see them in the bath however this was a very unusual situation chapter eighteen a daring bathroom rescue oliver wood shifted uncomfortably wondering what the problem was hermione hadntseemed to have too much of a problem showering that morning she d been embarrassed sure but she d handled it well she handled everything well oh damn dontthink that he ordered himself trying to keep his thoughts from getting too off track it wasnteasy however but then it never had been not when it came to hermione he d had a crush on her for ages it was something he d felt since her first year when he was in fifth he d noticed her during her sorting and after ages of staring at her thinking about her and so on it had clicked that he liked her a few months later right before harry first quidditch match hermione had been trying to force harry to eat a piece of toast and he d finally taken a bite from her hand just to placate her and oliver had felt the urge to murder his seeker and developed a sudden craving for toast he d stayed mostly silent over the years flirting with her a little and sometimes hanging out with harry just to be around hermione when oliver had graduated he d kicked himself for never saying anything to her then he d seen her at the quidditch world cup at night after the match hey what happened to keeping bad thoughts out of our head i trying oliver thought arguing with himself but she broken up with ron now according to rumor yeah rumors are always so reliable she broken up with ron just like she murdered snape keep your mind out of the gutter you teacher her student i ve got to get out of this bathroom oliver thought wearily glancing at hermione out of the corner of his eye and absently twirling the cherry stem between his fingers note to self buy fred a very nice christmas present he tried to force his thoughts away from hermione but there wasntmuch left to think about had she really broken up with ron maybe but they d seemed awfully friendly the day before in the hospital but ron had seemed no more friendly than harry come to think of it hermione hadntbeen holding hands with anyone she d been acting around them the way oliver remembered the three of them from school walking together talking together laughing together but no one making eyes at anyone else so perhaps hermione really was single now get in the tub the sane well saner part of him fairly screamed at hermione and draco get in so i can get out well oliver said a tad desperately neither draco nor hermione noticed his tone they were both staring at the tub worriedly and not paying attention to him much though both of them seemed to have heard oliver speak er maybe we can rig up a curtain hermione said nervously taking out her wand oh so that what the problem is oliver thought no more shower curtain good let fix that and get me out of here before malfoy has another rumor to spread it had never been easy for oliver to be alone with hermione especially now that his brain kept reminding him of things like cherries and how she was quite possibly a single girl now how are we supposed to bathe one at a time even if we do draco asked speaking more to himself than hermione we cantswim and splash around with only five feet between us the tub too deep we d have to keep one arm in the air it not like showering hermione sighed well we ll just go find another bathroom is all the three of them headed for the door oliver holding the clean clothes so that hermione and draco didntget food on them draco opened the door and froze i cantbelieve she really got a tattoo lavender voice squealed from the corridor outside i know who would have believed it parvati answered i thought malfoy just made it up me too exclaimed parvati twin padma i wonder where she went we ve got to get the story out of her lavender said hermione seized draco arm and hauled him inside slamming the door quickly with her foot okay never mind hermione said hastily making a silent vow to avoid her roommates as much as possible um well hmm i guess we could i just damn it i dont know she wailed i just want to get these damned cherries out of my bra oliver reddened and out of the corner of her eye hermione saw him toss a cherry stem across the room as inconspicuously as he could i ve got to get out of here come on those bubbles are completely opaque i dontcare how much they dontwant to do it i cantleave them alone and i cantstand this much longer well oliver coughed there only one solution then right you ll just have to bathe at the same time have you gone mad hermione asked with a laugh i ll keep an eye on him hermione i promise oliver said it that or you go find another bathroom and i know you re anxious to be seen and to answer questions hermione groaned fine she said feeling like she was permitting someone to shot her in the foot though logically she knew it was pretty much their only solution i not sharing a bath with her draco insisted crossing his arms over his chest well the slytherins are out of the dungeons now oliver said lightly i suppose you could tell them all about your food fight while you re looking for another bathroom and how you re on the way to find a nice place to shower with hermione the muggle born gryffindor or i could tell them your call draco bit his lip and looked at the tub in a whole new light even though they d both agreed more or less it took quite some time to actually get to the bathing both hermione and draco kept trying to stall and as usual they had plenty of fights along the way first it was an argument over which taps to turn on draco kept saying certain ones smelled too girly and hermione kept worrying about the waters bubbles being thick enough to keep anyone from seeing her then once the tub was filled they had another argument about finding a different bathroom on and on they fought who was going to get in first whose fault it was who deserved to be strangled to death more who won the food fight who had more right to complain and so on finally oliver exploded will you two shut up and get in there i haventgot all day i supposed to be grading essays and planning lessons i haventeven come up with an exam for my class tomorrow but no i have harry breathing down my neck and fred and george dragging secrets out of me and my desk flying out a window and a lot of wrong thoughts i shouldnthave about students oliver hermione exclaimed oh stop it everyone knows that i ve at least seen your tattoo why dontwe just go and tell everyone about how we silencio hermione screeched pointing her wand at oliver mouth are you insane there are probably people walking by outside let the man talk draco said lifting hermione silencing charm and looking at oliver in amusement this was just getting good oliver blushed you know what i a teacher i donthave to put up with this both of you get in the tub you cant order us to bathe hermione exclaimed watch me i order you i order you i order you oliver said in a singsong i ve gone mad sort of voice shaking his shoulders in a mock dance move for emphasis and letting out an evil cackle both hermione and draco backed away nervously quite worried about his sanity hermione staring at the crazed oliver suddenly realized how wrong her life had become in the past few months she had become completely gung ho about the prank war and as such she d become a nervous wreck and a devious plotter her stubborn streak had driven her to do the craziest things just like when she d followed harry and ron down that trap door beneath fluffy or freed buckbeak and sirius or made a solemn vow to get a shit load of dirt on rita skeeter and blackmail her breaking not just rules but laws overnight she d gone from trying to talk harry and ron out of the prank war to being determined to destroy draco malfoy at all costs she had entered into a freakish alliance with one of her least favorite people she had stripped a guy dressed him in her underwear and tied him to a goalpost she had fought tooth and nail to get one up on him and now she was standing in a bathroom with said guy and oliver wood of all people oliver wood the teacher who made her the most uncomfortable primarily because he had a habit of winking at her or staring at her or glaring at ron whenever ron was acting particularly boyfriend y and these sort of actions always brought up a lot of memories good memories to be sure but ones she didntreally want to think about while she was with ron oh god hermione thought overwhelmed i standing here with oliver and draco about to bathe with draco while ron pissed at me i accidentally almost killed harry with a coconut ginny stalling the teachers fred and george are doing god knows what everyone spreading rumors and through it all i thinking immoral thought about a man who is now my professor hermione burst out laughing oliver looked slightly affronted by this and draco just looked sort of annoyed and somehow that made it even funnier everything she d dealt with over the past few weeks from snape and malfoy to harry and ron minor pranks and major pranks and the tattoo and the hickeys and oliver and so on just sort of bubbled to the surface and gave new meaning to the phrase you ll look back on this and laugh she d been avoiding oliver all year embarrassed and rather worried about the feelings she still had for him she d been worried about her motives for letting snape mark her as hard as she tried to block the memories out she d been determined to keep anyone from ever finding out about that damned tattoo she d been plotting to prank draco and nearly every day she d been hit by some silly prank big or small her relationship with ron was basically over harry was being her protective savior of a best friend draco was chained to her and snape well who knew what had happened there what wasntfunny about it how had this happened how had she gotten here it was probably malfoy fault really but still it was just wrong what are you laughing at oliver demanded looking rather wounded almost pouting and hermione let out a particularly loud shriek of laughter you she choked out pointing at him and you she pointed at draco you two harry ron twins snape life malfoy dobby pork chops cherries she started laughing too hard to speak doubling over draco however had ceased to be amused or confused and was now just irritated he had congealed food all over his body he d spent the past few days make that months in a state of almost constant humiliation he was over it he wanted to choke her to death but he didntthink he really had the option so he settled for the next best thing draco reached out grabbed her shoulders and shoved her into the bathtub of course he instantly realized this was a mistake as he was chained to her wrist with a yelp draco went flying after her two screams and two splashes later oliver sighed annoyed and weary well at least they re in the bathtub now he muttered hermione popped back up first followed quickly by draco both of them spluttering how dare you hermione screamed splashing at him you bitch this is your fault draco yelled splashing her back harder this of course marked the beginning of a spectacular water fight oliver quickly went to rescue the dry clothes and towels from the waves of water pouring out onto the floor once they were safe on a shelf oliver was too busy to tell them to knock it off he was forced to take off his socks and shoes put them on higher ground roll up his pants and hitch up his robes as their fight got them slightly clean oliver watched in amusement for a while but there was only so much scented bubbles could do to clean two fully clothed and very messy people and when there was so much water on the floor that the pork chops from draco shirt had floated away underneath the bathroom door oliver called things to a halt stop you re in the damned tub together so bathe already oliver nodded pointedly at a few bottles of shampoo and similar things that were always kept in the bathroom hermione looked up at him holding his robes high with his jeans rolled up and giggled draco admitted defeat but splashed at her one last time hermione responded and the water war began to start back up until oliver screamed hey fine draco muttered turning away from hermione i can be mature about this you cantbe mature about anything hermione snorted moving to the edge of the tub as far from draco as she could get and turning on another tap they d lost a lot of water during the fight when the water was up to her neck about an inch below draco shoulder she shut the tap off draco was already taking off his shoes emptying them of water and setting them on the floor hermione copied him doing her best not to blush when the rest of draco clothes followed staring hard at the bubbles to make sure no one could see anything below them she struggled to take off her skirt and underwear without falling over and more nervously added her shirt oliver had his head turned away she thought he might still be watching out of the corner of his eyes but she wasntcertain if she was imagining that or not it was the most awkward moment of her life and that was saying something she was standing in a gigantic bathtub with her worst enemy standing five feet away and completely naked to top it all off as she took off her bra cherries fell out and began floating in the water though some had gotten smashed into the material and she shoved the bra under her shirt so that no one would see it or the crushed cherries she summoned a few bottles of beauty products before carefully laying her wand next to her clothes as far from draco as she could reach and set about trying to get clean bathing while standing up in neck deep water wasnteasy however she couldntbend over to wash the bottom half of her without submerging herself and she didntwant to lose track of draco determined to keep him in her peripheral vision it was also thoroughly embarrassing to wash certain parts of her she knew it wouldntbe hard for draco or oliver to guess just what she was cleaning her legs presented quite a problem also she was going to have to scrub them thoroughly to get off all the stains the mustard ketchup and several other things had left her legs looking quite discolored but she couldntreach below mid thigh without half drowning herself eventually she got the bright idea to hold onto the tub edge with one hand stand on one foot lift her leg up as high as she comfortably could and scrub herself that way draco smirked when he saw her foot and calf sticking up out of the water he eventually became braver about looking at her and she could just see the wheels in his head turning to come up with something insulting enough to say her hair too presented a bit of a problem the choice of two braids had turned out to be quite a bad one as the braids were now sticky and difficult to unravel it was also a chore to figure out just how to shampoo her hair she didntlike the idea of raising her arms to scrub her head worried that would make a bit of her chest show and maybe too much so she squatted down slightly to wash it and went under the water to rinse coming up quickly and making sure draco hadntmoved finally she felt quite clean but she continued to scrub not wanting to face the awkward moment when she and draco would both have to climb out of the tub are you done yet asked draco who had long since finished bathing and was lounging on the edge of the tub his elbows propped up on it and only his lower body still beneath the bubbles you still have mustard in your hair hermione retorted and draco grabbed his hair in a panic and dove for a bottle of shampoo hermione rolled her eyes you really are vain you know that who cares as long as i dontlook like a train wreck like you draco shot back as he re lathered his hair if you two have one more fight i ll drown you both oliver threatened blackly he was sitting on the counter in the far corner of the restroom where the sinks and mirrors were on the other side of the two toilet stalls he d taken off his robes in an effort to keep them dry and was looking rather strange with his jeans rolled up and an exasperated weary expression on his face he was half asleep not having slept very well the previous night he d been too busy doing research for the restoration of his desk and worrying about what dumbledore and many other people would say about oliver past with hermione if it ever came out do i still have sugar on my face oliver hermione asked in a small voice not trusting draco to reply honestly um yeah i can still see where harry er licked you hermione blushed and scrubbed harder at the sugar which was proving highly difficult to get off of her face pumpkin juice was known to leave vicious stains and it was apparently a good adhesive when it came to sugar granules and skin especially since it had been given a long time to dry you re good oliver said at last when she d nearly rubbed her face raw is she now draco said vaguely once more relaxing at the edge of the tub hermione glared at him and searched for something else to clean and had just decided that she might as well make sure all that pie crust and filling was really gone when the door swung open with a gasp hermione dove under the water madam pomfrey had healed the bump on harry head in a matter of seconds and was completely uninterested when he insisted that it was an unprovoked attack by a coconut though this story did make her look very long and hard for brain damage feeling as good as new harry set out to find hermione and to make sure she was alive and not strangling anyone or throwing pork chops down someone shirt ah hermione gotta love her he thought with a grin as he began his bathroom search he was certain they were still in one it would have taken a long time to scrub all that crap off and they would after all have to take two showers and they d probably argued for ages the first bathroom harry thought of was the prefects one as far as he knew the rest of the bathrooms in the main part of the school only had toilets as the common rooms all had showers and baths it was pretty private and much closer to the great hall than gryffindor tower which were also good reasons to go there if you were covered in food and had just been thoroughly embarrassed in front of most of the school harry immediately saw that he was right the entire corridor outside the prefects bathroom was flooded and two lone pork chops were floating in the mess holding up his robes and stepping carefully harry headed for the door he d become a prefect in his sixth year which was when secondary prefects were usually chosen to help with the extra work bestowed upon the older prefects rabbits feet harry called at the door grinning at the memory of draco love and bunnies password not that the two were related the door swung open and harry walked in then froze draco was looking up at him with an annoyed expression and oliver was nowhere to be seen primarily because his shelf was on the other side of the toilet stalls and neither was hermione but she had to be there somewhere i guess she under the water harry thought in surprise trying to work out just why hermione would be submerged he waited for a few seconds for her to come up but she didn t and then a horrible thought struck him draco looked pretty relaxed or had until harry had come in she wasntdown there doing she wouldn t would she go away potter draco snapped i busy oh god she is harry thought wildly she down there giving him a no no not my hermione no no no she wouldn t she doesnteven do that does she think harry think rationally why would oliver have left was he pissed off at her for some reason oh god what if he thought she told me her secret about him and he got mad and left what if malfoy done something to her ohmigod he drowned her i coming mione harry yelled and ran for the tub kicking off his shoes as he went the startled frightened look on draco face would have been comical if harry hadntbeen too busy charging the tub to care oliver meanwhile had dozed off slightly but awoke with a start at the sound of harry shout he stood up wondering what harry was doing there and stepped out from his little hidden corner just in time to see harry making a flying leap into the pool and draco ducking in terror scratching his head oliver was too tired and exasperated to do much but stand there and hit the door with a spell to close it hermione was cowering at the bottom of the tub praying that whoever had come in would see draco not notice her pile of clothes and leave before she ran out of air she d have to resurface soon she couldnthold her breath forever suddenly strong arms seized her around the chest and yanked her upwards hermione screamed then promptly choked on soapy water draco was trying to feel her up in the bath she d kill him or was he trying to kill her god she needed air she couldntbreathe her head broke the surface and she coughed and spluttered spitting out water and barely noticing as she was dragged to the side of the tub someone lifted her up and laid her on the floor and hermione in full panic mode now opened her mouth to scream and someone pinched her nose shut and covered her mouth with theirs hermione eyes flew open as a gust of air filled her mouth and harry dripping wet face filled her vision what the hell was he doing he he d just pulled her out of the bath and kissed her if one could call it that he definitely needed snogging lessons hermione was too shocked to react it wasntevery day your best friend dragged you out of the bathtub to prove their love by making out with you very very badly and it wasntuntil harry pulled away and put his hands on her chest that she shrieked and pushed him off and back into the bathtub harry let out a quick argh before he went under draco started laughing hysterically finally understanding that harry had thought hermione had drowned harry came back up looking quite confused the moment he saw her sitting up and staring at him he rushed to her and threw his arms around her hermione you re okay harry what has gotten into you hermione demanded trying to push harry away but to no avail how badly had she hurt him when malfoy had ducked that flying coconut i thought you went to see madam pomfrey about that head injury i thought you were a goner harry choked out when i came in and realized you were under the water oh god hermione sighed of course he hadntbeen kissing her he d been trying to do c p r harry forgive me but you really do have a saving people thing what am i going to do with you harry pulled back looking like a drowned and very relieved rat i couldntfigure out why you didntcome up at first i thought well never mind what i you re alive and naked he looked down at her body in shock harry hermione exclaimed having forgotten this fact in all the confusion and amusement oliver stepped up behind her and handed his robe to her she wrapped it around herself as harry looked away and draco fought to stay standing laughing as hard as he was what the hell were you doing in the bathtub with malfoy anyway harry demanded his back still turned as she stood up oliver robe sticking to her damp skin and retrieved her wand to summon a towel better yet what the hell were you doing naked in a bathtub with malfoy bathing harry what do you think the tub was too deep to bathe in separately and all well okay once we were in there we decided to bathe wait you got in and then thought you d take a bath together harry why are you taking this so so weird hermione demanded in exasperation malfoy pushed me in malfoy fell in oliver lost it hey and ordered us to get clean so we did staying as far apart as possible hermione continued drying herself off as best she could too annoyed and amused and overwhelmed by the strangeness of life to be embarrassed or less blunt then the door opened and i hid thinking it was some other prefect cantbelieve i forgot to charm the door the prefects usually cast a spell on the charm when bathing to prevent anyone else from entering then someone grabbed me and i fully intended to kill them but i screamed and choked and the next thing i know you re giving me mouth to mouth is that a new term for it the pureblooded oliver said in an amused sort of tone it a muggle thing hermione exclaimed indignantly it used to save drowning victims if you say so oliver said skeptically he didntsee how harry kissing hermione was some muggle live saving method and moreover he d been rather relieved and filled with a happy feeling when hermione had shoved him back into the tub harry pushed himself out of the tub water pouring off of him oh man i completely soaked he complained hermione performed a wave to make hot air blow out of the tip of her wand handed it to harry and continued drying off well thanks for trying to save my life anyway she said shaking her head at him she looked over at malfoy who was laughing so hard that no sound came out oh shut up malfoy special note march 6 2006 this story is currently undergoing massive editing i have taken down most of its chapters to do this i will be putting them back up slowly but surely thank you to all reviewers and sorry to all those who were upset by my tearing down of the story i tried to e mail everyone who sent me a pm e mail or confused review but i dontthink i succeeded again i very sorry hopefully the story has improved however anyone who has read it before will probably not need to reread it the basic plot remains the same chapter one it starts hermione granger was having a very strange dream for some reason she had broken up with ron and was lying in bed with oliver wood and neither of them was wearing anything above the waist she placed her arm across his chest and put her leg around both of his smiling as she nestled closer her head resting on one of his arms both of which were above him with the fingers laced together beneath his head snape meanwhile was coming out of his dreams and slowly entering a lighter stage of sleep as consciousness came closer he felt what was unmistakably a girl curling around him instinctively he put his arm around her but her hair was tickling his arm pulling him from oblivion faster oliver he heard a voice utter and his eyes flew open with a start he was at first angrily wondering why his girlfriend was calling him oliver it took him a moment to regain his senses and realize that he hadnthad a girlfriend for quite some time at which point he looked down at the girl cradled in his arms and screamed hermione eyes flew open at the terrified yell she was not half clothed in oliver arms after a quidditch game she was fully naked and cuddling her least favorite professor aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh she screamed in his face aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh snape agreed what are you doing here hermione shrieked clutching the comforter around herself what are you doing here he bellowed back she belatedly realized three things one she couldntremember a thing about the previous night past leaving dinner early two she was in snape private chambers a place she didnteven know how to get to and three he was fully naked as well the same terrible thought seemed to strike the both of them at the same time they stared at each other for a full minute with similar horrified expressions snape broke the silence no he muttered i wasntdrinking last night he climbed off the four poster bed while clutching his sheet around his waist and dashed over to a cabinet in the corner looking wild and panicky hermione glimpsed dozens of bottles of alcohol mostly liquor like vodka and gin before looking away from the cupboard as he mumbled to himself taking stock of each individual bottle as though they were ingredients for potions this is a nightmare a really bad one hermione chanted trying to convince herself worse than when i dreamed voldemort murdered harry and the weasleys and my parents worse than when i dreamed i married malfoy you dreamed what snape exclaimed in spite of himself but hermione wasntlistening she pinched herself hard and yelped oh shit watch your m oh gods i know i didntdrink all this no wait with minerva before term started shit i only had pumpkin juice damn it i haven t pumpkin juice hermione yelled suddenly making snape jump and almost drop the large nearly empty bottle of wine pumpkin juice malfoy yes that it of course what are you babbling about snape snarled annoyed at having found his liquor cabinet as full of alcohol as it had been yesterday professor malfoy did this what malfoy knocked over my goblet at dinner and after i drank it i felt really sleepy and then he went and talked to you and i felt extremely exhausted and retired earlier than i have in years snape slapped his forehead realization dawning he put a sleeping potion in our drink and then somehow got us both here the prank war that little i going to get him i dontcare if i lose head girl status and i dontcare if i get the whole of gryffindor expelled snape wand lay on the bedside table and she grabbed it looking as though she was ready to storm off to the slytherin dormitory and curse malfoy into next tuesday immediately accio robes she shouted no robes came flying at her accio robes she fairly screamed looking panicked accio clothes accio robes damn it accio pants accio robe accio anything a book flew at her and hit her between the eyes anything but that she groaned rubbing her head snape stared at her for a second mortified then he dove for his wand and snatched it from her accio he began but hermione stopped him it no good professor malfoy stranded me here and took my robes and wand so it wouldntbe easy to get back to the common room well you cantgo wandering around in my blankets snape said listlessly the shock was getting to be a little too much what would albus or minerva say if they found a naked gryffindor head girl in his chambers even if he convinced them that it was a slytherin prank he d never live it down minerva would have a field day with this one tequila he muttered and headed back to his cabinet tying the sheet around his waist securely as he went i know i have a bottle of tequila in here wait just transfigure something into a robe and then i can wear it back to the common room hermione said triumphantly good idea save i canttransfigure worth a damn like flitwick cantbrew a complex potion to save his life and vector doesntknow a thing about herbology where my shot glass unable to find it he gave up and took a huge swig from the bottle then gagged a little couldnti just wear one of your robes hermione asked in a small voice i suppose you could if i wanted to get fired and you wanted the whole of hogwarts to see you in a professor clothing with a head of house badge that says slytherin on it snape replied conversationally he held the bottle out to her tequila you should get drunk before classes it makes you much more civil hermione muttered irritably she felt trapped and restless and she certainly didntlike the fact that she was sitting in her least favorite professor bed with only a comforter for cover but she didntnecessarily want to stand up and walk around his bedroom wearing a blanket either and as if things werentsurreal enough snape was simply standing there chugging down a bottle of rather strong tequila like a wino getting drunk as fast as his gag reflex would allow annoyed she climbed off the bed and carefully wrapped the comforter around her one never got the best results with another wizard wand and she sucked at transfiguration with harry or ginny wand so she definitely wasntgoing to be able to do much with snape wand accustomed as she was to her own hoping malfoy hadntdamaged her wand and that she would find it soon she gathered up her courage and marched over to snape wardrobe harry ron have you seen hermione ginny called worriedly as she came into the gryffindor common room few people were left in the dormitories the majority of the older students had gone to hogsmeade for the day and most the younger were having fun wandering around the castle or enjoying the early autumn weather outside but harry and ron were sitting at a table engaged in a game of wizard chess as they waited for hermione to show up before they left for hogsmeade no why harry asked wincing as ron bishop pummeled his knight she not in her room and parvati said she wasntin the dorms when they came back from dinner ron frowned she must ve missed her hermione was really tired last night remember yeah but her clothes and wand are on her bed and she gone she was supposed to meet lavender two hours ago to study potions but she never showed lavender and parvati are already starting rumors you dontthink something happened to her do you nah harry said trying to sound convincing though he knew perfectly well that hermione like the rest of them never left her bed without her wand even now that voldemort was gone hermione not exactly easy to get the drop on maybe not if she had her wand no ginny argued she sighed and collapsed in an armchair i cantthink of where she d be nowhere parvati and lavender have dreamed up but still what are they saying ron demanded oh the usual bull ginny said in disgust their best story is that she cheating on you and the whole sleepy thing at dinner was a lie so she could sneak off to some guy room or something harry rolled his eyes they ve been coming up with those stupid stories ever since that time everyone swore she was with fred remember that ginny giggled yeah who doesn t fred had once found hermione asleep on her books in the common room and carried her up to her bed lavender and parvati had woken up before he left and next morning told everyone that fred and hermione were sleeping together fred ever one for a good laugh told everyone it was true lavender and parvati were quite disappointed when they d realized they d been wrong all along and blamed hermione for it they were always started some odd rumor or another about harry ron and hermione ginny frowned but still with the prank war what if something happened to her dontworry i sure harry stopped as the portrait hole swung open and hermione stumbled in it took her a moment to get back to her feet she was swaying unsteadily and was wearing robes several sizes too big making movement difficult i ve got a great idea for the prank war hermione slurred then hiccupped we ll all practice doing the unforgivable curses and then use them to kill the slytherins sound good the three of them blinked um are you okay ginny asked concerned i fine hermione said waving her arm dismissively then she promptly toppled over harry ron and ginny ran over and crowded around her as she giggled hysterically her eyes were a bit glazed and her friends could detect the strong smell of vodka she drunk ron said in disbelief trashed i tell you hermione granger head girl of hogwarts is trashed after the night i had i deserve to be hermione said defensively pouting what happened ginny asked as harry and ron hauled hermione over to the couch before she could answer harry said um hermione what are you wearing he d noticed the head of house crest on the robes which was much like mcgonagall or sprout s only this one said slytherin instead of gryffindor or hufflepuff snape robe hermione said as their eyes widened in disbelief she chuckled and quickly told them the whole story her humor fading after about the third sentence and then she finished snape let me borrow this thing which is gross enough without the fact that i donthave any underwear and by that time he was so smashed he let me fix myself a few glasses of vodka and butterbeer how many is a few harry asked suspiciously hermione began counting on her fingers when she reached ten she stopped presented her hands with all her fingers spread and said three of course not more than three hermione ron exclaimed in exasperation give her a break she woke up naked next to snape ginny said shuddering and i thought the chamber of secrets was bad hermione nodded though he not bad to talk to when he drunk did you know that we discussed the theory on a few potions but neither of us could remember the exact potions very well only hermione could find herself sleeping nude next to a naked snape and somehow start talking about homework ron muttered and then he told me about how he had a crush on harry mother when they were at hogwarts and that why he turned spy because the potters got dead ew harry exclaimed he liked my mother hermione nodded but that okay because we have to kill all the slytherins so i suppose we have to kill snape and that means you wontever have to think about it again and i can burn his robe when he dead even if it was awfully nice of him to lend it to me hmm snape a bit of a pod person when drunk you re not making sense herm ginny said gently c mon let go fix you up and get you out of sight before someone else sees wait get her stuff and take her to our dormitory harry said if seamus dean or neville come in they ll keep it quiet none of the girls will true ginny agreed and they set about getting hermione to the boys room to wait until she sobered up what are we going to do ron asked as he and harry staggered up the stairs each with one of hermione arms around their shoulders while ginny followed with hermione clothes and wand about what harry said the slytherins duh ginny said rolling her eyes i dontknow but whatever it is it gonna be big harry replied narrowing his eyes and probably illegal hermione added dramatically and hiccupped again she pointed her finger like a wand muttering avada kebavra avada cadabra chapter nineteen the weasley alliance ron was lying on his bed staring angrily up at the ceiling after all this time hermione had betrayed him he d been dating her for about seven months now and he d been her friend for over six years and yet she d been keeping secrets and she d actually done done something with snape snape the greasy git how could she ron heard the door opening and closing but he didntbother calling out a hello he just prayed it wasntharry or ginny trying to talk to him again he wanted to strangle them both that they d been in on it was almost as bad as hermione doing it they were supposed to be a team harry ron and hermione but no hey ron you in here we want to talk to you fred ron asked surprised what do you want to talk to you pay attention already george said pulling back the hangings around ron bed about what ron said viciously annoyed he wasntabout to just grit his teeth and forgive his friends for this one ginny had known before him for crying out loud well fred said slowly we figure we can help you you know get revenge ron stopped swallowing an angry rant about how he wasntapologizing for being kept out of the loop he had assumed the twins either wouldntget involved or would take harry ginny and hermione side they were closer to ginny than to ron why ron asked suspiciously as the twins sat down on his bed well fred said slowly we er feel sort of bad about pig and all and it was really rude of hermione to hit us with mashed potatoes george added brushing at some white gunk stuck to his forehead mione hit you with mashed potatoes ron repeated bewildered oh that right you left the hall dontworry we ll send you loads of pictures fred assured him yeah as soon as fred finished making a collage to wallpaper his room with ow hey that wasntvery nice george rubbed his arm where fred had punched it isntthat colin camera ron asked looking at the camera around george neck yeah we re borrowing it with permission for a change why um you kind of missed the fight of the century really fred said getting back to the point though we figure it time we trained you to follow in our footsteps meaning ron asked nervously the prank war ron how thick can you be fred exclaimed throwing up his hands in exasperation when was the last time you guys pulled a decent prank eh well now that you re angry with harry and hermione and ginny it time for you to strike out on your own little brother what have you two got against harry hermione and ginny ron wanted to know confused come on ron all those times we tortured you just for the hell of it and you think we ve got something against them george said shaking his head sadly he looked at his twin you were right fred we ve neglected the kid teachings for too long poor ron fred said with a heavy sigh listen ronniekins it not about what you ve got against them it about fun although hermione never did sleep with me in the library like she asked me to come to think of it fred been really disappointed about that george agreed ignoring ron glare yeah fred said with another sigh and a faked sniffle anyway lesson number one everyone is fair game your friends your family your professors everyone lesson number two george said dontget caught which bring us to lesson number three fred continued plan carefully lesson number four always have alibis backup plans and escape routes ready lesson number five i get the point guys ron interrupted do you have an idea or not no you have an idea we re here to give you motivation and support fred told him as though this should be obvious that what brothers do what do you mean i have an idea i dont have an idea i haventeven been thinking about it oh but you do have an idea little brother george said mischievously you have a thousand ideas you ve had them for ages things from us things from sirius and remus things you ve managed to think up all by yourself ron eyes widened he did have ideas ways to get back at his best friend and his girlfriend and his sister not to mention at malfoy none of them would suspect him either not for a while at least and then finally ron could prove he was just as good as any of them ron grinned oh this is gonna be fun ginny was on her way to gryffindor tower hoping that no one had gotten caught and that harry head injury wasnttoo bad when one foot landed in a puddle of water and the other landed on a pork chop found them ginny muttered she crept carefully closer to the prefects bathroom trying not to slip it looked like the sort of mess moaning myrtle would create she could hear laughter and harry and hermione talking she pressed her ear to the door to listen oh shut up malfoy hermione was saying irritably as malfoy laughter faded to choked gasps get out of the tub will you i want to get out of here ginny smiled wondering just what had happened and knocked on the door it me guys she called and then said the password to open the door she stared around at them the scene was even stranger than when ginny had walked into hermione room to find harry straddling hermione and draco lying next to them hermione was toweling off her hair and wearing oliver robe which was enormous on her draco who was obviously quite naked was clutching the side of the tub his face bright red with silent laughter harry was fully clothed save for his shoes and was dripping with water his glasses slightly askew oliver was simply standing by looking tired and amused ginny shot a questioning look at hermione who sighed i ll tell you later gin she said how did it go with the teachers they re only just leaving the dungeons ginny reported proudly took the lot of them a good deal of time to figure out what i d done to myself we need to get back to the dormitory though they ll be heading up here soon and i dontthink you want to have to explain this mess at least to them anyway otherwise it ll make a great story what happened with malfoy someone hit him with a cheering charm if only that had been the case hermione said dryly come on malfoy we ve got to get moving we re going to get caught it took them a good long time to get draco going by the time he was out of the tub hermione had thrown on the mismatched clothes dobby had brought and ginny had fixed her hair just as draco was starting to get dry they heard a loud meow in the hallway outside uh oh ginny said worriedly and opened the hallway to reveal mrs norris who gave ginny the most evil look a cat could give and whisked off it mrs norris she going for filch run oliver hissed shrugging his now slightly damp robes back on you guys go i ll make something up thanks the three gryffindors called as they dashed towards gryffindor tower draco in tow so you apologized to ginny seamus was saying to dean as the two of them sat in the common room with lavender and parvati seamus and dean were playing chess in an attempt to drown out the incessant gossip the girls were indulging in yeah dean said glumly she wonttake me back but i dontthink i ll have to worry about one of her friends or her brothers trying to kill me in my sleep seamus chuckled move on mate there are plenty of other fish in the sea there had better not be for you lavender seamus girlfriend cut in there aren t seamus said quickly you re so whipped dean said rolling his eyes am not seamus retorted are too well at least i not still mooning over some sixth year i broke up with over a year ago seamus shot back hey you try dating her for a few months and then talk to me about how hard she is to get over dean said sadly ginny is dean stopped hurriedly staring at the portrait hole seamus looked over to see ginny climbing through it holding an armful of clothing come on you guys ginny whispered motioning for someone to follow her into the room before the whole common room staring seamus immediately nudged lavender to get her attention and the four gryffindors turned to watch with interest several other people were looking at ginny curiously after a few moments harry climbed through the hole behind ginny thoroughly soaked and aiming a wand at his hair to blow it dry half of his hair was sticking up much more than usual as a result while the rest lay flat on his head behind harry came hermione dressed as if her closet had exploded on her she was wearing a bright red swimsuit under a pair of jeans and an open purple blouse on one foot was a dark green sock and on the other was an orange one with little black cats on it both socks clashed horribly with her pink high heels if hermione was dressed strangely however it was nothing compared to what draco malfoy was wearing a gryffindor scarlet bath towel only a gryffindor scarlet bath towel everyone in the common room started laughing draco shot an annoyed glare around the common room and clutched the towel tighter around his waist harry grinned hey malfoy what was that password again i cantremem love and bunnies draco shouted angrily at the wall which quickly opened dean seamus lavender and parvati watched as the strange in more ways than one group disappeared behind the wall to the guest quarters oh man parvati gasped through her laughter clutching her sides we have got to figure out just what is going on with them i can explain oliver thought to himself trying to come up with a good reason why the fourth floor was flooded as he stood outside the prefects bathroom one hand holding up his robes and the other holding his shoes and socks no i can explain sounds like i the one who did it damn what do i say i didntsee who did it no my robes are damp and my shoes aren t they ll figure that out should i blame it on a slytherin no they ve all been shut in the dungeons his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of mcgonagall voice which floated up to him from the third floor you re sure they re still in the bathroom macmillan she barked they were when i went to get you i could hear voices but i couldnttell who it was answered ernie macmillan oliver groaned macmillan had become a total dictator since making prefect never mind head boy i appreciate your coming to get me macmillan mcgonagall said her tone icy maybe stricter punishments will put an end to all this prank war nonsense oliver grimaced if there was one person he didntwant to have to deal with it was mcgonagall she had no patience for rule breaking and she would know instantly that oliver was covering up for harry in other words oliver was about to die for the fourth time in two days oliver turned tail and ran draco immediately seized his clean clothes from ginny and stomped into the bathroom they moment they entered while ginny and hermione argued over which clothes hermione should change into hermione standing outside the bathroom door when hermione was finally dressed in something normal looking ginny went to go grab some dry clothes for harry then decided to haul his entire trunk down to the guest room mad as ron was at them all strangest thing ginny said frowning as harry sorted through his trunk fred and george are talking to ron and they all seemed really cheerful but ron still glared at me when he saw me hmm hermione said filing that information away for later busy as she was with looking up a spell to clean the shoes she d been wearing during the food fight when draco emerged from the bathroom everyone avoiding speaking to him or looking at him which was fine by him he sat down on his bed harry hermione and ginny sat on hers and each side took to ignoring the other harry hermione and ginny spent some time looking up decent curses and wards to place on harry and hermione trunks which made draco roll his eyes as he really didntgive a damn about their belongings i sure ron will come around they kept assuring each other and fell into a light easy conversation nearly forgetting draco presence finally however draco stood up reminding them all of his existence it dinnertime he said coldly let go i not going to dinner hermione told him i skipping my meals for the next few months thank you very much my mum down there or i wouldntbe going draco snapped i ve got to go see her i dontcare who down there i come on guys let not argue harry said wearily i ve had enough of theatrics for one day why dontwe go down there and one of us can ask malfoy mum to come out to the entrance hall and they can talk and hug and whatever and then we ll go down to the kitchens for dinner all right are you compromising with malfoy hermione demanded in shock hermione harry said raising an eyebrow at her in the past two days i ve been petrified for half the night i ve flown on malfoy airlines i ve had ron get pissed at me twice i nearly got killed by you and a coconut i might add and most recently i tried to rescue you from drowning only to have to walk into the common room with malfoy while he wrapped in a towel i not having one more problem today understand i canttake it and considering i ve had a better weekend than you i hope you can agree hermione bit her lip and turned to look at draco who shrugged fine hermione grumbled ginny was given the task of entering the great hall for them and reemerged soon after with narcissa malfoy what all the fuss about draco narcissa asked confused oh i didntfeel like going in the hall draco said i ah mrs malfoy called a new voice and they all turned to see dumbledore coming through the front doors how are you fine albus and yourself she said pleasantly good good it is a relief to see another death eater captured he said mulciber is now serving a life sentence in azkaban once more a relief indeed narcissa exclaimed oh i so glad that horrible man is no longer free you are harry said frowning of course i am arentyou narcissa said looking startled she shook her head and turned back to dumbledore albus while we re all here i wanted to discuss the matter of this chain if you please of course dumbledore said why dontyou all accompany to my office rather nervous about the coming talk in other words they were worried about how badly draco mother the widow of voldemort right hand man and a woman who still had a lot of connections in the ministry was going to pitch a fit harry ginny and hermione followed dumbledore up to the headmaster office where they sat down in comfortable conjured chintz armchairs i glad you got all that mess off draco narcissa said as they took their chairs i was quite worried that mustard would stain all four students shot dumbledore a worried look hoping he wouldntcomment or punish them for their actions dumbledore simply gave them a knowing smile choosing not to comment first of all dumbledore said the research into this matter is going splendid we hope to have a solution soon but i do not believe it will be before the christmas holidays professor hermione said tentatively i i promised my parents i would make it home for christmas this year i haventseen them for christmas since my first year and my entire family meeting at my grandparents home this year on christmas day all of my cousins and aunts and uncles and i planned to spend christmas eve with the um in london she amended hastily not wanting to mention the order in front of the malfoys hey what about my christmas draco said angrily i ve been planning to spend it with mum hermione bit her lip not wanting to argue in front of the headmaster and narcissa er she said turning to dumbledore what do you think professor well dumbledore said slowly what time is your family gathering miss granger we ve agreed to meet at eleven and we ll probably stay until late afternoon in that case dumbledore said why donti talk to the order and see if we cantreschedule our celebration for christmas day in the evening mr malfoy can accompany you to both get togethers and you can accompany him to malfoy manor on christmas eve hermione stared at him in horror t take him to my family for christmas she spluttered but but they re muggles professor well if you d rather call the whole thing off draco began with a smirk i believe mr malfoy has taken muggle studies dumbledore said his eyes twinkling would that suit you narcissa he added turning to her she nodded we can make arrangements yes she said wait how will i get there hermione asked i mean i canttake the knight bus to my grandparents house i was going to take the bus home from london and then my parents and i were going to ride together dumbledore thought for a moment i sure we can find a solution to the transportation problem he said it may take some time however professor ginny spoke up what about the rest of the holidays where will they spend the remaining time i ll let mr malfoy and miss granger work that out dumbledore said though i strongly recommend spending that time either with the order or at hogwarts tell me your decision by the end of the week i should have a solution to the transportation problem by then now i believe the only item left to discuss is your detention harry detention for what harry said blankly for flying malfoy airlines hermione said giving him a significant look that young man stole draco broomstick narcissa said in shock no no mum draco said biting his lip he knew his mother well enough to know that if she knew harry had blown up draco head she d want all the details as to why dontworry about it it just an expression dumbledore smiled usually i would have asked mr filch to assign you a detention harry but as severus fell behind in the production of pepper up potion we ll have to wait until mr filch is feeling a tad better severus has agreed to oversee your detention harry and we ve set it for thursday okay then harry said er i really sorry about that professor one cannot always control one emotions dumbledore reminded him with another smile got that right harry ginny hermione and draco muttered in unison dumbledore chuckled i trust you are all using this opportunity to work out your differences it didnttake a genius to see that all four students were desperately trying not to laugh er we re trying professor harry lied right dumbledore said well if there is nothing more to discuss i have a lot of work to do thank you for your time albus narcissa said standing up harry hermione and ginny turned to follow draco and narcissa from the room but draco stopped halfway to the door professor draco said slowly i heard it was nymphadora tonks who captured mulciber and is is she all right she is fine dumbledore assured him she is in fact receiving a promotion as this is the fifth death eater she has brought to justice thanks draco said his expression unreadable harry and hermione exchanged glances wondering just what his interest in tonks was they doubted it was anything very wholesome tonks was the one who had killed lucius malfoy harry and hermione looked at ginny who nodded the three of them all made mental notes to talk about it as soon as they could get some time without draco around they went back down to dinner narcissa and draco said their goodbyes in the entrance hall and harry hermione ginny and draco detoured down to the kitchens once they were certain narcissa was gone the moment narcissa was out of earshot hermione exploded i cantbelieve i have to take him to meet my family they ll be all all weird and malfoy ha he ll get some good home cooking this time one wrong move and it grandpa old shotgun for him hermione you re not making sense ginny said gently sure she is harry said she just said she doesntwant to take malfoy anywhere and her family going to think it odd she bringing a guy home for christmas especially when she probably told some of them she hates said guy and then she said that if he does anything she ll throw her grandmother cooking at him before killing him in the messy muggle way oh okay ginny said grinning as long as she has a plan chapter twenty questions hermione harry said pausing outside the kitchen entrance i want to talk to ginny for a moment will you be all right hermione smiled i can handle malfoy for a few minutes harry dontworry are you sure ginny said with a mischievous grin there a lot of food in the kitchens you know oh ha ha hermione said rolling her eyes just hurry up okay she leaned forward and tickled the pear to gain entrance to the kitchens draco having never been down to the kitchens before watched with interest before following her inside so what do you want to talk to me about ginny asked suddenly nervous she doubted harry was going to compliment her hair or ask her for her opinions on house elf rights harry leaned against the kitchen doorway regarding her with an expression that told her he wasntgoing to let her get away from him without answering talk gin harry said now um about what you know about what harry said severely you and hermione are close she tells you a lot of things that she doesnttell me and ron the girl stuff well there are some things that just arentmeant to be shared with your guy friends ginny said swallowing i think it time you shared a few of hermione things with this particular guy friend he said narrowing his eyes like what up with her and wood for instance or why you both neglected to tell me about snape harry i not going to betray hermione confidence ginny said her secrets are hers and i d no sooner tell them than mine not even to you she was going to tell me anyway before er i accidentally blew up malfoy harry replied which she might not have done if you hadntcornered her between you and the lake ginny retorted having heard the whole story that morning while hermione was getting dressed and while draco was showering after harry ron and oliver had left the bathroom hermione had however said she planned to tell harry as soon as she found the right words ginny knew that hermione would be more grateful than angry if ginny handled the telling for her she would have told me sooner or later regardless harry argued you know she would have ginny bit her lip and sighed knowing that if anything hermione would be grateful that ginny had saved hermione the embarrassment all right harry if you must know are you sure you want to you might not want to honest gin the word honest is becoming rather taboo dontyou agree tell me start with the quidditch world cup i cantrecall hermione ever being alone with wood there ginny took a deep breath well she was twice when she left the line at the water tap she bumped into him and they chatted for a while then the night after the cup she couldntsleep and went wandering around you re joking ginny shook her head was she insane going out alone with all those death eaters on the loose she said she was so worried and upset that she just had to get out of the tent she figured the death eaters were so shook up and the ministry was so watchful afterwards that she d be okay she thought the death eaters would be lying low and she was right then well while she was out she ran into oliver who was walking around himself the two of them hung out together and to make a long story short oliver walked her back to the tent and they ended up kissing a lot so hermione showed him her tattoo right on the path in front of the tent oh dontbe stupid ginny exclaimed of course she didn t besides she didnteven have the tattoo then she got it last summer remember then how did he see it harry asked impatiently well ginny said slowly trying to figure out how much to say do you remember how we told you oliver joined the order before you first came to grimmauld place harry nodded in the talks he d had with fred george ron hermione and ginny about the order during the summer before his fifth year he d learned that several people he knew had become members of the order oliver being one of them oliver father was in the department of magical law enforcement and oliver had several family members who had been lost to voldemort so he d immediately sought out dumbledore to see if the rumors were true when dumbledore had confirmed them he d offered oliver the chance to become a member of the order of the phoenix and oliver had readily accepted back when oliver first joined he spent some time at grimmauld place learning attending meetings that sort of thing then puddlemere training season started up and he didnthave as much time but well when he was hanging around grimmauld place he and hermione well they spent a little time alone ginny stifled a giggle at the look on harry face and went on apparently just about every time oliver dropped by grimmauld place for the holidays during the two years you know who was around he and hermione hung out but but she got together with ron this past summer how she didn t she didntcheat on ron no after the war hermione told oliver that she was spending some time with her family and muggle friends and oliver occasionally went out with her and her friends to parties and whatnot he didntdo it often as he was a pureblood and it was hard to keep his story straight around all the muggles but i know he did it sometimes as for how he saw the tattoo i dontknow he could have been there when she got the tattoo given that they were hanging out they hung out a lot right up until she joined us at headquarters for your birthday he might have never seen it actually she might have just told him so wait when she got with ron she was cheating on oliver she was never dating oliver not exactly they they liked each other and then dated but they werenta couple hermione didntwant to date during the war and with her at school and him off playing professional quidditch it just wasntpractical and you know how hermione is with impracticality she got together with ron a few weeks before term quite a while after the last time she d seen oliver and then told oliver about ron once she found out he would be teaching this year her face softened poor oliver i think he thought teaching here would bring them closer i think oliver still likes her really but between her having a boyfriend and oliver being a professor they ve mostly just had awkward conversations harry was having trouble letting it all sink in so let me get this straight you mean they ve been sleeping together since before fourth year without even dating no ginny said in exasperation come on harry hermione wasnteven fifteen then you honestly think she d shag oliver when she was fourteen i never thought she d do a thing with oliver really harry said bluntly oh come on she a girl not a nun ginny snapped i mean surely you saw her snogging viktor once or twice no i didn t harry interrupted frowning hermione had always struck him as the don t touch me unless we re married or you don t want to use your hands ever again type ginny snorted you really are na ve you know that why d you think he invited her to stay at his house in bulgaria which he lives in all by himself by the way so he d have someone to play quidditch with harry jaw dropped are you serious yes harry ginny said rolling her eyes come on mr i ve never felt this way before asked her to stay over at his house in a different country which usually implies more than a day trip i dontknow what his intentions were but i doubt they were very innocent but hermione considered going yep but but pull your head out of your arse harry ginny said with a sigh viktor was famous rich sweet smart a good dancer and pretty good looking hermione herself said he wasntthat good looking yeah well she said that good looking which means he at least mildly good looking to her and girls dontalways mean what they say when they re talking about guys harry especially when they re talking to other guys one of your best friends is a girl how can you not know that how long have you been hanging around hermione now hermione not a real girl she a a a hermione ginny slapped her forehead anyway harry can we get back on subject i hungry harry pursed his lips and nodded i honestly dontknow if they slept together but if they did i doubt it was back at the world cup they might have eventually slept together mind you but i never asked hermione much about it i dontknow and it her business not ours like i said though i donteven know if he actually seen her tattoo he seen it harry said with certainty they were acting weird around each other all year i never thought much of it but looking back it kind of clicks i mean she never spoke much around him he always looked at her kind of funny i dismissed it then but now well it not really your business harry ginny said quietly i mean who she slept with what she done with this guy or that that not something she obligated to share maybe maybe not harry replied stubbornly but how would you feel if your best friend had been having some secret relationship for over two years without telling you ginny sighed i see your point harry anyway can we go get something to eat now not yet what happened between her and snape oh for crying out loud harry she was just messing with malfoy head ginny exclaimed throwing up her hands it was nothing she been so determined to win this war and you know what she like how hard she ll work for something she let snape put hickeys on her just to get back at malfoy harry said disbelievingly harry ginny said slowly are you aware of just how badly she would be in trouble if it ever came out that hermione blackmailed rita skeeter to keep her from writing damaging articles blackmail is illegal no matter how small or righteous it is and when you know someone committed a crime you re obligated by law to turn them in or you ve committed a crime yourself yet hermione doesntcare because a she doesntthink she ll get caught and b she despises skeeter so badly that the risk of having to share a cell in azkaban with her is worth it she blackmailed skeeter twice now once to write that interview and once to not write for a year two counts of blackmail and the gods only know how many charges could be brought against her for not turning in an unregistered animagus i dontknow if she can still be charged so long after she committed the crime but listen my point is snape was nothing more than an intricate revenge plot and a helping hand in getting ideas for pranks i know it seems rather farfetched but the idea that there was any other reason is even more preposterous it about the prank war nothing more she just didnttell you and ron everything because she figured you guys would freak and she was right wasntshe we still would have taken it better from hermione as opposed to malfoy well i sure she would have told you if she could have predicted that she d have malfoy attached to her arm in the near future ginny said rolling her eyes look hermione been going through a lot cantyou let it go she doesntneed this right now not from ron and especially not from you harry nodded briskly fine let get in there and make sure they re not having another row when harry and ginny entered the kitchen however they were rather surprised to see that not only were hermione and draco not fighting but draco was sitting at a table next to dobby chatting with him like they were old friends what going on harry whispered to hermione as draco ignored him dobby had yet to notice their arrival i dontknow they re being so nice to each other hermione whispered back they were the same way in the bathroom i dontknow why malfoy being nice to a house elf to his former house elf ginny hissed later when i get a chance i ll talk to dobby and see what it all about harry said and the three of them dropped the discussion and dug into the small feast laid out on the table between hermione and draco monday morning dawned bright and early and harry hermione and draco got up and dressed all of them nervous and quiet draco wasnteven bothering to make snide remarks they would have to go to classes today and none of them were looking forward to it between the rumors already flying around the school and the way hermione and draco had been spending their time together being with other students didntseem like a good idea what classes have you got today harry asked hermione as the three of them left the room early hoping to get down to breakfast eat and get out before the hall got too busy potions charms and then transfiguration hermione told him hey guys ginny called when they reached to common room i was just coming to see you gonna brave the great hall today yeah harry said neville told us last night that filch is over his cold and we dontwant him to find out that we know where the kitchens are so we re going to breakfast early too early draco muttered following them out the portrait hole so are you two ready for exams hermione asked harry and ginny harry gave a nervous sort of nod and ginny shrugged i ll have to take the transfiguration test today but i think i prepared do you guys want to study together tonight or do you have quidditch practice no slytherin booked the field uh oh the four of them stopped walking draco smacked his forehead i cantbelieve i forgot about quidditch practice tonight draco moaned well you can miss it harry said coldly it not like you re going to win the cup you beat us by fifty points potter draco snapped all we have to do is flatten hufflepuff and then you ll never get past hufflepuff now that they ve got macmillan for captain and hey the only team that ever lost to hufflepuff is gryffindor potter oh please at least i was still the better seeker you cantwin when you re trying will you stop arguing hermione demanded cutting malfoy off there nothing anyone can do about quidditch practice there no way you ll be able to go malfoy it not like i going to get on a broom and fly next to you yeah we ll see about that draco snarled and he marched off towards the great hall dragging hermione with him by the chain the great hall was mercifully rather empty when they reached it though the teachers were already there draco stalked right past the gryffindor table and marched up to the staff harry and ginny hanging back professor he called to dumbledore interrupting dumbledore conversation with flitwick i have quidditch practice tonight and i really need to make it is there anything i can do dumbledore smiled why dontyou take miss granger with you mr malfoy me fly with him during slytherin practice hermione said shrilly i realize that could be a tad dangerous dumbledore said slowly you are not very accustomed to flying are you no said hermione who hated flying and only did it when absolutely necessary well then i will ask one of the staff to oversee the practice dumbledore told her to make sure there are no mishaps but but but draco smirked at hermione stammering thank you professor he said already plotting ways to make the night miserable for her he glanced up and down the table for madam hooch but didntsee her her chair which was between sprout and oliver s was empty and draco vaguely remembered hearing that she d caught filch cold er is madam hooch around we ll need to borrow a school broom for granger oh that wouldntbe safe at all dumbledore said still smiling at them it is far too difficult to fly right next to someone especially when one is an inexperienced flyer and there are bludgers flying about miss granger will have to share your broom what both students exclaimed it will be much safer that way i believe dumbledore continued hermione and draco returned to the gryffindor table hermione angrily sitting down between harry and ginny draco flopping down across from her annoyed just when he thought something was going his way he was told he d have to share a broom with granger what was that all about harry asked hermione i supposed to fly with malfoy hermione raged smacking her butter knife down so hard on her toast that bits of jam splattered across the table dumbledore expects me to go to quidditch practice with malfoy we ll come too harry said sympathetically ginny nodded no you won t potter draco snapped you cantstop me seven slytherin quidditch players say otherwise hermione sighed tired of all of the malfoy induced fighting dontworry about it harry dumbledore sending one of the teachers to keep an eye out she said reluctantly harry frowned not wanting to point out all the reasons he should be there all of which involved scenarios that would make hermione feel even more terrified it okay harry honest hermione said more firmly study for your exams fine harry said sulkily ginny looked just as unhappy about it they ate quickly but the hall was starting to fill and they were nowhere near done with breakfast just when hermione was about to suggest they go down to potions early someone cleared their throat hermione looked up to see two very ugly pink clad girls standing behind draco malfoy said of one of the girls the taller one whose hair was up in two ponytails she was wearing a low cut frilly pink dress and like her companion she was enormous an even mix of muscle and fat hermione stared at her for a moment before turning to look at the shorter girl the second girl had on a short pink miniskirt which revealed a pair of large hairy legs and a white t shirt with rainbow letters displaying the caption proud to be a lesbian draco turned and stared at the girls in surprise for a moment wondering why they were talking to him before recognition finally dawned on him crabbe he gasped at the girl in the miniskirt he looked at the other goyle we cantget our hands unglued said crabbe in his thick voice as harry hermione and ginny burst out laughing crabbe held up his hand which was clasped firmly with goyle s who did this to you draco asked laughing a little as he pulled out his wand didntget a good look goyle said we were busy talking to longbottom there were two of them though and they had red hair guess fred and george haventleft yet then harry choked out tears streaming down his face from laughing so hard damn it guys what did i tell you avoid the gryffindors draco said angrily shaking his head we were just having a bit of fun goyle insisted draco rolled his eyes and tapped their joined hands with his wand crabbe and goyle pulled their fingers away and rubbed at their wrists be more careful will you you might get stuck together permanently draco said glaring down at his own wrist where the invisible cuff linked him to hermione or worse can you fix our clothes crabbe asked plaintively i donthave time for that draco said coldly go change are you coming back soon goyle whined draco shrugged i hope so go on and change dontforget about practice tonight crabbe and goyle hurried from the hall laughs sounded from everyone they passed oh that was priceless hermione said clutching her sides annoying as the twins can be you cantdeny they re funny ginny gasped harry hermione and draco were the first three students to make it to potions that morning having left the great hall as fast as possible they went straight into the classroom selecting a table in the far back corner where they would hopefully be less noticeable the slytherins filed in first automatically sitting far from harry and hermione most of them not noticing draco who was slumped down in his chair mostly hidden by the table and his cauldron lavender and parvati were next whispering and smirking at harry and hermione before choosing the table in front of them all right hermione lavender said grand hermione said dryly so parvati said in a tone that made it clear hermione was probably going desperately want to smack her for whatever she was about to say tell us hermione parvati lavender called dean who d just entered with seamus and neville did you hear what happened to crabbe and goyle no tell lavender exclaimed while neville sat with harry dean and seamus sat down in front of parvati and lavender and began to eagerly fill them in on the weasley twins recent prank hermione was so relieved that dean had turned away parvati and lavender attention that she instantly forgave him for the duel and its side effects as the four gryffindors laughed about crabbe and goyle hermione grew nervous if class didntstart soon they would run out of things to criticize even if there was a lot to criticize regarding crabbe and goyle and would turn back to interrogating hermione she checked her watch and was startled to realize that it was already five minutes past the start of class where snape she blurted out he late why are you complaining harry asked i not it just weird how many times has snape been late for class well never harry admitted dontyou think it kind of weird hermione said he was missing all weekend too neville piped up from harry other side it was all over school madam hooch was especially upset because he was supposed to brew pepper up potion for madam pomfrey and now they donthave any and madam hooch caught a killer cold off of filch harry frowned think it could have been business he asked hermione though voldemort was dead the order still had plenty of work to do assisting in the capture of death eaters and the protection of people like harry ron and hermione who were still at risk from fugitive death eaters who d escaped both death and the ministry after the final battle it was harry and hermione theory that the order was never truly dormant in the fight against the dark arts hermione shook her head remembering what oliver had said about the teachers confusion over snape weekend disappearance mcgonagall was looking for him too remember most of the teachers would know if that what it was harry shrugged it probably nothing really granger just missing her little pal draco said snidely hermione pursed her lips and harry glared but both did their best to ignore him speaking of missing people said neville who hadntheard draco comment about snape where ron at anyway hermione blinked she hadntnoticed ron was missing she d been trying to avoid thinking about him as the fact that he might never forgive her made her want to burst into tears i dontknow she said looking over at harry worriedly me either harry said neville frowned did you three have a fight i dontwant to talk about it hermione said firmly trying to keep her mind off of where ron might be but anxious about him nonetheless oliver was sitting at his fully restored desk hastily grading the last few papers for his first class which started right after lunch the essays werentbad most of them received high marks but there were only so many variations on the topic of water monsters most students had just written a lot about grindylows the most inventive essay so far was from luna lovegood who seemed to think that mermaids were highly dangerous and that there were something called griados that ate the toes of swimmers and lived in all lakes which explained why luna always wore her shoes when swimming he was just starting on his third to last essay when his office door flew open startled oliver looked up ron weasley stood in the doorway with a murderous look on his face chapter twenty one answers enter dumbledore called at the knock on his door and looked up to see who his visitor was minerva mcgonagall stepped through the doorway confirming his suspicions hello minerva he said pleasantly what can i do for you well you could bring back reality for a start mcgonagall said bluntly sitting down in front of his desk and giving him her sternest look what exactly happened to severus i dontknow what you mean please dontplay innocent with me albus minerva snapped i ve known you too long for that i have never seen anything quite as disquieting as severus snape was yesterday he seemed rather cheerful exactly severus only happiness is that derived from the suffering of gryffindors where was he all weekend albus did you send him out on a mission for the order severus was attending to his own business not the order s dumbledore replied and what business would that be mcgonagall asked i am afraid that is for severus to disclose mcgonagall sighed well could you at least tell me what happened between severus and miss granger in what respect mcgonagall gave him a pointed look you know perfectly well what i talking about how did those two end up working together on the prank war did they dumbledore said mildly i had no idea how very interesting one of these days albus i going to steal your pensieve mcgonagall said dryly dumbledore merely chuckled in response all right fine you re not going to give me any answers mcgonagall said sourly would you at least tell me why you re making miss granger and mr malfoy suffer i assume you are referring to the chain she nodded why wontyou remove it you know as well as i do that no good will come of it they re going to kill each other albus you d have better luck with making two enemies into friends by chaining severus to sirius and we both know severus would chew off his hand within thirty seconds in that situation dumbledore couldnthelp but chuckle at the thought of snape and sirius in hermione and draco situation miss granger is not unreasonable and mr malfoy is not as bad as he pretends to be hopefully spending time together will help them to overcome the past mcgonagall raised her eyebrow skeptically and what potter weasley granger and malfoy will end up the best of pals where miss granger goes so go harry and mr weasley mcgonagall snorted granger may be reasonable but she holds grudges albus she wontforgive malfoy very easily especially after this prank war nonsense we were lucky they both lived through the prank war before the chain never mind after they both have horrid tempers a lot of pent up anger and a multitude of spells at their disposal i have every confidence that they can work out their differences dumbledore said firmly mcgonagall shook her head you will unchain them before graduation wontyou if the solution to their problem has been found yes dumbledore replied with a smile come now albus mcgonagall said you ve known how to unchain them from the start perhaps perhaps nothing do you really think there anything to be gained by subjecting them to this surely you ve heard about the rumors flying about i have heard a few dumbledore said with another chuckle i do so wonder who invented the tale that miss granger had murdered severus mcgonagall couldnthelp but smile honestly albus hogwarts canttake much more of this poppy is ready to quit and argus was very upset that he finally got over his cold only to have to mop up a flooded fourth floor and clean up cheese slices and pork chops in the entrance hall they left a trail of food from the great hall to the prefects bathroom albus surely you cantlet this continue for too long they will work things out minerva dumbledore told her i am sure of it oliver swallowed nervously staring at the furious weasley in his doorway normally a seventh year student was not something oliver would fear unless it happened to be someone who was highly intelligent and a death eater offspring and to be both smart and a follower of voldemort was rare and even then oliver was probably advanced enough to win a fight his father had been in the department of magical law enforcement for decades and had taught oliver everything he knew on top of that the members of the order of the phoenix had taught him plenty of spells and charms both offensive and defensive and oliver had done a lot of his own research having always enjoyed the subject so his skills in a duel were rather sound ron however was a different matter ron was tough maybe not as skilled as harry or hermione but still a natural butt kicker and on his way to being an auror not only that but there was something intimidating about being glared at by a guy who had been barely seventeen when he had helped defeat the most dangerous dark wizard of the age if not ever it was even more intimidating to be glared at by just such a guy when he was holding his wand and probably knew that oliver had seen his girlfriend ass um ron hi oliver stammered wishing his office had an exit other than the one ron was standing in what can i do for you ron smiled a maniacal sort of grin that made oliver even more uneasy it didntclick at first oliver ron said silkily taking a step forward i was too shocked about the tattoo and the hickeys then i remembered what malfoy had said i do believe wood and the little weasel already knew mind telling me how you knew about my girlfriend tattoo hey it not what you think oliver said desperately standing up in case he needed to run who the hell came up with that dumb rule about not apparating inside hogwarts she never cheated on you not that i know of anyway honest ron face darkened even more at that last word you have any idea how long i ve liked hermione ron said dangerously since before we became friends since my first year i finally asked her out last summer she said yes we agreed to never act too boyfriend girlfriend around harry we ve had a really good relationship we still bicker all the time but people do that now dontthey then i find out that she going behind my back with other guys listen ron i serious i haventtouched her since you two started going out oliver insisted but you ve touched her before that ron raised his wand up to point at oliver pure fury in his eyes oops well well a little define a little ron face was slowly turning as red as his neck and ears a a little um not a lot we we hardly ever did anything well that was a blatant lie but at least ron was looking at him more with suspicious anger than undiluted rage if you ve hardly ever done anything then how did you see her tattoo ron demanded um well oliver searched for something to say he d seen it several times but ron did not need to know that it wasntron business anyway ron wouldntbe hearing anything if he wasnta pissed off guy who was strong enough to help kill voldemort oliver knew he d have to be careful ron temper was infamous at last the answer came to him tell him the first time you saw it and pretend you never saw it afterwards it was genius it was genius and it just might work he d be telling a half truth which was less detectable than a lie and the first time he d seen it had been rather innocent as a matter of fact he was fairly certain that hermione hadnttold anyone though from what she d explained during their time together she d only told ginny about her tattoo and that was a very abbreviated version hermione had told ginny not long after it had happened and only because she d been sharing a room with ginny later that summer and ginny had glimpsed the tattoo on accident when they were changing and demanded to know about it ginny also knew about hermione and oliver but not nearly everything ginny had been the only person hermione had ever told about their kiss at the world cup it had been the first secret she d ever told ginny actually and ginny keeping hermione confidence was what had made them friends in the first place oliver swallowed hoping ron believed him and that telling him this wouldntmake ron even more homicidal i was there when she got it ron went rather still frowning obviously not having expected that what i was there when she got it oliver repeated in the tattoo parlor ron gave him a thoughtful look through narrowed eyes all right he said go ahead and explain but this had better be good oliver nodded and sighed wondering where to begin hermione ever tell you that she and i used to hang out in the summers at grimmauld place no i mean yes but last year when she went back to her parents house for a few weeks i visited her sometimes when she was hanging out with her friends what friends her muggle friends people she was friends with before hogwarts like who there were over a dozen of them it doesntmatter the point is we had plans one day to get together with some of her friends and when i showed up hermione and four of her girlfriends were already there talking about getting tattoos i was really confused hermione was kind of tipsy hermione was drunk ron interrupted in disbelief no she was kind of tipsy the others were pretty drunk anyway the next thing i know they re dragging me to a tattoo parlor i was there when she picked it out hung out with her while she got it done the idiot tattoo artist gave her the bright idea of squeezing my hand to distract herself from the pain she about broke my finger she let you sit there while someone put a tattoo on her ass it not on her ass really it on her lower back couldntreally see anything important he added quickly ron still looked suspicious you expect me to believe this oliver struggled desperately to come up with some sort of proof i wait he shoved up his sleeve revealing a tattoo of the puddlemere united quidditch team logo i had them do this while i was there ask hermione to show you the picture of it we met up with some more of her friends right after that at a bar in london and one of them wanted to take a picture it a muggle photo of five girls showing off the tattoos on their backs you can see my arm in the picture hermione pulled me in at the last second demanded i be in the picture too one of her hands is pushing her shorts down just enough to see the tattoo the other is holding my arm towards the camera ron thought about this for a moment and you haventdone anything with hermione since we started going out ron asked his eyes flashing a warning brighter than polaris of course not she wouldntdo that and neither would i unfortunately oliver added silently okay ron said nodding to himself oliver struggled not to breathe a sigh of relief lest ron think he was lying ron stood up and smiled coldly if i ever find out that you re lying to me i ll stun you then cut you into little pieces with a rusty knife understand oliver nodded vigorously and ron swept out of the room without a backwards glance oliver sighed feeling drained as the adrenaline left his system and even more hopeless about hermione than he d felt all year oliver sank back into the memories of hermione her sorting how she d stood out because she was the only first year whispering excitedly and looking around in wonder rather than trying not to wet their pants he d thought she was pretty but seeing as how she was only eleven he d tried to put it out of his head it had clicked that he couldntignore her forever right before harry first quidditch match when he d been watching hermione try to get harry to eat and reminiscing about his own first match then he d seen harry finally take a bite of toast from hermione hand just to shut her up and he d had an overwhelming urge to strangle his own seeker the day he d realized he liked her when she d been force feeding harry toast and how his gryffindor bravery had completely failed him when it came to plucking up the courage to do something about it he hadntsaid anything to her over the next three years while hanging out with harry usually as a team with fred george angelina alicia and katie and lee hermione ron and sometimes neville and percy who was a roommate of oliver s hanging on he d managed to pick up a few things about her like the fact that she was muggle born and that she was actually only a little over three years younger than oliver rather than a full four as she was almost twelve when starting hogwarts but he d only interacted with her one on one during his seventh year a few times and their conversation had centered around the first quidditch match harry had ever lost two days before ravenclaw match against hufflepuff hermione had decided to tell oliver off flashback oliver and percy were the only two in the dormitory at the moment and oliver wished percy would leave exiting the dormitory meant he d be subjected to the twins boisterous jokes and teasing their own special version of let cheer up oliver which usually led to oliver or someone in the vicinity visiting the hospital wing or angelina alicia and katie overly nice tones and attempts to make him feel better so he d chosen to remain in the room but percy was best taken in small doses especially since he d made prefect it wasntthat oliver disliked percy they had a lot in common they were both very driven people they just drove in different directions and they shared the almost foolishly brave quality of all gryffindors and the tendency to stand up for themselves and others but percy got boring on occasion and there was nothing worse than being around percy while he studied it wasntthat he was talkative or distracting it was that he chewed his quill loudly and rubbed out his mistakes loudly and said shh loudly when anyone in the room spoke above a whisper and ruffled parchment and book pages and muttered to himself and often let out loud cries of dismay whenever he couldntremember a fact or he happened to lose something vital to the process of doing homework so oliver was lying flat on his back trying to block out the annoyance that was percy while studying timing himself to see how long it would be before oliver snapped and trying to think of something to do when he did have to storm out of the room then without warning someone banged on the door oliver could you get that percy asked distractedly sounding irritated at the very thought that someone dared come knocking during study time sorry oliver said yanking the hangings shut around his bed sure the girls had come looking for him i ll give you my last chocolate frog if you tell them i not here what would i want with a chocolate frog percy asked contemptuously penelope collects the cards oliver pointed out and grinned to himself when he heard the door open oh hello said percy sounding surprised oliver hoped that meant it wasntsomeone from the team percy usually sounded bored or casual when greeting most of oliver friends or exasperated when the twins came by what can i do for you percy continued in a polite almost formal tone oliver frowned confused i ve come to see oliver percy came to his shock hermione voice oliver eyes widened wondering what she wanted with him probably something to do with harry he told himself with a sigh hermione was nice to him but she didntexactly pay him much attention oliver not here percy lied oliver cursed himself for ever making that deal and thought fast trying to come up with a way to pop out of his bed without looking like an idiot he could probably say that percy just hadntnoticed him come in and lay down oh really said hermione oliver sighed she didnteven sound a little disappointed just sort of determined hey percy exclaimed suddenly amidst the sounds of a scuffle oliver confusion just had time to deepen before the hangings around his bed were thrown back revealing hermione oliver jerked into a sitting position hey he yelped utterly startled what if i was naked in here she rolled her eyes as if it was laughable to think there might be consequences to yanking aside the hangings around a seventh year guy bed without knowing if he were clothed she shot a glare at percy before turning back to oliver hello oliver hello intruder he shot back he knew the generally accepted practices when talking to your crush especially when said crush had just burst into your bedroom were to act pleasant but she d just scared the crap out of him and didntexactly look like she was here to throw herself at him she looked more likely to throw a punch at him i was invited hermione said imperiously what are you a vampire oliver retorted you werent invited anyway percy muttered he was rubbing one arm with his other hand looking sour that hurt percy could you give us a minute oliver called over her head he didntknow what hermione wanted but he figured it would probably go better without percy studying in the background i was studying percy complained which you cantdo when people are talking in the background oliver pointed out fine hurry up percy said sulkily he shut the door behind himself still rubbing his arm so oliver asked hermione what do you want i want you to stop acting like a prat he gaped at her nonplussed when was i acting like a prat you haventstopped sulking like a two year old ever since that match if i hear someone comment that you re off drowning your sorrows one more time i going to really drown you i happen to be a little upset okay oliver said dryly this is my last year hermione if i dontwin the cup this year pro quidditch scouts and teams arentgoing to pay one bit of attention to me i a great keeper it all i ve ever wanted to do and i cantdo it if i just the keeper from the hogwarts team that hasntwon a game since the great charlie weasley left well you re depressing harry she said severely it not harry fault the dementors came inside the grounds it the dementors fault oliver glowered at her oh well excuse me harry knows i dontblame him and if he doesntthen he not going to believe it if i tell him again i dontknow what you want me to do about it i want you to stop whining i haventbeen you ve been sulking which is bad enough i dontknow a thing about quidditch but i do know about numbers and from what i understand from fred and george you re only down by a hundred points and ravenclaw keeper is better than the hufflepuff chasers and cho chang is supposed to be a better seeker than diggory so was harry oliver muttered so there a good chance ravenclaw could beat hufflepuff by at least a hundred and fifty points maybe more she continued as if he hadntspoken they d only have to be up fifty points when they catch the snitch and given that hufflepuff beat you they ll probably want to beat the pants off of hufflepuff if they want to keep their hope for the cup alive which they ll be thinking about for the first time in years ravenclaw will be thinking that if they squish hufflepuff then all they ll have to do is narrowly defeat you and slytherin and they ll have the cup so i d imagine their captain will tell them to hold off until they re way ahead by goals you could still win the cup if you d stop sitting around feeling sorry for yourself oliver raised his eyebrows he hadntthought about the fact that ravenclaw might be seriously entertaining hopes of getting the cup gryffindor had been the only one to give slytherin a run for it for the past decade now that hufflepuff had beaten them the rest of the school probably thought the cup was fair game his jaw clenched that was his cup his maybe you re right he admitted slowly of course i am she said pompously reminding him forcefully of percy now get out of bed and start thinking strategy harry life is hard enough especially now that he got a murderer after him the whole school making fun of his dementor problem and he actually lost a match oliver felt a twinge of guilt but he smiled at her are you always this inspirational he asked teasingly she grinned back no i usually much worse she turned to go hey he called after her not wanting to see her go just yet she looked questioningly over her shoulder at him thanks you re welcome he shook his head not just for this i keep meaning to tell you how great that was when you cast that spell on harry glasses back during the match she shrugged i just wish it had helped it did if we had won the match it would have been because of you right before harry fell i shouted that the snitch was behind him if you hadntcast that spell he wouldnthave known what i was talking about wouldnthave seen it the dementors are the only reason we didntbeat them but if they hadntshown we still wouldnthave beaten them not without you that was bloody brilliant of you she blushed and struggled to sound modest it was nothing it was a hell of a lot more than nothing it wasntjust good spell work it was great thinking i ve known that spell since fifth year and i didntthink of it and you were smart enough to think of it and to do it two years before it was taught to you you re amazing she beamed at him her face as scarlet as his quidditch robes i thanks he nodded at her and she left oliver grinned happily as he lay back down well aware of the fact that while she had coming looking for him in order to help harry she d also managed to help him as well and she d been quite pleased to hear him compliment her end flashback oliver sighed at the memory that moment had managed to change something between them she d become his friend not a close friend to be sure but a friend nonetheless once she d started fighting with harry and ron so much she d chatted to him whenever she wasntstudying which was frighteningly often and even ate a few meals with him even though she was fighting with harry and ron at the time she d come to oliver to tell him that while in the girls bathroom she d overheard that cho chang would be the seeker for the gryffindor and ravenclaw match she d even managed to listen sympathetically while he ranted to her about how cho wasntsupposed to make a full recovery so soon after that tumble down the ravenclaw tower dormitory stairs and it was because of cho that hufflepuff had lost so badly to ravenclaw although there were rumors that if cedric diggory hadntbeen so enamored with cho he might have been paying more attention to the snitch and somehow that had led to an embarrassing argument over whether or not cedric was too old for cho cedric was a sixth year after all and she was a fourth but given the placement of their birthdays they were almost three years apart oliver supposed he shouldnthave said that bit about that like saying you and i couldntdate because after that she d turned pink and run off soon afterwards and he d kicked himself but good for it it wasntuntil the world cup that he d truly let himself think that she might return his feelings he d come across her giggling over by the water tap line and she d told him that he looked good then blushed and hurriedly said that she d meant he knew how to properly dress like a muggle he d teased her a bit and she d finally said something about harry and ron and run off then they d gone for that walk together both unable to sleep worried about voldemort and he d somehow managed to pluck up the bravery to kiss her goodnight in front of her tent he d felt the urge to run afterwards but she d grabbed him by the jacket and they must have been making out for nearly a half hour when bill came out of the tent scaring them both to death they d both stammered pathetically oliver vaguely remembered hermione saying something about braces being stuck together though neither he nor bill had a clue about what braces were but bill had been cool about it he d said he was just on his way to wake up the girls and they d better say their goodbyes if they didntwant the twins to see what they were up to they d started writing letters after that him telling her all about his frustrations at being only a reserve keeper for puddlemere and her telling him about rita skeeter and harry troubles with the cup he d been utterly surprised to see her at headquarters when she d joined the order after managing to distract the twins the two had hung out for a bit in the attic and she d explained that she hadntwritten him because the order was reading all their mail to make sure they werentgiving anything away to harry and she hadntwanted to explain why she was writing to him they d spent an ungodly amount of time together that summer and the next he d even missed a few of his first practices as starting keeper just to see her by the summer after voldemort defeat he d felt utterly privileged that she d invited him to hang out with her while she was with her muggle friends the muggles harry and ron hadnteven known about they d accepted oliver and he d overheard on more than one occasion someone referring to him as hermione hot boyfriend from her boarding school after harry birthday at which he d put in an appearance he d left hermione side to go back to training for the upcoming quidditch season finally a starting keeper for puddlemere but he d felt very positive about hermione on the whole their time during the summers and their letters during the school year had become more and more serious then he d gotten injured decided to teach at hogwarts to be closer to her and she d dropped this bombshell out of nowhere that she was with ron now and planned to stay with him and she was so sorry god he d wanted to strangle ron in the end he d decided to wait see how things panned out here it was just before christmas not even six months into her relationship with ron and it didntseem to be going very well he d had a very heartening very secret talk with ginny early in the year apparently ron own sister hermione best friend didntthink it was going to work out either he d be marrying his mother ginny had told him they re just not compatible oliver it not that ron isntsmart it that he uninterested in being smart it isntthat hermione doesntwant to break rules and walk on the wild side it that she knows when it a bad idea hermione needs someone who knows what it like to be passionate driven focused ron only along for the ride ron needs someone to laugh at his jokes and take care of him not boss him around i think they re together because they like each other i dontthink that ll be enough you need more than attraction even emotional attraction to keep a relationship going they re better off as friends and i hope they realize that before it too late oliver didntknow if she d been telling him this because she knew about oliver and hermione he knew the first secret hermione had told ginny exclusively was the kiss at the world cup that it was one of the things that had cemented the two girls friendship however he sincerely hoped it wasn t he cared about hermione but lately there was a nagging little voice in the back of his head that said he might not be all that depressed if things didntwork out with her he just wasntsure how much more he could take the insanity that surrounded her and harry and ron didntappear to be slacking off anytime soon he had noticed this over and over again hell he d been dancing on common room tables when harry had become seeker only to discover that harry had an odd knack for ending up in the hospital wing or fighting giant snakes or being hunted by mass murderers or being accused of mental instability by the entire world there were rumors that the three of them wandered into the forest periodically to battle evil creatures chat up the centaurs and even hang out with a real live giant and the prank war no prank war had ever been this intense oliver own seventh year prank war had been so tame he barely noticed it except for when fred and george who didntcare at all about the fact that they werentseventh years at the time got bored and targeted percy and occasionally oliver himself although that was rare as oliver had the power to kick them off the quidditch team or make them practice until two in the morning he d seen other people get sucked in by it too neville longbottom was great at it and if there was one person who didntneed any more freak accidents it was him luna lovegood well it was hard to tell if it was harry cosmic problems or hers that put her in awkward situations but oliver had had many a problem with it himself most especially this year he didntknow if he could handle any more of it and it was still only the first term of his employment ron why arentyou in class finally becoming a full fledged weasley fred asked as he turned towards the defense against the dark arts office and nearly ran smack into ron wanted to talk to wood ron said darkly had a few questions for him why didntyou let us ask george said you know we could have dragged it out of him i got the answers i need ron muttered what about hermione ron growled he says he never did anything with her while we were going out i could have told you that fred said rolling his eyes hermione wouldntcheat on you did you really need to bother asking wood what about the hickeys though ron said the ones malfoy mentioned oh come on ronniekins think about what you just said george said with a sigh malfoy not the most reliable source in the world he was telling the truth about the tattoo doesntmean he was telling the truth about anything else george said bluntly even if he was fred added that just means he saw hickeys on her neck that he sure were from snape didntyou say hermione was messing with his head the whole time making him think all sorts of things about her and snape ron frowned thoughtfully then perked up a bit maybe you re right we re always right george said it probably not half as bad as you think hmm ron sighed and started walking figuring he d wander around aimlessly until it was time for his next class that still doesntmean i should forgive her for this tattoo thing though he pointed out oh come on ron she knew you d just give her hell about it if she did tell you george said yeah like we re gonna fred grinned look if you dontwant to apologize then don t but the longer you wait the less chance there is that she ll want to hook back up in the future i dontcare ron lied feeling like he d been punched in the gut he adored hermione yes she could be annoying with her bossiness and stubbornness and homework devotion and her temper and her cluelessness about quidditch but he still really cared about her he didntwant to lose her not as a girlfriend and not as a friend end notes people who read this story before the editing often asked for more of an in depth look at oliver and hermione and i finally decided it was time to make something up hope it not too shabby almost cheese spirit time cue evil grin chapter twenty two snape christmas spirit stop humming granger draco snapped irritably i not humming hermione said absently too worried about snape ron and the fact that parvati and lavender were close by to pay much attention to draco attempts to annoy her in fifth year dumbledore had insisted that snape lower his requirements so that more students could make it into the n e w t level potions class more gryffindors hufflepuffs and ravenclaws anyway as slytherins easily made it into snape class no matter their grade only harry hermione draco and quite surprisingly neville had made top potions scores on their o w l s but the other gryffindors had decided to keep taking potions in light of the war at the time hermione had thought dumbledore was right to change snape rule now she thought it had been the stupidest thing the headmaster had ever done why wasntsnape arriving parvati and lavender would remember her before long come on dontbe childish i can hear you humming draco said tiredly i not humming malfoy she snapped draco opened his mouth to reply then closed it realizing he could still hear the humming when she was speaking potter are you humming i donthum malfoy harry replied shortly no one is humming you re delusional i hear it too neville spoke up well it not me hermione said glancing around as the song reached her ears dean seamus parvati and lavender were still talking and slytherins didntstrike her as the type to like the jaunty tune the culprit was humming now that she was listening the song sounded vaguely familiar hang on harry said slowly that that song from that disney movie whistle while you work that a dumb name for a movie draco scoffed there a movie called whistle while you work neville asked struggling to recall what his muggle studies professor had said about movies no it the name of a song from a movie hermione said she frowned wondering who on earth would be humming a song from the disney version of snow white at hogwarts quite suddenly however her question was answered and she immediately wished she hadntfound out hermione gaped unable to fathom what she was seeing as stunned as her classmates snape had returned there was some doubt about whether it was really him however his greasy hair had obviously been given a thorough wash and his black robes were open over green slacks and a red christmas sweater which said ho ho ho in yellow letters around the collar and merry christmas over a picturesque christmas scene with santa and his reindeer landing in a sleigh atop a gingerbread house the image was complete with snowmen a gingerbread family wearing little hats and mittens snow covered pine trees and mountains in the distance beneath a night sky filled with stars and a crescent moon on the front pocket of snape robes were two small bells that jingled faintly tied with green and silver ribbon to a patch that said jingle bells that wasntthe worst of it however snape was not only humming he was humming whistle while you work and all while grinning and fairly skipping into the classroom like a little kid heading downstairs on christmas morning it was terrifying as he reached the front of the class snape did a little shimmying dance step before completing his song and grinning even more widely at the stunned gryffindors and slytherins before him he suddenly flung out his arms pansy parkinson and millicent bulstrode who were sitting in the front row ducked instinctively and said cheerfully good morning class well there was only one possible reaction to that as one the class decided that snape was quite dangerous and every last student gasped in unison and leaned as far away from snape as their chairs would allow how are you all today good i hope snape said in the same happy tone his only response was a couple of dropped jaws and quite a few shivers of horror that a great song isntit snape continued not noticing the revulsion and fear on his students faces then he did the unthinkable snape began to sing he began in a rather merry singing voice then whistled so loudly that most of the class jumped before continuing humming or whistling when the song called for it pansy and millicent scooted their chairs back until they ran into crabbe and goyle table a few audible gulps could be heard and more shivers were seen as snape completed his song with a flourish this left the class without anything much to say my god he knows a muggle song draco thought in horror his very world appeared to be shattering and this hallmark version of snape was doing the shattering he knows a muggle song from a muggle movie and what is with that sweater snape doesntown christmas clothes he doesnteven own colored clothes and bells no this cantbe right this is a nightmare this is just some horrible dream brought on by having to room with granger and potter wait this must be their fault draco whipped his head around to hermione intent upon demanding to know what she d done to snape and found her gaping at snape with the same expression of numb shock as the rest of the class harry expression was only slightly different he was obviously doing something he d done a lot since the beginning of the war with voldemort running over his options planning spells for offense and defense draco watched harry eyes sweep the room lingering on all possible exits and weapons well snape continued that one version of the song anyway would anyone like to hear the other neville whimpered no ah kids these days no appreciation for music he chuckled well i apologize for my tardiness he makes one wrong move we head straight for the door and slam it behind us harry murmured to hermione we ll try to let as much of the class out as we can but as soon as he gets close we ll put an imperturbable charm on the door and run for dumbledore okay hermione blinked coming back to her senses slightly and turned to look at harry with an exasperated expression even draco was giving him a how much of a paranoid dumb ass can you be sort of look though neville eyes had widened at harry instructions and he looked ready to wet himself pursing her lips hermione turned back to the front and slowly still nervous raised her hand yes hermione snape said apparently too far away in his own little world to notice the shocked gasps from the class at the use of her first name um p professor hermione squeaked a a are you all right i great he exclaimed clasping his hands behind his back and rocking back and forth slightly how are you v very well thank you hermione stammered looking anything but professor could we take our exam now seamus asked desperately in an attempt to get them out of class as quickly as possible oh yes the exam well i meant to plan it out over this past weekend but i was far too busy to get it done snape said in an off handed sort of tone everyone stared in shock snape had forgotten to make an exam for a class filled with gryffindors usually he came up with the hardest exam possible just to see as many gryffindors as possible fail and graded it easy for the slytherins or whispered advice to them while he prowled the rules the shock over the lack of exam was nothing however compared to snape next words tell you what why dontwe just just skip the exam and all brew our favorite potion or perhaps a potion to give as a gift for christmas that is what there no way i brewing a potion for a christmas gift theodore nott suddenly burst out oh prefer to buy your gifts snape said his smile finally slipped but only momentarily or do you just not celebrate christmas theodore i am sorry i should have thought blaise zabini elbowed theodore nott in the ribs and muttered something that sounded like what are you doing do you want to take an exam blaise gave snape an obviously fake smile and said i think it an excellent idea professor snape smiled back at him i used to make my mum a potion for christmas every year he said a distant look in his eyes i d buy her chocolates too she used to love those things from honeydukes yes why dontwe everyone we ll all brew potions for our loved ones at the end of the class i ll get you all some nice flasks to put them in so you can give them as gifts for christmas or whatever holiday you celebrate he added nodding at theodore in fact why dontwe just make this optional if you dontfeel up to it dontworry there no obligation no one made a move to brew a potion but snape didntseem to notice loved ones you know what i suddenly reminded of the first potion i ever made my god he having a flashback hermione whispered okay harry you were right it was just before i started hogwarts snape continued still smiling this time reminiscently his head tilted back until he was staring up at the ceiling he gave a little jump backwards and landed on his desktop casually it was a love potion if you can believe that everyone in the room shook their heads vigorously i d met the most wonderful girl in diagon alley while shopping for my school things she was a pretty little thing with red hair and green eyes and just as nice and smart as can be pity she was later sorted into gryffindor snape sighed and dropped his head back to eye level with his students then he burst out laughing looking right at harry oh potter if you could see the look on your face even you would laugh everyone turned to look at harry who looked mortified as though a gangrenous gore covered zombie would have been easier to stomach hermione who remembered what she d told harry after malfoy prank on her and snape was the only one who had any idea what was wrong with him couldntsuppress a small giggle harry turned such a furious glare on her that she recoiled bumping into draco draco frowned as he shoved her away and did his best to piece together just what was bothering harry he knew there had to be something else besides snape as harry looked a lot worse than he had a few moments ago and the fact that harry had inherited his green eyes from his redheaded mother popped into draco head bwahahaha everyone jumped and hermione spun around and backed into harry draco was laughing louder and harder than he ever had before ah figured it out did you snape said grinning great isntit he laughed again and harry shook his head in disbelief i dontbelieve it harry said in awe shaking his head even when he pretending to be mr rogers he still hates me a small snort was heard from hermione as she struggled to rein in her laughter and harry glowered at her angrily once again anyway snape said wiping tears of mirth from his eyes as potter can undoubtedly tell you the potion went horribly wrong good harry muttered his hand clenched around his wand as he glared at snape i d found it in one of my school books which i was looking through before term started i still remember every ingredient snape went on not having heard harry first the potion called for dragon blood and powdered rose quartz draco listened to snape description grinning his head off snape had had a crush on harry mum oh the horror harry must feel and i didnthave any sarsaparilla root so i sent the house elf out to get some right only the elf wasnttoo bright and came back with a muggle drink barq root beer i figured it would work just fine as it had sarsaparilla in it but sure enough things later went sour or should i say cheesy he laughed though no one quite caught the joke slowly draco good humor faded what was wrong with snape why was he acting like this was this another ruse designed to confuse him of course it is he told himself realization dawning this is about messing with my head well it not gonna work i gonna prove he just making this up as he goes along he d never admit to having a crush on someone anyone even if it did make potter draco took a moment here to look over at the sickly green tinge to harry face and grinned before returning to his mental rant about snape i not going to let him mess with me i not this is about the prank war that all well if he willing to go all out so am i draco dug out his stash of potions ingredients and began to line them up next to his cauldron taking careful mental notes of everything snape said well little brother you donthave to decide if you want to prank hermione right now fred was saying as they wandered aimlessly through the halls of hogwarts i mean come up with the plan then figure out if you want to do it because if you do then you need to have the plan first right i guess ron said vaguely lost in thought crap george said suddenly staring down at the end of the hall that a slytherin she ll tell snape you re out of class better get out of sight ron ron squinted at the slytherin who didntappear to be one of the slytherin prefects i a prefect ron reminded george i put them in detention ron headed towards the slytherin who upon closer inspection appeared to be daphne greengrass a girl in his year and his potions class who dyed her hair black and always smelled of cigarette smoke hey you greengrass he called why arentyou in potions why arentyou weasel she retorted did you see snape too ron paused snape what about him you haventseen well you re missing the creepy event of the lifetime i was running late for potions and as i walking down there i walking behind this weird guy with nice hair who humming his head off then he turns to go into the potions room and i realize it snape or someone who drank some bad polyjuice soon as i saw how whacked out he was i turned around so i dontcare what you try to do to me weasel i not going in there until someone figures out how to fix him the three weasleys looked at each other eyebrows raised then without a word they pushed past daphne and raced down towards the dungeons chapter twenty three love poems and root beer draco had listened carefully to snape story which had described the ingredients and potion brewing process before detouring off to tell about how just as he was sitting down to start the potion he d received a letter from the object of his affection harry kept involuntarily gagging through most of this part and had sat down immediately to write his reply to harry mother whose name he still had yet to reveal to the rest of the class the story was becoming funnier and funnier draco however sat fuming in the back corner throughout the whole story the more snape talked the more convinced draco was that this was all some elaborate joke designed to fake draco out and the more convinced he was to prove that snape was lying draco had memorized the entire process and had gathered all of the ingredients for the potion save one where exactly was he going to find a can of muggle root beer there was obviously no root beer to be had in the classroom wizards didntstock muggle soft drinks so he wasntsure if he could get it at all in hogwarts but he had to try he vaguely recalled the muggle studies professor mentioning that the elves got him muggle drinks occasionally so he might have a chance if he went to the kitchens especially now that dobby was working there hopefully dobby would either have some or know where to get some but how to get to dobby draco hand shot up into the air professor he called loudly cutting off snape granger and i have to go to the bathroom hermione shot him a startled what the hell is wrong with you look as snape looked over at them in surprise you re excused draco hermione he said and went back to his story draco leaped out of his chair grabbed hermione by the back of the shirt and dragged her bodily from the room hermione had time for one startled glance at harry before they were out the door every gryffindor and slytherin turned to stare at the door then at harry who looked slightly cornered and shrugged not understanding it himself what are you doing hermione hissed shoving malfoy off of her the moment they were out of the classroom draco bit his lip having no time to come up with an even slightly plausible explanation so he settled for the truth we re going on a secret mission granger we re off to regain my sanity with that he darted off down the corridor heading back for the entrance hall his eyes shifting about nervously for signs of trouble hugging the wall and moving so fast that hermione practically had to run to keep up with him the whole time she grumbled and scolded him what the hell are you doing where are we going i ve got news for you malfoy there no regaining it your sanity is gone for good stop going so fast malfoy what your problem draco refused to answer her as he half dragged her to the entrance hall and through the door that led to the hufflepuff dormitories and the kitchens they stopped in front of the door to the kitchen draco tickled the pear while hermione stared at him in disbelief all this because you were hungry she said incredulously couldntyou have just waited until class was over draco pulled open the door and stepped in then hurriedly shut it in hermione face hey she exclaimed and reached for the handle draco seized it to hold it still and pressed his body against the door doing his best to keep her from getting in the last thing he needed was for hermione to ruin his plan draco sir came dobby familiar squeal have you come to visit dobby sir um actually i need your help draco said apologetically anything sir listen have you ever heard of barq root beer hermione twisted the doorknob her shoulder shoving hard against the door but it was no use malfoy was too heavy for her to move draco malfoy she shouted through the door i dontknow what you re up to but so help me if i the door suddenly swung inward and hermione who d been leaning heavily on the door and pushing hard lost her balance and stumbled forward nearly colliding with draco who had opened the door and now stood there giving her a smile that turned into a smirk when he saw her fall she glared up at him as she righted herself come on granger he said we re missing class with that he walked away hermione staring daggers at his back as she trailed behind him so then the last part of the potion calls for an incantation if you can believe it which is rare in potions as i later discovered but increases their potency anyway i was rather surprised that the last step was to visualize the person i intended the potion for and speak aloud a love poem it had to have three four line verses every other line had to rhyme and most importantly it had to be composed by the person who was brewing the potion as you can imagine this took quite some time writing poetry was never exactly my strong suit snape was saying some time later he chuckled as did several of the students gradually the seventh years had started to relax once it became apparent that snape lapse in character was not a warning that he was about to get out his wand and perform the killing curse on anything that moved after all the sight of snape in a christmas sweater and snape telling them a story about something to do with his crush on a gryffindor was bound to wear down their fear and replace it with humor draco meanwhile was the only person who wasntthe least bit entertained with the possible exception of harry draco potion carefully brewed via the instructions in snape tale was almost complete and when it was finished he would prove that it was not some botched love potion but something else entirely thus proving that snape made the whole thing up which would mean that snape was in fact still an evil slytherin bastard which would mean that draco would regain some small shred of the sanity he d lost on the day he d spiked granger pumpkin juice unfortunately it looked like if he really wanted to be certain that snape was lying he was going to have to follow the last few steps as well and that meant composing a love poem draco almost decided to scrap the idea right then and there after much internal debate however he decided that it couldntbe that hard to come up with twelve lines of poetry people did it all the time right let see he thought frowning at the murky pinkish red potion what sort of thing goes in a love poem stuff about um oh who cares i ll just throw in a bunch of girly words and call it a day girly words cute adorable pretty sweet sweet there we go sweeter than what sort of things are sweet um puppies i guess and chocolate what the hell would rhyme with chocolate focklut hock a lot okay i just wontuse chocolate what about puppies i hate puppies screw that draco frowned the love poem was going to be harder than he thought still he reasoned that if it was this hard for him it must have been a lot harder for snape and as such draco was far more certain that snape had never actually done any of it and in about twelve lines draco could definitely prove that snape was in fact a devious little jerk draco resolved to think harder but the potion smelled absolutely foul which was interfering with his concentration and making him wish he had bothered to learn an air freshening spell wait sweeter than air freshener no sweeter than air air rhymes with everything sweeter than air what else rhymes with a lot of stuff draco glanced around the room for inspiration parvati was taking notes in the row in front of him and giggling with lavender hermione was watching snape with both amusement and thoughtfulness as though trying to figure out what had happened despite how funny it was he glared at hermione reminding himself that whatever it was that had gotten into snape probably had something to do with her everything was all her fault after all as his anger with her boiled to the surface a sudden image of hermione during the food fight sprang into his mind her foot on his chest and a bottle of honey in her hand and he grinned widely causing hermione to shoot him a funny look and remind him that he was staring at her while looking happy honey he thought happily turning away from hermione quickly sweeter than air sweeter than honey now i just need something that rhymes with air fair bear hair mare glare pair maybe share care wait wait aunt andy wedding picture what was the inscription on it she and uncle ted always had those little poems written all over pictures and cards and stuff god what did that picture say dare the last word was dare yeah a love that i dare i remembered it because i didntunderstand it in the slightest okay that three lines sweeter than air sweeter than honey a love that i dare what was the rest of that poem it had the word shall in it shall be my my what what rhymes with honey money funny bun oh god i am not using bunny i absolutely refuse bunnies evil little rodents i ll never look at one again without being embarrassed thanks to dumbledore cantbelieve he took my suggestion what suggestion it was a joke a sarcastic comment and he knew that i sure he did i refuse to use the word bunny that it they re all against me granger potter even snape that why i brewing a supposed fudged love potion to prove snape wrong and trying to convince myself not to use the word bunny well they wontwin i refuse to use the word bunny refuse there are more words in the world they wontget me with this one still even if i did use it it not like potter and granger would know i refused to use it so they wouldntknow they d won and that the whole point right no i still wontdo it oh they re good with their games even turned my own mind against me but i will not use bunny bunny is out they ll never get me to utter that demonic word outside of that wretched password ever i still refuse i refuse to use bunny or love or wait i already used love well it is a love poem damn it why canti just say a bunch of crap about shagging ten minutes later however draco had failed to come up with anything better than bunny reluctantly he started memorizing the first four lines of his poem then moved on to compose the second verse gods above this potion reeks come on brain think who else do i know with a love poem i can steal from hah that a laugh um damn this smell it stinks worse than limburger cheese hey wait that could be a line more smelly than no i cantuse smelly that not mushy um synonyms come on let think smell scent fragrance more fragrant than cheese cheese ll rhyme with lots of stuff please fees how would i use them um fleas sees seas yeah girls always put something about the ocean in poems dontthey so what would be a good line for after cheese cheese what goes with cheese spaghetti damned if i could make that rhyme wine wine wine rhymes with mine ah ha more fragrant than cheese more tasty than wine and then um as as er love lovely as lovely as the seas shall be only mine hey this isntso hard it sucks but he didntsay it was supposed to be a good poem now did he wait arentpoems supposed to have a beat or something what did mum call it meter oh who gives a damn it ll work it sort of does have a beat anyway duh duh duh duh duh duh duh my god i singing a love poem in my head that it i need a few lines about liquor or quidditch or hey this is my poem why cantit be about shagging that sort of like love right from a girly view anyway okay let shag by the something that rhymes easy let shag by the something else that rhymes easy and then two more lines and i can finally show him what for hah let see where do people usually shag who cares not like it matters stupid granger she ruins everything i could ve gotten some this weekend but nooooo hmm maybe i ll just bring girls up to the guest room i d just have to get the drop on potter and granger god this is all granger fault i going to be stuck to her for who knows how long she interfering in my social life argh how much more will i have to suffer why must granger ruin everything why couldnti have gotten chained to someone who i could shag not that granger bad lo aaaahhhhhhh draco clamped his hands over his ears and shook his head vigorously as though there was some evil external force about him that was causing his thoughts and if he just closed all passages to the brain he could get it to leave no he moaned mentally she horrible looking she a troll damn it i knew looking at her naked would scar me for life what are you doing hissed hermione and draco looked up to see her staring at him oddly trying to keep a thought in not that you have many ha ha granger he snapped glancing around to make sure no one else had noticed and quickly letting go of his ears just in case the thought did do what hermione had suggested not even harry had seen draco strange display harry was too busy convincing himself that he had to remain vigilant in case snape snapped at any moment so he didntquite catch draco rather erratic movements not that he would have cared anyway hermione had only noticed because draco had disturbed her arm via the chain draco forced himself to act naturally and shove thoughts of hermione out of his head he had to finish the poem he had to prove his teacher was still a slytherin so that snape would rejoin draco side and smack down all those pansy ass gryffindors once and for all i cracking up draco realized and sighed heavily before returning to his poem and struggling to finish it let shag by the hmm people shag in beds and on floors and in empty classrooms no that too long and in the common room and in the shower and in the forest and in the locker rooms and by the fire if it winter fire fire rhymes with plenty of stuff okay where else i ll need a second verse by the forest girls write a lot about nature i think um the lake no that only rhymes with fake and make neither of those would work well it does rhyme with shake but i am going to have to say this aloud god i d better be as quiet as possible what about river no that only rhymes with shiver um pond what rhymes with pond bond fond wand wand ha i so good at this now what rhymes with fire tire mire dire no it all too depressing squire sire ah desire yeah that good for a love poem now hmmm searching the classroom for more inspiration draco couldnthelp but notice snape the potions master whom many a student feared was now sitting at his desk feet propped up chair tilted back hands clasped behind his head as he told his story which was still not over by the sounds of it so then i took the porcupine quills said the poem and added the last line because i love you and then tossed the quills in explore our desire eyes widening slightly draco cringed both outwardly and inwardly as the thought popped into his head causing hermione to look at him oddly again images of snape and hermione together were now coursing through his head and it wasnttoo pleasant he gagged slightly shuddering it was simply ghastly snape was saying a thick green smoke started pouring from the cauldron much to my dismay and a smell like you wouldntbelieve came with it it now or never draco draco told himself and seized the handful of porcupine quills he d set aside earlier and then the most horrifying thing came out of that cauldron snape continued he paused laughing oh it was absolutely dreadful more than sweetest air draco said shakily as quietly as he could and still be even vaguely audible more than sweetest honey a love that i dare shall be my a bitter taste filled his mouth as he reluctantly forced himself to continue love bunny what gotten into you now hermione whispered rolling her eyes draco swallowed and continued doing his best to ignore her but her gaze was making him nervous and his voice shook slightly for the first time he wondered what might happen if snape was telling the truth more fragrant than cheese more sweet than grape wine lovely as the seas shall be only mine malfoy hermione said staring at him in disbelief are you saying a love poem that caught even harry attention he looked over curiously draco could hear snape say so there it was three feet tall evil as can be let shag by the fire what the hell are you doing hermione whispered more urgently let shag by the pond a horrible foul smelling snape said explore our desire do what hermione and harry demanded together cheese spirit snape concluded dramatically let forget our wands draco finished draco moved to throw the porcupine quills into the cauldron and realization dawned on hermione no she shrieked jumping up to knock his hand away but draco was too quick hopping out of his chair and sidestepping her the entire class spun to look back at them seven years in a potions classroom with neville longbottom teaches a strong sense of alertness to screaming thirteen pairs of eyes fixed on hermione and draco just as draco shouted in a voice filled with triumph about proving snape a liar mostly but hey no one else knew that because i love you just as hermione threw herself forward noooo shouted snape leaping to his feet and drawing his wand but it was too late with a wide victorious grin draco tossed in the porcupine quills chapter twenty four the cheese spirit harry brain was still trying to process the chain of events one minute they d been listening to some ridiculous tale by snape who appeared to have finally lost it and the next draco was muttering about wine shagging and desire the next thing he knew hermione had freaked out draco had professed his love to hermione and hermione had thrown herself into draco arms harry didnthave time to dwell on yet another impossible event occurring in snape morning class however hermione smacked into draco her arms outstretched harry presumed to throw around draco waist but draco was off balance and they both went toppling over on the other side of draco potion which had turned a dark putrid green and begun to emit thick smoke an incredibly nasty smell like a mountain of limburger cheese began to fill the room accompanied by a loud and unpleasant sound like a magnified drawn out mooing noise no one move stay still dontpanic snape yelled sounding quite panicky himself the fog of green smoke grew at an exponential rate until harry couldntsee his hand in front of his face hermione he yelled and then gagged coughing on the fetid haze of smoke har hermione voice broke off into choking sounds as she too inhaled the smoke get off me granger draco gasped slowly ever so slowly the smoke began to dissipate until only the rancid stench was left behind hermione harry called again when he could at last breathe through his mouth more or less normally are you okay she wontbe if she doesntget off me snarled draco what have you done you idiot hermione wailed when the smoke cleared completely harry was able to see that a ruffled hermione and a worried looking draco were staring at the cauldron in trepidation harry turned to look and felt his jaw unhinge in horror standing in the cauldron was one of the creepiest creatures harry had ever seen its entire body was three feet tall and roughly humanoid in shape with extremely lumpy skin that ranged from palest green to yellow white to yellow orange in random blotches it had no hair or external ears just little indentations where ears might be and its fingers were wedge shaped like blocks of cheese large black eyes stared around at the class from a face that reminded harry of nothing so much as lockhart pixies everyone was perfectly still holding their breath well that might have had something to do with the stench and watching warily the cheese spirit smiled revealing double rows of razor sharp teeth booga booga the cheese spirit yell was so sudden that most people jumped even as they started screaming there was instant terror it was as if the cheese spirit had threatened to kill them all or produced a chainsaw do not panic do not panic snape shouted but no one was listening everyone was too busy running for the door come on harry neville yelled you go harry told him and started forward determined to make sure hermione got out okay i ll catch up rawg the cheese spirit lunged forward and waved its arms threateningly wedge shaped fingers curled into claws harry leaped back and drew his wand watching it warily oh for crying out loud what is everyone screaming about draco muttered as he marched towards it it doesntlook dangerous to m aaaahhhhhhh with a guttural shriek the cheese spirit launched itself at draco its razor like teeth visible then jumped onto his head holding tightly and with a graceful turn sank its teeth into draco shoulder draco screamed and began doing an odd sort of dance trying to shake the cheese spirit from his head and succeeding only in lodging its teeth in deeper he began beating on its head trying to get it to let go of his shoulder scared to death and wondering if the bite should be painful no blood or rips in his clothing could be seen as the cheese spirit lifted its head licking its lips the cheese spirit turned to hermione grinning eerily as she attempted to back away from the fondue reject before she remembered her wand as she wasntable to think too clearly with the cheese spirit eyeing her preparing to jump again her choice of spell wasntthe best expelliarmus the cheese spirit confused only for a moment went to lunge for hermione when harry unable to get a clear shot at the cheese spirit to cast a spell ran up and tried to punch the cheese spirit in the back of its head that only turned its attention to him and took harry hand in its mouth bit down then spit it back harry grimaced at the sight of his wand and hand all covered with warm slimy cheese that stank to high heaven snape voice made everyone even the cheese spirit start whatever you do do not let that thing outside of this room snape was doing his best to get to the back of the room but the flow of students making for the door was slowing him down no matter how many he shoved out of the way shrieking the cheese spirit turned to snape and hissed seweeeeruuuus letting out a howl that sounded more like a laugh the cheese spirit pushed away from the three jumped onto a nearby table and made a mad dash for snape seweeeruuuus as the final student neville ran out slamming the door behind him snape turned towards the cry of the cheese spirit face hardening in resolve snape planted his feet and readied his wand staring down the grotesque vision of the cheese spirit as it ran knocking things over as it went shrieking and flapping its arms like a voodoo priest its short legs bending at odd moments it might have been an impressive sight really a small violent demon running straight at a powerful wizard however this was a demon made of cheese and a powerful wizard who d lost his mind and was wearing a cheesy um dorky christmas sweater that took away most of his intimidation factor harry hermione and draco all turned to watch nervously as the cheese spirit suddenly made a flying leap at snape hey calm down everyone calm down it okay it locked in there ron was doing his best to calm down the screaming slytherins and gryffindors who d come pouring into the hall well he really only cared about the gryffindors but the slytherins were there it locked in ron repeated snape and harry and hermione will sort it out ron fred and george who d been spying on the class since long before the cheese spirit appearance had seen the whole thing and hadnthad time to run for it before the class had run for the door and forced ron and the twins back cutting off their exit to the first floor the slytherins now stood on one side of the three weasleys the side leading towards their common room while the gryffindors stood on the side of the corridor that would take them to the entrance hall what the hell was that thing parvati gasped harry and hermione are still in there neville exclaimed worriedly hey if anyone can deal with it it harry and hermione lavender said ron shot her a dirty look and ron she added quickly dontworry guys we re all safe and i sure ron broke off he could hear the evil cackle of the cheese spirit from inside and he shook his head nervously and stepped away from the door just in case i sure they can handle it neville go get dumbledore will you he ought to know about this yeah sure neville ran off at top speed what do we do parvati asked wringing her hands we wait here ron said trying to sound more certain than he felt for now all we can do is wait for the all clear if it sounds like it getting worse in there then we ll go back in and give them backup forget that blaise zabini spat i out of here hey draco is still in there pansy yelled at him so we cantjust leave him hey you want to go back in there and fight some freakish demon creature be my guest snapped theodore nott pansy narrowed her eyes at him fine leave i ll be sure to tell draco you guys left suddenly none of the slytherins were too eager to leave ron rolled his eyes at the slytherins and turned to dean seamus parvati and lavender i sure they ll be fine guys he told the gryffindors harry and hermione have handled a lot worse i so glad you re here ron george said latching onto ron arm and pasting a mock terrified expression on his face you re such a big strong take charge kind of guy yes you ll protect us wontyou fred asked tremulously grabbing ron other arm his eyes darting around as though looking for the demon oh shut up ron growled trying to shake the twins off his arms oh my god what is that fred screamed suddenly aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh the rest of the class shrieked and without a single backwards glance gryffindors and slytherins alike took off running leaving the three weasleys alone in the corridor both fred and george burst out laughing releasing ron and clutching the wall for support oh that was priceless fred wheezed good one fred george gasped i surrounded by idiots ron muttered throwing up his hands and turning to watch the door warily harry hermione and draco stared as the cheese spirit flew closer and closer to snape and then juusto and just like that the cheese spirit was knocked out of the air it landed in an unconscious heap on the floor in front of snape who smirked down at it ha he gloated pointing his wand at its body i was ready for you this time wasnti dorwilaron you you cheese flinging bastard you hahaha he looked up at the three students dontworry it okay i know how to get rid of dorwilaron here dorwilaron hermione repeated yes dorwilaron the dairy demon dorwilaron the dairy demon snape nodded rather solemnly that what i called it harry hermione and draco gave him a funny look you named it draco said faintly snape rolled his eyes and glowered at draco i messed up a potions ingredient and conjured a dairy demon and i figured it needed a name since it was locked in my wardrobe for six hours while i looked up the spell to fix the whole mess i swore i d never do something that stupid again taking in the looks draco hermione and harry were giving him snape finally frowned i was ten years old okay he turned to draco what your excuse by the way was hermione not giving you enough trouble so you figured you d literally make some or did you just have a cheese craving draco glared at snape i thought you were lying so i decided to prove it snape gaped at him then laughed the old snape laugh all bitter sarcasm draco if i told you that pointing your wand at yourself and saying an incantation would kill you would you try to prove me wrong by doing it how stupid can you be idiot boy how could you even think about trying it hermione snapped at draco the gods only know what you ve done to harry i dontcare what i ve done to potter i care what i ve done to me draco retorted looking mortified at the thought that his cheese spirit bite could have side effects what kind of idiot brews a potion with those ingredients hermione demanded the caffeine in the root beer would have caused a negative reaction on the rose petals and everyone knows that rose petals are used to make spirits appear and all the extra love herbs you used coriander ginger vanilla and that not to say anything of the other stuff nutmeg and anise what are you talking about granger draco snapped d you have any idea what in root beer hermione told him fairly shouting now all sorts of herbs most of them used to enhance divination and psychic ability or for love potions well there is some consolation snape muttered at least it bit him what does that mean harry demanded in a panic my god what happening to malfoy hermione asked odd parts of his skin and hair were turning a shade of pink that slowly darkened to a beautiful shade of fuchsia that would be the bite snape said wearily if it bites you any part of your body that it touched or bit turns my hand harry wailed my hair draco wailed and grabbed a glass bottle off of a nearby table to check his reflection aaaahhhhhhhhh it goes away dontworry snape said hastily when draco shouted when my head is pink again well the pink goes away in about six hours if i remember correctly snape said the corners of his mouth twitching in amusement then it turns the color of white cheese then yellow cheese over a space of about six hours then it becomes a sort of moldy green for another hour i think regardless it only lasts for about thirteen hours only harry roared only well compared to the other problems the bite causes this is quite minimal what other problems draco demanded well as granger said the root beer causes a lot of problems where did you find a can of barq root beer anyway draco frowned dobby i went to the kitchens when you let me go to the bathroom you went to the kitchens with malfoy during class harry asked hermione incredulously as he dug a dragon hide glove out of his pocket and covered up his pink hand no i was dragged to the kitchens hermione replied glaring at malfoy what are the other problems draco repeated worriedly heading for his desk and seizing his hat then pulling it as low over his head as he could well the most annoying parts as i recall were the psychic visions they re quite bothersome mostly because they usually dontmake sense in the slightest as for the other effect well who were you visualizing draco what you followed the directions exactly yeah then who did you visualize as the intended recipient while you spoke the love poem draco blinked i didntvisualize anyone he said draco had been too busy worrying that granger would catch on to what he was doing and muck it up to remember that he was supposed to visualize a girl that he wanted to make fall in love with him did you potter did you think of anyone while he said the poem no then you re probably both safe from the other side effects snape said so dontworry about them the visions are more annoying than anything else you ll see a flash of the future or something just a jumble of images that probably wontmake sense until it happens for real that goes away after about a week you might also spout miniature prophecies a line or two about the future hopefully if neither of you visualized anyone the effect should be lessened and ignore any strange dreams for the next week or so okay harry and draco just sort of stared at him in horror um right hermione said back to the point what happens to the cheese spirit i say we toss it in the fire draco said tugging his hat down a bit more and rubbing his shoulder it a demon though isntit would that even work harry asked no it wouldn t snape replied there is only one way to get rid of it as i discovered twenty nine years ago and it is most certainly not pleasant wow a demon banishing ritual hermione said her eyes lighting up can i help that would be so interesting there is something seriously wrong with you draco said giving her an annoyed look shut it pinky actually snape said ignoring the argument you will all have to help this particular ritual requires four people i had to enlist avery and the lestrange brothers the death eaters harry said sharply they were the only people i had who d help me with it snape told him shrugging they were friends of mine children of my father friends well we had best get started he said and turned towards the door where are you going hermione asked to find an unsuspecting student to rope into banishing the cheese spirit snape replied cheerfully i swore once we d banished it that i would never ever have to do it again well technically he added pulling open the classroom door i swore i would never be stupid enough to conjure it in the first pla weasley just the man i wanted to see snape who d opened the door to find three weasleys standing in the hallway who now all wore nervous expressions grinned at the sight of them and grabbed ron by the arm pulling him into the classroom you can be the fourth person for the banishment ritual snape said marching ron over to the unconscious demon on the floor hey there no way i going anywhere near that thing ron said crossing his arms over his chest especially not to help those three he sneered at harry hermione and draco oh you ll do it weasley snape said in a pleasant tone or there will be serious consequences draco blinked looking up at snape the only teacher in the school who actually liked him who favored him above harry and hermione the only teacher he felt was really on his side threatening a weasley even while wearing his bizarre christmas sweater and bells and smiling i knew it draco yelled running forward and flinging his arms around snape you really are still an evil slytherin bastard everyone just sort of stared including snape yes well we evil slytherin bastards dontusually hug you know snape said in disgust patting draco on the back awkwardly can we banish the demon now please hermione said i really want to see how it done and we have another class right after lunch plus that just disturbing harry said nodding at draco who was still hugging snape yes we d better snape said and frowned trying to remember the banishment ritual right now i believe professor vector might have some colored ink we could borrow and we ll ask the house elves to make draco a necklace of garlic bulbs what draco demanded stepping back immediately fred and george who d been hanging back in the doorway trying to decide if they should leave before something bad happened or stay and watch the action immediately came into the room and shut the door behind them sitting down together on one of the tables oh there no way we re missing this fred said grinning his head off minerva are you there mcgonagall jumped and spun to face the classroom fireplace where snape head sat smiling at her in the same creepy way he d been smiling yesterday hello severus she said wearily i giving my second years their exam what sorry to interrupt snape said nodding at the class who promptly looked confused at his apologetic nature but i need to talk to you about granger and malfoy i need you to reschedule their exam mcgonagall arched an eyebrow why oh the reason not important i just need them here for a while and i dontthink they ll be fit to take an exam today tell me mcgonagall growled tired of never getting any answers and it had better not have anything to do with this prank war or so help me severus letting her sentence hang mcgonagall rubbed the bridge of her nose waiting for an answer snape gave her a nervous smile well i told my morning class about the first potion i ever made and how it went wrong well now draco wearing a garlic necklace while granger and potter draw symbols on his face what mcgonagall spluttered startled whispers and giggles erupted from the class causing mcgonagall to snap around quickly glaring at them sharply before turning back to the fireplace when the whispers disappeared it a long story a sudden scream which sounded strangely like fred weasley and was only slightly muffled by coming through the floo network cut snape off argh the cheese spirit awake run came draco malfoy panicked voice yes well i ll tell you later snape said worriedly and quickly disappeared end notes ah the lovely cheese spirit chapter my best friend freyja silverwillow was an enormous help writing this one and from what i understand it become one of the most memorable things about this one of my all time favorite chapters and i especially proud of the original posting of this story this chapter was the one for which i received review number one thousand god that seems like eons ago anyway for those of you who might wonder where the hell i got this i know some of you ask where i get my ideas on occasion i ve decided to include the story once upon a time my dear friend freyja and i were talking to this guy who was quite a nuisance but very entertaining the way movies on mystery science theatre are entertaining he d asked us to teach him to do magic saying that he d always been intrigued by the idea of wicca this idea made us very frightened as this guy using said skills was quite terrifying and possibly no definitely dangerous possibly deadly so we gave him a long list of books hoping he would never read up on it and as such never start playing with things like magic well naturally he contacts us a few days later to say he used cheese and a candle in a spell and something went wrong imagine that and now there was a creepy spirit in his house who wouldntleave now freyja and i were certain this was a horrid attempt to be funny or to play a practical joke but there was also a chance a much larger chance than with a normal person that he d actually done something involving a candle cheese and magic and was now convinced in other words hallucinating or paranoid that there was a malevolent spirit in his house well we did the only thing we could do we invented a fake demon banishing ritual and told him that performing it would get rid of his problem the ritual was quite hysterical it included things such as covering all the furniture in the house in garlic eating more cheese of a different brand a goofy chant and symbols to draw all over his skin this may have been slightly cruel of us but we knew that there was almost no chance that a spirit would be conjured with cheese and a green candle and almost no chance that he really did the counter spell okay there a huge possibility he did the counter spell because he just was that brand of dense anyway that was where the cheese spirit came from a whacked out guy whose furniture now reeks of garlic antics with him show up in many a story actually another thing i wanted to mention was that freyja silverwillow and i did actually look up the ingredients for root beer and then cross referenced those ingredients with the magical properties of herbs apparently there really is a lot of stuff in root beer that used in love spells such as coriander and sarsaparilla go figure finally thanks to adel for pointing out my mistake in chapter twenty one regarding the toast story it has since been fixed chapter twenty five the banishment of dorwilaron the dairy demon hold still shut up granger if you donthold still i going to poke you in the eye with the quill if you get that thing anywhere near my eye i ll ow oops hermione said innocently hermione sighed and pulled the quill back from draco face shortly after snape had drawn ron into the room and the twins had invited themselves along snape had unearthed an old book that he d gotten the banishing ritual from which informed them that they d need to brew a potion draw magical symbols on draco in certain colors of ink and place a necklace of garlic bulbs around draco neck before starting a simple chant and process that would destroy the cheese spirit snape had given the twins the task of brewing the potion they were rather good at potion brewing given their skills with inventing joke shop merchandise even though snape would never admit their talent and had gotten out the necessary ingredients before forcing ron to make a list of anything that they might still need for the ritual while helping harry and hermione begin the process of drawing symbols needless to say no one was very happy you did that on purpose draco yelled squinting one eye closed in pain gee do you think ron said rolling his eyes but unable to suppress a grin currently snape had told them all to stay put and left to go get some colored ink from professor vector as they only had black in the classroom and naturally the twins had left to go to the kitchen to grab some food using the fact that someone needed to ask dobby to make them a garlic bulb necklace for draco as their excuse meanwhile ron looked up some of the book more interesting spells and harry held draco still which involved pinning his arms behind his back while hermione drew the rune of elhaz inverted and inside a circle on each of draco cheeks or tried to anyway not only was the chain making things difficult but draco was not by nature a cooperative person if you donthold still this isntgoing to work hermione snapped so snape can just lock the cheese spirit in a trunk or something why dontwe lock it in yours harry muttered good idea that way i can let it out while you sleep oh shut up malfoy hermione said in exasperation just then the twins reappeared dumping a load of food on a table there you go ickle ronnie poo fred teased patting his brother head while ron glared yes we know ow cwanky ou get when ou get hungwy george added with a smirk isntit time for you two to go home ron growled picking up an clair and biting into it we cantabandon our friends and family in their time of need fred exclaimed feigning shock we would never oh shit is the potion still simmering he and george rushed over to the cauldron in which they were brewing the ritual potion please dont screw that up hermione said wearily i want this over with yeah i have quidditch prac ow stop talking malfoy you re messing me up for the sixteenth time hermione erased the screwed up design with a quick spell and started over i going to really mess you up in a minute draco growled of all of them he was the most annoyed but then that was to be expected it isnteasy to allow your mortal enemy to draw on you while anticipating chants and necklaces of garlic why are you drawing a peace sign on malfoy george asked hermione it the inverted rune of elhaz in a circle she explained absently the peace sign is an inverted rune in a circle george repeated no yes oh shut up and brew the potion hermione moaned as malfoy moved once again causing her to ruin the design harry this isnt working i know harry sighed then he brightened i have an idea let shove him against the wall to pin his arms and then i can hold his head still what that a great idea harry donteven think about oof the next thing draco knew he was pinned against the stone wall harry elbow in his gut and harry free hand attempting to hold draco head still draco was having none of it however this is ridiculous draco roared as he jerked his head around as hard as possible to avoid hermione quill which wasnteasy with harry hand on his head let just throw it in the fire it ll work there no need to do all this stupid crap i say we stun him harry said as he struggled against draco we d have to do it over and over again and repeated stunning within a short period of time can cause lasting damage hermione said sadly so harry replied bluntly so i saving that idea until he no longer chained to my wrist hermione replied he annoying enough without further brain damage for the next few moments the three weasleys watched in amusement as harry and draco had a miniature war and hermione accidentally made little black dots all over draco face by jabbing him with the quill well accidentally might be the wrong word at last hermione pulled back exasperated we ve got to find a way to restrain him better she told harry the binding curse wears off too fast the full body bind so does that and he wouldntbe maneuverable well that settles it help me wrestle him to the ground after much screaming from draco and laughing from the twins ron and occasionally harry and hermione draco lay on the floor his arms pinned down by hermione legs as she sat on his chest and his legs held still by harry who was sitting on them calmly while eating some of the food the twins had brought this is the only way to deal with malfoy harry said as he reached for another cauldron cake i swear potter i ll get you for ow damn it granger it slipped she insisted in the same innocent tone she used to defend herself every time the quill stabbed him painfully now hold still with her left hand hermione forced his head to the side and began to draw with the right draco went limp finally admitting to himself that it had to be done and would be over faster if he gave up the fight within about thirty seconds hermione had drawn the rune elhaz on each of his cheek upside down within a circle which truly did look exactly like a peace sign okay she said brushing her hair out of her face she swallowed and addressed ron without looking at him ron was still mad at her and would only speak to her when absolutely necessary and even then he used a frosty tone what next ron skimmed over the page draw the rune dagaz on the castor forehead using black ink he recited coldly hermione giggled dagaz the one that looks like a bow fred asked incredulously grinning his head off what draco yelped hermione firmly placed her palm on his forehead to hold him still and drew dagaz with relish hee hee it really does look like a bow she said poking draco in the temple with the quill for the fun of it i ll get you for this draco growled on the left side of dagaz draw ehwaz and on the other mannaz ron told hermione what do they look like harry asked eagerly like the letter m basically hermione said they re only slightly different um left as in my left or malfoy left er malfoy left i guess but what if they mean hermione left harry said how about dagaz left dagaz has a left how do you know which side is its left yeah you cant tell if it facing towards malfoy or away from malfoy yeah it symmetrical i sure it doesntmatter well if it does matter it could be a big deal couldntit well ehwaz is the female rune and mannaz is the male so given the traditional association of the male with the right and the female with the left doesnthelp us if we dontknow where left is haha you re drawing a female rune on him if your conversation is going to be even more boring could you scoot back a little granger i cantsee down your shirt prope ow if you ever say anything like that again i going to put this quill through your brain everyone laughed save draco nah that wouldntwork mione fred said his head too thick then i ll use something sharper she growled why wait for provocation george said good point hermione said thoughtfully and glanced around the room as if hoping someone had left a sword lying around apparently no one had brought a sword to class however the most weapon like instruments were quills left by the students who d fled she sighed then smiled slightly for just a moment things had been back to normal ron had smiled and laughed at her threat and it had been gryffindors against malfoy just like before she forced thoughts of her row with ron away and looked back at draco critically well she said ehwaz and mannaz are both really similar so i ll just draw as much of them as i can without knowing what they mean by left and ask snape what goes where when he gets back when hermione had completed her drawings she leaned back again to gaze at them critically good thing i never dropped ancient runes she remarked could you get off me now draco said listlessly no hermione said reluctantly i not dragging you to the floor again and we re just going to have to draw on you some more draco sighed so i ll hold still hermione snorted in response and draco rolled his eyes just then the fireplace flared green again and snape appeared carrying a box ah he said nodding at harry hermione and draco you ve started the drawing already good idea letting him lay down holding still while my friends drew on me was quite tiresome draco glared at him and the gryffindors tried to suppress their laughter so you really did this yourself fred asked unlike the others fred and george were taking snape bizarre new attitude in stride not only had they just won a hell of a lot of money off lee jordan for how long it would take snape to crack but they were masters of weird yes snape said smiling slightly it was rather funny looking back did professor vector have the ink professor hermione asked snape nodded yes though explaining why i needed it took some work well here you go hermione he set the box of ink down next to her which side of dagaz does ehwaz go on hermione asked him on draco left snape said at least that where we put it on me hermione giggled at the thought of snape with three runes across his forehead and peace signs on his cheeks and went back to finishing the drawings of the male and female runes why does she get to draw on malfoy face fred said sulkily nodding at harry and hermione as he poured some rosemary oil into the cauldron set up in the middle of the room it looks like a lot more fun than this because the last time i went near a potion a cheese spirit jumped out of it hermione said wryly so you re trusting us to do it fred said he paused and looked up at his twin confused george stared back also startled at the realization that anyone would trust them to do something so important trust snape repeated frowning snape promptly hurried over to the cauldron and dismissed the twins worriedly the twins smirked and sat down to watch the face painting hermione leaned back again ehwaz and mannaz having been carefully completed well that done she said looking down at her drawings proudly what next you need to come up with seven symbols relating to the poem snape said absently he was carefully inspecting the potion everyone just sort of stared blankly you mean like if he said something about love we d draw a heart or something hermione said wrinkling her nose yes hermione frowned how did the poem go again malfoy i am never saying it again thank you hermione rolled her eyes we need seven symbols what all was in it draco gritted his teeth he didntwant to mention the poem again ever but if he kept quiet he d never get hermione off his chest and she d probably jab him with the quill again all sorts of stuff he said grudgingly i barely remember it wine fire the sea girly shit like that that only three i need more hermione mouth twitched with amusement while the guys laughed outright honey draco growled er cheese love the bitter taste filled his mouth again and bunnies that seven hermione joined in the guys laughter where do the symbols go professor she asked on his chest snape told her have him take off his shirt wait his chest hermione interrupted yes and i am not drawing on his chest yeah she not drawing on my chest harry you do it hermione begged turning to look over her shoulder at him he not drawing on me either yeah i not drawing on him either please harry er how about we all draw straws how about you two draw straws ron said firmly i like that idea better er i cant draw harry said quickly i cantdraw very well either hermione insisted but you re a girl you d know how to draw hearts and stuff hermione eyes narrowed dangerously what kind of logic is that harry realized he d said the wrong thing and decided to change the subject fred george you wanted to draw on him right forget it man yeah the appeal has passed ron harry said pleadingly oh hell no ron smirked i have an idea how about you all keep the pointy quill away from my chest at all times i told you this is necessary draco snape said giving him a half smirk half smile i refuse to believe that you actually went through this draco snapped it in the book malfoy ron pointed out his neck and ears red i dontcare have you met the lestrange brothers yeah harry shot back although we werentformally introduced a little too busy trying to kill each other my point is there no way in hell they drew a heart on snape chest it was avery actually snape admitted i recall him being very unhappy about having to draw on me but he was the only one who could draw worth i not letting anyone draw on my chest i ve been through enough today it serves you right hermione snarled and you donthave a choice she pulled out her wand knowing that she d be the only one who would break down and draw on his chest and deciding to just get it over with stupefy she yelled then used the same charm they d been performing to get their shirts on and off to cut his shirt and robes open she tossed the scraps aside and sat back down on his stomach making sure that her knees were sufficiently holding his arms down only then did she notice everyone staring at her in surprise what she demanded glaring around at them all they all looked away hurriedly innocent whistling came from harry direction until he caught himself and stopped draco unfroze a second later why you little he shouted and struggled to sit up lay down hermione snapped shoving him back down i not happy about this either not happy not happy you let me up or so help me this has to be done draco snape cut in smoothly the cheese spirit has to be sent back to its own world what world is that cheese planet dairy land draco tried to sit up again and hermione shoved him back down hard enough to crack his head on the floor draco glowered up at her the moment his eyes regained the ability to focus but didntattempt to get up again deciding he d stick to making comments that he knew would piss her off he said i always figured you were the dominating typ ow granger oh i am sorry hermione said in a deadly sort of tone did i just poke you in the eye again with this sharp pointy sharp sharp quill i holding she held it above his face poised to stab him with it draco glared but didntspeak harry let out a snort of suppressed laughter and hermione turned towards him with a furious look still holding the quill suddenly everyone in the room was perfectly straight faced now hermione growled any particular color or order for these symbols black ink snape said i dontrecall there being any order look it up weasley ron glanced over the page and shook his head just says to draw them start making a list of the colors she ll need for the planets and zodiac symbols snape told him then went back to his work becoming absorbed in the potion process fine ron said reluctantly and got out a piece of parchment from harry bag hermione looked down at draco chest a sour look on her face having to draw on his face was one thing this was quite another frowning even harder hermione tried her best to ignore what was in front of her well technically underneath her it was very apparent the sun did not reach any part of him clothed or not like there was some sort force field around his person with the words thou shalt not color pleasantly tacked on it still that didntkeep her eyes from wandering a bit damn it evil slytherin bastards shouldntbe allowed to look like that the quill she was holding was in danger of snapping in half from her gripping it forcing her hands to stay put and not see if his skin was really as smooth as it looked it malfoy hermione told herself if you violate him in a room full of people these people you d never hear the end of it it malfoy hermione shuddered this was ridiculous good looking or not he was the biggest asshole she d ever met excepting perhaps a few of the death eaters and voldemort himself malfoy didntdeserve a second glance let alone a stare besides it wasntas if it was the nicest chest she d ever seen oliver was much nicer and viktor wasntbad either that put malfoy third on a list of three blinking hermione bit back a groan of despair when she realized just what she was thinking about that was it she absolutely had to start researching the chain thoroughly no matter how suspicious madam pince was of them she d sneak into the library at three a m with harry cloak if she had to she happened to glance at draco face and saw he was smirking his head off at her discomfort he raised an eyebrow at her then yelped when she jabbed him with the quill determined not to let draco see her uneasiness and embarrassment she put the quill to his skin and started to draw the room was completely silent save for the sound of the quill on draco flesh or dipping into the inkwell and the bubbling of the cauldron all three weasleys were now poring over the book and the twins were taking notes which was quite a disturbing thought hermione finally finished the symbols and hurriedly sat back surveying her handiwork the fire wine glass and heart were quite well done though the rabbit she d drawn looked rather like the easter bunny on crack she d done a honey pot a la winnie the pooh for honey a wedge shaped hunk of cheese and little waves for the sea all of which were passable she couldntresist smiling and adding the word hunny on the pot giggling at the muggle reference hermione please dontmake any sort of happy noise when you re drawing on malfoy chest said harry who was sitting with his back to her and couldnttell what she was doing it a tad too creepy oh shut up she muttered holding up the quill threateningly when she saw draco open his mouth to speak he shut it grudgingly as soon as the symbols were done hermione climbed off of draco chest feeling quite like she d just been doing something horribly naughty shuddering slightly hermione picked up the box of colored ink and avoided draco gaze as he sat up and shoved harry off his legs help me do his arms harry hermione said it ll go faster why d you let him up harry said irritably rubbing his shoulder where it had hit the floor i cantdraw on his arms if i kneeling on them hermione said in exasperation figuring that was a much better excuse than sitting on him is too distracting draco held still thankfully while harry and hermione each took an arm ron was given the task of telling them which symbols were meant to be which color while the twins sat by and made comments and asked annoying questions like why that one green that not a planet symbol is it what the hell is chiron isntthat one of pluto moons an asteroid is not a planet didntyou already draw that one they look the same why does virgo look so much like scorpio then which one aries hey dontmake fun of us for being born on april fool day just when hermione was beginning to wonder how much trouble she d get in if she tried to see if a quill would make a good enough javelin to pierce a weasley forehead she put the finishing touches on pluto and pulled back finally she growled are you done yet harry hermione went over to harry side of draco and discovered that not only did he have three left to do he d drawn gemini sideways confused virgo with scorpio and done sagittarius backwards in addition to all of them being rather shaky hermione sighed and held out her hand for his quill i told you i couldntdraw harry said apologetically retreating in relief okay snape said the potion just needs another twenty minutes to boil i ll contact filius and minerva to reschedule today exams for you all the symbols are done hermione said wearily leaning back and changing the color of three of harry drawings that had been readable enough gemini is yellow harry for future reference and aries is red not pink and cancer is silver sorry harry said shrugging he d never really cared for astronomy while snape used the floo network to contact flitwick harry ron hermione and the twins glanced at the book while draco stared sadly at his multi colored skin okay hermione said slowly it looks like we all just stand in a circle around the cheese spirit and malfoy and we hermione was interrupted by a loud cracking noise and they all jumped and turned to point their wands at the unconscious cheese spirit but the sound turned out to be from a different magical creature dobby has the necklace squeaked the little house elf holding out a very strong smelling necklace of garlic bulbs that was longer than dobby was tall draco let out a growl of frustration looking down at his decorated skin before grudgingly accepting the necklace with a muttered thanks and throwing it on dobby stayed only momentarily waiting for snape to come back out of the floo network to ask if there was anything else they d need snape declined and went back to the floo network to contact mcgonagall this is so stupid draco grumbled he made this all up i just know it like he made the potion up eh hermione said rolling her eyes shut up mudblood draco snapped then instantly realized he d said the wrong thing as harry hermione and the three weasleys rounded on him their wands drawn i ve had it with you hermione hissed raising her wand but before she could curse him argh the cheese spirit awake fred shouted run draco yelled heading for the door climbing onto a table in his haste to exit just as he was about to leap off the other side and make a break for it he realized that harry hermione ron fred and george were laughing their heads off oh that was great hermione said clutching a chair for support a few feet away from draco thank you ever so much fred draco glowered tempted to go stomp her fingers the flames in the fireplace disappeared and snape tried to stand up cracking his head on the stone above the grate he staggered to his feet clutching his head with one hand his wand with another seeing the cheese spirit still lying motionless on the floor and the others laughing at draco sour expression he chuckled kids these days he muttered in a fond sort of tone well he called let get a move on all right the potion should be just about done yes it already turned green come on then fred and george moved out of the way sitting down near snape desk while snape directed harry ron hermione and draco to stand around the cheese spirit in the center aisle draco made a few last muttered complaints and then took his place next to dorwilaron in the middle of the triangle formed by harry ron and hermione harry took the cauldron and threw some of its contents upon the cheese spirit alluette mauntrooet he intoned jabini jabini jabini draco recited in a monotonous voice harry tossed a little more of the potion upon dorwilaron suddenly a green wall of smoke surrounded the four of them swirling about them like living flame hermione stared at it with interest before saying her line evil has not beat me yet she said her tone laced with excitement jabini jabini jabini draco said nervously wondering if he could make a break for it through the smoke or if it had some sort of magical properties that would contain him the smoke began to pale slowly fading from moldy green to white harry sloshed almost all of the remaining potion upon the cheese spirit and looked at ron any spirits who are here ron said sounding as nervous as draco and edging away from the smoke slightly even as it turned clear jabini jabini jabini draco muttered squeezing his eyes shut harry tossed the remainder of the potion right into draco face may you now disappear all four of them yelled draco spitting and coughing the whole time a low rumbling noise like an approaching stampede of bison began building louder and louder until it seemed they would all go deaf snape suddenly dove behind his desk fred and george looked at him then at each other and promptly dashed for the door they were too late however the thunderous noise promptly stopped and with a loud pop the cheese spirit exploded foul smelling cheese flew in every direction coating the entire room in hot sticky nasty globs of it everyone froze shocked cheese dripping off of all of them snape peeked out from behind his desk grinning ha he said cheerfully thank god i remembered that part you could have warned us you know hermione told him dryly well i er remembered at the last second you see yeah everyone turned to glare at him well fred said to george a large hunk of cheese falling from fred hair and landing on the floor with a soft plop i think it would be a good idea if we left now author notes i apologize for my absence comp went boom comp finally just got fixed couldntremember where i d saved my hp files have now drawn map to the prank war through mass of folders and subfolders should be reposting a lot more in recent days and as i said in the original notes the runes mentioned in this chapter are actual runes still read today by pagans psychics and the like one can view more about runes at twilight planet the link to which is in my home page space on my profile just enter the site and click divination also some of you might know the runes under different names and or spellings that just something that happens in divination the runes names are translated from the original language so they re bound to be different depending on the source chapter twenty six quidditch practice part 1 what the hell is wrong with you hermione raged as she harry and draco headed into the empty common room are you insane i had to prove he was lying draco snapped shut up will you what did it matter if he was lying hermione yelled couldntyou have picked a better way to prove it other than brewing a potentially dangerous potion you dontget it draco shouted i have to figure out what wrong with him he must be stopped draco began to pace back and forth as best he could while chained to hermione what could have happened to him he muttered weasel mouthed off to him he disappeared all weekend and draco stopped frowning he came back happy his jaw suddenly dropped and a look of horror so complete washed over his face that harry and hermione stared at him nervously oh my god draco breathed turning to look at hermione in total mortification snape got laid harry eyes widened and he turned to look at hermione too waiting for her to use her cool logic and assure him that no snape never did anything as normal as have sex and she completely misinterpreted the look what are you looking at me for she demanded harry had the good sense to shake his head emphatically and stammer that he hadnt meant anything by it but draco had never exactly been the most perceptive when it came to hermione moods it was you admit it he yelled pointing at her accusingly this just proves it you ve been shagging him for ages for months it was all you you ve driven snape to madness first off you re a complete idiot to believe that i would even think about doing that with him it was a prank you stupid prat and second off i ve been chained to your annoying ass all weekend so i couldnteven possibly be an option option what harry was looking positively green hermione looked at him expression sour you re not helping you know ha draco yelled jabbing his finger at her wildly bits of cheese falling off of his arms dontthink you can fool me you have some secret way to get the chain off dontyou dontyou admit it if i could get this damned thing off i would never put it back on oh suuuuuuuure granger suuuuuuuuure you ve been taking the chain off every night to go screw your greasy over the hill boyfriend and then you come back before i wake up because because draco paused stumped momentarily thinking hard a look of realization finally dawned on his face because you re trying to seduce me what harry and hermione both shouted incredulously harry burst out laughing but draco continued to rant i ve figured you out now granger you ve got a fetish for bad boys that what it is you like your guys dangerous and now you want me you probably put the little weasel and thomas up to that duel just to get to me well i onto you now granger it ll never happen i dontcare how hot you are argh draco slapped his hands over his mouth looking disgusted with him himself hermione stared at him her mouth opening and closing several times as she fought to find something to say unable to come up with a dignified response she turned her wide half crazed eyes to a still laughing harry harry she said pleadingly i canttake much more of this i just can t i we the chain must come off she roared and then cutting through the haze of madness came ginny voice calm and serious just like it had been when the chain had first appeared hermione if we cantfigure out how to get the chain off then we ll cut off malfoy arm okay hermione froze the logic hitting her soothingly and then she dived forward and sank her teeth into draco wrist draco let out a rather girly scream of pain and terror and began to beat his free hand against hermione back and head hermione doing her best to bite through his arm and not getting very far between his robes shirt muscle and the nasty taste of the rancid cheese covering his arm harry hung back torn between saving hermione from a trip to azkaban for biting off draco hand and watching with glee eventually hermione realized that draco wrist simply wasntcoming off so she figured there was only one thing left to do strangle him and then cut off his arm once he was dead then she could get his end of the chain off and just turn the damned thing into a pretty bracelet hermione released his arm spat out a mouthful of cheese and torn robes gave herself a second to stare sadly at his arm she hadnteven broken the skin how distressing and then attempted to get him in a chokehold draco however ran for it still screaming in a high pitched feminine wail but of course he couldntexactly get away with the person intent on chewing his arm off attached to him by the very thing that drove her to this kind of insanity hermione chased after him her arms outstretched and combined with her crazed expression making her look like a very fast moving zombie harry watched tears of laughter streaming down his face as if watching them chase each other wasntenough they were both still covered in globs of hot cheese draco still had ink drawings on his face and when his hat fell off as they leaped over the couch one could see that half of his skin and hair was a bright shocking pink ah what the hell harry muttered to himself she deserves a bit of fun dodging around draco and hermione harry headed over to the guestroom to get a fresh change of clothes intent upon hitting the showers harry returned from the showers just before dinnertime to find small groups of people standing a few steps up on each dormitory staircase watching with amusement as hermione continued to chase draco around the only difference in the scene was that draco was no longer screaming saving his breath for running and most of the furniture and tables had been knocked over hey harry called fred who was standing on the boys dormitory staircase with george both of them now clean of cheese and watching with amusement ron was right next to them apparently the twins had decided they just couldntstay away from hogwarts for long in the middle of a prank war want to place a bet fred asked so far odds are in favor of hermione four to one george added harry rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand eight spells a lot of disappointed gryffindors and two showers later draco and hermione were preparing for quidditch practice neither of them speaking much draco with a large bandage covering the bruise hermione jaws had inflicted upon his arm just above the invisible chain cuff and a tight black toboggan covering most of the color stains in his hair are you sure you dontwant me to come hermione harry asked for the sixth time as she tied a scarf around her neck and pulled on one of her hand knit caps dumbledore said a teacher would be there hermione told him wearily just focus on your exams harry didntbother to point out the fact that studying without hermione was pretty much useless and let it go he accompanied her and draco down to the kitchens for a quick bite to eat and then split up from her in the entrance hall harry heading back to gryffindor tower and hermione and draco leaving for the quidditch pitch a foot of snow was covering the ground and the wind chilled them both to the bone hermione pulled her cloak tighter around herself swallowing at the sight of the six hulking trolls who formed the rest of the slytherin quidditch team hey draco crabbe called smirking at hermione brought us something new for bludger practice unfortunately not draco growled causing hermione to stare at him in surprise he ignored her the little mudblood here has to share a broom with me and as i ve told you lot a thousand times i d better not see one single bludger aimed at me understand granger has to share your broom a slytherin sixth year blurted out dont you want to cancel practice then no i dontwant to cancel practice draco growled because unfortunately you people cantplay quidditch worth a damn which is usually the captain fault hermione muttered how would you know you little sorry i late called a new voice interrupting draco and hermione let out a small groan of all the teachers who could have been picked to oversee the practice dumbledore had picked oliver she supposed that technically he d know the most about quidditch after hooch or maybe even more than hooch but the last thing she needed to deal with right now was oliver what are you doing here draco snapped keeping an eye on your pathetic excuse for a quidditch team oliver shot back he turned to hermione you okay hermione grinned at him weakly and nodded at least she knew that if any of the slytherins tried anything funny oliver would pull a harry or maybe even a ron draco didntmiss the kind look oliver was giving her or the little grins they shared he snorted in disgust what is it with you and teachers granger what oliver said blinking and turning to look at him startled will you stop with the whole snape thing hermione screamed making everyone but draco who was quite used to her yelling by now cringe back i am not shagging snape i d think the fact that i just tried to chew off one of your major appendages would prove it everyone stared goyle scratched his head in confusion and a few of the smarter slytherins frowned thoughtfully um oliver said wondering exactly just what that meant which major appendage are we talking about here oh donteven try to play innocent draco yelled ignoring oliver you re shagging wood you re shagging snape and you re i am not shagging snape hermione screamed so loudly that her voice echoed around the grounds ha so you admit to shagging wood do you no oliver fought off a grin dontbother denying it everyone knows now shagging any other teachers hagrid flitwick dumbledore is that why you get such good grades ow hermione had grabbed oliver broom right from his hands and walloped draco in the head with it how sick can you be hermione shouted you shut your mouth or so help me i ll kill you in your sleep oh right i would ve already tried to kill you in your sleep but you never do sleep you re always shagging someone goody two shoes my ass and you re trying to seduce me i know it oliver pinched the bridge of his nose trying desperately not to laugh they both looked like complete raving lunatics and it didnthelp that draco who wasntas gifted with spells as hermione and as such had been unable to erase the ink drawings by magic had faded symbols and what looked like pale pink slowly fading dye all over his face the slytherin quidditch team who werentexactly the brightest people in the school watched with a mixture of amusement shock horror and nervousness i wouldntseduce you if my life depended on it ha you know you want me hermione raised oliver broom once again but this time draco was ready for her blocking her blow with his nimbus 2001 before anyone could blink the two of them were locked in a vicious sword er broom fight twigs and snow flying as they once again battled it out hey hey oliver shouted getting whacked four times before managing to shove the two of them apart he seized his beloved broom back from hermione are you crazy this is a firebolt 2 autographed by shaun lambdin do you have any idea what this is worth hermione rolled her eyes and oliver glanced around singling out a nearby slytherin hey you with the crappy broom the slytherin stepped forward reluctantly and oliver snatched the broom away here you go he said handing it to hermione perfectly good cleansweep nine hermione gave him a dirty look but was unable to resist smiling at him typical boy always obsessed with quidditch and speaking of quidditch obsessed boys hermione tossed the broom aside and pulled her wand draco had drawn his own before she could get off a curse however and she paused she d already spent most of her day suffering because of misused magic and she didntreally want to get oliver in any more trouble who knew what would happen to him if anyone found out how much he d been covering for them for the past few days drop your wand hermione told draco and oh goyle said suddenly that what she meant by major appendage did she really try to chew yours off draco something about his words seemed to make it click with the other slytherins you let her close enough to try crabbe said in amazement she a mudblood are you mad blaise zabini exclaimed you let her live theodore nott said gaping at draco incredulously hermione closed her eyes absolutely mortified oh god what was she going to say when this got back to harry and ginny and ron oliver couldnthelp it he burst out laughing somehow that made it twice as bad in hermione mind the slytherins thought she d tried to bite off draco major appendage why had she used that to describe his arm and for all she knew oliver did too and he thought it was funny can we play quidditch now hermione groaned she bit my arm you idiots draco growled my arm there were a few moments of silence as the slytherins mulled this over uh why would she bite your arm crabbe asked yeah that doesnt make any sense goyle said come on draco we re your friends blaise said with a smirk you can tell us the truth draco glared at blaise so furiously that blaise decided to examine something off in the distance with an innocent look on his face for the last time draco spat it was my arm hermione sighed i want to go home no one stopping you draco snapped you are stopping me you horrible little prick hermione screamed you you you you draco grinned knowing that no one else knew about the chain but oliver and therefore they would have no idea what she meant the slytherins would have no idea how draco was preventing her from going home ah so you do want me well i sorry granger but it never gonna happen oh shut up hermione snapped if i had a galleon for every time you ve checked me out in the past seven years i could buy hogwarts draco jaw dropped surely she hadntever actually caught him did he really do it that often of course not and it wasntlike he d really been doing it for seven years he hadn t just since that prank since he d noticed that she actually had a good body well okay the yule ball had really done a lot too but aha somebody looks guilty hermione gloated draco panic changed instantly to rage she d tricked him and in front of six of his mates well as close to mates as one could find in slytherin anyway he could already hear blaise and theodore struggling to keep their laughter in draco leaped forward itching to wrap his hands around her throat until she turned an interesting shade of purple he didntget far however he literally ran into oliver who d stepped in front of her still chuckling slightly as amusing as this truly is oliver said trying to sound stern and failing i have things to do start your practice or call it off malfoy draco glared at oliver dying to say something but knowing better wood might be a gryffindor a psycho and a jerk who shagging granger draco reminded himself but he still a teacher one who on granger side fine draco snapped snatching the box containing the quidditch balls from blaise everyone in the air he called releasing the snitch the quaffle and one bludger standard drills the other six members of the slytherin team kicked off from the ground as best they could in the snow and draco turned to hermione after a long pause draco grudgingly held out his nimbus 2001 though he didntwant hermione anywhere near him or his broom he needed a bit of a good moment and flying was one of the few things that made him happy get on he snapped hermione stared at the broom panic rising within her she d taken the required flying courses in her earlier years but she d never been very good at it and had been terrified the whole time the only other times she d flown had been on buckbeak and that thestral and neither of those times had been too much fun for her flying courses and magical creatures were nothing like quidditch either what was she going to do she couldntget on a broom with draco malfoy get on draco repeated no she shrieked in a panic granger we ve been through this dumbledore dumbledore makes mistakes he only human i not getting on yes you are draco shouted what if i push you off huh you ever think about that you re chained to me you push me off we both die well that wasnt comforting and it hadntworked either but but she looked at oliver who knew she wasnta fan of flying and gave her a sympathetic look i here he said softly i wontlet anything happen to you hermione took a deep breath of course oliver wouldntlet her get hurt she smiled weakly relieved but she forced herself not to take comfort in his presence it was a moment between them one she didntwant to have not when her boyfriend was mad at her and oliver was her professor and malfoy was chained to her and life was unbelievably hellish hermione suddenly felt a little foolish where was her gryffindor courage how could she be scared of a broom she d faced voldemort and death eaters and three headed dogs and giants and centaurs and so on surely she could handle a broom it wasnteven invisible like thestrals were she could do this she could do this she could damn it why her reluctantly moving about as fast as a person who was asked politely to sit in an electric chair hermione threw her leg over the broom move back draco snapped and hermione scooted as far away from the front of the broom as she could get without the tail twigs poking her in the butt draco sat down in front of her as far to the front as possible while still allowing him space to steer we have to kick off at the same time draco said sourly or this wontwork we re too heavy on the count of three kick one two three draco pushed off with his legs as hard as he could the front end of the broom jerked up maybe an inch but the rest stayed put and draco nearly jumped right off his broom his grip on the broom was the only thing that kept him from slipping sideways and landing in the snow he slammed back down onto the broom quite painfully and let out a loud scream oliver burst out laughing ah the other hazards of quidditch he gasped it took all of draco willpower not to perform the killing curse on them both right then and there after a long while he turned and glared at hermione over his shoulder if you do that again he growled through gritted teeth i will kill you hermione swallowed reminded for the first time that this was in fact the son of voldemort right hand man and given enough prodding could probably be persuaded to do a lot of horrible things i dont wanna fly she whined well you re gonna with or without a broom he snarled and turned back around now on the count of three kick off this time hermione obeyed but it was such a weak kick that they didntget very far and draco kick off was decidedly less powerful also they struggled to get height oliver following them easily still trying to reign in his laughter hermione gripped the broom handle tightly slowly trying to relax they were holding still more or less as draco scanned the stadium for the snitch she could handle holding still yes holding still was fine for a few moments everything was okay oliver flew over to the slytherin keeper badgering him for his sloppy performance and yelling things like you idiot stay in the middle come on he trying to fake you out if you can let these pathetic excuses for chasers passed you you need to go ah ha draco yelled drowning oliver out he d seen the snitch at last without thinking he aimed the broom in the right direction and they shot forward aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh of course he d forgotten hermione in a panic hermione flung her arms around draco waist clinging for dear life to the only thing she could startled and then outraged draco let go of the broom in an attempt to dislodge her fingers and slowly they started to sink let go we re gonna diiiiiie get off me help help draco look out the single bludger was zooming their way draco yelped and grabbed the broom handle but hermione saw the bludger coming too and tried to lean back while still holding his waist tightly and draco was jerked slightly backwards the top of the line broom which reacted to the slightest touch flew back and up so they missed the bludger but began to back flip in mid air aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh hermione screamed as the broom spun them over six times before draco was able to right it draco let the broom hover and began to struggle with her fingers but hermione was now completely hysterical screaming her head off and clinging to him like a barnacle to a shipwreck oliver who was by their side in an instant spent about ten minutes talking to her soothingly before she realized he was even there the moment she saw him she flung her arms around his neck oh god he really did try to kill me hermione babbled fly kill scary let me on your broom she grabbed the back of oliver broom and started to pull her leg up to climb on and then she caught sight of the ground some fifty feet below aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh she flung her arms back around draco squeezing his chest so hard that he began to gag a few of the quidditch players stopped to watch the comical confusing scene hermione granger clinging tightly to draco him apparently about to throw up and oliver hovering next to them looking pleading um blaise said crabbe cocking his head to the side as he stared d you think all that was true about her liking draco and wood i starting to wonder blaise said to him it appeared that she was hugging draco he couldntsee her face or hear what any of them were saying but draco looked quite nauseous and blaise wondered if oliver was trying to convince her that she didntreally want draco while we re on the subject called one of the chasers why are draco hair and face kind of pink i more curious about those grayish peace signs on his face said theodore back on draco broom hermione was finally starting to calm a little thanks to a long pep talk from oliver who was quite good at such speeches especially after several years as a quidditch captain she finally released draco quite shaky and draco started gulping air she scooted back and grabbed the broom handle in front of her instead her knuckles white from the tightness of her grip okay she said i okay now i right here with you remember that okay oliver said hermione nodded and oliver gaze immediately began to wander back to the slytherin team a wistful expression on his face at the thought of the game the keeper missed another save and oliver rolled his eyes i ll be right back he called absently hermione stared after him in indignation stupid quidditch she growled chapter twenty seven quidditch practice part 2 harry sat in the guestroom looking over his notes for his exams harry couldnt concentrate studying was much less productive without hermione there to keep him on track and help him and he was quite worried about her out there on the pitch supervised by a teacher or not he set his notes down his eyes blurry he had slept reasonably well the night before but that didntmake up for two days of near sleeplessness he hadnt exactly been the most well rested person in the world over the past few years but he d been gradually getting more sleep since voldemort demise and he d started to forget what it was like to go days without a good night rest harry head dropped to his chest and he fell into a light doze within a few moments he was dreaming a pleasant feeling filled him a feminine hand trailing down his chest his arms were around a girl and from what he could tell she was naked or close to it he could feel bare soft skin beneath his fingers but he kept his eyes closed it was more fun that way harry hand glided up the girl back and then his fingers collided with an arm an arm that couldntbe hers it was too large too masculine and in the wrong position to logically be attached to her shoulder harry eyes snapped open saw the bushy hair that could only belong to hermione and behind her was draco harry could only see draco arm face and part of his chest but all were bare he shot a horrified look at hermione who grinned back at him and pressed her lips against his softly then she turned to draco lifting her head up towards his their mouths were soon close enough to kiss harry woke up screaming hermione gripped the broom tightly now mentally berating herself for her fear and for actually clinging to draco malfoy for comfort and berating oliver for being so into quidditch that he d completely forgotten his promise to keep by her side he was still conversing with the slytherin keeper apparently he missed quidditch too much to care if he was affecting gryffindor chances at the cup who came up with this dumb sport hermione muttered to herself if draco heard her he didntacknowledge her she wondered if he d forgotten her presence harry ron ginny and several other people she knew were prone to doing that when it came to quidditch the snitch was proving hard to find apparently he occasionally moved around going slowly probably not wanting to have the crap hugged out of him again she swore to herself that she would keep her cool the next time he put on a burst of speed feeling more confident every time he slowly moved aimlessly to another location and then he saw the snitch again aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh hermione thoughts flew right off the broom along with her resolve to keep cool and she flung her arms around draco from behind again hanging on as tightly as she could draco was torn between his determination to finally catch the snitch and his determination to get her off of him he kept one hand on the broom and tried to use the other to pry her arms away but she would have none of it the broom began to swerve dangerously increasing hermione panic the nimbus 2001 was much faster than thestrals hippogriffs or school brooms even at half speed and the swerving was a lot like a car skidding out of control while going eighty miles an hour closing her eyes hermione screamed gibberish about harry and ron and going into the light and going home while draco screamed gibberish about mudbloods and murder and psycho girls and cheese a particularly jarring turn of the broom jolted hermione eyes open and suddenly she stopped screaming right in front of her was the tiny golden snitch she d never seen it up close before and she couldntremember the last time she d seen anything half as interesting it seemed to glisten its golden form catching the light from the stadium magical illumination its silvery wings bringing angels to mind without thinking hermione sat up releasing draco and gingerly taking hold of the snitch it so beautiful hermione breathed wondering how her friends could go on and on about the finer points of quidditch and never once mention how gorgeous the snitch looked up close draco who was startled by hermione abrupt withdrawal turned to see what she was doing and felt his jaw drop at the sight of her sitting there staring at the snitch which was held carefully between her thumb and forefinger give me that he yelled grabbing at it as best he could from his position no hermione jerked her arm away from him clutching the snitch to her chest and looking like sm agol coveting his precious draco carefully turned and began to yank at her arm hermione used her free hand to smack at him and started yelling for oliver who was too far away to hear the broom began to sink draco tugging harder at her wrist and hermione slapping at him like crazy so is it true hermione has to share a bed with malfoy asked one of ginny roommates a girl that reminded ginny of parvati and lavender ginny sighed inwardly she had decided to catch up on her gossip and take a break from the hermione draco insanity and that meant hanging out with her roommates some of her only other friends well close acquaintances really hermione neville luna lovegood and colin creevey were all closer to ginny than her roommates but ginny did her best to get along well with them in an effort to keep her dorm life from becoming a living hell no it not true ginny said shaking her head at the strange sort of things people speculated on she d been hoping to hear about what was going on in the rest of the school hear who was mad at who that was always useful to know in a prank war and stuff like that but her roommates were far more interested in hearing about hermione draco harry and ron she knew from experience that they wouldnt quit for a good long while people often saw ginny ties to harry ron and hermione as a good way to get dirt on the three most famous people in hogwarts and ginny had become accustomed to staving off rumors about her brother and his two best friends orla quirke said they have to share a bed another of ginny roommates said doubtfully orla quirke is a ravenclaw fourth year ginny said rolling her eyes she never been in gryffindor tower let alone in hermione room i have they have separate beds her roommates all looked disappointed and turned to another topic is it true that hermione dumped ron for harry someone asked ginny fought off a groan why did people always start questions about rumors with is it true it was rare that anyone would believe the truth anyway no she didn t ginny told her hermione and harry are just friends what up with her having a tattoo i dontknow ginny said wearily i ah ha ginny spun around at the yell drawing her wand on reflex like harry ron and hermione she was still prone to jumpiness after the war with voldemort she lowered her wand however at the sight of harry rushing towards her his hair messier than usual his glasses slightly askew and his face flushed and sweaty found you he gasped finally harry what hey harry seized her arm and bodily dragged her down the hall away from her roommates no time tell you later he said must hurry must hurry ginny spluttered at his odd behavior waving good bye to her surprised roommates who had already started whispering no doubt starting a new rumor already harry what is going on she demanded as soon as they were out of earshot is it hermione did malfoy do something where are we going library harry panted ron wonttalk to me hermione at the quidditch pitch i need someone to help me research research what ginny asked but harry didntanswer he pulled her all the way to the library and through the doors then straight to the section on psychic abilities and psychometry seven years of being friends with hermione had forced him to memorize the library layout harry i ll help you look up whatever you re searching for but i need to know what going on ginny told him i need a spell to block psychic visions harry said during his mad dash through the school to find ginny he d run through all the possibilities and remembered with horror that snape had said something about psychic visions being a side effect of the cheese spirit bite ignore any strange dreams for the next week or so he d said but harry didntwant to ignore them he wanted to stop them and somehow he doubted that occlumency would work it blocked psychic attacks not freaky dreams induced by dairy demons he presumed this was some sort of psychic vision but he really didnt give a damn he just wanted to make the visions cease and then make sure they didntcome true of course they wouldntcome true that wouldnthappen not ever that was ridiculous him and hermione and malfoy together ew of course not you had a vision ginny gasped harry didnthave those he d had a connection to voldemort but he d never actually had a vision he d just sort of read voldemort mind yes harry said shortly and i never having one again he dropped the book he was looking at and grabbed her by the upper arms staring into her eyes with a hunted look you have to help me ginny we re friends we ve saved each other lives we play quidditch together you have to help me please help me make it stop if you care about me at all harry calm down before the urge to run screaming away from you gets any stronger i ll help you dontworry harry breathed a sigh of relief and a mischievous grin came over ginny features but first yeah harry said well ginny said innocently i ll need to know what the visions are about if you stay over to the right then you wonthave a chance if they move in from the left if you stay to the center though you re going to be able to react to both fake outs and actual shots and force the chasers to go left or right and hey look at draco crabbe called interrupting oliver rant to the slytherin keeper shit oliver swore turning to look and cursing himself for forgetting hermione it took him a second to find them they werenton eye level but rather twenty feet off the ground and still going lower having a bizarre slapping fight which they somehow managed while sitting one in front of the other on a four foot long piece of wood oliver groaned and started to make his way over to them then glanced at the quidditch players god he missed quidditch and hermione was fine she could handle malfoy they werenteven far enough of the ground to break anything now she d be all right oliver turned back to the keeper as i was saying hermione wondered briefly what would happen if she shoved draco off the broom he d probably scream like a girl again so that would be a good thing but then his abrupt departure would probably cause the broom to shoot back up and she didntwant to even begin to try to steer a top notch broom and oh yeah she was tied to his wrist so that might cause a problem not unlike when harry had blown up draco head give it to me no i caught it give it here hermione glared at him furiously one of his hands was latched onto her forearm pulling as hard as he could without leaning back which was too dangerous for leverage while the other hand tried to fend off her repeated attacks he glowered back a mixture of rage frustration and determination on his still slightly discolored face which was slowly changing from pink to the hue of white cheese something about his expression his glare and the tilt of his head at a funny angle from turning around to face her his usually well groomed hair all messed up and whipping in the wind somehow it struck her as adorable god she thought i ve got to get this chain off draco was having similar thoughts she was so infuriating always had been but he couldntdeny that she looked hot she was especially pretty when she was angry and as he made it a habit to piss her off he d noticed that several times over the years if only she hadntbeen some muggle born lackey of harry s maybe dontthink like that draco yelled at himself he groaned mentally note to self look up the success rate in chewing off your own arm and having it reattached hermione glanced around for some means of escape she wasntsure how long she could fend him off without shoving him off the broom and she wasnttoo happy about the direction her thoughts were taking then she noticed with a start that the broom was only maybe two meters off the ground she could jump that no problem hermione would later realize how stupid it was but she wasntexactly thinking straight she d had a rough day a rough week really and the spurts of adrenaline entering and leaving her system were taking their toll she was also very eager to get back on the ground whatever her reason or lack of it she jumped off the broom and naturally draco was forced to come with her oliver heard a loud scream and whipped around to look at where he d last seen draco and hermione draco was flat on his stomach broom clutched in one hand and hermione was standing nearby nervously clutching the snitch to her chest it didnttake a genius to figure out what had happened oliver burst out laughing come on harry just a hint no are we all going to die or something no not this time anyway could you tell me instead why snape exams for today were rescheduled and why he going to be holding class in a different room for the next few days no was the vision about hermione or something i am not telling ha so it was no i ve got you now potter you didntsay no you said i not telling and then you denied it too quickly what the vision about her and ron why would that oh god it was something about her and malfoy wasntit no ha it was what about her and malfoy has you so spooked eh harry does she kill him ginny no eh she doesntkill him hey i didntsay she doesn t you didntsay no because you think i think no means yes your logic is a little off you know so if she doesnt kill him then what oh my god surely it wasn t was was it that sort of vision gin oh god it was wasntit oh she gonna freak when i you tell her and i ll kill you i did not have a vision about what you re thinking oh yeah how do you know what am i thinking then if only you could see how hard you re blushing oh shut up draco just had time to let go of her and grab the broom handle to prevent the broom from getting blown away as he was yanked sideways and down he at first marveled at her abrupt decision to jump off the broom thinking something along the lines of she must really hate flying and then he was screaming mentally cursing hermione as he fell hermione landed in a shaky crouch and quickly stood leaping out of his way as he landed hard face down his landing cushioned only slightly by the snow hermione first instinct was to run because a draco wanted the snitch and b draco would not be happy once he remembered how to move however his fall had reminded her that she couldntgo anywhere without him being a few feet behind so she stayed put as far from his still form as she could tensed to run and vaguely wondering just why he wasnt moving draco didnthave the energy to get up for one thing he d just had a very trying day for another he d been injured quite a lot in the past few hours hermione crashing into him in the potions classroom the antics of the cheese spirit the hermione inflicted bite on his arm bumping into various things in the gryffindor common room the unsuccessful kick off hermione whacking him for a good fifteen minutes as they struggled over the snitch and now a ten foot fall from broom to snow why me he whined to himself feeling his body ache and a new rush of hatred for hermione this was all her fault somehow he was sure of it everything was her fault it was her fault his skin kept turning colors it was her fault he d spent weeks with people saying nice underwear to him in the hallways it was her fault his favorite teacher had betrayed him and it had to be her fault that he was chained to her bruised in places he didntknow he had sharing a room with her and harry his fellow slytherins now convinced that she d tried to bite off his major appendage and wondering if she and draco secretly liked each other and his seventh year almost completely ruined it was all her fault hermione watched him warily waiting for him to spring up at any moment and wondering if she d seriously injured or even killed him malfoy she said finally edging a little closer cautiously are you okay he didntmove and she tentatively stepped up to him and nudged him in the side with her foot draco felt her kick him and suddenly the rage rushed to the surface like shrapnel exploding from a landmine i gonna kill you he roared jumping to his feet so fast that he might have been yanked up by the hand of some god hermione yelped and fell backward her arms flailing as she hit the ground an image of draco burned into her mind eye as he rose from the snow like some angry boogeyman like a drunken horror movie producer idea of a yeti with snow and water covering him and his nimbus 2001 held in his hands like a sword as soon as she hit the ground she rolled back to her feet and took off still clutching the snitch to her terrified of what might happen should draco catch her she headed for the edge of the pitch intent upon making a beeline for the castle where a teacher who wasnta quidditch freak could help her hermione shifted the snitch to her left hand flicking her right wrist to bring her wand shooting from the specialized arm cuff she d bought during the start of the prank war forty feet from the exit thirty twenty and then suddenly she went flying draco had leaped forward and grabbed her around the knees she spun as she fell and landed on her back draco picking himself up and jumping on top of her draco dug his knees into the snow kneeling over her his hands reaching for her neck hermione raised her wand pressing it to his throat draco stopped glaring down at her both of their eyes flashing warnings and loathing at last draco dropped his hands and sat back on her hips still glaring but obviously reluctantly admitting a draw hermione lowered the wand slightly but knew better than to let her guard down they took to staring at each other both breathing heavily and suddenly the tension became a completely different type she saw something flicker in his eyes and his gaze became distance pensive almost wistful his head tilted to the side and his eyes moved lower was he looking at her mouth of course not probably not no no way just at her chin or something for no apparent reason a surge of confused panicked emotions coursed through her was he thinking about kissing her why the hell was he thinking about that surely he wasn t six of his friends were in the air above them along with an ex gryffindor teacher who was probably lovingly caressing the gryffindor goal hoops and chattering absently with the slytherins about memories of his glory days come to think of it hermione didntknow what to do what to say draco was looking back into her eyes now still angry but she could tell he was thinking about something else now too she was suddenly terrified that he would kiss her terrified and excited horrified and anxious and damn it why wouldnt he get off of her draco started leaning down towards her so slowly that it took her a second to realize he was moving his eyes looking at her lips and then back up to meet her gaze as though daring her to stop him she didntmove scared stiff part of her telling him to hurry up and do it and the other part running over a list of curses she could use if he tried draco closed his eyes but hermione kept hers open certain this had to all be a trick of course it was a trick he wasntgoing to kiss her what would she do if he kissed her just when hermione had made up her mind to close her eyes see what happened and then curse him into oblivion regardless of what he did draco went flying off of her landing about three feet away in the snow and hermione looked up to see a red faced harry standing above her her panic increased harry had seen draco about to kiss her he was going to kill draco well that didntsound too bad not really and then he was going to demand to know what she was doing not trying to stop draco no no harry hadnt even noticed the almost sort of possibly would have been a kiss he barely gave draco a second glance before dropping to his knees beside hermione he looked nervous and jumpy hermione wondered briefly if there was something wrong something about the order or the death eaters but she couldntseem to start her brain going in any direction that didntinclude draco and the almost sort of possibly would have been a kiss hermione you ve got to help me i need you to help me research psychic vision blocking i had a dream like snape said i might and i dontknow what to do snape said to ignore it but no oh no i cantignore that i have to kill that it got to go away we have to find a way i cantfind it and ginny wonthelp me look because i wonttell her what my vision was about and she wontaccept that she does not want to know and i dontthink occlumency will work because that for when people try to attack your mind and no one trying to attack it it all about cheese damn it why cheese i hate cheese you have to help me hermione blinked harry rant penetrating the haze of confusion and emotion that had settled over her since draco tackle maneuver research yes research books the library places where almost sort of possibly would have been kisses did not exist normal stuff yes normal stuff like books and psychic visionary dreams that led to a new hatred of cheese yeah normalcy hermione sat up the other six quidditch players were landing near draco and oliver was walking towards her slowly having trouble moving due to how hard he was laughing leaning on his firebolt 2 like an old man with a cane hermione took a deep breath and looked over at draco you okay draco goyle asked the bludger held tightly under one of his massive arms draco groaned his eyes not quite focusing practice is over now he said closing his eyes looking quite disappointed hermione smiled in satisfaction she didntknow what that almost sort of possibly would have been a kiss had meant but she did now that whatever happened draco was still her least favorite student at hogwarts and nothing was going to change that she turned to harry and held out her left hand which was still tightly holding the tiny golden ball guess what harry she said grinning her head off she opened her hand a little to show him i caught the snitch chapter twenty eight feliz navidad madam pince who had been informed of the chain binding draco to hermione and now knew just why they d been researching love potions and curses last friday didntobject to the presence of harry hermione and draco who chose a table at the far back and sat down with large stacks of books in front of them draco stared blankly at the cover of a book that might contain something on breaking the chain barely listening to harry and hermione conversation draco realized now what was happening he had gone mad completely utterly insane no sane person tried to kiss granger wood snape and weasley were all proof of that draco had lost it he wasntsure when but he was pretty sure it was right about the time he d started fanatically planning that first prank all those months ago carefully brewing the potions carefully making sure crabbe and goyle went nowhere near the potions running over and over the plan with pansy and crabbe and goyle perhaps that had done it the entire prank now seemed like a damned fool thing to do even though she tried to avoid getting into trouble he d seen first hand what granger could do when she snapped and snape why had he chosen snape yes snape was the only teacher who would horrify her completely but he was also a former death eater for crying out loud and it appeared that not only had he driven the two of them to work together but he d destroyed snape completely so ginny wouldnt help you she said she wouldntdo it if i wouldnttell her what the visions were about yeah harry that a perfectly reasonable request no no it isn t you dontunderstand draco couldnt think he wasntsure what was up with granger but he knew that chewing off his own arm was sounding more and more appealing by the moment why had he almost kissed her why how are we supposed to stop the visions if we dontknow anything about them you dontwant to know anything about them hermione harry are you sure stopping them is such a good idea excuse me miss practice occlumency or i ll never let you hear the end of it wants me to have visions now visions harry not dreams fed into your brain straight from voldemort draco didnteven bother to flinch at the sound of the dark lord name he was too lost in thought how could he have even thought about kissing her she was a mudblood and more importantly she was potter friend harry i dont know why you dontwant to tell me but you have to tell me something even more importantly why was he disappointed that he hadntgotten to follow through with it fine it was about you me and malfoy and it was the most horrifying thing i ve seen since since ever wait what draco said tuning into the conversation fully you had a vision about me what else would make me want it out of my head harry snarled harry hermione said uncomfortably did you see us die no harry said shortly then i dont understand why you re so upset you me and malfoy were we tortured harry shook his head er seeing someone else get tortured again he shook his head did did anyone die head shake were we fighting she sighed in exasperation well then what exactly could be so oh my god harry and hermione jumped and turned to look at draco who was staring blankly ahead looking terrified what with you harry snapped but draco didntreply draco eyes refused to close the library was replaced with a room he didntrecognize a room that looked more like a bedroom than anything else he was staring at himself and hermione as though seeing it through a crystal ball he was kissing her quite thoroughly from the looks of it and she was smacking him upside the head then just as suddenly as it had appeared it vanished draco returned to reality with a jolt that made him feel like he d just been thrown off the astronomy tower he stared numbly into space so dazed that it took him a second to realize he was looking at harry you saw it too harry said shakily draco blinked and came back to earth oh god that what you saw harry nodded draco stared in horror one of them seeing it that was one thing draco could explain that as a delusion brought on by various injuries and cheese spirits hell he d just shown that he was prone to recent lapses in mental health by that display out on the pitch but if harry had seen it too it cantbe real he thought desperately it just can t and even if it is i dontcare i ll never kiss granger never draco lunged across the table causing both harry and hermione to jump and try to scramble back but he merely seized two stacks of books and pulled them closer hurry he growled at them i want this out of my head mcgonagall sighed as she scrawled an e across the top of the last written exam now once draco and hermione completed their written exam after dinner the following day she would have all of the slytherins and hufflepuffs exams completed until the practical on wednesday she stood up stretching the muscles in her back which were aching from too many hours spent hunched over her desk the days tests were graded the majority of the gryffindors were behaving for the moment and now she could put on her slippers and settle down to a nice you better watch out you better not cry you better not pout i telling you why sang a very loud male voice which was horribly off key who on earth is that she wondered the singer sounded older than most of the students and familiar and like he hadntsung a thing in decades frowning she headed for her office door but it sprang open before she could reach it severus snape waltzed not walked waltzed through the door wearing a ridiculous christmas sweater clutching a bottle of fine wine and smelling faintly of rotten cheese santa claus is coming to town santa claus is coming to town santa claus is coming to town snape sang loudly mcgonagall stared in pure disbelief she had never seen anything quite so disturbing in her life it was like watching santa sell drugs snape danced towards her shimmying around the office as he came he making a list checking it twice gonna find out who naughty or nice santa claus is coming to town santa claus is coming to town santa claus is coming to town mcgonagall continued to stare as snape danced to her side and threw his arm around her shoulders wondering if he was drunk he had two sides when drunk depressed and sarcastic amused both of which were radically different from happy and singing besides which the bottle of wine was unopened and all she could smell was cheese come on sing it with me minerva santa claus is sing one more line and i ll kill you slowly mcgonagall shouted snape stopped startled taking a deep shuddering breath she stepped out from under his arms and glared up at him with an expression that was known to make first years wet themselves i ve had it severus she growled i canttake this anymore you re going to tell me exactly what the hell happened to you or i ll beat you until you remember that you are an evil slytherin prat snape blinked and stared at her then shrugged and opened the wine sure minerva he said i ll tell you everything but come it christmastime yule is here at last let drink to christmas eh mcgonagall sighed and eyed the bottle longingly oh why not she grumbled i could use a drink that was so great fred said for the fortieth time him screaming like a little girl i mean ten galleons says hermione did that to his arm george said looked like she tried to bite him did you see the marks through that big hole in his sleeve hermione trying to bite off malfoy arm fred said with relish oh i wish i d seen that dontyou ron ron made a noncommittal noise in his throat even though seeing malfoy on the run had been quite amusing it had also been rather depressing it bothered him that he and hermione were fighting really fighting not just having one of their spats which occurred several times a day but never resulted in either staying mad for more than a few hours it bothered him that she d kept things from him most of all it bothered him that he wasntthere for her when they had both first arrived at number twelve grimmauld place they d both been so stressed out that they d fought constantly the only times they werentfighting were when one of them had stormed off and ignored the other for hours on end eventually about three weeks after staying together at headquarters they d both just snapped ron had started screaming about how he was always left out always the third wheel and while she tried to apologize at first he wouldnt calm down and soon she d started screaming back about how ron and harry werentthere for her not the way she was for them he d denied it and she d thrown up every single instance in his face viktor the fights in their third year about scabbers and the firebolt and on and on even some moments he could barely remember for the first time he d realized how many times he d really hurt her over the years and how many times he d taken her support for granted and how many times he d let her down by not helping her deal with her own problems hermione problems had been her own while ron and harry had always been hermione s she was in tears by the time she finally finished screaming ron had stopped her when she d tried to storm off and told her how sorry he was and how he never knew and promised to be there for her in the future ever since he had done his best to be there for her and he always felt horrible when he realized he d failed no matter how big or small the failure was now she was chained to malfoy few things required more support than that and here he was hanging out with his brothers instead letting her deal with her problems alone it wasntthat he didntfeel he had a right to be angry it was just that he felt bad about neglecting his duties as a boyfriend and more importantly as a friend what up with you fred asked interrupting ron thoughts you look like pig died or something ron glared at him or was turned into a canary the size of the library perhaps right fred said forcing his face into a properly ashamed expression sorry hey listen george said holding up his hand from down the hall they could hear harry voice sounding agitated and jumpy i not telling you gin he said let it die gin came hermione voice wonderful fred exclaimed we can ask them how that chase thing got started ron panicked if there was one thing he couldnthandle right now it was facing hermione ron seized the backs of fred and george robes and began to haul them towards the nearest secret passage oliver walked down the hall with a spring in his step he always felt great after flying and this time had been absolutely hysterical from what he d seen of harry ron and hermione over the past two days ron and hermione were fighting oliver felt bad for her but he couldnthelp feeling hopeful too add that to her astonishingly funny antics with malfoy at quidditch practice and it was a wonder that he didnt just go zooming down the hallway on his firebolt 2 like a little kid it was the best evening he d had in a long time no matter how horrifying his morning with ron had been and even then it was good to know that ron was no longer going to be out for oliver blood even if the scene had been embarrassing vaguely recalling that he was supposed to go to mcgonagall and tell her when the practice was over and relate how it had gone he detoured away from the path leading to his quarters and headed instead for her private office he could hear her talking to snape as he approached they were conversing in a loud informal way that he could hear even with the door closed something seemed off about their voices but oliver didntrealize what it was at first so they re going to be experiencing visions and spouting prophecies mcgonagall was saying sounding amused oh that not the worst part snape replied his voice sounding very odd indeed see if the cheese spirit bites you you become plagued with dreams about whoever you were visualizing while it was being conjured hang on a second mcgonagall groaned i canthandle big words right now let me think when i did the spell snape clarified i d been thinking of evans so for about a week i dreamed of her every time i slept and thought of little else mcgonagall laughed much more loudly and raucously than she usually did so who did malfoy visualize he said he wasnt thinking of anyone snape replied and potter supposedly wasn t either but if they had they d be dreaming about that person and thinking about them yes in a very intimate way snape laughed which made oliver shudder laughter was just too foreign coming from snape i hope potter was thinking of someone unconsciously maybe he was mcgonagall said malfoy too or maybe malfoy just didntwant to say who he was thinking about something about the way she said the sentence the words so garbled that it sounded more like er mebbe mall foyust dinnut wanna sssay ooh ee us sinkin abut hit home with oliver like most guys in their early twenties oliver knew slurring when he heard it as a professional athlete he was a little too acquainted with slurred speech so he d processed what they meant automatically and hadnt realized what he was really hearing he knocked on the door and opened it without waiting for an answer his jaw dropping at the sight of snape and mcgonagall snape was sprawled in a chair practically lying on it an empty bottle of wine next to him and a nearly full wine glass in his hand mcgonagall was lying on her desk her feet bare and swinging off the edge her head pillowed by what looked like rolls of parchment covered in students writing one hand clutching a large bottle of wine as oliver watched in disbelief mcgonagall took a swig from the bottle without lifting her head and smiled at him you scared us silly she slurred thought you was a student oliver blinked and turned to snape hoping for an explanation and getting only a feeble wave hiya wood snape said the bells on his christmas sweater jingling what are you wearing oliver managed to say through his shock christmas spirit snape told him not to be confused with cheese christmas spirit cheese yessir christmas is a time for spirits and happy i a happy man now he held his hand up to one side of his mouth as though he didntwant mcgonagall to hear i got me a girlfriend now he added in a loud whisper oliver shook his head unable to cope with one more strange moment today um i ll just be going now he mumbled oh come on wood dontbe such a wuss mcgonagall said did you just call me a wuss oliver said indignantly he d just been called a wuss by a drunken woman who was old enough to be his mother what the hell was wrong with his life lately stay and have a drink she said drink like a man you you wussy boy wussy boy snape repeated gleefully i think i ll just come back when you re sober oliver said stiffly glaring at them both wussy boy mcgonagall fairly shouted wussy boy wussy boy wussy boy wussy boy wussy boy snape yelled taking up the chant oliver spluttered i am you stop i i am not a wussy boy he roared finally making both of them jump he stormed over to mcgonagall snatched her wine bottle and took a large gulp from it there you happy i hey this is good he said holding it up to read the label finest wiiiiiiiine in the wizarding woooooooorld snape sang help yourself mcgonagall said to oliver she opened her desk and pulled out another bottle which she opened with a tap of her wand we have plenty oliver frowned on one hand this was really really weird on the other his weird experiences seemed to be turning out pretty well today and the wine was good why not he muttered and took another swig ginny had joined back up with harry hermione and draco on their way back from the library and as they needed someone to help carry their library books all fifty two of them they put up with her prattling as they headed back to gryffindor tower in exchange for hard labor she d learned from hermione that draco was having visions similar to harry s and that it had something to do with the rumors ginny had been hearing about a cheese monster naturally the one rumor she had deemed automatically false was really true go figure and an accident in snape classroom but no one would tell her anything else and it seemed hermione knew little more than she did hermione wasntinterested in talking about the quidditch practice either but ginny had decided that for now she might as well focus on the visions come on just a hint she pleaded thoroughly amused by the two spooked boys i not telling you gin harry said let it die gin hermione said wearily struggling to keep up with draco he was power walking as quickly as possible towards the common room determined to get back to researching as fast as he could did he tell you ginny asked hermione accusingly no hermione said shortly which you re going to have to do eventually harry she added sternly it could be instrumental if i knew what the vision was about i could narrow down the research prophetic visions of death for example would probably be different from visions of what we re going to eat for lunch tomorrow and it could be important in some way you haven t it wasn t harry said shortly it was not important it probably not even real but it needs to go away it must have been major ginny said smugly oh well i guess i ll just have to slip malfoy here a truth potion and get it from him since he having them too now draco stopped in his tracks and whirled to face her startling her he stared at her seriously his mouth set in a thin line listen little weasel he said coldly and listen good you do not want to know oliver lay flat on his back between snape chair and mcgonagall desk drunk off his ass little red stains on either side of his mouth from where he d missed with the wine so you guys do this a lot he asked sometimes snape said holding his wine glass out towards mcgonagall fill er up minerva mcgonagall mostly missed the glass a lot of wine poured onto oliver chest and the carpet but enough made it into the glass that snape pulled his glass back after a few moments mcgonagall continued to pour oliver who was used to this by now tipped the bottle upright for her and she withdrew her arm alcohol affected witches and wizards in slightly different ways than muggles the magic in their blood did funny things when exposed to mind altering substances but alcohol still did its job magic or not snape mcgonagall and oliver had been in the room for some time now and oliver was nearly as trashed as the other two they d been telling him all about dorwilaron whatever that was a cheese demon of some sort and he was simply nodding and saying uh huh in the right moments knowing that he d just sort out the information later when he was more sober i bored mcgonagall said suddenly and struggled to a sitting position hey i know let go play confuse terrorize or escape the students how do you play oliver asked frowning well we wander the building snape said and if we see a smart student or a student who might talk we run same goes for if we see argus or albus mcgonagall added if we see a dumb student or one we dontlike we do crazy things to confuse them snape continued that usually for the slytherins though mcgonagall said helpfully if we see a cool student one that no one would believe or one we like who wouldnt be all guess what snape and mcgonagall did then we terrorize them i have more cool students than severus though mcgonagall said giggling terrorize how oliver said suspiciously remembering a wild story of angelina johnson back in his fourth year you ll see snape and mcgonagall said mischievously oliver shrugged and sat up can we take the wine cantplay confuse terrorize or escape the students without wine snape said or something like it liquor best mcgonagall agreed then i game oliver said cheerfully ron fred and george watched from a secret passage hidden behind a tapestry as harry hermione draco and ginny started walking again weird fred muttered could you imagine hanging around those two all day george said harry and hermione i mean imagine all the stuff you d have to put up with fred said psychic visions fighting evil the gods only know what else ron gave fred a look and fred cut himself off right sorry he said dont know how you do it ron it takes practice ron said dryly stepping out of the passage once he was sure harry hermione draco and ginny were gone the twins followed ron out so should we follow them and eavesdrop george said eagerly might be good research for the prank war ron shook his head overhearing the conversation had made him feel a lot worse not only was she chained to malfoy but she and harry were struggling to solve some strange new mystery all alone i think i need to be alone for a while he muttered um okay fred said startled we ll go visit oliver yeah george said he told us he was going to be overseeing slytherin practice i bet he has loads of things to tell us george trailed off once again they could hear voices only these were infinitely more interesting that harry and hermione not to mention tuneful is that snape again fred wondered someone with him ron said i can hear it who on earth would go wandering around singing with snape george asked maybe everyone gone insane fred said brightly harry and malfoy are sharing visions ginny wandering around with a load of library books ron not being a proper weasley and looking forward to practical jokes and snape is singing the world has really gone insane hasntit george mused then he frowned dontanswer that the answer came however in fact it walked right around the corner snape mcgonagall and oliver all covered in wine stains and carrying bottles of the stuff were stumbling down the corridor with their arms around each other shoulders singing if one could call it that feliz navidad they shouted together without much regard for unison as they staggered closer their words slurring and making it difficult to figure out what they were saying the three weasleys vaguely recognized the words as spanish as they continued fred george and ron could do little more than stare as the three professors one of which who had been their friend for years stopped in front of them suddenly snape lunged forward and seized ron by the shoulders fred and george drew their wands on reflex but ron was too startled to think of any such course of action snape glared into ron eyes for a moment there was a long pause as the twins tried to decide if cursing snape would be a good thing or a horrible mistake at this point then snape opened his mouth and screamed the english chorus of the feliz navidad song so loudly everyone in the vicinity nearly wet themselves when he was finished he looked expectantly at ron for a response ron really couldntthink of much to say after a very very long pause snape let go of ron shoving him backwards hard enough to make ron stumble then he turned back to mcgonagall and oliver i like this game oliver exclaimed happily mcgonagall burst into giggles feliz navidad mcgonagall gasped through her giggles advancing on the three confused and panicky weasleys fred and george hurried to get farther behind ron but mcgonagall surged forward and threw her arm around fred feliz navidad feliz navidad oliver yelled bunny hopping around in circles feliz navidad snape said swaying back and forth with a luna lovegood type expression feliz navidad mcgonagall told fred who stood frozen with a wide eyed please god help me look on his face feliz navidad feliz navidaa haaad oliver yelled in a jazz singer imitation as he continued to hop in circles in the corridor snape threw his arm around george shoulder in much the same way as mcgonagall and fred and tried to get george to sway with him ron looked at all three teachers nervously and began to cautiously edge away down the corridor trying to keep everyone in his sights oliver mcgonagall and snape stopped just then and began to scream the english part like snape had a moment before simultaneously the twins reached up to rub at their ears um please let go george told snape weakly snape obliged then made a little jump and landed with his arms and legs spread wide jingle bell rock everybody he called the three of them sang the first four lines together all of them doing strange little dance moves that might have been bad versions of the twist to the ravenclaws mcgonagall exclaimed and the three of them began to form a conga line snape sang the next line in such a creepily happy way that each weasley privately thought they d never been more afraid of anything before every few steps someone kicked but usually the kicks werent timed and everyone kicked at different moments they had now reached the end of the corridor ravenclaw here we come mcgonagall exclaimed she and snape turned left and oliver turned right all of them singing and kicking and oliver turning around and chasing after them a second later somewhere around the last line of the song the three teacher voices faded for quite some time fred george and ron simply stared after them in the numb sort of shock one feels after cheating death slowly fred and george blinked and turned to look at each other yep the world has gone insane george said taking a shuddering breath fred nodded and glanced in the direction the professors had gone shaking his head in awe wow he whispered in awe hogwarts really has changed special note march 6 2006 this story is currently undergoing massive editing i have taken down most of its chapters to do this i will be putting them back up slowly but surely thank you to all reviewers and sorry to all those who were upset by my tearing down of the story i tried to e mail everyone who sent me a pm e mail or confused review but i dontthink i succeeded again i very sorry hopefully the story has improved however anyone who has read it before will probably not need to reread it the basic plot remains the same author notes i dontthink i mentioned this in my previous notes but hermione and ron are a couple for the moment though this story will end up being a draco hermione romance chapter two unusual allies snape was drunk very very drunk this was not not cool he d woken up next to a student the damned head girl from gryffindor and that was bad enough without her being potter best friend and one of his least favorite people then it turned out she was actually good to talk to when he was too drunk to care that it was hermione granger he was talking to and he d ended up having a thought or two that wasntright on so many levels as she lay in his bed or sat in his armchair in his robes he couldntremember having a morning half as strange malfoy needs to die malfoy needs to die he was chanting it he realized to the tune of the farmer in the dell hi ho the dairy o malfoy needs to diiiiiiiie snape found himself bursting into the slytherin common room it was early but malfoy was awake and sitting by the fire malfoy hadntslept well since his father death last year during the final battle with voldemort malfoy stared up at his professor startled worried and completely confused snape pointed his empty tequila bottle at malfoy like a sword malfoy began reaching for his wand carefully looking scared terrified really but then it wasntevery day a powerful wizard and ex death eater ran into the room wearing nothing but a sheet around his waist and brandishing an alcohol bottle at you snape caught himself before yelling the killing curse when he realized he wasntholding his wand instead he started shouting at malfoy like well like the drunken madman he was it none of your business if i slept with her none and i didn t honest granger and i are are just friends the look on malfoy face made even the intoxicated and enraged snape laugh although hermione had used secret passages all the way back to gryffindor tower and although no one had seen her save harry ron ginny and neville who came into the dormitory and nearly fell over in shock when presented with evidence that hermione would get drunk malfoy had told every slytherin about the prank parvati and lavender had gotten their hands on the information too but harry ron ginny and hermione had all agreed that ginny and hermione would tell them the whole story was a ruse invented to cover up the fact that hermione was indeed cheating on ron which neither ron nor hermione were pleased about but it was better than the truth the tale didntgo any further than the slytherins most of the students in other houses either didnthear it or didntbelieve it the first potions class after hermione had woken up next to snape however set harry ron and hermione to thinking the moment snape walked in he glared around at the class before speaking i realize that as seventh years you will be engaging in the prank war i am also fully aware that as a teacher i am only permitted to punish you with detentions and the removal of house points but know this he glared directly at malfoy i will not be toyed with anyone who makes the mistake of trying to get the drop on me will face revenge not punishment you will be severely dealt with the old fashioned way and my job be damned snape was now avoiding harry ron hermione and ginny like the plague knowing full well that anything in hermione life was always shared with ron and harry and usually with ginny the four of them enjoyed an increase in their grades snape was even grading fairly trying to make sure none of them had a reason for hermione to report the event to any of his fellow staff members he was also downright hateful towards malfoy who obviously hadntbudgeted for his teacher figuring out who had set the whole thing up and was thoroughly unhappy it did however reveal to malfoy the fact that his plan had worked and he kept catching the gryffindors in the hallway and muttering things like did you and professor snape have fun granger did he teach you anything new hermione had found a new hatred of malfoy she d read a book on dream recall and had deduced from the dream about her and oliver that she and snape had not originally been lying side by side she was also quite ashamed of the fact that she d gotten drunk especially since neville was still giving her funny amazed looks and she was worried about snape robe she hadntgiven it back and lavender and parvati had a tendency to snoop through her trunk looking for clothes to borrow or things to tease her about she still couldntthink of a way to get back at malfoy and eventually decided to see if maybe just maybe professor snape would be an ally in the prank war after the second potions class after the prank nine days since she d woken up in his bed and two days after halloween hermione gathered up her courage approached snape desk with a plastic bag professor what miss granger snape said his sallow skin tinged pink at the cheeks er your robe she said whispering even though no one was around i ve been meaning to give it back th thank you sir you re welcome miss granger snape said stiffly suddenly he burst out laughing loud guffaws that sounded downright bizarre coming from him hermione couldntever remember him genuinely smiling at least not about something other than harry ron or hermione getting in trouble let alone laughing she couldnthelp but grin it was funny wasntit looking back she said sheepishly i ve never been so mortified in my entire life snape laughed know what i did after you left i got even more drunk barged into the slytherin common room and started yelling at draco telling him that i didntsleep with you and it was no one business if i did or something i cantfully remember he shook his head chuckling i stumbled back to the common room and drunkenly explained to harry ron and ginny that we had to kill every slytherin then they hid me in harry and ron room and neville came in and found me he nearly died of shock and you should ve seen the look on harry and ron face when they saw me in your robe ginny had told them i d left my clothes and wand on my bed so draco didntdestroy your stuff well that something she nodded but she frowned the thing is how did he get into the common room he d need the password you know and it usually not related to anything to do with gryffindor or whatever we make them hard to figure out by an outsider especially what with the prank war snape blinked he didnthave to take you from the dormitory probably a bad idea considering he d have to get you all the way down here how could he do that if you werentwearing your clothes she was a bit startled to note that he wasntblushing or being his usual standoffish self but rather talking about things in a thoughtful and calm manner almost like a friend trying to help her figure out why so and so had asked her out for some reason he reminded her strongly of sirius even if he did wait until i was in your room to take my clothes which is possible i cantremember a thing about that night except for leaving dinner he managed to get my robes and wand on my bed perhaps he had a gryffindor accomplice not likely i grant you but it has been known to happen in the past i dontsuppose it really matters does it he was probably playing no harm no foul if he d destroyed your belongings or they were found in his possession he could ve been in serious trouble the destruction of another wand is a serious offense in the wizarding world now we canteven prove it was him oh it matters how he did it for one thing if he could get into my dorm and your room too mind then he could do it again and even though we were mostly all at dinner how precisely did four slytherins get past the fat lady she bound by the password but i think she might ve said something to someone about it he got some way of sneaking around no one knows about and if he does we re in it deep i dontreally think he would be stupid enough to risk barging into gryffindor tower like he owned the place there rarely a time when the whole house goes down to dinner at the same time you know for one thing meaning that for another if you caught him in your room you could have a field day with him and four slytherins draco crabbe and goyle make three she smiled the thought of catching him had crossed my mind but i dontthink it was one of them who went up to my room i assuming it was pansy parkinson he nodded boys arentallowed in girls rooms but how did you discover that snape smiled at her and lifted an eyebrow talk about surreal snape is actually teasing me er i read it in hogwarts a history she said though her voice sounded a little squeaky sure miss granger sure he smiled as her face burned bright red it true and mr weasley has never tried to break into your room no she insisted she paused he and harry tried to tell me about something umbridge had made a rule about back in fifth year and ron went flailing down the stone slide well draco may or may not have enlisted miss parkinson he may have found a way hermione nodded yes but it would ve just been a lot of work for him and malfoy likes to take the easy road fred and george weasley and lee jordan had some sort of spell that let them into the girls dorms whenever they pleased but i think it really complex i haventbeen able to even find it myself she winced inwardly she hadntmeant to mention that she d been looking for just such a spell any hope that snape hadntpicked up on it went out the window when he grinned at her teasingly you can get a broomstick and fly right over those trick stairs you know he said lightly you can hermione said sounding way too eager to know such a thing even to her own ears snape gave her another grin she planted her hands on her hips defiantly and how exactly would you know about that sir he raised his hands in mock surrender touch miss granger touch she tried not to let her jaw drop open at the thought that snape had flown up a few girls dormitory staircases in his day anyway i want to know how malfoy got in from what i can tell he probably wouldnthave used a spell to carry me he terrible at those i ve seen him practicing quite a few things in the common room snape agreed but he could have carried you himself he strong enough could have maybe would have never draco malfoy do his own dirty work touch a mudblood she scowled fiercely yeah right he would have gotten someone else to do it he d never do it himself then not only would he avoid breaking a sweat he could blame it on someone else if he was caught which means he would have brought crabbe and goyle maybe even just one of them and even one of them would have a hard time squeezing under an invisibility cloak with malfoy they re both huge i doubt even one of them would fit and malfoy not exactly a small guy so either malfoy went to my bedroom alone after dropping me off or he took pansy parkinson or she went alone or they found a different way besides invisibility cloaks snape nodded polyjuice potion maybe are you missing any boomslang skin hermione asked innocently he gave her a dirty look but he didntseem truly angry you know it and i know it professor but you cantprove it she said boldly true he replied and shrugged rolling his eyes no my private stores are fine but my cabinet is not the only place to pick up boomslang skin just the most convenient she joked apparently he shook his head and mock glared at her for a moment then smiled slightly i dontthink draco will try the same stunt again though he been talking about it so much someone would probably turn him in for suspicion if it happened again besides it was based on shock value the prank would lose its humor if we werentaffected by it and we ll both be watching draco more closely now yes but he gonna be moving again soon and if he cantfigure out if he needs to get me the most or you or the others then what he ll opt for getting us all then we d better get him first good lord that was nine days ago haventyou moved yet we ve got to act we she repeated hopefully i owe him one he said calmly then he grinned again besides if he realizes we re acting together what i said to him that day will be all the more confusing what exactly did you say she said slowly suspicious er something about i didntsleep with you honest he emphasized the word ruefully and hermione eyes widened with all the meanings one could pick up from that statement and that we were just um friends just friends she repeated incredulously if she and snape had ever been remotely close to being friends at least before now she was malfoy wife oh great what must be running through malfoy head oh shut up i was drunk now are we going to kick draco malfoy sorry ass or what he sounded so much like a teenager that hermione couldnthelp responding to him like a peer yes we most certainly are a slytherin ass kicking is well past due chapter twenty nine the great lemon drop caper ginny if you ask one more question about it i going to hex you hermione said wearily leaning back in her chair they were sitting in the guest room draco was working at one of the desks speaking to them very little and only approaching them to swap books and hermione was at the other desk harry and ginny on either side of her sitting in armchairs they d dragged over ginny doing her best to get information out of harry and harry doing his best to ignore her they had been searching for hours but had yet to find a single thing on blocking visions hermione was ready to give up she had her written and practical exams for arithmancy in the afternoon and she harry and draco would have to take their written exams for defense against the dark arts in the morning and transfiguration in the evening she was fairly certain she could stand to lose the studying time and there would be time in the morning anyway but the last thing she wanted to do was research her clothes were damp from all the rolling around in the snow she d done she was mourning the loss of the snitch harry had taken it from her and thrown it back in the box just before dragging her back to the castle and her mind kept drifting back to draco she kept second guessing his intentions on the quidditch pitch and the fact that he was just as worried as harry was about the visions was a lot more disturbing there were plenty of things that would worry harry and even more that would worry malfoy but very few that would worry harry and malfoy they didntexactly have a lot in common all hermione really wanted to do was head for the prefects bathroom take a nice long bath and read hogwarts a history a little before getting a good night rest none of which she could actually do not with draco tied to her wrist harry flipping out ginny digging for gossip and hermione new unpleasant memories of the prefects bathroom ginny sighed fine you re not going to tell me anything not yet anyway but you re going to have to spill eventually about quidditch practice about this cheese monster in snape cla snape draco yelled suddenly making harry drop his book and hermione draw her wand in surprise they d almost forgotten draco was there draco tossed the book he was reading over his shoulder and stood up snape of course who would know more about these cheese visions than he would now there an idea hermione said thoughtfully too tired to care that it was draco who came up with it we ll go ask him in the morning harry screw the morning draco exclaimed i going now it after curfew hermione pointed out good point i ll get the cloak harry said nodding at her and practically running for his trunk that not what i meant hermione said in exasperation let just wait until tomorrow harry and have another dream again tonight no thank you harry said already digging through his trunk i going hermione with or without you without then she told him irritably with draco said firmly i not ever seeing what i saw again ever only one of you needs to go if you re suffering from the same thing hermione snapped oh and i supposed to trust potter to tell it to me straight that a laugh well i not going and you cantmake me wanna bet yes i do hermione said coolly fingering her wand ah found it harry who hadntbeen listening stood up with the invisibility cloak and the marauder map in one hand and his sneakoscope in the other we d better take this he indicated the sneakoscope just in case snape tries to lie to us harry it can wait until morning hermione insisted is that an invisibility cloak draco demanded his tone accusing and indignant harry nodded so that how you ve been doing it all these years you little cheater that how you ve been able to stay out of trouble oh shut up harry growled rolling his eyes hermione we ll take the cloak and then no one will see us you re desperate enough to let malfoy use your cloak ginny said in shock wow the visions must be bad harry shot her a dirty look and set the cloak and map on hermione bed tucking the sneakoscope into his pocket i solemnly swear that i am up to no good he said tapping the map with his wand snape snape not in his office not in his classroom where is he harry scanned the map for a few moments furrowing his brow hermione prayed that snape had gone to hogsmeade or something but no such luck harry jabbed his finger at the map triumphantly ah there he is snape in mcgonagall office with her and wood it looks like what are they doing in there together ginny asked coming over to look the map doesnt exactly say harry reminded her he was surprised to learn during his sixth year that ginny whom the twins viewed as a real prot g had known all about the map and its powers the twins had told her all about it and its whereabouts but they re there which is a good thing for us it not as far away as the dungeon the trick will be to get snape on his own i for one dontwant wood and mcgonagall knowing what going on i could cause a diversion ginny offered say there something wrong in snape classroom or something and get him to leave the office that should do it but dontuse his classroom you re supposed to be in gryffindor tower think up another excuse on the way harry said he pointed at a spot on the map near mcgonagall oh and try and get him to come over here to this secret passage we should be able to hide in there and wait for him if he doesntcome within fifteen minutes we ll head down to the potions ro will you listen to yourself draco interrupted you sound like a general planning a battle or something this isntsneaking out after curfew it guerrilla warfare can we just get moving we wontall fit under the cloak hermione pointed out i ll walk outside it ginny said you ll have the map to watch for teachers and if i get seen i can always just say that i on my way to find snape i not going hermione repeated i going to take a shower and go to bed you ve had enough showers this weekend to last you for the rest of your life harry told her hermione we need you you ve got sway with snape teaming up for a prank doesntmean make me his bestest friend in the whole wide world hermione said testily draco grabbed her arm you re coming with us hermione wrapped her feet around the legs of her chair and held tightly to the seat no i not yes you are make me draco and hermione entered into a fierce glaring contest for a few moments before draco finally growled and seized the back of her chair fine i ll make you he snapped come on potter harry stuffed the cloak and map into his robes they d learned that it was best to put on the cloak in the corridor when they had to sneak out so early in the night so that they didntbump into anyone in the common room on their way out and announce the fact that harry owned an invisibility cloak gryffindors werentprone to tattling especially not on curfew violators when chances were they d get in trouble themselves for leaving the common room after curfew hermione yelped as draco jerked her chair tilted it backwards and began to drag her towards the door chair and all she tried to lift her hand from the seat to get out her wand but the chair gave a slight lurch and she clutched the seat again afraid of losing her balance harry help she called sorry hermione harry said apologetically if snape gone back to his former self you might be the only person who can get any answers out of him harry how could you you re you re cooperating with malfoy harry froze looking green after a long pause he started following her and draco again sorry hermione he said but if all goes well i ll never cooperate with malfoy again hermione gaped at him there was something he wasnttelling her probably something to do with the visions but the fact that he would actually let draco malfoy cart her around was far more astonishing never a dull moment ginny muttered as she followed harry hermione and draco to the door draco pulled her out into the corridor paused only momentarily for the door to open up and then dragged her out into the common room dozens of students of all years were still awake studying for the end of term tests everyone looked up eagerly at the sound of the wall opening then stared as draco dragged a grumbling hermione towards the door walking backwards and keeping both hands on the chair back what he snapped at all the staring gryffindors no one said anything draco kept walking towards the portrait hole smack into another person draco turned to look over his shoulder and promptly gulped and turned hermione around so that she was between him and three glaring weasleys hermione swallowed hard as she stared up at ron who was flanked by fred and george all of them with their arms folded over their chests and furious expressions on their faces r ron she said tentatively i just want you to know hermione ron snarled that you can sic your lovesick little tagalongs and your favorite teacher on me all you want because you dontscare me and neither do mcgonagall snape and wood uh wha hermione said intelligently you know perfectly well what i talking about ron growled we dont appreciate snape mcgonagall and wood singing to us george said coldly or grabbing our shoulders fred added or yelling feliz navidad at us ron finished hermione stared at them what if it war you want hermione ron said it war you ll get you and harry ron i don t save it ron interrupted and the three of them walked around hermione and headed up the boys dormitory staircase that was interesting ginny said breaking the heavy silence in the common room what were they talking about hermione wondered who cares i ve got larger problems draco said shrugging and tilting hermione chair back again nearly dumping her out of the chair as he turned her back around to drag her to the portrait hole harry ginny someone should go talk to him hermione began but harry cut her off this is more important hermione harry said as draco kicked the portrait hole open harry stepped forward grabbed the legs of hermione chair and helped draco lift hermione into the corridor oh that was great mcgonagall laughed she snape and oliver had returned to the office fairly quickly after nearly running into dumbledore on their way to the library did you see the look on weasley face grabbing his shoulders was a great touch oliver said grinning he was quite enjoying the fact that he d been able to freak out the twins he considered it as a sort of revenge for forcing him to tell them about hermione the tattoo and the prank war we should do this again some time i sure we will mcgonagall said we ve been doing it for years did you guys ever terrorize angelina johnson oliver asked about seven years ago oh she was one of the best snape said with relish she looked ready to cry or perhaps wet herself even when you re happy you re still a slytherin mcgonagall remarked shaking her head you enjoyed it as much as me snape retorted so mcgonagall said smiling mischievously snape was about to reply when a knock on the door cut him off the three of them jerked their heads up in alarm who is it mcgonagall called it ginny weasley professor there been a bit of an accident snape mcgonagall and oliver had already stopped listening grinning from ear to ear the moment they heard ginny voice after a quick whispered conversation oliver headed for the door they d dragged hermione chair and all to the first staircase leading downward before she d finally given in or to be accurate freaked out at the thought of malfoy helping to carry her down a load of steps and started screaming she grudgingly got off the chair helped harry hide it in a secret passage for the time being and hid under the invisibility cloak with harry and draco this isnttoo weird hermione muttered as she harry and draco inched down the corridor you re telling me harry and draco whispered together then glared at each other in disgust please dontdo that ginny said it creepy enough to be wandering around with you three under the cloak the invisibility cloak which had seemed so roomy when harry ron and hermione were first years now seemed to have shrunk several sizes while both harry and malfoy were on the thin side for guys their age they were still fully grown and rather tall and they both had to scrunch up to make sure no one feet showed in an attempt to stay away from each other they d forced hermione to walk between them which she wasnthappy with harry kept stepping on her foot and every time draco bumped into her she jumped and pressed herself against harry which he found rather disconcerting he was jumpier than usual are we there yet hermione whined unable to see anything but the floor and harry back almost harry said with a sigh consulting the map filch is still in his office and snape is still in mcgonagall s there a secret passage up ahead but i dontthink going down the narrow staircase in there is a good idea better take the long way hermione groaned in frustration all she wanted to do was sleep she was tired and her mind was buzzing with unpleasant questions but no they had to go see snape snape of all people hey guys ginny said thoughtfully as she led the way has anyone given any thought to just why snape mcgonagall and oliver are in her office together what does it matter harry asked it doesntmatter much i suppose ginny said but it weird oliver doesnt exactly hang out with the teachers too often especially not mcgonagall and snape and the first time we checked the map was at least twenty minutes ago and they haventleft and what the hell was ron talking about harry said warming to the subject didnthe say he thought hermione sent all three of them to attack ron and the twins something about singing and feliz navidad ginny said vaguely it a christmas carol hermione said more popular in the muggle world though snape attacked fred george and ron while singing a christmas carol with mcgonagall and wood helping him wouldntbe the strangest thing he d done lately draco muttered no wonder ron thinks it was you wood and snape have no other connection harry mused just you and with you and ron fighting dontmake me feel any worse hermione began but draco cut her off ha draco exclaimed loudly so there is some freakish love triangle between you wood and snape yes malfoy that sounds so logical hermione said rolling her eyes and stomping on his foot ow well there no other explanation you and snape you and wood and for some reason they ve joined forces to terrorize ron with christmas songs hermione finished riiiight makes perfect sense before long you ll be uncovering all my secrets maybe i should just tell you now i the descendant of a fire breathing sorceress and merlin himself and i an exotic dancer on the weekends i also use the library for all of my secret rendezvous meetings with every male staff member under the age of fifty good to hear you re finally coming clean draco retorted with a smirk can we push him down the stairs now hermione asked harry and ginny not until you get the chain off and only if i can help ginny told her ditto on that harry agreed firing off insults all the way harry hermione ginny and draco made their way down to the corridor outside mcgonagall office harry hermione and draco hid inside a nearby secret passage and ginny knocked on the door who is it called a rather nervous sounding mcgonagall it ginny weasley professor there been a bit of an accident in the hallway on the way to gryffindor tower it looks like a spilled potion of some sort and i cantfind my way across it but it s the door was suddenly yanked open to reveal a frightened looking oliver who seized the front of ginny robes hauled her inside and began dragging her over to mcgonagall desk hey what are you argh oliver shoved her down by pushing on her head and under the desk she was so startled by her surroundings that she tried to back out and nearly cracked her head open on the underside of the desk the small space beneath the desk had been enlarged by a spell similar to that put on the weasleys former car sitting beneath the desk were mcgonagall and snape and in between them was a small green fire that didnt appear to be ruining the carpet it was burning upon what going on ginny demanded as oliver crawled under the desk behind her were you followed mcgonagall asked sharply what no why would are you sure oliver interrupted yes what wrong she demanded albus snape said darkly he after us he going to get us um professor dumbledore is after you that what i said weasley er why because it the truth no i mean why is he after you because we stole his lemon drops ginny stared at him what is a lemon drop these oliver said and he mcgonagall and snape all held up large bags of yellow candy are lemon drops and you stole them from dumbledore and now he gonna kill us if he can find us but he wontfind us in here no sir snape gloated marshmallow snape stuck a long stick in her face a marshmallow on the end mcgonagall and oliver each had one too they held the marshmallow carefully over the green fire we re making s mores oliver explained old recipe my cousin husband a muggle and he got me hooked on the things chocolate graham cracker marshmallow nothing better than that you re making food on a campfire under your desk when dumbledore is out to get you ginny hissed unable to fathom the logic behind that well what else are we going to do oliver said practically yeah it not like we re going to be able to go running through the halls singing feliz navidad mcgonagall said as though the three of them did that on a regular basis why did you steal his lemon drops ginny asked pinching the bridge of her nose just so we could say we committed the great lemon drop caper snape explained cheerfully retracting the marshmallow he d offered ginny and holding it over the fire himself right that sounds completely logical ginny said wearily remembering her mission she added um professor snape there appears to be a potion spilled in the corridor on the way up to gryffindor tower it a huge mess and i cantseem to find my way around it hermione and i have been trying for close to three hours hermione trying to clean it up but she sent me to go find professor mcgonagall to help and since you re here no can do weasley s mores are more important er but the entire corridor is it can wait snape interrupted ginny scratched her head it was obvious to her that the three of them had gone insane normal people didntstart campfires while hiding under desks after stealing the headmaster candies there was something seriously disturbing about seeing two of the strictest people she d ever known sitting cross legged and roasting marshmallows with a guy her brothers had hung out with for years who had visited their house during vacations and sat with the twins at mealtimes on occasion when she combined their manners with the fact that harry and hermione were waiting just down the hall under an invisibility cloak with malfoy waiting for ginny to lure snape outside so they could ask for his help i suddenly dont feel so good ginny said i think i ll just be going now she turned to go but oliver blocked the exit i cantlet you leave without eating a lemon drop she arched and eyebrow at him and folded her arms across her chest that way you cantrat us out if you ve eaten a lemon drop you re in the same boat as us ginny sighed and held out her hand fine oliver put a piece of the candy in her hand and waited for her to put it in her mouth before letting her pass ginny crawled out from beneath the desk and practically ran to the door harry hermione and draco had separated a little in the cramped secret passage only partially covered by the cloak with harry keeping an almost constant eye on the marauder map to make sure they could hide themselves fully before they were discovered draco kept looking at the map curiously where did you get that thing potter draco asked finally having seen and heard enough of it by this point to know what it was none of your business malfoy i was just asking you know draco snapped it not like i could turn you in for having it dumbledore probably already knows knowing you he probably gave it to you didnthear you complaining when it helped us get here harry retorted whatever happened to gryffindor bravery what you cantleave the dorms without hiding behind a cloak and checking for teachers with that map thing it called not being stupid enough to get caught harry try not to talk to him would you hermione said leaning against a wall her eyes half closed he much quieter when you ignore him harry snorted still watching the map if i could make him stay quiet by ignoring hmm this is interesting what hermione said standing up straight and coming over to look the map oliver appeared to have opened the door while snape and mcgonagall went over here then oliver and ginny went over here together and they re all standing very close too close in fact harry according to the placement of the windows and doors they re all sitting on professor mcgonagall desk hermione pointed out there not enough room for three adults and ginny to sit on the desk and why would they do that anyway harry wondered hermione frowned maybe there some sort of spell on the room we havent noticed before an enlargement spell or something something that would turn a small space into a large space so all we see is them standing in a small space maybe but that space is right on top of the desk isntit harry said hmm well look here comes ginny she ll tell us when she gets here hey she alone draco exclaimed indignantly he had moved closer to look over their shoulders without them noticing i sure she ll explain when she gets here hermione told him and turned away from him they put the cloak up over their heads but left it open in the front so ginny could see them but no one coming up behind them could ginny pushed open the entrance to the secret passage a moment later looking rather unhappy her eyes kept darting around nervously and she had a look on her face like she d just eaten something sour gulping loudly and making an even more sour face ginny coughed slightly and spoke sorry guys i out she said her eyes watering i not eating anymore lemon drops and snape a tad busy making s mores what draco said staring at her i your friend she told harry and hermione ignoring draco but i not sitting around anymore campfires wait until morning to talk to snape with that she turned on her heel and marched away campfires hermione repeated in mcgonagall office harry said staring down at the map as though expecting it to tell him something more believable s mores why would they be making s mores hermione wondered they re all purebloods arentthey what a lemon drop draco wondered aloud not really expecting an answer from either of them i guess we ll have to go ourselves harry said glaring in the general direction ginny had disappeared in it too suspicious now that we ve already sent ginny so draco started to move out from under the cloak let just go in there and demand some answers if you remember the last time any of us were out in the middle of the night reason or not gryffindor was docked a hundred and fifty points and harry neville you and i received detention it was your own fault transporting an illegal dragon draco said smugly just because you would never stick your neck out for a friend oh wait you dont have any real friends what do you know granger you re such a freak that the only people who would hang out with you are ow draco doubled over harry had just elbowed him hard in the gut i getting really sick of you harry growled i ve been sick of you draco retorted harry started to say something then stopped you know i just realized something i ll always hate you wow i feel so much better the feeling mutual why wouldntyou you know why no i don t you had the vision too why would that make you think we wouldnthate each other i should think if anything that would make us hate each other more and by the way those visions arentreal they cantbe they re bogus i mean i was bit by a cheese demon surely it just some sort of hallucination i am really sick of this vision crap hermione said shut up about it will you snape having a campout in mcgonagall office and if it could actually freak out ginny people who are on their last shred of sanity like the people standing in this secret passage with their worst enemy and an invisibility cloak will not be able to handle it let just get some sleep honestly haventyou both had enough fun for today werentthe cheese spirit quidditch practice and the attempted arm removing enough with that hermione marched out of the secret passage chapter thirty the shampoo duel between their shared visions and their interrupted argument harry and draco were both in a foul mood the whole way back to the dormitory while neither of them spoke much hermione could practically feel their anger radiating off of them in waves which only increased when they returned to the gryffindor common room after retrieving the chair and removing the cloak to find everyone who d been in the common room when they d left and then some waiting for them all of them with eager expressions as though they were hoping for explanations or more stuff to gossip about ginny was nowhere to be seen ignoring everyone they headed for their room i need a shower hermione mumbled the moment they got into the guestroom you ve already had one today not six hours ago harry pointed out and about seventeen yesterday draco muttered with a pained expression it seemed like the head inflation incident the hospital wing the food fight and the bathroom fiasco had all been ages ago it was hard to believe that they d only been chained together for three days hermione glared at him before looking back at harry wearily i need another one she said tiredly she d gotten slightly sweaty being under the cloak and running from draco at practice and felt somewhat grimy maybe it was just her imagination or maybe one of the boys hadntbathed properly but she also thought she could still smell rancid cheese harry glanced at the books no doubt thinking that he d at least get a chance to research the visions if he was in the bathroom instead of in bed and nodded pulling out his wand and aiming it at draco who scowled but didntsay anything hermione gathered up her nightgown and some fresh towels then led the way to the bathroom harry attempted to read while hermione showered but it seemed that draco had a bad habit of being unable to keep quiet or still and eventually draco started to antagonize harry before she knew it they were screaming at each other at least i dont have to have a mudblood girl do my homework for me you re just jealous because your only friends are as stupid as you are hermione growled having been able to block them out up until now she was starting to lose all patience however somewhere between at least they re purebloods and yeah and inbred hermione did the only thing she could think to do she grabbed a spare bar of soap from the shelf in the shower and lobbed it over the shower curtain in harry and draco general direction ow harry yelled a split second later what the draco exclaimed before he burst out laughing sorry harry hermione called meekly what was that for harry demanded i was aiming for malfoy no offense but your aim sucks bwahahahah ow hermione heard a slight slapping sound and could only assume that harry had thrown the soap bar at draco she turned to look through the shower curtain all she could see was shadows but it looked like they were now playing a demented game of catch with the soap one would throw the soap the other would use his quidditch player reflexes to catch it occasionally fumbling it a little from the slipperiness and then throw it back why they were bothering to throw soap instead of use wands or fists she couldntsay but she was worried that they d finally lost it she sighed figuring that she might as well finish her shower and turning away too tired and annoyed to deal with their antics right now just as she d closed her eyes and stuck her head under the spray to rinse off her shampoo she heard the curtain rustle and a moment later something touched her back hermione yelped and leaped to the other side of the shower turning as quickly as she could and opening her eyes she saw draco arm inside the shower waving around for some reason just as she started forward intent upon ripping his fingers off draco hand closed around her conditioner bottle and withdrew hey give that back hermione cried ha come on potter show me what you got draco yelled ignoring her another hand brushed her back and hermione shrieked and jumped back towards the front of the shower this time it was harry hand that was groping around inside the shower he seized her bottle of shampoo and retorted anytime you little prick a series of loud thwacking noises and miscellaneous shouts of things like ha and take that began hermione rolled her eyes and peeked around the shower curtain harry and draco were duking it out with her hair care products parrying blows like they would in a fencing match and occasionally landing hits on each other give it up malfoy harry said during a momentary pause where he and draco stood back panting and holding their bottles at the ready never draco proclaimed and lunged at harry swinging madly harry sidestepped him and smacked him in the head as he passed you re not going to beat me harry warned i ve sword fought a basilisk and won yeah that was five years ago and i knocked a few twigs loose from wood broom only this afternoon so i think i ll take my chances draco forced to stop his lunge because of the chain turned and swung his bottle at harry who blocked almost too fast for the eye to see draco whipped the bottle under harry guard and walloped harry in the side hermione turned away in disgust as the battle continued then realized she couldntfinish her shower without her conditioner hermione reached for her wand which she now kept in her arm cuff fastened with a spell high up on the shower wall away from the water she stuck her left hand through the curtain then raised her wand and yelled accio conditioner even as the bottle zoomed into her hand she heard draco shout no fair you little bitch and harry bottle smacking more repeatedly against draco body before hermione could begin to feel smug about it draco hand plunged back into the shower startling her half to death once again this time his hand was in front of her not wanting him to get up the nerve and the brains to open the curtain to look and see where another bottle was she whacked him with her conditioner bottle a few times and grudgingly handed him a bottle of his own expensive young wizards shampoo hermione refused to let their petty fight bother her after all she d seen and been involved in her fair share of petty fights over the past few days and did her best to ignore them she used mostly her right arm to condition her hair and finish washing herself as draco kept jerking around her left in the course of the fight and singing old muggle pop songs to cover up the noise she finished her shower without any further annoyances and managed to get dried and dressed inside the shower without falling over which was no easy task with draco running around the bathroom once she was done she paused in her singing to see if they d stopped fighting and when a shout of die reached her ears followed by when will you evil jackasses learn that nothing kills me she resumed her singing half an hour and most of an album later hermione decided that she couldntstay in the shower all night and pulled back the curtain halting her singing if she hadntbeen singing so loud she might have noticed that somewhere along the line harry and draco had stopped shouting insults at one another and that each hit the bottle made caused a much more hollow sound but as she d been half screaming herself she was completely surprised by the sight that met her eyes harry and draco were still dueling but it appeared that sometime during the fight one of them had gotten the bright idea to squirt the other with their shampoo and the other had followed suit harry was now coated in a blue slimy substance that could only be young wizards while draco was covered from head to toe in hermione apple scented muggle shampoo the entire bathroom seemed to be coated in blue and green slime and through it all draco and harry were still going at it with their mostly empty containers slipping in the shampoo but somehow managing to stay upright the shouting had stopped because both boys were keeping their mouths firmly closed in an attempt to keep the gunk out of their mouths what are you doing hermione shrieked harry looked over at her and promptly lost his footing he landed hard on his side draco let out a triumphant yell and advanced on him and then fell flat on his back thanks to hermione giving the chain a good hard yank what is wrong with you two hermione shouted are you complete infants who in their right minds has a shampoo duel he started it harry said indignantly no he started it draco was quick to say no he technically i started it hermione cut in but that was an accident was not draco muttered sitting up and it shouldnt matter that does not give you the right to waste perfectly good shampoo while beating each other my shampoo draco wailed only just realizing that he d just wasted it all you re going to pay for this potter harry struggled into a sitting position bring it malfoy stop it hermione screamed waving her wand about wildly just stop do you have any idea how many curses i know you re going to stop and you re going to go to sleep or you re going to be turned into hermit crabs grudgingly harry looked at draco and held his bottle out to the side draco did the same he waited for harry to drop his bottle first then dropped his own not wanting to get hit with a curse in the back by an angry girl especially not since he d become rather bruised over the past hour between hitting the shampoo bottles harry fists and the walls and floor and he had had enough bruises already given how badly his weekend had gone evanesco hermione intoned pointing her wand at the room in general the shampoo vanished leaving only a faint smell of apples and what she assumed was draco shampoo fighting the urge to growl she stomped over to the sink to brush her teeth she reached for her tube of toothpaste and discovered it was missing sighing heavily she asked does someone want to tell me what happened to my toothpaste um it s over here harry mumbled and got up crossed the room and picked something up off the floor before walking to hermione and holding out a tube of nearly empty toothpaste what happened to it hermione asked wearily unable to muster any more mrs weasley like moments um well harry began reddening and rubbing the back of his neck i disarmed malfoy and he got out his wand and tried to summon something but i think he missed i did not draco muttered darkly and your toothpaste zoomed over only it didntreally work well as a sword so he squirted me with your toothpaste and while i was trying to get out of the way of it i saw your lotion hermione spluttered angrily now that she thought of it the smell in the room wasnt apples and young wizards but apples and peaches my favorite lotion my wonderful smelling wonderful feeling very expensive peach scented lotion i ll buy you a new one harry said meekly picking up a large bottle from the floor and setting it down on the counter with a hollow clunking noise and then what happened hermione demanded narrowing her eyes well i squirted him with the lotion then i ran out so i tried to go back to the sink only it didntwork out too well i slipped in the lotion and toothpaste and i accidentally kicked his shampoo back over to him and he squirted that at me so i shot back with your shampoo harry trailed off blushing and seeming to cower before her like a first year student facing an angry mcgonagall hermione sighed used a spell to clean her teeth as best she could and headed for the bedroom i going to bed no sooner had she stepped into the main room than a knock sounded on the door um hermione came neville voice sounding rather worried are you in there what is it neville hermione asked hurrying towards the door draco dragging behind her i was just wondering if you were okay i heard shouting and who was that singing old backstreet boys tunes yelled another voice which was unmistakably lavender brown hermione froze with her hand on the doorknob how many people are out there neville hermione called cautiously backing slowly away from the door um a few thirty two called dennis creevey helpfully thirty two harry repeated incredulously you ve been making quite a racket you know called george we heard you all the way in ron room what are you talking about said dean thomas you both had your ears pressed to the door when seamus and i ow was that harry yelling i am immortal eat potion asked colin creevey it was lotion draco called back without thinking why does everything smell like apples and peaches parvati patil demanded forget that what were you fighting about jack sloper wanted to know hey whatever happened with that cheese monster guys seamus finnigan asked can i come in came ginny voice she was apparently over whatever had happened in mcgonagall office she sounded rather amused this i gotta hear oh be quiet ginny or i ll make sure you have another campout with snape hermione yelled crossly there was silence on the other side of the door for a few minutes hermione could only speculate but she was fairly certain that everyone was now staring questioningly at ginny thanks hermione ginny said after a moment sighing thanks a lot campout with snape fred repeated i think i ll just retreat now and think up a good explanation though i can tell you now its foundation will be the argument that hermione is delusional i am not delusional just for that you get lemon drops for christmas what a lemon drop asked neville who like most purebloods was unfamiliar with muggle candy goodnight hermione ginny called g night harry goodnight they both called back sourly you cantleave gin you re our ticket in exclaimed one of ginny roommates somebody stop her fred yelled get back i ll put the bat bogey hex on each and every one of you watch it guys i think she serious george said nervously you re damned right i am but she the only one who knows the password how will we get in lavender whined no one is getting in hermione fairly screamed i going to bed hey is it true that you and malfoy have to share a bed parvati asked no harry hermione and draco shouted as one fine we ll just wait out here harry has to come out sometime lavender yelled harry nervously edged away from the door actually harry hasntbeen sleeping in our room seamus said there was another long pause hermione put her head in her hands sure enough a few moments later everyone started talking at once speculating on just why harry was now rooming with hermione so he sleeping in there with hermione and malfoy i knew hermione dumped ron for him never thought you had it in you girl go hermione go hermione go go go hermione pay up andrew that five galleons i am sound proofing the door hermione screamed really fred said his tone so suggestive that hermione vowed to strangle him why exactly a loud round of laughter sounded oh that it hermione roared hermione unlocked the door and yanked it open raising her wand and suddenly there was a stampede to get back through the wall and into the common room harry rushed forward to try and hold her back doing his best to get her wand down and succeeding just long enough for the wall to start to close behind the last gryffindor fred and george seeing her contained momentarily by harry paused by the way hermione fred called as the wall slid shut nice nightgown harry released hermione who glared at the blank wall but turned around and marched back into the bedroom flopping down on her bed harry smiled weakly at her as he shut the door locked it and put a few charms on it remember what you said last summer harry said as he got into bed next to her about writing a book maybe even a series telling the story of me and you and ron and defeating voldemort and our time at hogwarts yeah hermione said if you ever do write that book harry told her as he took off his glasses leave this part out chapter thirty one blame it all on the prank war for a little while it seemed that harry and draco were through fighting for the night they were both quiet and hermione was able to drift off to sleep however not long after she d started breathing regularly draco muttered this is all your fault my fault harry hissed incredulously draco whose main intention was to wake hermione up rudely from her sleep after all she d put him through she didntdeserve a good night rest glared over at harry yeah you if you hadntstarted this mess me me you started this mess harry snapped as loudly as he dared you with that prank on hermione if you werentsuch an asshole i never would have started it i an asshole ha you ve never been anything but an asshole and everyone in hogwarts agrees oh good comeback potter who taught you that weasel or that big oaf hagrid shut your mouth harry snarled knowing draco was just trying to bait him but he d been put through the ringer for the past few days because of draco and his patience was long gone why dontyou make me potter why dontyou just jump off the astronomy tower malfoy why donti just push you off it i d like to see you try once again great comeback haventheard that one since before i started hogwarts why are you even still at hogwarts why couldntyou have just gone to jail or died like your loser father and the rest of the death why couldnt you have just died with your parents like you were supposed to draco interrupted angrily both of them had just been pushed over the edge they each reached for their wands simultaneously but draco got there first he started to call out a spell in a last ditch attempt to stop him harry threw his body to the side and hit the chain yanking draco to the ground draco wand flew out of his hand he hit the floor and reached for harry legs trying to pull him down before harry could get his own wand harry kicked him as hard as he could with bare feet and draco yelped before grabbing harry foot and yanking harry flew backwards onto the bed kicking draco in the opposite direction as he went so hermione awoke to harry landing painfully on her stomach and her left arm nearly being pulled out of its socket by draco hermione eyes flew open flashing with fury as harry scrambled off of her she drew her wand and hit them both with the impediment jinx which was painful but not paralyzing both of them got back up fairly fast looking at her warily i not going to get yanked out of my bed every night hermione snarled from cheese spirit to shampoo i ve had a rough day and you two are not going to make it any rougher hermione advanced and the two boys quickly backed up accordingly draco more worried than harry as draco didnthave seven years of friendship on his side or the ability to move more than five feet away from her but hermione stopped once she was clear of the bed and turned around she waved her wand and called out a levitation charm harry and hermione nightstand lifted high into the air and with hermione wand directing it settled on the other side of the bed the same fate met draco nightstand and another wave of her wand sent the two beds colliding with a loud crash lastly she called out a warding spell something harry had seen her use several times when she wanted to ensure that she was the only one who could undo a spell there she said in satisfaction and crawled back onto the bed which was slightly more difficult without the space in the middle being there the mattresses were pushed flush against each other considering the length of the chain neither of them would be able to fall off either edge if they slept on opposite ends of the bed what are you doing harry asked staring at her in horror i making sure i dontget yanked onto the floor anymore hermione said sleepily already burrowing under the covers with her head on the pillow i am not sleeping with the beds right next to each other harry said me either draco said crossing his arms over his chest as best he could with the chain stretching out over the bed suit yourself hermione said closing her eyes harry glared at her then brightened and looked at draco well if you re not sleeping in there then why should i care he grinned at draco furious expression goodnight malfoy harry hopped onto the bed hermione opened her eyes just enough to look at draco and smirk and then both she and harry attempted to sleep draco considered making enough noise to keep them up all night but he had no doubt that he d end up paralyzed on the floor again harry and hermione were both better at spells than he was and short of hitting them in their sleep he didntsee how he could get the drop on both of them at the same time but they d both be furious when they woke up and therefore more dangerous he didntreally see any way to hit them with anything gruesome without waking them up and there was no point in knocking them out when they were already asleep unless he went all out and killed them but that would probably have serious repercussions for some reason the general populous actually wanted the two of them alive he sighed he was tired and short of sleeping standing up he wasntgoing to get any rest he knew a few charms that might separate the beds again but all of them would probably wake up harry and hermione and draco really wasntup for a fight just then there was no visible way to fix the bed situation without both of them attacking him and draco was too tired to think of one anyway he sat down on the edge of the bed sulking it figured that they d find a way to push him right out of his bed but really why should he let them why should he have to lose sleep it was his bed and from what he d seen harry and hermione didntroll around much in their sleep he could probably just sleep down on the edge and then both gryffindors would see him in the morning and realize that they hadntwon after all he wasntgoing to let them push him around like this and when they saw that draco hadntgiven up the bed entirely they d surely move the beds back apart being as immature as they were right draco whispered to himself and climbed onto the bed as far away from hermione and harry as possible the next morning ginny trudged downstairs dark circles under her eyes she hadntbeen able to get everyone to leave her alone for ages and it was only after she d actually used the bat bogey hex on lavender brown that the questions died down still ginny hadntbeen able to sleep her roommates chattering had kept her awake and when she d finally slept her dreams had been completely bizarre she dreamt she was back under mcgonagall desk with snape oliver and mcgonagall and ginny roommates gossip blended in to the dream so the three professors all sounded like teenaged girls and discussed almost nothing but harry ron hermione and draco they kept asking her to eat lemon drops too somewhere around her fifth refusal they d started throwing large bags of lemon drops at her and when she was nearly buried in them the desk had exploded above them and she d looked up to see dumbledore standing above her looking scarier than voldemort ever had and screaming at her for stealing from him ginny had woken up with a yelp cursed harry and hermione existence and tried to sleep again only to dream about snape some more this time he d given her a christmas sweater like the one she d seen him wandering around in and then told her that he needed her help to cut draco arm off and that she d be expelled if she didntdo it and tried by the ministry and sentenced to wearing the sweater for the rest of her life should she be found guilty needless to say she d given up on sleep after that she was incredibly tired but at least she d gotten in some last minute studying she was a little worried about the lack of study time she d had in the past few weeks but she fairly certain she could scrape a passing grade she was really more worried about the lemon drop thing surely dumbledore wasntreally after mcgonagall wood and snape was he no of course not he would have already caught them right ginny did her best not to think about it as she headed down to hermione room figuring she d just hide in there for as long as possible before sneaking down to the kitchens to breakfast since hermione quidditch practice a lot of rumors had been flying about hermione and snape and thirty one gryffindors knowing that ginny had sat around at least one campfire with snape wasntgoing to make her life very easy she was almost to the bottom of the girls dormitory staircases when a long horrified shriek cut through the early morning stillness like a samurai sword she nearly fell down the remaining steps in shock she recognized the scream immediately from the previous day malfoy another deeper yell harry voice she was sure of it added to the noise whatever it was had to be major they both sounded absolutely panicked she could hear people waking up with startled yelps all around her the sound was echoing around gryffindor tower and probably half the seventh floor ginny steadied herself on the stairs and ran for hermione room praying that her friends were okay draco awoke quite suddenly so suddenly that he wasntsure what the cause was something caught his eye and he turned his head to the right to see hermione kneeling beside him about time she said smiling at him in a distinctively suggestive way i ve been waiting ages for you to wake up why didntyou just yell or something he asked regarding her warily you looked so cute in your sleep she said her smile widening draco swallowed wondering if this was some sort of prank or if she d been cursed somehow and hoping fervently that he was imagining things where potter he blurted out knowing that harry should be freaking out right now if hermione was acting the way draco thought she was i asked him to leave you why draco demanded feeling a jolt of panic because i want to be alone with you she said trailing a finger along his jaw line and down his neck why draco asked in a high pitched voice that sounded more like a squeak his every instinct was screaming at him to run but he couldntseem to move i want to tell you a secret she said lowering her voice to a whisper her hand kept moving lower down his chest very slowly her touch feather light what draco choked out run run run run his brain screamed at him hermione leaned down and put her mouth very close to his ear too close far too close you were right i can get the chain off w wha you how you can draco stammered his brain refusing to process this i just dontwant to she continued you like chains do you he said then cursed himself that was not the right thing to say at a moment like this she was coming on to him what was going on hermione giggled well that and you me hermione pulled back staring down at him oh the look on your face she said in amusement all shocked and fearful a mischievous glint appeared in her eye i ll help you relax though dontworry run you stupid idiot his brain shouted but draco was still frozen in place the commands to run were now warring with the phrase granger seducing me granger seducing me which kept repeating in his head like a mantra hermione started to lean towards him her lips parted and her eyes closing sheer terror fought with anticipation and excitement he wanted her to do it but he hated her yes he hated her he hated her argh no draco entire body jerked and his eyes flew open hermione was gone a dream draco thought happily relief flooding him as he closed his eyes again it was all just a dream granger didnttry to kiss me in fact i not chained to her i in my own bed and the prank war never happened i in the slytherin dorm and apparently there someone with me so it must have been a great night last night draco shifted a little someone was curled up around him undoubtedly someone he d been getting drunk with last night his head hurt rather badly and he felt like he had a few bruises so all signs pointed to him getting trashed strange he rarely let himself get drunk enough that he would wake up hung over with no memory of the previous night but there was no other explanation hermione stop moving mumbled a decidedly masculine voice harry potter voice draco opened his eyes and turned to look at his companion apparently the prank war really had happened he was really chained to hermione his head hurt and his body was bruised for many reasons one of which was that hermione had bashed him in the head with oliver broom and harry had whacked him with a shampoo bottle but more importantly harry was cuddled up against him aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh harry jerked awake his head wasnton one of his best friends stomachs but his worst enemy chest aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh what wrong what happening hermione was now awake her wand drawn harry wand in her free hand and extended towards him but he wasntexactly paying attention harry had sat up as had draco and they were both just screaming in each other faces she couldntsee what the problem was harry dove off the bed still screaming and ran like a lunatic for the bathroom a moment later the sound of violent puking replaced his mortified shouting harry hermione yelled trying to follow him but only able to get to the foot of the bed because of the chain she tried yanking on it but draco refused to move still screaming in complete terror harry are you okay the door burst open just then and ginny rushed in looking frightened what going on she gasped help harry hermione shrieked tossing her harry wand and gesturing towards the bathroom ginny nodded and dashed for the bathroom leaving the bedroom door open hermione what hermione turned the weasley twins had just arrived and most of the residents of gryffindor tower were right on their heels hermione opened her mouth then closed it hopelessly having no idea what was going on what wrong called an urgent voice and ron burst through the crowd looking beyond worried ron hermione exclaimed relieved harry malfoy they both just started screaming i don t where harry ron demanded bathroom i think he s ginny ran back out of the bathroom looking green i love you herm but i cantwatch harry puke much longer it disgusting what wrong with him hermione asked raising her voice even more to be heard over draco continuous screaming if he ever stops puking i ll ask him ginny said crossly out of my way ron said and pushed past her into the bathroom hermione grabbed the chain and gave it a strong yank as discreetly as she could but to no avail draco didntmove nor did he shut up silencio she yelled in exasperation but draco continued to screech his mouth gaping open in a silent scream hermione sighed thankful that she couldnthear him though the sound was replaced by harry retching and ron muttering something before she could decide if this was a good thing or a bad thing parvati patil who was peering between the twins decided to make matters worse so you do have to share a bed with malfoy hermione rounded on her get out she growled through gritted teeth her eyes flashing go on guys said george turning around and shooing away the ones who hadntimmediately run for it there nothing to see here are you okay fred asked stepping towards hermione i d be a lot better if life wasntso damned strange she muttered yanking on the chain again fruitlessly hermione looked over at him what was with you guys yesterday anyway something about snape and singing fred expression became stony you of all people should know better than to mess with us and then act all innocent afterwards hermione sighed and threw up her hands fine dontbelieve me the idea that i sent snape to sing at you make so much more sense this is a prank war hermione fred told her sharply we re the best pranksters hogwarts has ever seen and after that little stunt you pulled yesterday we re on ron side the prank war hermione said bitterly could you be any more juvenile this from the girl who tied malfoy to the goalpost in women underwear george retorted pointedly you know what hermione snapped i dontcare what you do i ll kick your ass do you understand me i dontknow what you think i did but if i were going to prank you you d know it and i wouldntpretend i hadn t you are the ones who will make the first move and when you do expect some major payback just try it little girl fred said coldly and he and george turned and left hermione sighed realizing that she d just made life a lot worse for herself but not really caring she was tired she was unable to leave the presence of her least favorite classmate and ever minute of every day seemed to bring some new problem part of her hoped the twins would try something just so she could release a little anger ginny stood up and sighed glancing from the door to hermione and back again listen i really dontwant to go back out there but if you want me to talk to them gin dontsuffer anymore at my expense hermione said wearily if you want to go for it but i not going to ask you to stick your neck out further ginny smiled hey what are friends for she said she left as well leaving hermione alone with the silently screaming draco harry come on ron said in exasperation as harry continued to heave what the hell did you do eat raw hippogriff worse harry choked out what happened i dontwant to talk about it harry said glumly ron sat back on his heels harry he began slowly ron listen harry said quickly dontstorm out on us we need you we re your friends hermione your girlfriend we ve been through a lot together i ve tried but i cantdo this alone malfoy driving me mad and there all these new problems it not supposed to be hermione and harry it supposed to be ron hermione and harry ron face clouded you re right harry it supposed to be but it isn t you and hermione are keeping things from me things that you donteven keep from ginny and the twins and she cheating on me you know she wouldntdo that harry said hotly standing up and going to the sink to brush his teeth yeah then what this about hickeys huh she been alone in snape office doing god knows what playing a prank on malfoy that what harry insisted yeah she and snape are pretty friendly though arentthey and they practically attacked me and fred and george yesterday snape and wood her ex that she never bothered to tell me about that you never bothered to tell me about and snape i donteven know where to start ron the whole school has lost its mind why would wood and snape do anything together especially if they re both supposedly mad about hermione snape been singing and dancing all over hogwarts he wearing color and wood was never entirely sane either you remember what i told you about him as quidditch captain if you would just stop being stupid and open your eyes ron tensed and harry cringed knowing that he d said the wrong thing i didntmean it like that harry said hastily you didn t ron said coldly no i have a nice life with hermione harry ron snarled maybe snape will let you be the best man with that he stomped out of the bathroom hermione sat down on the edge of the bed wondering what was going on in the bathroom harry and ron seemed to be talking right now but she couldntmake out what they were saying she hoped it was something good a few seconds later ron came out of the bathroom and her heart sank he looked ready to kill someone ron she began and he stopped and turned to look at her she hastily jumped off the bed then wished she hadn t as it made her look rather guilty ron glared at her then turned to look at draco who was still screaming silently ron eyes swept over the bed then around the room as if he were looking for something hermione realized suddenly how bad it must look ron wasntgoing to give her time to explain just why she d pushed the beds together and from the lack of pillows and blankets anywhere but the bed it was obvious that the three of them had been sharing which she had to admit looked very very odd so you re sharing a bed with malfoy too now ron said in a carefully controlled voice and harry too right well ron you know perfectly well that i am not doing anything with harry or malfoy or snape no ron said bluntly i don t i wouldnthave thought you d do it before now i barely surprised you know me ron you know i not like that maybe i would know you if you werentalways lying ron snapped and marched away hermione tried to follow him but draco still wouldntmove suddenly her hurt was replaced by anger she needed ron and she d never meant to hurt ron and she really couldntbe brought to believe that she d done anything wrong oliver and the tattoo were none of ron business and ron had no right to jump to conclusions snape well it wasntlike she d been cheating it was just something she d thought was necessary to freak draco out but ron wouldnteven listen he didntcare that she needed him that she was trying to cope with draco and help harry through this vision thing in fact when had he ever given her needs a second thought fine ron hermione shouted after him go ahead leave ron paused with his hand on the doorknob and hermione kept yelling i dontknow what you want me to do but if you wonteven let me explain then go stick your head back up your ass and wander around like the oblivious little git you are ron whirled back around to face her his face and ears an ugly red we re going to get you he spat me and the twins go ahead you stupid prat she shrieked ron eyes widened and he took a step forward raising his arms a little with his fingers curled as though the thought of strangling her was becoming irresistible with some difficulty he turned and stormed out slamming the door behind him so hard that the room seemed to shake hermione took a deep shuddering breath then turned away and summoned her trunk to her side she dug out her robes her hands shaking with fury well that didntgo well harry mumbled emerging from the bathroom i gonna kick his ass hermione growled you know what harry ron doesntdeserve me he a quidditch obsessed self absorbed idiot please dontcontinue this list harry interrupted quickly then he frowned hey what wrong with being quidditch obsessed i ll make him pay for this hermione went on ignoring him leaving me and you alone to deal with malfoy and visions we re supposed to be a team harry but no i guess he wasntin it for the friendship hermione but he doesntdeserve me harry i smart i pretty i can function in the wizarding and muggle worlds i can speak three languages i know more spells than half the school combined and i can use the telephone you realize you re raving right hermione ignored him i going to get him we re going to get him me and harry knock ron out she finished assembling the day outfit and started changing harry turned his back who would know more about getting to ron than his best friends no one oh and we ll have ginny that girl quite scary sometimes and we can blame it all on the prank war hermione let out a distinctly evil laugh and harry couldnthelp but wonder once again at the strangeness of his life recently he d never exactly been normal but he d come to expect certain things snape was a prick hermione was sane ron was his friend the twins werentaffronted by singing oliver was just a quidditch loving teacher and draco stayed in his own common room only coming out to make idle threats and bad insults now since the beginning of the prank war everything had changed how did this tradition survive harry wondered sitting on the edge of the bed wearily did my parents and sirius go through this was it this much of a freak show for the marauders and my mum he realized he d stopped paying attention to hermione when she leaped in front of him fully dressed but with her uncombed bushy hair sticking out in all directions and a crazed expression on her face come on harry get dressed we have to plan our war harry couldnthelp but grin at her she looked so so adorable like a little puppy that was delusional enough to think it was tough enough to take on the world right harry said you calm malfoy down i ll get dressed then we ll plan the war on the way to finding snape we need his help excellent idea harry he ll be a great asset in the prank war harry watched her as she tried to go smack some sense literally into draco so this was it he was now destined to fight against his best friend and the weasley twins with hermione at his side while seeking snape help for the visions and maybe enlisting him to pull a prank or two while this should have made him feel quite unhappy he suddenly could no longer be brought to care just another normal fun filled day he muttered and went to go get dressed chapter thirty two malfoy go boom oliver awoke with a splitting headache leaden limbs and a severely dry throat he immediately realized he was hung over and badly so however he didnthave the vaguest idea why his second insight was that wasntin his bed he appeared to be lying on carpet passed out on the floor again oliver thought unconcerned gotta stop getting drunk with the team after every win just before he fell back asleep he remembered that he hadntbeen on the team in several months and that he was now a hogwarts professor awakening quite quickly he jerked into a sitting position and promptly clunked his head on something ow looking around groggily he realized that he was in fact under a desk and it didntappear to be his he couldntsee much from where he was other than the fact that he was covered in large purple red stains and wearing rumpled clothes nervously he climbed out from under the desk and glanced around for any other signs of life he was alone and he was apparently in mcgonagall office he couldntremember why though thinking hard he struggled to recall the previous day but could only bring to mind a few funny moments on the quidditch pitch with hermione and the slytherin team so how had he ended up passed out beneath mcgonagall desk sighing oliver headed for the door hopefully mcgonagall would know i serious ginny insisted snape mcgonagall and oliver werentdoing it for hermione they would never do that besides they ve all been acting funny do you have any idea what they did to me yesterday fred and george gazed back at her stonily arms folded across their chests ginny sighed knowing it was a lost cause but also knowing that she couldntgive up just yet her brothers were a force to be reckoned with they were smart and they had a twisted outlook on the world that gave them few inhibitions if they got into it with hermione the prank war would be renamed as the weasley granger war and before long people would be running for their lives and the castle would have to be evacuated ginny opened her mouth praying she could talk some sense into them in case harry failed to get through to ron but before she could say another word ron burst through the door and her stomach dropped he looked ready to murder someone he turned and glared at her in much the same way as the twins get out gin ron said coldly narrowing her eyes ginny stalked out then paused on the stairs she couldntlet this go if fred george and ron didntlisten to reason and fast she was going to be screwed and so were hermione and harry she turned back around but the boys had already shut the door she reached for the knob but her hand couldntseem to make contact with the door an invisible barrier was surrounding it an imperturbable charm ginny knew a way to break through the charm at least temporarily but it was tricky if she didntopen the door and make it in before the charm re strengthened she d be blasted backwards and probably knocked down the stairs and seriously injured her hovering hand just above the knob she prepared to open the door and run then cast the counter spell time to call in the big guns george was saying as the door creaked open who that ron asked and ginny stopped knowing this was far more important than getting them to listen to reason she withdrew her hand from the knob and waited peeves the twins said in unison ginny could practically see their mischievous grins the charm resealed but ginny didntcare peeves could take out an entire city with sheer annoyance if they were enlisting him fred george and ron werentgoing to listen to reason any time soon so harry and hermione would have to without a second thought she turned and dashed back down the stairs it took quite some time to get draco to stop screaming but once he had he was ready to go see snape almost immediately the dream had scared the crap out of him especially given his bizarre behavior on the quidditch pitch and waking up with harry curled up on him had been the last straw he didntcare if the dreams or visions would be useful he just wanted them gone waking up so early had been somewhat advantageous they now had plenty of time to get to snape before breakfast after a quick glance at the marauder map to make sure snape was already in his office they headed out ignoring all questions thrown at them from the gryffindors who d been rudely awakened by their screaming harry hermione and draco marched straight for the dungeons all of them determined harry and draco determined to force snape to tell them how to fix the visions and hermione to recruit him within a few moments of leaving the dormitory the unlikely trio was pounding on snape door and he called for them to enter hermione walked in first followed quickly by harry and draco both of whom recoiled slightly snape was wearing a bright pumpkin orange sweater beneath his robes but thankfully they could only see his collar his robes were closed which made him look slightly more like his old self his hair was tied back however which looked quite strange far more of his face was visible and it was too difficult to tell if his hair was greasy or not he looked much younger somehow in the same way sirius had a tendency to do when he was happy ah hello snape said cheerfully which sent an involuntary shudder through the three students there was no getting used to his happy side what can i do for you we need your help hermione said and then promptly burst into tears snape and harry stared at her at a loss for words and draco edged farther away from her disgusted what wrong harry asked tentatively taking a step forward and wondering how best to comfort her ron hates me she sobbed the twins are gonna torture me to death i chained to malfoy isntthat enough hermione started to say something else but her hysterical sobs prevented it taking pity on her harry awkwardly put his arms around her and let hermione sob against his chest it ll be okay hermione harry said soothingly trying to stroke her hair and getting his fingers caught she d forgotten to brush it he settled for rubbing her back instead no sob it won t why did malfoy have to pick sob me he supposed to hate you you or ron why me because he a git harry said glaring at draco who was mimicking hermione behind her back in a most unflattering way he should have been a git to you she shrieked whacking her fist against his chest hard enough that harry winced wellll the prank wouldnthave worked if it were me harry said racking his brains for something comforting to say and he just prejudiced because you re muggle born snape said helpfully i canthelp that she screamed and there hundreds of other muggle borns in hogwarts why couldnthe have done it to one of them come on hermione look on the bright side harry said you ve done loads of things to get him back haventyou you made him think you and snape were an item hermione let out an even louder sob and harry hastily continued you tied him to the goalpost he got me back she choked out yes but his response sucked she looked up at him hopefully really yeah totally i mean no one even saw it and we got him back really good for that we ve been kicking his butt since day one you did make him puke snape pointed out and tormented him in quite a few other ways hermione sniffled looking a tad better which lasted for all of three seconds before she broke down again but what about ron she howled sobbing again he ll come around honest dontsay that evil word right yeah he ll get over it he will i mean it isntanything major and he ll get over snape and you re pathetic at comforting people potter snape said dryly as hermione cried harder at the mention of ron reasons to be angry and i suppose you could do better you harry began hotly then paused what is that in your hair what snape reached up to brush his hand over the top of his hair but harry was staring at his ponytail which was held with a pink ribbon tied in a bow is that a bow harry exclaimed incredulously draco looked over even hermione stopped crying momentarily and turned around to see oh yes it is snape said with a shrug i didnthave anything to tie my hair back with and one of the hufflepuffs had put it around her essay scroll from last weeks homework what is wrong with you draco shouted so suddenly that everyone jumped he marched forward seized snape by the shoulders and began to shake him you have a pink bow in your hair pull yourself together man st t top it snape stuttered going slightly cross eyed as draco continued to shake him a bow harry mumbled shaking his head what next we ve driven snape to madness hermione yelled crying once more twice as hard never get into ministry job applications say drove teacher to pink bows we re doomed whole lives ruined and i ll never marry ron will you stop crying draco roared there there granger it okay snape is wearing a bow harry moaned pressing his palms against his eyes as if to bore the image out snape put his arm around hermione shoulder dontworry granger you ve just got to think like a slytherin channel all that anger into mean hateful vengeance so says the guy with the bow draco growled this is all malfoy fault hermione whined got that right harry muttered come now we ll find a way to fix it in no time you ll have your boyfriend back and you ll graduate and you ll get a good job and get married and have three point seven kids and a dog what is going on in here everyone looked around mcgonagall looking a little tired and pale but otherwise normal had appeared in the doorway her eyes swept over the tearful hermione the compassionate snape with his pink bow ponytail the weary harry and the furious draco never mind mcgonagall said shaking her head i dontwant to know severus wood showed up in my chambers confused and looking like he got hit by a truck he needs a good strong potion you three you re to make up your charms exam right after breakfast and your transfiguration exam after dinner did i drive you crazy too hermione interrupted softly what mcgonagall frowned at her did i drive you insane are you going to start wearing pink bows in your hair and whistling while you work are you going to give me a bad reference when i apply for jobs i so sorry hermione wailed and burst into sobs again she a little upset right now snape told mcgonagall apologetically gee do you think harry muttered granger pull yourself together i ve got bigger problems draco snapped i cantget you out of my head and all you can do is stand there and she in your head snape cut in grinning and looking at mcgonagall who snorted a little as she tried to suppress a laugh i ve driven malfoy mad too hermione that a good thing harry said in exasperation all my fault snape never should have hickeys oh gross hermione threw herself into an armchair in front of snape desk to cry no one was paying much attention to hermione at the moment save harry which was a good thing because draco would have taken the opportunity to gloat over hermione admission and mcgonagall would have been horrified and demanded an explanation hermione began rambling through her tears about everything from rabbits to beef stew very little of which made any sort of sense draco rolled his eyes and turned to his professors how do i stop the visions professor he asked snape wearily i cantkeep having them you re going to have to i afraid snape said with a slight smile they wontgo away what do you mean they wontgo away draco demanded panic rising within him they have to go away i cantkeep having visions about granger it sickening if i knew how to stop them i would tell you snape said perfectly straight faced but somehow unable to seem sincere you you what about that thing potter did when the dark lord was around occlu occoo ock you la men occlumency mcgonagall interrupted looking as though she was trying desperately not to laugh is only for psychic attacks if someone were trying to attack your mental someone is the cheese spirit he attacking my brain draco tapped his fingers against his forehead sharply and nodded his eyes wide he looked rather creepy and insane no snape said his face twitching like mad as he tried to hold back his mirth the visions arentan attack you can no more stop them than a seer can stop themselves from i have to stop them draco screeched teach me ock you la men see i have to try something look at me i chained to granger i woke up in bed with potter draco stamped his foot repeatedly looking close to tears himself snape and mcgonagall were both staring at him in a shocked and mortified sort of way and it suddenly occurred to draco how that last part had sounded indignant furious and absolutely powerless to do anything about it draco let out a small scream oh ock you both he yelled and started to storm away only to land flat on his back he d forgotten the chain and completely lost his balance when it had been pulled taut there was silence for a few moments other than hermione sobs harry who had been trying to cheer her up all this time figured the draco sudden fall was as good a thing as any to use in lifting hermione spirits in the same soothing talking to scared children voice he d been using for quite some time harry shook hermione gently and said look hermione malfoy go boom he wasntsure why he d said that it was just the first thing that had come out the strange phrasing got hermione to look up and when she saw draco lying on the ground glaring up at the ceiling his pale face turning an unnatural ron like red she let out a small giggle through her tears and smiled this appeared to push poor draco off the edge rrrraaaawwwwgggg he roared leaping to his feet so suddenly that everyone instinctively jumped back and began fumbling for their wands before anyone could gather their wits draco dove at harry with his hands outstretched it wasntreally the best of moves he didntpunch or kick or start strangling or anything else directly painful he did however hit harry like a freight train and keep going harry and draco soon hit snape desk and toppled right over the back of it kicking several jars of pickled specimens down on top of themselves hermione was yanked forward and into the desk so hard she screamed mcgonagall rushed forward to tend to her while snape ran around to the back of the desk trying to break up the fight are you all right mcgonagall asked hermione worriedly hermione nodded weakly clutching her stomach with her chain free hand mcgonagall rushed around to the side of the desk drawing her wand stupefy she called aiming as best she could for draco who had lost all sense of reason and was swinging madly at harry unfortunately snape who hadntseen mcgonagall come over had moved right into her path while attempting to pull the two boys apart a jet of red light hit snape squarely in the back and he keeled over landing in a heap next to draco and harry oh damn mcgonagall muttered taking aim again did you just swear hermione demanded shrilly granger now isntthe mcgonagall began but hermione cut her off you re not supposed to swear hermione cried a look of intense anguish on her face you re a teacher the best teacher i ve driven you mad too and it malfoy fault and before mcgonagall could stop her hermione dove at draco somewhere between gryffindor tower and the fourth floor ginny worry had developed into panic harry hermione and draco had left their room and they had no clue that fred george ron and peeves were now out to get them ginny had to find them she d been running flat out for quite some time checking all the places she could think of where the three of them might have gone whenever fred and george had told her about some prank they d pulled ginny had always found herself thinking i so glad i their sister and they d never do anything really horrible to me now however it seemed all bets were off the twins had just become official players in the prank war and she knew that now that it was them now that it was personal everyone who wasntbehind them was going down the pranks would be a hell of a lot worse than anything they would have suggested to ron and harry ginny had to talk some sense into harry and hermione before they all ended up as long term st mungo residents i really cantkeep doing this ginny muttered realizing her nerves were completely shot she hadntslept right in a good long while she was constantly annoyed by people looking for gossip she still felt a little nauseated from watching harry puke and she was still quite worried about whatever was going on with the lemon drop thing if there was one wizard on the planet you really didntwant mad at you it was dumbledore ginny frazzled mind had long since given up on any logical explanation those no longer seemed to exist in hogwarts anymore and now had practically convinced herself that dumbledore had just gone off his rocker and decided to kill anyone who ever ate a nasty lemon drop her only chance of not getting into trouble or worse was to stay far away from snape mcgonagall and wood in fact she was considering hiding quite soon once she dealt with the prank war mess she had now looked just about everywhere she could think of for harry and hermione and had just reached the entrance hall and turned towards the kitchens when she heard a loud scream of rage come from the dungeon entrance draco ginny turned towards the dungeons and ran down the steps without a second thought simply following the sounds of draco harry and hermione yells not realizing where she was going if she had she might have remembered that the only place down here that harry hermione and draco might be was snape office and that it was also the last place she wanted to see granger mcgonagall shrieked not only out of shock and disapproval but out of horror hermione had knocked mcgonagall wand right out of her hand as she d jumped on draco the wand flew back towards the doorway but mcgonagall lost sight of it knowing she couldnthandle the three teens without it mcgonagall hurried to the wand last known coordinates and began to search for it desperately die you evil scum hermione roared leaping on draco back in classic piggy back style her legs wrapping around his waist to hold herself on while she smacked him repeatedly on the head with one hand the other hand using his hair as a handhold argh get off take that harry who had been knocked to the ground right before hermione sneak attack leaped up and prepared to deck draco but good draco in danger of losing his balance thanks to hermione did the only thing he could think to do and swung round so that hermione was between him and harry the momentum proved too much for him however and he fell backwards into harry the three of them smashed into one of the shelves containing jars of preserved creatures and potions specimens several jars were knocked loose suddenly everyone was screaming and it was raining glass and liquid and squishy things better left unnamed and still the fists and feet flew once the majority of the sickening shower had stopped draco took his hands away from his face and pried hermione off him then tried to run he was almost to the door when the chain forgotten once more snapped him back again this time he landed on his face and before he could recover from the harsh introduction to the stone floor hermione was on him next there was a civil war of sorts between harry and hermione that helped draco quite a bit harry tried to push hermione away to get at draco and hermione refusing to give up her claim in the fight tried to shove harry away they got into a strange sort of pushing match harry didntwant to hurt hermione and she didntwant to hurt him but neither harry nor hermione was willing to surrender pummeling rights on draco draco managed to slither away and get to his feet now however he remembered the chain and knew there was no way out before he could figure out what to do harry and hermione noticed his absence from the floor and got up jumping away from them draco saw mcgonagall reclaim her wand out of the corner of his eye and finally remembered he was a wizard harry and hermione had their wands out at almost the same instant as draco all three raised them hermione starting a complex wave they each began to shout an incantation and then ginny appeared seemingly out of nowhere in between the three of them shouting peeves is coming they say that the best way to get someone attention is to startle them and there are few things more startling than a short frantic redheaded girl popping up practically out of thin air and shouting that a poltergeist is coming to get you what harry hermione and draco asked in unison but ginny couldntanswer at first too out of breath from running peeves twins kick ass we dead must not ginny stopped trying to speak straightening up slightly and looking around she swallowed taking a few steadying breaths before whipping her head round to stare at harry and hermione with wide eyes we re in snape office yes and we re in the middle of a duel draco said rolling his eyes could you move what if it was true are you mad dumbledore coming to kill us all poor sleep deprived panicky ginny looked ready to faint what are you babbling about weasley mcgonagall asked at the sound of the professor voice ginny yelped spun and backed away farther from the door over by snape desk k k keep away from me y you lemon drop thief i have enough problems obviously draco muttered lowering his wand and calming slightly now that he got to see a weasley having a bad day which was always a good thing for him he gingerly touched the swollen bloody area surrounding his left eye the swelling was starting to obscure his vision already calm down gin harry said automatically he was getting quite used to comforting people weasley about yesterday mcgonagall began looking rather embarrassed ginny cocked her head to the side looking a tad calmer as though she was starting to get a grip and she might have continued to do so had snape not suddenly leaped to his feet right next to ginny and shouted i okay i okay dontworry i ll stop them before snape could sort out the fact that he d just been stunned and had missed most of the fight ginny snapped the sudden appearance of snape so close by proved to be too much for her nerves get away she screamed and ran flat out for the door the next thing anyone knew she had bounced off of something and landed on her butt harry and hermione both went to help her but didntreach her before she looked up to see what had stopped her oliver wood sorry about that ginny he said pleasantly extending a hand to help her up aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh ginny bloodcurdling scream made them all wince none so much as the hung over oliver who grabbed his pounding head and groaned ginny shoved him to the side and ran past him screaming all the way oliver who had no idea what was upsetting her his memories of his drunken escapades were still foggy stared after her in disbelief what did i do he asked turning back to survey the room which was in shambles dozens of shattered jars and their grotesque former contents littered the floor snape was looking somewhat disgruntled and his hair was coming loose from the pink bow mcgonagall stood wearily in the corner her wand held loosely at her side harry hermione and draco were all covered in cuts and bruises and slimy liquid do you guys ever not have drama oliver asked with a sort of disgusted awe have you ever had a drama free day or even a drama free twenty minutes no harry and hermione said flatly in unison oliver sighed what happened to ginny er never mind that mcgonagall said quickly you three better get to the hospital wing fifty points from slytherin and gryffindor yes hospital go you re bleeding all over the place the three of them filed out all of them now subdued from their injuries the abrupt recession of adrenaline and life in general oliver shook his head noting the trail of slime blood and glass they were leaving behind he could still hear ginny screaming in the distance wincing at the echoing noise he pulled the door shut author notes a reminder whatever happened in the sixth book and whatever will happen in the seventh will not apply in this story at all draco being a death eater draco knowing occlumency snape being a half blood etc i only use things we learned up through ootp and unfortunately once again i am being plagiarized the prank war has been posted on mediaminer under a name that isntmine and they woke up married by anapplefromatree on this site has stolen a huge chunk of my dialogue from the second chapter of we woke up married please if you ever see my stories posted under a name that is not crazygirl47 or something with rain or 47 in the title please let let me know finally on a good note i ve finished the revision and am working my way through chapter 44 meaning that i have one completely brand new chapter ready called oliver last stand i just have to format the chapters for this site and get a little light editing done but i ll be throwing out chapters left and right here soon once i finish reading the seventh book naturally chapter thirty three draco the britney fan after a relatively short visit to the hospital wing during which madam pomfrey made about six threats along the lines of if dumbledore even thinks about failing any of you i swear i ll quit harry hermione and draco headed down to the kitchens wordlessly the entire school had to know by now that harry and draco had woken up screaming and there were all sorts of other things they couldntor didntwant to explain the single large bed the slytherin quidditch practice the cheese spirit and its banishment hermione attempt on draco arm life and that was only what had happened since yesterday morning never mind sunday saturday and friday on an average day each of them could handle teasing and gossip and rude remarks at the moment none of them wanted to face any further annoyances unfortunately you cantalways get what you want is a very wise saying filch came out of the kitchens just as they were approaching the door what are you three doing down here he demanded glaring nothing harry and hermione replied filch raised a skeptical eyebrow he knew as well as harry and hermione did that the hufflepuff dormitory and the kitchens were the only things in this part of the school that were of any interest draco rolled his eyes for two gryffindor brats who often managed to escape punishment for broken rules they werentvery good at lying to authority figures we were just taking a walk draco said coldly not illegal is it you were preparing to pull some sort of prank werentyou filch snapped eyes darting around as if hoping to find some sort of joke pulling device right draco said rolling his eyes again me and potter and granger work so well together dontyou think harry laughed and hermione giggled it didntlast long however as their mirth quickly changed to mortification at the fact that one of their least favorite people could make them laugh in a way that wasntcondescending filch looked as surprised by their laughter as they did and he edged away from them slightly you should be at breakfast go on go he said gesturing up the stairs behind them harry and hermione exchanged panicky glances mr filch hermione said quickly i am head girl and it is my duty to patrol the corridors there is no morning duty only night you only have wednesdays and thursdays besides go on off to breakfast with you and if i catch you down here again you ll have detention to look forward to after a few moments harry and hermione grudgingly turned around and headed back for the stairs draco glared at caretaker but couldntsee a way to get past filch without getting into serious trouble and it wouldntbe prudent to let anyone on the staff know that the kitchens location wasnttotally secret more than one way to skin a cat you know draco told filch who snarled but still looked a tad worried then followed harry and hermione leaving the caretaker to splutter angrily outside the kitchen door so i guess we re skipping breakfast harry said hermione bit her lip maybe we can get ginny to go in there for us i dontthink so she seemed pretty er psycho draco supplied helpfully he had always been rather talkative it was part of being arrogant and loving to brag a lot and now that the sullen silence had been broken he figured a bit of arguing and insulting banter was just what he needed well i doubt she going to be any more willing to go in there than we are harry said trying to ignore draco as best he could hermione sighed well what are we supposed to do curse anyone who gets within three feet of us harry paused looking thoughtful then drew his wand and grinned harry i was kidding yeah but no one else ll know that and i hungry harry walked on ahead and hermione sighed and followed him drawing her wand also boys she muttered never thinking with their brains draco was still trying to come up with a good pun about the double meanings of her phrase when they entered the great hall a good deal of the student body was there chatting away a lot of ravenclaw hufflepuff and gryffindor students were at the wrong table sharing gossip or perhaps discussing prank war ideas even some of the slytherins were mixing with a few of the ravenclaw and hufflepuff students it was rare but the occasional slytherin had friends or at least acquaintances outside their house plenty of people spotted harry hermione and draco entering but everyone hung back when they noticed their wands were out managing to secure a good spot at the gryffindor table they were only interrupted once by colin creevey who asked if there was any reason for ginny being in the hospital wing seeming quite ill and rather jumpy neither harry nor hermione told him much and when draco opened his mouth he received two sharp kicks in the shins and he thought better of it madam pomfrey had cured most of his bruises and he wasntreally looking to get himself injured again harry hermione and draco all ate with their wands in one hand which wasnteasy when harry dropped his wand beside his plate neither hermione nor draco thought much of it hermione figured he was just having trouble using his silverware one handed and draco simply didntcare it wasntuntil harry gasped that they noticed he d gone completely rigid he having a vision draco muttered harry was in fact having a vision but he couldntmake sense of it in the slightest draco appeared to be wearing muggle clothes and sitting in the passenger seat of a car wearing his seat belt harry could see snow covered trees were flashing past that alone was odd the malfoys despised muggle things so unlike the weasleys they d probably never ridden in a car that wasntthe strangest part however draco was singing his arms were flung wide his hair was messy and he looked rather frightened as though he was being forced to sing at gunpoint his singing voice wasntall that great either that or he wasnttrying to sing properly his voice seemed all wrong for the notes he was trying to hit too harry barely noticed however he was concentrating on the lyrics the vision ended quite abruptly and harry returned to the present with a jolt confused harry tried to sort out the vision glad it hadntbeen about him hermione and draco harry recognized those lyrics but he couldntremember from where he hadntreally been paying attention to the weird sisters at the yule ball and that was the only band he d heard in the wizarding world so it had to be muggle and probably old something clicked into place and it hit him britney spears he d heard that song several times heard sung by muggles as he wandered around little whinging heard playing in shops he went to with the dursleys or walked to alone draco had been singing britney spears songs that made absolutely no sense what was it draco asked impatiently it was you singing britney spears hermione stared at draco incredulously you know britney spears who she draco asked blankly harry rolled his eyes dontplay dumb you obviously know who she is i just had a vision of you singing hit me one more time sounds like a nice violent song draco replied frowning baby one more time hermione corrected absently you re a britney spears fan harry asked incredulously no i that not important harry what on earth would malfoy be doing singing britney spears songs what else do you remember i dontknow harry said shrugging he was sitting in a car passenger side a car i ve never ridden in a car why would i start now well you looked scared but okay now i know you re lying draco interrupted irritably come on people open your eyes doesntit strike you as a little odd that these visions are things that we would never do and the only person who knows the truth about them is a guy like snape they re not visions they re illusions that an interesting thought hermione said slowly false visions oh come on hermione that was reasoned out by malfoy harry pointed out but it does make sense hermione said reluctantly a lot more sense than anything else nothing has made sense lately harry insisted no and that what bothering me think of it harry which makes more sense a cheese spirit bite causing psychic abilities or a cheese spirit bite causing delusions and snape he the only one who knows what really going on and if it werentfor the fact that snape not the most imaginative person and certainly not the first person to purposely set himself up to get insulted i d bet every galleon i have on him fabricating this whole happy bit it certainly freaking us out which snape would enjoy it freaking the entire school out really and you and malfoy thinking that whatever you ve been seeing is actually real would be just the sort of kicks snape would enjoy only snape doesntlike kicks and even for a prank he wouldnttie a pink ribbon in his hair in a bow or wear a christmas sweater or tell us some funny story about what he did as a kid who to say that was a true story draco said suddenly i mean his whole mannerism yesterday freaked us all out and snape smart he could have figured out what i would do could have made the whole thing up he wouldnthave admitted having a crush on potter mum otherwise i ve had a little too much experience with visions to just write these off harry said stubbornly wincing at the part about his mother we need to talk to snape more hermione sighed look harry maybe you re right we shouldntjust ignore them still i cantimagine that they re true not if they re as bizarre as you say but snape has been helping us you know he knew when he gave us all those ideas that it would help you as much as me he cantbe trusted draco said flatly it doesntmatter what he done to help you granger it probably all just a means to an end for him whose side are you on anyway hermione demanded not yours draco said shortly he jerked his head at harry or his hermione blinked suddenly remembering who she was talking to their discussion was just the sort of thing harry ron and hermione did all the time she shrugged off the creepy feelings of actually trying to figure something out with draco malfoy helping them in ron stead as best she could and turned back to harry i dontknow if these visions are true or not mostly because i dontknow what most of them are and i dontknow what snape really up to he told me there was no way to stop the visions back while you were sobbing your heart out like a lunatic draco interrupted i pretty sure he lying there no way to tell with someone that skilled in occlumency hermione argued hey i can do occlumency and you can still tell when i lying most of the time harry said stop switching sides hermione yelled stamping her foot i not i on the true vision snape is a sick freak side harry retorted look whether he knows or not he cantbe trusted draco said there has to be some other way a spell to check the validity of a prophecy or something if only the twins were on our side hermione said with a sigh all those years of looking for joke shop junk has made them great at researching what you dontwant to spend time in the library draco snorted that a first look you evil little maggot hermione snapped if you want those visions out of your head you ll keep your mouth shut harry and i have been solving these sorts of mysteries for over six years i guarantee you we can do it if you want help you had better avoid pissing me off or i ll make you beg for mercy by the time i through with you understand draco rolled his eyes all right fine you get the visions out of my head i ll leave you alone until the chain off good hermione said but sighed she knew that it wasntgoing to last for more than a minute and a half but even a momentary lull was better than putting up with his constant rudeness forbidden forest best idea not too far in need people to be able to see it cantdo it during exams last weekend before christmas holidays everyone will be in hogsmeade but the first and second years so we convince people to stay that ll tip off our victims too right dontwant them to know leave harry out of it just hermione and malfoy yeah they ll know it us if we hit all three of them but that a prank only we know about no it isn t plenty of people had parents who went here during the original prank maybe but parents who share their prank ideas with their kids ron sat on his bed in his dormitory eating sandwiches that fred had conjured and watching the twins with interest they were pacing up and down the room shooting rapid fire ideas at each other at least that what he assumed they were doing he didnthave the foggiest clue what they were talking about slytherins would people like the bones family would dad would hey we should talk to dad no too risky mum might find out what we re up to shoot we should have thought of that earlier yeah damn that could have been so useful well if we need more ideas after this prank we can do some of what we did our seventh year no too suspicious and they ve all been seen before everyone was so focused on the umbridge thing though nasty old bat hope she in st mungo s hope the centaurs came after her hope peeves beat her to death with mcgonagall walking stick we re getting sidetracked damn okay so we strike with this prank but we dontwant her to know she the only one we ll need to worry about really yeah harry bright but he assumes the best about people hermione only delusional about teachers hey maybe we should talk to wood the next time i talk to wood i beating the crap out of him oh yeah i forgot but then he had to be drunk or maybe high whatever he was on we should get some he probably still got some on second thought why hold a grudge excellent point and we re sidetracked again right okay main problem getting harry away from hermione we can try using ron how have him try snogging hermione in a broom closet why not harry wontstick around for that they re not that close she chained to malfoy wrist mate oh yeah yeah she probably wontget it on with malfoy watching ron started gagging on his sandwich fred you ve just given me nightmares right sorry anyway there has to be some time when they split up right we need to figure out their class schedules she said something about it when we went down to hagrid hut right before that food fight oh yeah she has ancient runes on thursday afternoons and muggle studies on fridays so we kidnap her right after lunch no if we kidnap her when she supposed to be somewhere people will notice too fast and if she misses an exam without there being a good explanation someone will go to dumbledore and dumbledore will probably think she been kidnapped by renegade death eaters and then we re screwed and probably in azkaban so we do it after class before she finds harry again not enough time to get her hallways would be too crowded so we need to get harry out of the way how though club him over the head nah we could lock him in a broom cupboard or inflate his head like he did to malfoy wait he supposed to have detention for that on friday both twins halted their pacing and turned triumphant grins on ron we strike on friday they yelled in unison ron arched an eyebrow at them we strike what the twins looked at each other and sighed chapter thirty four the truth about the visions so what exactly is going on oliver asked looking around the trashed office oh the usual mcgonagall said dryly potter granger and malfoy had a fistfight something about driving each other mad that was just before weasley ran in screaming like paul revere snape grinned as he bent over to pick up a slimy green creature that was absolutely priceless malfoy go boom he mimicked mcgonagall laughed i thought it was far better when granger leaped at malfoy i ve never seen her just starting beating someone like that i missed that part snape said repairing a jar with his wand and dropping the creature inside the jar automatically began to fill with the same slimy liquid that now coated the floors must have been when somebody stunned me terribly sorry about that severus mcgonagall said trying not to laugh and failing oliver shook his head too weary to even think about sorting out this new bit of confusing information minerva said you might have something for a hangover he asked snape top drawer snape told him pointing at the desk you ll find a bunch of bottles you want the one that says you knew better than to drink all that severus oliver gave him an odd look and opened the top drawer it was sectioned off into deep pockets each big enough to hold about a dozen small flasks and each section containing a different sort of potion the bottles were all labeled with odd things like you know you canthandle thai food you idiot and what would be better for your blood pressure than an anti stress potion quitting your job the handwriting didntappear to be snape s which made the humor of the labeling seem a lot less strange so you actually did use that labeling device filius gave you for your birthday mcgonagall remarked oh be quiet snape mock growled mcgonagall chuckled then grinned so mr malfoy having visions of granger is he interesting isntit snape said with an evil grin he having what of hermione oliver demanded oh be quiet wood and drink your potion mcgonagall said and came over to sit in an armchair in front of snape desk smiling like a teenager with a juicy piece of gossip why do you think he was thinking of her during the spell probably because she was trying to stop him snape said thoughtfully but i suppose there could be other reasons oh potter will have a fit mcgonagall said gleefully he was bitten by dorwi er the cheese spirit too i doubt he came all the way down here for draco benefit he probably got some sort of vision of her in his head too or if he was staring at draco wondering what draco was doing no wonder he losing his mind mcgonagall exclaimed clapping her hands together what are you two talking about oliver asked gulping his potion down quickly and watching them suspiciously potter granger and malfoy mcgonagall said i cantrecall if we explained yesterday or not but you see yesterday in my class draco unleashed a nasty sort of cheese spirit there such a thing as a cheese spirit oh yes cheese demon actually but that not the point anyway this cheese spirit is conjured up because of a botched love potion a complex potion that when used properly with the right sort of incantation can force others to fall in love with you draco malfoy he tried to brew a love potion yes well his motives had nothing to do with love but again not the point as i was saying when the spell is done properly it will only work upon the person you visualize during the incantation in this case a love poem written by the castor malfoy wrote a yes wood he did stop interrupting anyway when it goes wrong the cheese spirit is called if and only if it bites you you ll end up having dreams about the person you were trying to cast upon and thinking about them far too much you ll also become mildly psychic but that neither here nor there malfoy is psychic oliver repeated understandably alarmed well not really most of the times the visions center almost exclusively around the person you were thinking of and while the visions are accurate they dontreally make enough sense for you to understand them until they come true and what does this have to do with hermione oliver asked well draco said he wasntvisualizing anyone during the potion but now he cantget granger out of his head so either he was thinking about her at the time because she was sitting next to him or trying to stop him or he fancies granger mcgonagall interrupted with a wicked grin and the same goes for potter he was probably thinking about granger at the time also and possibly thinking about granger and draco so potter would be having dreams about being in love with granger draco or whoever and having visions about their future and dear little malfoy cantstop thinking about granger mcgonagall finished it sort of like karma you try and infringe upon someone free will you messed with magic you werentprepared to wield and the cheese spirit turns it back upon your head snape explained the effects only last for about a week but one would guess that enough time to teach someone a lesson why a cheese spirit oliver asked frowning probably because whatever higher being came up with it had a twisted sense of humor snape said with a shrug what caused this potion to go wrong anyway mcgonagall asked oddly enough muggle root beer severus you got this whole thing out of a book no she said thoughtfully yes how would the witch or wizard who wrote this book know about the ill effects of root beer on a love potion actually it not about the root beer it the added herbs root beer has a lot of common potions ingredients in it certain herbs arentmeant to mix in certain cases and this is one of them the cheese spirit phenomenon happens when too many herbs used in love magic go into the potion and negatively affect the rose petals it was discovered almost twelve hundred years ago by the potions creator younger sister who was attempting to help assure his success and added a few too many herbs they re also the ones who came up with the banishing spell for the cheese spirit of course it took them five years of research and some sort of quest that led them to thailand what on earth made you research all of this oliver asked er morbid curiosity snape said innocently and went back to cleaning up his office so oliver said a few minutes later when are you planning on telling harry and hermione the truth about the visions what do you mean snape asked looking surprised when are you going to clue them in harry and malfoy dontknow what really going on right they dontknow that their dreams are false and that their thoughts are being influenced and that their visions oliver trailed off and looked at mcgonagall hoping that if snape wouldnttell them she would mcgonagall and snape grinned at each other in a purely mischievous way oh they ll figure it out snape said casually they re smart kids harry hermione and draco completed their walk to flitwick classroom in silence smiling he ushered them in ron was already there sitting in the far corner and writing furiously he looked up when they entered and surprisingly he didntglare neither harry nor hermione could read his expression at all before he went back to his writing harry and hermione looked at each other curiously before accepting their exams from flitwick and getting started all three of them did very well on the test with the prank war going on charms was currently the most studied subject in hogwarts draco wrote twice the required length on repeated phrase jinxes ron finished only a few moments before them and left without a backwards glance however the moment they stepped outside the classroom they found ron waiting for them he turned to hermione with a nervous but hopeful look on his face i sorry he told her i really am i i didntmean hermione whose anger with ron had been steadily replaced by sadness smiled in relief and threw her arms around him draco yelped as he was jerked sideways it okay she said dontworry about it ron grinned his relief matching hermione as he held her close he looked up at harry hesitantly are we okay he asked uncertainly harry grinned of course we are good ron said hugging hermione tighter the next three days were some of the best harry ron and hermione had had since the start of the prank war the three of them joked and laughed and studied together as though nothing had happened and it almost seemed as if draco wasntthere the twins left hogwarts claiming that they d left lee in charge of the joke shop for far too long though they forgave harry and hermione completely and promised to return on friday to hang out ginny calmed down rather quickly especially after learning that ron and hermione were no longer fighting and after oliver went up to her and explained that whatever he d said about lemon drops was just crazy talk and that dumbledore was as nice as ever ginny now spent most of her time with harry ron and hermione they studied together in the evenings and researched both the visions and the chain although by thursday they were less disturbed by the visions after a long discussion they d all concluded that the visions were false after all though harry still remained somewhat skeptical and since snape had said it was temporary they concentrated more on the chain and their end of term exams the amount of fighting seemed to suddenly plummet once ron became their friend again the gryffindors found it far easier to ignore draco the only major fight was on tuesday regarding the beds hermione refused to push them apart and draco refused to sleep in the same bed as anyone else in the end draco started sleeping on the couch which they moved over right next to the bed ron now slept in hermione bed though they both behaved themselves harry didntmind this change in the least which is an understatement when he returned to his own dormitory he threw himself on his four poster and refused to get out of it for hours despite the fact it was mid evening by thursday night there had been thirteen more visions between harry and draco draco visions were often harder to explain as most of his centered around hermione and sometimes hermione appeared to be doing muggle things between harry ron hermione ginny and draco they d only managed to vaguely comprehend two of his visions one was of hermione crying and rambling that they were hopelessly lost and one was of her and draco lying together in what looked like a snowy ditch oddly enough harry had also had a vision of them lying in a ditch together and when comparing the two both draco and hermione had been wearing the same clothes it was the only vision they d had that was similar however harry visions which were less frequent than draco s usually had some sort of fight between harry hermione and draco while harry was much happier now that ron was his friend again and he didntfeel obligated to stay with hermione he was still disturbed by the visions and jumpy about the prank war everyone appeared to have written off the psychic moments as cheese induced delusions but he wasntso sure for one thing the visions of him and hermione fighting with draco often took place in number twelve grimmauld place which he had neglected to tell hermione for another he didntthink delusions were as detailed or realistic then too something about ron seemed off he was cheerful but also somewhat distant and harry could have sworn that he d seen ron glaring at harry or hermione when he thought neither of them was looking harry wrote this off as paranoia but he still found it disturbing worst of all were his dreams which were often something horrifying involving hermione and draco his occlumency skills helped but not enough to shut out the dreams completely he was rather glad that he along with the other gryffindor prefects had patrol on wednesday and thursday which meant he got to miss a few hours of sleep and wander around the halls being tired was better than dreams of your best friend and enemy strange thoughts began to seep into his waking moments harry did his best to ignore them though writing them off as the by products of interrupted sleep and the cheese spirit still he was generally pretty happy the only person who wasntwas draco draco steadily became more and more miserable by the hour harry ron and hermione and ginny when she joined them refused to respond whenever he tried to insult them they only spoke to him when necessary which was rare it seemed they had finally learned how to ignore him and that drove him absolutely insane he was a natural attention seeker he hated to be ignored more than almost anything else he was also having a rough time of it with the visions sometimes they involved grotesque things like his first vision about kissing hermione while other visions meant ages of trying to explain what they were about to the four gryffindors the dreams had also increased until he had several a night far more than harry which they presumed was because of occlumency and the fact that draco not harry had called the cheese spirit he was soon jolting awake several times a night and ron snoring made it twice as difficult for him to fall back asleep his thoughts were starting to revolve around hermione also which he attempted to blame on the cheese spirit bite he found that most of his intrapersonal communication was ranting about her and he was finding it harder and harder to avoid noticing that she was in fact good looking rage and depression became his two main emotions he couldntseem to enjoy anything even the thought of the approaching holidays couldntcheer him every teacher he asked about the chain said no one was any closer to a solution and the last thing draco wanted was to spend his christmas with hermione on thursday evening dumbledore approached them in the great hall they d taken to eating in the great hall after their run in with filch outside the kitchens knowing it would be too risky to go back for a while they did keep their wands out most of the time but whenever someone had asked ginny about a rumor she had said that ron had told her to hex anyone who bothered her which kept people away from ginny harry ron hermione and draco the headmaster had told them that the outlook on removing the chain was far too bleak and that they d have to go on christmas holidays together after all knowing better than to hold a major fight in front of the headmaster draco and hermione settled the matter with minimal arguing they d ride the train to king cross with the rest of the students on monday and stay at draco home until christmas morning dumbledore was hoping to secure a ministry car to get them to hermione parents home on christmas day and her parents had already agreed to drive hermione and draco to the gathering at hermione grandparents home and then to grimmauld place for the rest of the holidays neither was too happy with this arrangement but both grudgingly accepted it ron woke up on friday morning with an almost overwhelming sense of determination today was the day today was the day he would make hermione wish she d never messed with him it had been exhausting pretending that everything was okay that he was no longer angry when all he wanted to do was scream in her face and beat the snot out of draco if anything he d become even more upset during the past three days and even more eager to get revenge he was now convinced that hermione had been messing around on him every time they d passed snape in the hallway or seen him in the great hall snape had waved and smiled or called out a hello the look on oliver face when ron and hermione had walked into defense against the dark arts holding hands and smiling he d been disappointed and annoyed ron was sure of it oliver had looked like he was going to say something to them when they d first walked in but once he d spotted ron he d clammed up oliver had been avoiding them ever since and ron didntthink for a second that the visions were false delusions didntjust come and go like the visions did a delusional person didntjust have a one moment where they saw something strange and then went about their day delusional people who hallucinated believed in the hallucinations and didnthave a sense of rationality like harry and draco still did harry and draco hadntbeen driven insane by the cheese spirit and ron didntthink that snape had been lying about the visions after all he hadntbeen lying about the potion or the banishing ritual ron knew there had to be some sort of truth to the visions and the common factor in all of them the one everyone seemed to have missed was that ron wasntin any of them he wasntin the visions about harry and hermione arguing with draco and he wasntin the visions draco had either ron was also absent from the dreams though neither harry nor draco would say much about them which could only mean that soon ron would be out of harry and hermione life good riddance he thought though he still felt a twinge of sadness he d really cared about hermione and harry they were his greatest friends and some part of him would always see them as such still that didntexcuse their behavior that didntgive them the right to do what they d done the twins had planned the whole prank perfectly every angle was covered from the best way to get the drop on hermione to alibis to getting an audience they would pull it off and they wouldntget caught not even hermione would know who had done it which would leave her open in the future ron looked over at hermione who was sleeping peacefully two feet away beyond her side of the bed he could see the back of the couch draco was muttering unhappily in his sleep ron grinned everything would go according to plan chapter thirty five according to plan hermione hummed cheerfully to herself as she walked out of draco muggle studies class everything was going blissfully well she was back with ron harry was a lot calmer ginny had stopped pestering them all for details of one rumor or another and draco had been blessedly quiet for almost three days the only times he d been even remotely close to getting under hermione skin was when they had to split up from harry and ron during afternoon classes but he d given up by thursday hermione was too happy to let draco bother her much could you stop humming please draco muttered irritably as he turned towards the staircase that would take them down to the great hall hermione ignored him she didntstop humming but she didntstart humming louder to further annoy him the fact that she wasntletting him bother her was enough to make her happy draco sighed wondering what his fellow slytherins were up to crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson were probably all chatting away perhaps planning a prank on the gryffindors or some of their other enemies as annoying as the dimwitted slytherins could be he would have given his right arm to be hanging out with them especially since his right arm was the arm chained to hermione at least classes are over he told himself though that didntgive him much comfort now that he d just completed his last exam muggle studies there would be no classes until next term and no classes meant more time with harry ron and probably ginny they rarely left hermione side they were like one big disgusting family always smiling and laughing and giving draco the urge to kick a small furry animal preferably a puppy still he couldntsuppress a rush of anticipation christmas break was almost upon them he would just have to suffer through a weekend of gryffindor cheer before finally being able to get rid of them after the train ride to king cross if only for a few days he wasntlooking forward to having hermione in his house or going to hers but the more time he spent with hermione and her friends the more he began to realize that anything was better than hanging out with harry and ron he would sell his soul just to get rid of one of them never mind both and ginny was evil incarnate he especially hated her habit of finding sneaky little ways of rubbing things in she still liked to make references to the bat bogey hex she d put on him in umbridge office two years ago a painful yank on his wrist made him wince and he turned to see hermione headed in the other direction this way she said absently wondering where ron and harry were they had somehow always managed to be outside her class by the time she left the room there nothing down that way but a shortcut to charms draco protested jerking his head at the turn in the corridor that would lead them over to flitwick room hermione didntreply draco started to snap at her but stopped as hermione stepped behind a suit of armor and tapped a stone in the wall with her wand the wall slid apart creating an opening he growled low in his throat everything about her pissed him off especially the fact that she was oh so smart come on she said stowing her wand away in her arm cuff as she slipped into the secret passage draco grumbled as he followed her annoyed beyond belief she had to know everything about everything and everything had to be done her way it was driving him mad the passage led them down a set of stairs and into a short tunnel which soon forked into three hermione turned right without hesitation and draco followed still ranting in his thoughts when he felt something hit his back and then suddenly he was flying forward barely managing to get his arms up in time to protect his face he hit the floor painfully hard and skidded forward a little hermione yelping and leaping out of his way draco rolled over and sat up his eyes flashing what did you do that for he yelled at hermione i didntdo a thing hermione informed him frowning you hit me with a jinx i felt the spell hit dontdeny it how could i hit you when you were behind me she said calmly you must have tripped and imagined that you got hit draco opened his mouth to tell her off just as something hit his shoulder an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion swept through him building upon the tiredness he d been feeling since the dreams had started his angry retort turned into a large yawn and he slumped back against the stone floor asleep hermione arched an eyebrow at him confused for a moment before her instincts kicked in a rush of adrenaline went through her her mind and body filled with sense of readiness acquired after years of helping to fight against voldemort and his supporters who there she called turning to face back the way they came and dropping the load of books in her arm before she could draw her wand something hit her hard in the stomach and she fell back on top of draco next second a wave of sleepiness hit her she struggled to stay conscious but failed a heartbeat later the weasley twins were grinning down at the two of them harry walked into the great hall with ginny smiling from ear to ear exams were over and he was only two days away from vacation during which he wouldnthave to see draco for nearly a week as worried as he was about things a week without draco malfoy seemed rather like winning the lottery so where ron ginny asked as they sat down at the gryffindor table said he d go up to muggle studies and walk hermione down told me to go ahead harry said with a shrug digging into his dinner so are we all heading into hogsmeade this weekend of course ginny said i am anyway i need some stuff from zonko s dontyou get a discount at weasleys wizard wheezes oh it not for me fred and george offered me ten galleons to do some industrial espionage on the new zonko products industrial espionage yeah you know get old mr zonko talking about his new products and take a few notes he always used to tell anyone who d listen about his ideas but now that fred and george have gone into business he wonttell anyone with red hair speaking of which remind me to research a few glamour spells tonight isntthat i dontknow copyright infringement or something oh fred and george would never copy ideas straight from mr zonko they love that old man to death they re all still friendly and stuff mr zonko just paranoid the twins just like hearing other people prank ideas they build off them twist them around and come up with other ideas it more like inspiration research for them and speaking of joke ideas we should get back into the prank war you know how we canthit malfoy we ll get blamed for it maybe maybe not we can set it up to look like an outside job you do realize you sound like a bank robber right and there are like somewhere between sixty and a hundred other slytherins plus there are a few people i d like to hit in the other houses starting with parvati and lavender and some of my roommates and working down from there i dontknow gin harry said thoughtfully absently glancing over at crabbe goyle and pansy we ve got a lot to deal with right now maybe though maybe what ron asked appearing at harry side and sitting down gin wants to get back into the prank war harry said sounds like a great idea ron said his mouth already full of mashed potatoes hey where are hermione and ferret boy ginny asked ron rolled his eyes hermione said she wanted to go up to the library to research some stuff told me to go down to dinner alone bet malfoy was happy about that harry said dryly ron chuckled ginny gave ron a funny look frowning you let her go alone she asked me to and i was too hungry to argue she wanted to go alone yeah said there was no point in me skipping dinner oh she did ask me to save her something though harry wondering why ginny was giving ron a hard time gave her a questioning glance and found her giving him a significant look he wasntsure what she meant however he couldntsee anything wrong hermione had been telling them that she didntneed an escort to class for days even though he and ron had never relented after dinner ginny mouthed and harry nodded slightly wondering what was going on fred and george who knew hogwarts like no one else had no problem getting hermione and draco out of the castle once they d reached the grounds they used a spell to make it look as if hermione and draco were simply walking of their own accord so that anyone who saw them would assume hermione and draco were conscious in minutes they were at the edge of the forest and heading inside the twins also knew some of the forest quite well having ventured into it many times during their days as students once they were under the cover of the trees fred pulled a map from his pocket and examined it carefully the twins and ron had marked the location of every place where he harry or hermione had ever run into anything nasty and fred and george planned to work out a good place to stash hermione and draco from this information and their own let see he said as he and george paused in the trees their captives floating eerily a few feet away ron written aragog here and underlined it six times and here where they think the centaurs hang out over there hagrid hut and we know there at least one blast ended skrewt here what the hell does this mean grawp dontgo there new people have to be introduced by hagrid what a grawp george wondered no idea but let avoid it i d say ten meters east of here and twenty into the forest it not too close to hagrid perfect no wait that near where fluffy lives remember he scared the crap out of us in fourth year how could i forget fred tapped the map with his wand and a little note appeared okay so not there and this is where the thestrals are pity we donthave the marauder map george said with a sigh harry and hermione belongings had been thoroughly warded once they d started sharing a room with draco after a good quarter hour of discussion the twins headed east for five meters and south for thirty which put them far enough from fluffy without getting them too close to anything very deadly it was deep enough in so that hermione and draco wouldntbe lying on snow the trees were so close that the snow hadntreached the ground it was also far from any clearings leaving two unconscious people in the open was too dangerous and close enough to the edge of the forest that draco and hermione wouldnthave too hard of a time getting out after all the real fun began when the two of them tried to make it up to the castle okay fred said as he and george released the spells holding draco and hermione upright still got hermione wand what george said blankly hermione wand do you have it no i thought you were supposed to get their wands no i was supposed to get malfoy and you were supposed to get hers so we forgot the wand in the corridor big deal we ll go back fred frowned knelt next to hermione and lifted up her right arm or it still in her arm cuff oops george said sheepishly george you were supposed to wait for her to draw her wand before you hit her with the spell so i goofed pardon me for being human this isntgoing to work half as well if she can use her wand fred groaned well it still going to work and that what important fred sighed a bad feeling coming over him contrary to popular belief the twins plans didntalways work out smoothly that was the real reason why they were known as troublemakers because they kept getting caught yeah you re right well let get to work i freezing my ass off george paused frowning thoughtfully say fred it below freezing isntit yeah so and it almost dark so it going to get colder what your point well how long do you think it will take two naked people to freeze to death fred smacked his forehead why didntyou think of this before well why didntyou because i came up with the idea no snape and harry mum came up with the idea well i came up with the best place for us to knock them out oh following them after class is real original at least i didntleave hermione her wand hermione of all people no you re just the one who wanted to leave them half a meter from a violent three headed dog okay okay look let just forget it and think how long does the sleeping spell last another forty five minutes to an hour okay so how long does a warming spell last a half hour max so we ll just put warming spells on them and hermione will renew them when she wakes up except we might do it wrong because warming spells are difficult and we wontreally be able to tell if we did it right or not damn um think think think hey what about an illusion spell what good would that do remember when ron told us about malfoy hitting her with that spell made her look like she was in her underwear that could work bit disappointing though it ll wear off two hours or so after they wake up well it all we ve got and it not like we donthave plans for future pranks to embarrass them true fred pulled out his wand frowning in concentration before casting the spell a moment later hermione looked like some strange sort of fashion reject her gloves scarf hat cloak shoes socks pants and bra were still there the only things that appeared to be affected at all were her robes and shirt well george said laughing at the strange sight of her either you really suck at illusions or she made her clothes spell resistant i sure i just did it wrong i got her shirt and robes which she couldntmake spell resistant because she has to slice them open and repair them with spells every day to get them on and off fred growled in frustration he should have thought of that with all the pranks flying around hogwarts hermione surely would have looked for a way to keep her clothes from constantly getting ruined well i doubt malfoy as smart go ahead what cast an illusion on him i cantcast a spell with my eyes closed so leave your eyes open and see malfoy naked i dontthink so well i cast the spell on hermione which not only failed but would have been a good thing if it had worked not a traumatic moment if you donthit him he ll stay clothed then i guess he staying clothed george this is working out bad enough we have to at least hit malfoy you re right let go get ron to do it fred sighed pitifully all right look let just leave his pants okay you do the shirt i ll get his feet why do you get his feet after a long argument the twins finally realized that they were running out of time before draco and hermione woke up george grudgingly performed the spell on draco shirt robes and cloak and fred did the same to his shoes and socks okay fred said looking down at the strangely dressed pair what next on the list we go persuade hagrid to go get drunk in hogsmeade so they cantget him to help then we head to the great hall as if we ve just arrived great after all we just had a few minor problems everything else will go according to plan hello potter harry ginny and ron all fought to suppress a groan snape had yet to deviate from his new midlife crisis personality he d now taken to saying hello to hermione and the others when they passed him in the hall it was starting to freak them all out and they were getting even more weird looks from the other students harry turned to see snape standing behind him dressed strangely and smiling snape had yet to actually approach them at meals harry prayed this wouldntbecome a habit hello professor he said wearily i just wanted to remind you of your detention snape said i ll be filling in for filch to get you started the poor man has daisies growing out of his face something to do with the prank war no doubt meet me out by the greenhouses in a half hour all right do try to be on time i ve got a pressing engagement harry nodded relieved when snape smiled said his good byes and left mental old freak he muttered turning back to his meal is that any way to talk about your professors said fred dropping onto the bench next to him george sat down across from fred considering it snape yeah harry said with a sigh what up guys oh not much george said stopped off to see hagrid and convinced him to go down to the three broomsticks and tell rosmerta to put it on our tab awfully nice of you ginny said raising an eyebrow well he still taking care of pig and we feel pretty bad about that fred said i dontsee you offering me a night of drinking on your tab ron muttered you re family george said you re supposed to automatically forgive us supposed to being the key phrase ron retorted harry opened his mouth to make a joke but a sudden sharp pain shot up his leg ow he yelped what is it fred asked it not your scar is it ron said worriedly flashing back to the days before voldemort demise no harry said rubbing his shin i think someone just ki it his leg ginny said talking over him he fell on the way down to dinner harry you really should have that looked at the sharp pain came again and harry glared at her wondering why she had to get his attention in such a painful matter right harry agreed confused and annoyed i think i ll go up to the hospital wing before detention madam pomfrey might hex you you know fred said idly nah she won t harry replied with a grin then she d have to treat me longer see you guys harry and ginny got up and left harry limping slightly was that really necessary gin harry asked walk faster she told him we ve got to get to the library why harry asked frowning because i ll bet you every knut i have that hermione isntthere ginny said grimly ginny what harry dontyou think it odd that even though ron has refused to let hermione out of his sight for the past few days he agreed to let her go today you know how ron is about food harry replied with a shrug isntit strange that he let hermione out of his sight on the same day the twins are visiting ginny continued power walking towards the library harry rolled his eyes gin you re just being paranoid come on harry surely you ve noticed that something seems off about ron lately he too cheerful he doesntseem sincere or something and i could have sworn i saw him glaring daggers at you and hermione a few times harry frowned recalling all the instances when he d thought something was up with ron well so what maybe he still angry but trying to get passed it i dontthink so harry ron too stubborn and so are the twins doesntit seem strange that a few hours after they swore to get revenge on hermione they were all nicey nice i know my brothers harry the moment they left our sight they started planning ways to get us while you and hermione and draco were dueling in snape office i was eavesdropping on them and they were talking about bringing in peeves to help not how they should get over their little grudge something wrong i think they ve done something to hermione harry swallowed her logic hitting him hard he cursed himself for not keeping his eyes open wider and he broke out into a jog think gin what would they have done i dontknow a fairly major prank i d wager and something to do with hagrid no doubt the twins are nice enough but they dontoften offer their tab at the three broomsticks to a guy who can hold his liquor like hagrid maybe i wrong it definitely possible but something doesntfeel right harry a few moments later harry and ginny were bursting through the doors of the library both of them looking around for hermione and draco madam pince glowered at them no doubt annoyed by their noisy entrance harry ran over to her have you seen hermione he asked and malfoy miss granger she hasntbeen in here since yesterday pince replied harry and ginny looked at each other worriedly and dashed out of the room where would she be harry wondered we ve got to find her harry you have to go to detention ginny reminded him i not going to detention when hermione is out there somewhere harry look there a good chance i wrong ginny said you have to go skipping detention is grounds for suspension maybe she just left the library and madam pince didntsee her maybe it not ron and the twins at all harry bit his lip that was the thing about ginny she was very objective always looking at all the angles even the ones she didntlike all right harry said finally starting back towards the entrance hall check the great hall first maybe she already there if she isn t see if neville or luna or someone will help dontaccuse the twins and ron of anything okay donteven let them know that we know she not in the library avoid them for now come get me once you know something i ll probably be out in the greenhouses all night i heard a third year nearly blew up greenhouse three right ginny said ask snape if he seen her okay they headed down to the entrance hall and split up both praying that hermione was okay draco awoke with the wonderful knowledge that he hadnthad a single bad dream he had had a blissfully dreamless sleep no images of hermione no images of anything at all he grinned keeping his eyes closed and savoring the moment perhaps this meant his nightmarish week was coming to a close or maybe it meant that whatever magic had caused the dreams and visions had given up on him now that he refused to believe it and decided to leave him alone or maybe it meant he d gotten hit with a spell in a secret passage on his way out of muggle studies oh yeah he thought dismally now afraid to open his eyes he was on a hard surface so hopefully they d left him in the passage but it was cold too cold was he outside sighing wearily draco opened his eyes staring straight down at him was the huge misshapen face of the most horrifying monster draco had ever seen chapter thirty six hermione introductions and snape information hermione awoke to find a tree root poking her uncomfortably in the back and something gently scratching her face instantly alert she sat up recalling the spell she d been hit with in the corridors and scanning her surroundings she groaned realizing where she was the forbidden forest she started to check herself over for injuries and noticed that her shirt and robes werentvisible though she could still feel them illusion spell she thought grimly brushing leaves from her face thank the gods for spell resisting charms hermione grabbed at her arm cuff pleased to note that her wand was still there whoever had hit her with the charm in the corridor had hit her before she d had time to draw her wand that was now going to work to her advantage who did it though hermione thought forcing herself to remain calm and concentrate absently she glanced at draco noticing that he appeared to be wearing only pants and was also covered in leaves twigs and dirt because of the strong wind who would want to strand me here in hermione didntfinish the thought glaring down at draco her calm quickly dissipating to be replaced by pure fury draco slytherins were the only people who d want to hurt her most everyone in the other houses liked her at least to some degree and the ones that didnteither didntknow her or didntdislike her enough to do something this horrible to her so obviously it had to be a slytherin prank but no slytherin hated draco or if they did they knew better than to cross him while harry ron hermione and many other gryffindors had no fear of draco malfoy a lot of other people did draco was the son of voldemort right hand man he had plenty of exposure to the dark arts plenty of gold and connections even if a lot of his connections had been destroyed by his father being publicly revealed as a death eater it had earned him fear and respect from many slytherins if no where else so if none of the slytherins would do something this bad to draco then draco himself had to be in on it hermione rose to her feet drawing her wand and leaning over him preparing to wake him up and just then draco opened his eyes stared up at her in horror and started screaming hermione jumped and shushed him but he was freaking out and not wanting to be set upon by centaurs and giant spiders and who knew what else hermione shrieked silencio the noise died and hermione looked around uneasily keep quiet you idiot do you have any idea how dangerous the place is draco shut his mouth looking relieved hermione lifted the silencing charm i thought you were a monster he breathed he smirked when she d stood over him her bushy hair all fluffed out by the wind and full of leaves and twigs her face shrouded in shadow she d looked rather frightening now that his moment of fear was over he was quick to cover it up with an insult you always look like one but all those twigs in your hair really make it more pronounced hermione eyes narrowed dangerously and she pointed her wand at his throat what have you done what do you mean what have i done he snapped looking around where are we oh shit are we in the forest dontplay dumb hermione snapped this had to be you the slytherins are the only ones with a grudge against me draco stared at her as if she was mad or at least very stupid did it ever occur to your idiotic arrogant little gryffindor brain that this isntabout you that it about me in case you haventnoticed most of the school doesntlike me that couldntescape anyone attention hermione said coldly but no one would dare strand me in here with you no one but me you potty and the weasel family knows about this stupid chain draco snapped no one else would know you d have to come with me when they planned this prank and once they saw i couldntbe separated from you they d abort hermione insisted no one but the slytherins would be that cruel to me not everyone in my house likes me you know draco pointed out hermione rolled her eyes admit it you planned this as a way to get me back i know you did if it was someone just aiming for you they wouldnthave jinxed me back there in the corridor unless they didntwant you to see them and then decided to bring you along when they realized that you re chained to me draco retorted believe me granger if i was going to find some way to pull a prank on you it wouldntbe this for one thing i haventhad the time or the opportunity to so much as owl my friends i ve been stuck with you and your sickening little crew so you d have seen me for another there no way in hell i d pull a prank that would strand me in the middle of the forbidden forest his voice had risen on the last bit a note of very sincere panic in his voice hermione frowned then lowered her wand though she kept it out she knew perfectly well that draco was more or less terrified of the forest harry had told them all about draco nerves back in their first year and while admittedly most eleven year olds including themselves would be scared of the forest in fifth year she had been quite satisfied to watch him squirm when hagrid had taken their class into the forest she and ginny had made a running joke out of it that had lasted weeks whenever hermione was looking depressed ginny would wander by and whisper what prefers the dark what did he say prefers the dark did you hear in an uncannily good impression of draco quoting his words just before they d followed hagrid into the forest the thought still brought a smile to hermione face all right she said reluctantly it wasntyou you wouldntcome in here if your life depended on it so who was it she wondered frowning who cares granger draco demanded find out once we re out of here all right for now pick a direction and start walking we cantjust pick a direction we need to think hermione told him if we end up going in the wrong direction so what we just wait here for some monster to come kill us draco said shrilly shut up hermione hissed look we re in very real danger here you have no idea what in here of course i do werewolves and thestrals werewolves and thestrals are the least of our troubles we re talking about a herd of murderous centaurs acromantulas bigger than me and you put together a giant three headed dog i can think of dozens of things in here that ll kill us as soon as look at us and i sure i haventmet everything that lives in this forest so shut up and let me think draco nodded mutely looking pale and petrified hermione began to mutter to herself trying to figure out which way they should go but night fell too quickly in the forest and every direction looked the same g granger draco whispered after a few minutes sounding twice as scared and timid as he looked not now malfoy hermione snapped granger i busy what do you want draco his face ashen pointed silently behind her with a shaking finger now that her concentration was broken hermione became aware of a loud rattling noise from behind her which she recognized as the breath of an enormous creature swallowing hermione raised her wand and nervously spun around i sorry i late harry told snape automatically as he arrived at the greenhouses out of breath and worried sick it just have you seen hermione i cantfind her no i haven t you all right snape asked as harry doubled over putting his hands on his knees and gasping for air having run all over the castle fine harry lied snape nodded all right then your detention should be simple enough a small explosion in greenhouse three has covered the walls in dragon dung no i not all right harry said suddenly the thought of cleaning dragon dung all night further sinking his spirits life sucks snape cast a glance up at the castle as though itching to leave but he said without much interest why that potter why that why that because harry shouted suddenly ron gone evil i ve got to clean dragon dung from walls just because i reacted like anyone would and i have to spend every waking moment with malfoy just to be a good friend that why i want the simple life damn it i defeated voldemort twice and my reward is dragon dung and malfoy i can barely sleep anymore either i keep having these awful dreams about hermione not just hermione malfoy hermione and me it sickening i can barely look her in the eye anymore and i dontknow what it about but it cantbe true it just can t snape who d been trying to find a way out of the conversation sighed deciding that the time to tell harry the truth about the visions had come potter he said awkwardly it isnt true what harry stopped his ramblings and looked up at snape with a look of surprise mingled with faint hope snape uncomfortable continued the visions arenttrue well the dreams aren t anyway the cheese spirit bite causes you to dream of whoever you were looking at during the last stage in the potion process in this case the love poem the cheese spirit is a demon who causes confusion and fear surrounding love and desire as a punishment for the misuse of love spells and potions there are many such demons though few are made of cheese as a matter of fact i not sure if he made of cheese that just what he looked like to me plus you know the smell and the mooing sound when he first arrives and the i dontcare what he made of harry interrupted happily the dreams arent real are you sure of course not for heaven sake potter haventyou found anything during your research madam pince says you re in the library almost every day looking for a way to block visions not for cheese monsters harry told him oh this is excellent absolutely brilliant well now that we ve cleared that up snape said briskly there the small matter of dragon dung supplies over there no magic he jerked his thumb at a pile of cleaning equipment i must be going i have a prior engagement he started off back up to the castle harry nodded unable to believe it how could they have been so stupid as to overlook researching the cause they d simply tried to block the effects which was a lot like casting a spell on a pile of dung to make it smell better rather than getting rid of the dung itself he picked up a bucket and a rag then turned as snape called back over his shoulder do make sure you tell draco wontyou harry waved in response but the moment snape was out of earshot he muttered malfoy a smart guy he can figure it out for himself even with the prospect of a night filled with fertilizer harry was beyond happy hermione breathed a sigh of relief as she saw what was behind her she had been expecting some horrifying monster but it was in fact grawp ever since their sixth year harry ron and hermione accompanied occasionally by ginny had made regular trips into the forest with hagrid trying to educate and civilize grawp harry and hermione felt as if they owed grawp something well to be fair they did owe him their lives and as such made little complaints as they taught grawp about grammar and manners grawp did surprisingly well hermione pointed out to the others that hagrid had told them that other giants had learned enough english to translate for hagrid and maxime when the two had tried to convince the giants to join dumbledore so the idea that a giant could learn and think and even become smarter wasntas farfetched as they d originally thought since their lessons began grawp had never intentionally injured anyone though there were a few mild accidents and he now had enough english to carry on an almost normal conversation hermy grawp said looking pleased as always to have company hermione was a bit nonplussed about her nickname but hermione was rather hard to pronounce for a giant hello grawp hermione said pleasantly but her voice was drowned out by draco who seemed to have taken grawp cheerfulness at seeing her for cheerfulness at finding a meal draco naturally started screaming his head off shut up hermione yelled as grawp began to roar in surprise she attempted to calm grawp which was no easy task grawp couldnthear her over the deafening sound of his own voice hermione put her hands over her ears grawp breath was shaking most of the leaves from the trees overhead and frightened birds added their screeches to his yells as they took flight grawp grawp it okay it s argh draco had seized hermione by the waist and pulled her back behind a tree are you insane dontspeak to it you might make it mad hermione stared at him unable to believe he was trying to help her though the fact that he was holding her in front of him made it clear that it wasntan entirely selfless act you distract it and then we ll run he added in a tone that clearly meant you distract it while i run hermione shoved him away and waited for grawp to draw breath when he would be able to hear her grawp she screamed as loudly as she could it okay it all right grawp looked down at her hermy where haggard he asked he was getting closer and closer to the pronunciation of hagrid name hagrid not here right now hermione said biting her lip and glancing around she wasntsure where she was beyond the fact that she was definitely in the forest who it grawp demanded pointing at draco so suddenly that draco yelped fearfully grawp misjudged the distance and accidentally poked draco in the chest knocking him flat draco got to his feet and hid behind hermione trembling this is draco malfoy hermione said feeling beyond stupid me grawp the giant explained he looked at hermione pointedly remembering her numerous manners classes with grawp she cleared her throat malfoy this is um hagrid little brother hermione said grawp little draco said shrilly little pleased meet you grawp said extending his hand as if to shake draco s shake his hand hermione instructed what draco stared at her in disbelief shake his hand and say the pleasure is all mine hermione said patiently fighting to keep a straight face shaking madly draco put out his hand as slowly as possible and closed his eyes grawp carefully wrapped two fingers around draco hand hermione giggled slightly as she remembered how long it had taken them to get grawp to do so without hurting anyone p pleasure all mine draco stammered hermione wondered if he was going to wet himself harry ron and i have been teaching grawp how to use proper grammar and etiquette hermione told draco as though this was a perfectly natural thing to do with your friends on a saturday night is drag omal foid friend grawp asked hermione what did he just call me draco asked well no hermione said ignoring draco wondering how she could explain this is it enemy grawp asked glowering at draco no no no hermione said hastily yes draco said at the same time me hurt enemies i not an enemy in that case draco said quickly granger and i are best friends in that case lovers even yes we re in love everyone knows that grawp looked questioningly at hermione hermy what is lovers what are lovers hermione corrected automatically we just talked about plural and singular last time remember grawp nodded and repeated her what are lovers er that is something hagrid will tell you hermione said wincing the last thing she wanted to do right now was teach sex education to a giant she struggled for something else to say to change the subject and was struck by sudden inspiration grawp she asked eagerly did you see who brought us here grawp no understand did you see any other humans today two boys with you grawp said nodding hard look same look as ron they leave not talk to grawp hermione jaw dropped fred and george fred and george had brought them here but how would they have known about the forest prank hermione brain ran through everything the twins would have done to plan but why would they have done it they were on good terms with her and so was wait ron hermione whispered what are you talking about draco demanded it just described the weasley twins not ron did this hermione said sounding close to tears he only been pretending to be nice he hasntreally forgiven me he been conspiring against me all this time he only got on my good side to make sure he d be able to keep harry and ginny from interfering and to prevent me from thinking it was him so he could terrorize me without seeing any payback oh stop whining will you draco snapped who cares so your boyfriend a jerk show some spine already you re supposed to be brave so stop bitching and moaning and kick some ass hermione stared at him surprised by his sudden outburst but more surprised by the truth behind his words she suddenly felt like an idiot here she was crying and complaining when someone had done her wrong why wasntshe rising up and teaching ron fred george and the world in general that no one from dark wizards to idiot boyfriends messed with hermione granger you re right hermione said simply you re absolutely right malfoy i am draco said startled he wouldnthave been surprised to have gotten smacked or at least yelled at rolling his eyes when hermione ignored him he glanced around trying to find the way out for himself losing interest in hermione and grawp hermione squared her shoulders and turned back to grawp grawp we need your help hermione said uncertainly we need to find something important will you take us to the spiders big spiders grawp asked yes er no not the really big ones a rather small one about this big she held up her hands about three feet apart draco stared at her as if she were insane grawp help grawp said eagerly grawp know where find them hermione smiled and prepared to thank him but just then grawp gigantic fists shot out toward them one hand closed gently around hermione and the other around draco then he lifted them up draco began to scream again and held them closely to his chest it appeared he had thought hermione request to take them to the spiders a literal one shut up she called to draco he not going to hurt you he thinks we re friends shows what he knows draco muttered glaring at hermione what he doing then taking us to the acromantulas what an acromadu whatever you said a giant spider more or less hermione said calmly capable of human speech what draco hissed how giant is giant oh not too large harry said they were about as big as carthorses i believe what dontworry hermione told him we just need a small one a few spells and we ll be safe from it as soon as we pick it up we ll just run like hell i like that plan at least draco muttered irritably why exactly are we going to go pick up a giant spider because hermione said her eyes glinting in the dim light it time to show ron that one good prank deserves another so how did it go ron asked in a low voice as soon as ginny and harry left the great hall like clockwork little bro fred said pleasantly ron raised his eyebrows and fred sighed well okay we had a few problems the twins launched into a detailed account of the execution you guys ron exclaimed slapping his forehead not only did you leave hermione her wand you forgot to perform the bust enhancement charm malfoy boobs knew we forgot something george muttered dontworry ron fred said soothingly as ron ears went red we ve got plenty of ideas on other pranks this is just a prequel to the real story understand george nodded emphatically by the time this is over even they ll be impressed at how badly they got their butts kicked when they re not sobbing ron forced himself to calm down all right he said sulkily what do you have in mind end notes still reading the seventh book but i almost done i ll be updating a lot more after it finished more importantly congratulations to sarahyyy the 5 000th reviewer of the prank war thanks to all of you who made this fic so damned popular and for putting up with my insane urge to edit this thing until it was if not perfect then certainly less flawed the revision almost over and then we can get on with the story i have a feeling that by the time i read the epilogue of deathly hallows i ll be itching to rewrite the hp universe to my liking but i must say i like the book quite well so far anyway i cantthank you all enough i had no idea when i started this thing that it was heading down this multi chaptered road of psychoticness and even less idea that i d soon have 5 010 reviews and counting you guys are amazing chapter thirty seven new alliances hermione thought hard as grawp carried them through the trees further into the forest the plan was forming quickly harry grawp ron draco an acromantula she could do it she could have her revenge grawp grawp put us down please the moment hermione issued the request she wished she hadn t grawp opened his hands dropping the two startled students unceremoniously on the ground draco once again started screaming as soon as the giant fingers gave way ow hermione moaned as she hit the dirt hermione stood up kicking draco lightly in the invisible boot to get him to shut up grawp hermione called loudly i think we should go alone from here on out we have to surprise them which way are the spiders grawp pointed straight ahead thanks grawp which way is hagrid grawp pointed directly behind them okay why dontyou go on back to your clearing get some sleep the giant looked somewhat disappointed at this hermy come visit soon of course i will grawp hermione promised grawp turned to look at draco nice meet you he said draco shook his head wearily you too he muttered rubbing a sore spot on his leg caused by his recent contact with the ground you come visit too grawp asked eagerly draco stared at grawp appalled at this suggestion hermione nodded quickly at draco trying to urge him to say yes draco thought about refusing to do so but decided it was probably better to be nice to a giant okay yes i will grawp grinned said his goodbyes and lumbered off noisily only when grawp disappeared into the deepening darkness did draco realize that having a friendly giant around was definitely not a bad thing wait come back draco yelled getting to his feet hermione shushed him and he turned to glare at her are you insane you want to sneak up on a gigantic spider alone when only one of us has a wand we re not going to be able to sneak up on one at all if we re with grawp so at least we d have had a better chance at fighting it harry and ron said there were hundreds of acromantulas in this forest well ron said thousands but he always gets a bit emotional when he talks about it so we cantrun the risk of attacking one spider and having it call dozens upon dozens of spiders to its aid dozens hundreds thousands draco yelled shrilly alarmed that it granger no way in hell am i going to help you listen to me hermione interrupted something about her tone quiet insistent and pleading rather than the bark like yells she used when angry with him made him shut up and decide to at least hear her out malfoy fred george and ron left us here in the forbidden forest they knew we could get hurt they tried to remove our clothes so we d have to sneak up to the castle naked and knowing the twins they probably are trying to make sure we re seen in our leaf covered half naked state i dontknow about you but i ve had enough of being humiliated what are you getting at draco demanded not liking the way she was talking as if she were trying to strike a bargain ron is terrified of spiders completely he d sooner face an army of giants combined with fifty basilisks than even a small acromantula weasley afraid of spiders draco repeated incredulously feeling like he d just been made king of britain hermione nodded matching his grin with a small mischievous smile wait why are you telling me this he asked suspiciously because if ron finds an unnaturally large spider in his bed he ll never even think of crossing me again i can make it happen how easy enough i ve got it all worked out but i cantdo it without two people harry and you draco stared at her you re actually going to ask me for help and expect to get it hermione stepped closer her eyes boring into his that slight smile still on her face yes i admit it i need you i need your help i not asking to pick out a china pattern i not asking to be bestest buddies i just asking for a temporary partnership so that we can get revenge on three of the weasleys you so despise imagine the look on his face malfoy imagine ron coming upon an enormous spider in his bed imagine his horror when he finds the door locked when he realizes there no escape from his worst nightmare draco grin broadened at that but faded quickly as he gazed at her thoughtfully something about her was different well perhaps not different he didntknow her well enough to know if this side of her was new but he did know he d never seen it before it was strange a change more felt than seen he could sense her passion her devilish side her raw power and her strength it was frightening and yet oddly alluring he let his eyes travel over the rest of her face amusement adding to his already confused emotions she had twigs and leaves caught in her poofy hair dirt and scratches marred her skin her eyes glittered at him with an almost crazed spark feeling the urge to test her he let his gaze go lower linger on her almost bare chest before looking her in the eye once more she didntcall him on it though her smile changed to a half smirk a daring one almost playful accepting his challenge and giving him one of her own well she asked in a lilting somewhat mocking tone draco shook his head suddenly angry at himself he d allowed himself to think she was pretty to think that she looked endearing covered in cuts and dirt and leaves that was far too dangerous and he knew it it was one thing to think of her as a girl he d like to shag it was something entirely different to think of her as cute he had to put a stop to these more frequent trains of thought about her still a vision of ron face swam before his eyes of ron screaming pathetically and trying to run from a small easily bested spider i in granger draco said shrugging slightly i can always make your life hell tomorrow she let out a short laugh same here draco smiled again so what the plan harry sighed stretching his aching shoulder muscles he d had the bright idea to start at the top of greenhouse three walls and the soap and water had slid down the wall helping to cut through the muck on the bottom half so he d finished faster than expected now he just had to put the cleaning supplies away and then he could hunt down ginny and they could spend a few hours hunting for hermione before finding their friend in some embarrassing and possibly dangerous situation great harry forced his mind back to the wonders of knowing his dreams were false while they were still disturbing it was greatly comforting to know that they would end soon and that they wouldntcome true it was even more comforting to know that draco didntknow it as he was leaving the greenhouses an orange blur hit him in the chest he looked down just in time to catch ginny before she fell over she was gasping and looked like she d been running nonstop for four hours checked every w where ginny gasped no no sign of mione then realized was an idiot for doing things the hard way she held up the marauder map harry slapped his forehead i cantbelieve we didntthink of this hours ago he muttered grabbing the parchment eagerly if hermione still in hogwarts she ll be on here he began scanning the map anxiously which was no easy feat it did after all show all of hogwarts and with all the towers and floors and secret passages and whatnot one person was going to be difficult to find ginny shook her head already found her she wheezed ran all the way here from gryffindor tower harry hermione in the forest harry stared at her in horror what no way she what would she be doing in there open your eyes harry ginny snapped fred george and ron must have put her there i know you dontwant to believe it i donteither but my brothers have turned on us and turned hard harry sighed he didnt want to believe it ron was his first oldest and best friend but it was too much of a coincidence how many people knew about the forbidden forest prank and also had a grudge against hermione or draco perhaps someone had thought of it themselves or gotten the idea from their parents but harry doubted that a lot of parents discussed their former rule breaking practices with their children and he knew that most of the students wouldntvoluntarily go near the forest at all the slytherins wouldn t for sure he d seen their terror whenever hagrid had asked them to enter the forest for class that left the hufflepuffs most of whom were too friendly to hermione to prank her and the ravenclaws a few had problems with hermione and harry and ginny some were jealous about hermione topping them in classes and michael corner and his friends were rather icy to ginny after she dumped him but ravenclaws werentoften the type to do something as stupid and potentially harmful as leaving fellow students in the forest draco had far more enemies but when it came down to it harry couldntthink of a single person who would set foot in the forbidden forest unnecessarily other than hagrid fred and george that why they sent hagrid down to the three broomsticks harry muttered so he wouldntbe there to help hermione exactly ginny said grimacing come on harry we ve got to go after them how harry asked stuffing the map into his pocket angrily the map wonthelp us it not that detailed we ll probably run into all sorts of horrible creatures and it could take us days to find her well we ve got to try ginny insisted glaring at him furiously i know that harry retorted i just i wish we had a plan hey harry the two of them looked around confused dean and seamus were walking towards them a steady stream of people was walking behind them what going on harry demanded fred and george said a slytherin was about to get their just rewards down by the forest dean explained harry groaned his worst fears confirmed they re putting the word out that we should see something interesting before curfew seamus added looking excited harry and ginny exchanged horrified glances fred and george had not only stranded hermione in the forest they d made sure she d have an audience when and if she made it out harry do you know what going on neville called walking up with luna lovegood at the mention of harry name the crowd mostly older ravenclaws hufflepuffs and gryffindors rushed forward to hear what he had to say given the incredibly large amount of rumors being spread and the whole confusion over draco and the chain everyone had been on high alert whenever the subject of harry came up harry looked at them all worriedly then at ginny for help she bit her lip thinking hard then suddenly blurted out you ve been duped what d you mean called a hufflepuff fred and george are setting you all up ginny continued hurriedly trying to get you to break curfew in the process too there not going to be any prank unless it on all of us yeah right one of the few slytherins said with a snort you re just trying to get us to leave hey if the twins knew about a great prank they d want to be here to see it harry snapped if they re not here they re worried they ll get caught so they re establishing alibis i dontknow about you guys but if something is about to go down the last place i want to be is near it a few people looking alarmed and remembering various weasley twins moments headed back towards the front doors quickly i think we should go watch from the windows ginny added much safer eh harry last thing i need is to get in trouble again harry muttered especially three seconds after i got out of detention you re right harry neville said loudly a touch too loudly those two would do anything for a laugh if there was really a prank going on they d have come too let get back inside before they lock us out of the castle somehow or whatever this seemed to inspire a touch of panic in the others everyone turned back to the castle save dean seamus neville and luna coming harry neville asked still far too loudly harry realizing something was up replied with i ve got to finish something in the greenhouses for my detention i ll only be a second when the last of the other students had disappeared neville dean and seamus looked at harry expectantly while luna stared dreamily into space playing with her butterbeer cork necklace absently dean and seamus the only ones in the group who knew neville well enough to know when something was up looked rather excited but neville appeared more nervous so what really going on neville asked is it hermione what makes you think that ginny said giving harry a pointed look he took the hint and kept quiet they had to be careful who knew who the twins had enlisted as spies no one seen her all day not since muggle studies ernie came over to the dinner table said he needed to talk to her about some head boy head girl thing neville replied without a trace of a lie i told him i d keep an eye out for her but i haventseen her at all neither has anyone i ve asked about her what up with the twins dean added why d they send us all out here if there isntgoing to be a prank to watch there is ginny said with a sigh at least there might be we think the twins and ron have been working together to pull a major prank on us harry said we think they ve stranded hermione and draco in the forest this provoked instant anger and mortification you re kidding no way she could get hurt that wasntvery nice of them luna said appearing a bit more serious than usual dean seamus and neville turned to look at her as she stood calmly next to neville her eyes were a tad wider than usual but that was the only indication that she was even slightly worried no it wasn t harry said dryly anyway we ve got to go look for her you guys want to help er in the forest dean said hesitantly but it dark seamus protested i with you harry neville said shooting a dirty look at the other two boys luna shrugged and nodded serenely i coming too she said as though marching into a forest full of deadly beasts were as simple as going to class seamus looked at luna and sighed it went against his grain and that of many gryffindors to wuss out when others showed bravery especially if those others included neville and a weirdo of a ravenclaw are you sure she in there positive harry replied all right then seamus said taking a deep breath he looked at dean for confirmation dean nodded reluctantly we re in chapter thirty eight centaurs and spiders and owls oh my hermione crept as stealthily through the brush as she could while chained to draco who obviously was unaccustomed to excursions in the woods he ran into every bramble and bush and tripped over every tree root in his path after the fourteenth time hermione shushed him for complaining he stuck to making grumbling noises in his throat that sounded like he was talking with his mouth shut hermione was having a slightly better time of it but not by much she d been in the forest often enough on her missions with harry and visits to grawp to know what she was doing but it was still very dark and the vegetation was very thick hermione paused and bit her lip looking around using her wand for light i wish i knew where we were hermione muttered we re lost draco hissed angrily you got us lost in a forest full of dangerous creatures while looking for enormous spiders no i mean i know where we are i just not sure where the acromantulas are she performed the four point spell it showed that they were facing northwest the castle is southeast from here and i know the path to grawp lair is that way ah there the clearing the spiders are in there draco yelped leaping away from the direction she was pointing no no that where we were all attacked by centaurs thanks to you hermione said lightly sorry draco said with a large sarcastic smile dontmention it hermione said coolly after all that what got umbridge out of this school wait what harry and i well i suppose it was just me i led her in here when harry and i left her office that term hermione explained absently heading farther northwest the centaurs surrounded us and umbridge made the mistake of calling them half breeds with near human intelligence if grawp hadntshown up we d have all been killed anyway harry told me later that i d accidentally taken the same track that had led him and ron to aragog so that clearing is on our way cantwe cut through it draco moaned as she headed around it no hermione told him there no cover that how the centaurs were able to surround us we were in the open and they were hiding in the trees draco sighed then shook his head is there anything you haventdone he mumbled what you ve had every adventure known to wizard kind draco pointed out sourly dementors and trolls and giants and acromantulas and murderous centaurs wasntit enough for you three to single handedly win a freaking war against some of the world most powerful wizards wasntthat exciting enough nope hermione said with a smile now be quiet we re getting close how can you tell all these trees look the same draco grumbled lowering his voice all the same in response hermione aimed her lit wand tip at the ground so that draco could see that the crunching sounds he d assumed were made by leaves and twigs were in fact incredibly large spiders though they still werentclose to an acromantula size shuddering deeply he crept a little closer to hermione so these acromantulas draco whispered you said potter and weasley met them yeah so hermione muttered distractedly intent upon untangling herself from a particularly vicious bramble so they wonthurt you right they know you like that giant does he figured this was why she was so calm about approaching them oh no i was petrified when harry and ron came in here and met them besides aragog the chief or whatever the acromantulas call their leader he told harry and ron that he wasntgoing to prevent the other spiders from eating harry and ron said that since hagrid was the one who raised aragog from an egg hagrid was under aragog protection but he wasntgoing to extend that to anyone else there hermione finally tugged herself free harry and ron were attacked nearly killed what draco yelped shh oh this just keeps getting better and better draco snarled giant evil intelligent spiders us alone me unarmed and they ve already threatened to kill you lot once just great we ll be fi look out hermione shrieked pointing behind him yeah right granger like i really going to fall for that sure there some big huge monster behind me rolling his eyes he glanced over his shoulder intending to make his point instead he came face to face with a spider as big as a blast ended skrewt aaaaaahhhhhhh get down hermione shouted but there was no need draco was already diving behind her as the spider moved forward hermione drew back her wand and slashed it forward and just like that the acromantula was blasted on its back ha draco gloated strutting forward those things arentso aaaaaahhhhhhh the acromantula rolled back upright with impossible agility hermione who had been expecting this took aim again draco who hadntbeen expecting this ran like a bitch argh hermione was jerked sideways by the chain and was forced to follow as draco tore through the trees like a wood chipper heading back the way they came malfoy stop you re going to get us killed hermione didntknow what to do the spider was giving chase and draco was showing no signs of slowing if she tried to stop him by yanking on the chain she d waste precious seconds that would allow the acromantula to catch her if she turned around to aim she d get yanked off her feet by draco before she could get a spell off and running backward would probably send her straight into a tree in vain she fired off curses over her shoulder but the spider dodged easily aaaaahhhhhhh stop running will not save you useless human the spider said its pincers clicking loudly aaa oof draco ran into something large and furry and fell backwards hermione not missing a beat spun round and hit the pursuing spider with a jet of red light it stopped rolling over again and before it could get back up she hit it with three more quick spells argh the spider down you idiot murderous centaur murderous centaur draco screeched diving behind hermione again hello said a sad doleful voice hermione froze recognizing it at once whipping her head around she saw that the large furry object draco had bounced off of was in fact ronan the chestnut bodied redheaded centaur who had been against killing her and harry ronan she breathed fearfully backing up a step and accidentally stamping on draco foot draco barely noticed he clutched her shoulders and ducked his head down whimpering in panic wait neville called as they stood at the edge of the forbidden forest dean and seamus halted immediately harry and ginny a bit more reluctantly luna simply stood gazing vaguely into space what harry demanded harry shouldntwe have some sort of plan before we go in there neville asked timidly you know a plan of action or at least a weapon we have wands ginny reminded him yes but i mean maybe we should get hagrid yes let do that dean said quickly hagrid down at the pub harry said shortly well well one of us could go and get him there no time for that hermione could be hurt harry snapped i know i know but well it is dark are you lot coming with me or not harry burst out angrily if you re not just say so because i donthave time for potter harry jumped a tall figure was walking towards them across the darkened lawn snape is that you professor harry called yes yes what are you doing down here snape asked i what are you doing down here harry retorted he wasntgoing to let a teacher any teacher prevent him from rescuing hermione given snape new insanity he might be easier to get around and harry had to take that chance i on my way to the gate snape said with a shrug i was planning on taking the floo network but i dontfancy being covered in ash when i get there they all stared at him noticing in the light of their wands that snape appeared to have taken great care in his appearance he seemed freshly showered his hair wasntgreasy at all he was back to wearing black thankfully but the smile on his face completely destroyed any evil points the black clothing could have given him especially when combined with are you wearing perfume ginny demanded incredulously who me no no of course not snape said hastily backing away slowly it s potion ingredients you know horrid smells all the time well i ll leave you to whatever you re doing harry ginny dean seamus and neville gaped at him as he hastily retreated even luna looked mildly interested what was that all about seamus wondered ginny rounded on harry okay i know hermione in there alone with malfoy and i know there are dangerous things in that forest but harry we have to stop snape we have to figure out what he up to never have i wanted to play detective with you and hermione and ron like i do right now but since the world is completely out of whack at the moment and we ve got these four instead of those two i say we follow him first hermione capable of holding off until we get there and i want to know what snape is up to it could be important dean added nodding emphatically and we ll probably get lost in the forest anyway luna added serenely for ages until the glob sludge gets us glob sludge neville repeatedly anxiously yes it quite horrible you know harry frowned tuning out of the conversation hermione was alone in the forest with malfoy but there was no way fred and george could have gotten her wand from her cuff she could take care of herself for a few more moments and they did need to figure out what was up with snape if he was meeting someone in hogsmeade they could solve the mystery once and for all and if snape had somehow had a hand in putting those visions and dreams in harry head all right harry muttered but if it takes more than a few minutes we re heading back up here dean seamus and neville hastily nodded and the six of them hurried off after snape unlike her last encounter with the centaurs hermione had been prepared for something like this just in case therefore she had a better idea of what to say hastily she stuffed her wand in her arm cuff and held up her hands in the classic position of surrender willing herself to stay calm ronan i know you and the other centaurs didntwant me to come back hermione said trying not to babble but only halfway succeeding and i ve only been going to see grawp until today like hagrid arranged with you i haventeven been in here very often since school started what with how busy i ve been i didntmean to intrude on your territory it just that there this prank war going on and we were stranded here i just wanted to capture an acromantula for revenge i know it was wrong of me to go where i told you i wouldn t i just be at ease ronan interrupted you are one of the three who killed he who must not be named we now call you the daughter of athena and i am honored to be in your presence please extend my regards and apologies to the chosen one for our previous treatment i will not harm you nor will any other of my kind but i implore you make haste towards the safety of the castle there are other dangers lurking in this forest thank you hermione said sighing in relief and i ll tell harry what you said she pointed her wand at the spider and it rose into the air hovering a few feet off the ground it would follow where she led it she started to push past ronan draco following her closely and still shaking but she paused and looked around uncertainly erm that is the right way to the castle isntit she asked pointing yes thanks goodbye ronan goodbye daughter of athena draco gaped after ronan as he cantered away then hurried forward to walk close to hermione as the spider was floating uncomfortably close behind them you werentsure where the castle was i just wanted confirmation hermione insisted but draco thought she looked a tad shifty you could have walked us into the middle of a nest of werewolves considering it nowhere near the full moon i doubt it hermione said rolling her eyes still draco sighed glaring at her then looking back at the spider apprehensively you sure that thing isntgoing to attack positive now hurry up it should be about a half hour walk to hagrid from here minimum why are we going to hagrid s you ll see when we get there draco frowned what was all that about with the centaur i guess they ve all changed their minds about us now that voldemort dead hermione said with an irritable shrug no i mean the daughter of athena stuff i dontknow i guess that their way of honoring us the chosen one would be harry everyone been calling him that where do you think they got your nickname i dontknow athena was the goddess of wisdom and war right yes but not like ares ares just liked blood and mayhem she liked championing causes so she was a goody goody like you draco said cheerfully eh makes sense doesntit of course she was a virgin and you re a tramp for crying out loud will you shut up about that already hermione grumbled no it true and i going to make sure everyone knows it you re going to make a fool out of yourself you know gee like i ve never done that before he said rolling his eyes it ll be worth it the tattoo was hermione gritted her teeth seeing this he pressed on a bit more gleefully i bet even now everyone talking about what happened at quidditch practice on monday shut up hermione growled that old news yeah but the week been so quiet there isntmuch else to talk about but monday draco pointed out smugly yeah i bet the team told everyone about how you tried to chew off my major appendage and all of course they might start thinking that chew off was slang for something else something with a more positive meaning you re disgusting says the girl who shagging snape i am not look hermione snapped stopping and turning to look at him fighting to keep her rage in check i thought we had a deal we call a truce until this prank is over but you re just so hot when you re angry draco said mockingly okay hermione said glaring dangers at his smirking face i tired i cold i covered in dirt and scratches my senses are on high alert for evil creatures you have no wand and i have a giant spider under my control a giant poisonous spider i should say is this really the best time to be making me angry draco smugness changed immediately to nervousness all right point taken thank you as they continued onward however draco couldntresist once last dig you re welcome i figure i should be a little nicer to you anyway hermione shot him an incredulous look what i mean after all since you ve been chained to me you haventbeen able to shag wood or snape must be terribly frustrating for you hermione let out a small scream and marched on draco followed with a grin on his face and bounce in his step he watched her march angrily towards the castle amused and thoughtful at the change in her her revelations about ron would make life a lot easier for draco after all the euphoria centering on ron had been all that kept her from losing her cool when draco attempted to attack her that euphoria had since been replaced by determination and vengeful wrath with which would surely come satisfaction but that was nothing like what ron return had given her he could get under her skin now and the idea was more appealing than ever so draco said after granting her a few minutes peace what next in this devious little plan of yours hopefully hermione said stiffly you ll break your nose walking into a tree well what after that draco asked cheerfully to ensure that she couldnthave the pleasure of bothering him hermione heaved a sigh we re going to hagrid s why that great oaf might try to steal our big evil dangerous spider better not let grawp hear you saying mean things about his big brother hermione said coolly then smirked when draco looked around nervously that not funny draco insisted glowering at her and promptly walking into a tree hermione burst out laughing oh ha ha draco said sourly rubbing the side of his head now come on we ve got people to prank dontwe what next oh i just love it when you re all business hermione said dryly before draco could retort she continued we re going to hagrid to send a message to harry we found out last wednesday that he had detention in the greenhouses today with any luck he ll still be there hagrid has an owl draco asked yes hermione said not meeting his eye okay then now be quiet hermione said pushing ahead remember what ronan said about other dangers in here draco swallowed and decided she was probably right they marched back through the trees with only the occasional complaints and bickering matches the way back was much easier they d managed to clear something of a path on their way through the forest after a long while hermione veered off their path and onto a slightly clearer trail that she frequented on her visits to grawp winded cold and irritable they kept quiet until hermione whispered careful we re pretty close to fluffy fluffy you re worried about something called fluffy hermione paused then lowered the spider to the ground so that she could maneuver her still lit wand better tell you what take this and just look through those trees right there draco took hermione wand and held it aloft three seconds later as his eyes widened in terror at the sight of the giant three headed dog chained to a large tree he started screaming hysterically hagrid named him hermione said simply with the utmost satisfaction as she reclaimed her wand and waved it a haunting melody started playing and the dog eyes closed quickly oh my god draco moaned shaking badly we ve got to get out of this forest granger hermione paused and looked around suddenly appearing puzzled oh damn i think we re lost again what sorry i couldntresist she said grinning smugly you little temper temper remember giant spider giant dog giant giant i hate you likewise ah here we are they emerged quite suddenly from the forest and found themselves in hagrid pumpkin patch come on hermione told him and went and rapped on hagrid front door this shouldntbe too hard to explain draco muttered looking at hermione and then at himself their clothes still under the illusion charms the both of them looking like they d lost a fight to an army of bowtruckles and the acromantula floating overhead hagrid pretty nice about helping us no matter what we ve been up to hermione called over fang barks but it looks like he not home heaving a great sigh hermione set the spider down carefully and waved her wand at the door it promptly popped open stay here she told draco grabbing fang collar and pulling him away from draco hey why draco demanded casting an apprehensive look at the spider someone needs to watch it well it sure as hell isntgoing to be me fang doesntknow you fang met me in our first year we ran from the dark lord together it was a bonding experience well dogs have short memories hermione snapped slamming the door on him she turned to head for hagrid table and having overlooked the problem of the chain nearly cut off her own hand forget something draco asked holding up his wrist when she reopened the door irritably shut up hermione growled as she let him in donttouch anything we wontbe here long i just need to write a note to harry grabbing a scrap piece of parchment and a quill hermione wrote one note to harry and another to hagrid apologizing for helping herself to his house then she led the way outside draco grumbling behind her about dog drool bloody beast probably the little brother of that fluffy monstrosity hi hermione called out and draco looked up expecting to see hagrid owl what he saw instead made him gape at hermione in horror oh hell no draco breathed are you insane you want to send a letter with that he ll do fine hermione insisted have you got a better idea if hagrid isnthere we re going to have to use what we ve got draco sighed as hermione moved towards it i ve got a bad feeling about this he muttered harry slow down neville puffed ginny dean seamus neville and luna were all extremely winded so was harry really but he was refusing to let it slow him down we ve got to save hermione harry snapped their pursuit of snape had been useless snape had apparated immediately once leaving the grounds thus they had no idea where he was going though they doubted snape was going to hogsmeade as there wouldnthave been much point in apparating a few feet and most wizards considered it rude to apparate directly into someone home anyway i knew we shouldnthave wasted time on snape harry if we collapse from exhaustion we re not going to be able to save anyone ginny panted harry glared at her but halted and the others gratefully stopped breathing hard and clutching stitches in their sides hurry up he called impatiently pulling the marauder map out of the pocket of his cloak to check that hermione was still in the forest he received a pleasant surprise however hey he called ginny looked up from where she d collapsed on the grass hermione and malfoy made it out they re at hagrid s oh thank god ginny gasped wiping the sweat off her forehead and sighing in relief that great neville said look out seamus bellowed and harry dropped the map fumbling for his wand and whipping around to see something the size of a baby elephant flying at them in an erratic sort of way its wingspan was roughly fifteen feet and it was twittering madly its enormous body oddly shapeless in the dark the five gryffindors and luna scattered yelling argh run it a kacknarc harry tried to raise his wand but too late he was knocked flat on his back by the large feathery mass of the creature it zoomed over and past him still babbling incoherently in its own language harry twisted around and took aim stup no ginny shrieked knocking his wand down it pig sure enough the freakish creature was not attacking but flying round and round harry and ginny like an overexcited racehorse at last pig landed and stuck out its leg nearly decapitating luna with his claws hermione must have sent it harry muttered snatching the note from pig leg and glaring at it she had to get a cat didntshe ginny said couldntget an owl could she no she figured it d be just fine to borrow other people owls instead good plan hermione makes perfect sense nothing has made sense in a very long time harry said wearily what it say luna asked curiously as pig took flight again heading back to hagrid s harry cleared his throat and read it aloud dear harry ron has betrayed us the twins carried malfoy and me into the forest and left us there they stole draco wand i already have a plan for revenge but it involves dean seamus and neville you have to keep them out of the dormitory meet me at the broom shed by the quidditch pitch and i ll explain everything come as fast as you can love from hermione p s i hope it didntstartle you too badly to see pig flying at you that putting it mildly seamus growled glaring after pig what this about us being involved then dean asked i dontknow harry said stuffing the note in his pocket along with the map you best come with us to the broom shed why the broom shed ginny wondered frowning surely she not thinking of flying she hates flying who knows come on harry said already striding across the lawn ginny and luna hurried after him dean seamus and neville looked at each other what do you think dean asked should we go hell yeah seamus said gleefully this ought to be good author notes i d like to point out as i currently still reposting this fic that i not doing it for extra reviews while i love reviews who doesn t i feel no need to play games to drive them up i ve got more than enough reviews in fact i had more than enough over three thousand reviews ago and i not greedy for more there no point in trying to drive them up anyway if you dont earn them they re pointless i reposting this fic because i want to get all of my files straight so that what online matches what on my computer and i was tired of having a sub par fic posted so i trying to make it better not perfect as i dontthink that ll happen but better i apologize if this made some of you think i was a review whore cuz i not i honored by my reviewers and i thankful for each and every one of them but i not looking for ways to drag in more chapter three a plan for revenge you did what harry ron hermione and ginny were sitting alone together in the great hall discussing their plans for the prank war the other gryffindors were keeping their distance knowing fully well what the four of them were up to the whole of gryffindor house was waiting eagerly for harry ron and hermione to make their move and no one wanted to disturb the crucial planning process the gryffindors were currently dying with curiosity hermione had just told the other three about the morning events and that had meant a lot of shocked yells and laughter so everyone was watching them avidly but everyone held back and left them alone i made an alliance with snape hermione repeated calmly in response to the horrified stares the other three were giving her he seemed happy to help he has some ideas about wards to keep malfoy out of our rooms and there was a slight incident after i ended up in his rooms if malfoy figures out that snape is helping me it going to confuse the hell out of him what slight incident ron demanded hermione told them about snape barging drunkenly into the common room and confronting malfoy oh my god harry said looking a bit green malfoy probably thinks you had sex ginny exclaimed apparently thinking the whole thing was hysterical harry ron and hermione shushed her and glanced around but no one seemed to have heard and ginny went on that why he keeps saying did you have fun and stuff because he thinks you two woke up next to each other and ginny shut up ron and harry who d clamped their hands over their ears yelled so loudly that most of the students and teachers in the great hall turned to look at them hermione herself was wincing looking nauseous i soooooo dontwant that image in my head harry moaned apologetically to ginny ginny nodded her expression disgusted now too so what our plan of action she said trying to look innocent so that no one came over to interrupt we re empty handed right now ron said with a sigh there the standard stuff though putting bulbadox powder or ants in his clothes dying his hair pink or whatever color that sort of thing it just not good enough for malfoy though well it ll have to do for now harry said taking charge meanwhile we re going to be planning something big but it would look strange if we werentretaliating in any other way fight a few skirmishes while we plan the major battle of the war hermione agreed nodding not only that but it ll make him think we suck at pranks get him to drop his guard harry nodded okay second we re out of ideas right after dinner i ll write sirius and lupin ron get word to fred and george hermione i never thought i d say this but see exactly how snape wants to help outline a few of the more major pranks he has in detail ginny think you can handle the powder ants and color spells yep ginny said her eyes glinting evilly all right and while you re working on that make a list of people we could get to help us and it what ways you know more people than we do ginny nodded now on the count of three everyone look over at malfoy hold for a few seconds after he sees us and then start laughing harry instructed why hermione asked what better way to freak him out harry said slyly one two three they turned as one to look at malfoy staring at him with mischievous grins that could have scared voldemort himself malfoy swallowed and fidgeted nervously as they turned back around and cracked up this is great ginny laughed if an old trick like this weirds him out just imagine if he saw hermione talking to snape that perfect harry shouted suddenly what is the others demanded what if and i know this is a very creepy sickening idea but what if hermione and snape were not only working together to plot against malfoy but were a lot more than just friends as snape put it what hermione fairly screamed leaping to her feet everyone in the great hall turned to stare at them once again if you think i would do something like herm sit down ginny hissed pulling her back to the bench that came out wrong harry said hurriedly cringing i meant what if we make malfoy think you re more than friends hermione calmed down taking several deep breaths as she considered it hmm that interesting think of it harry went on eagerly you and snape could stage a few scenes and let malfoy catch you stage how ron demanded you know when they know malfoy eavesdropping start talking as if they re well having sex ginny supplied harry blushed and nodded you mean hermione and snape moaning and saying ooh baby where malfoy can hear them eh something like that harry said now looking a tad more awkward hermione grimaced but ginny and even ron instantly warmed to the idea and hermione had to admit it was a good one how would we get snape to agree to it hermione asked well we d just have to ask and hope for the best harry said uncomfortably you mean i would have to ask hermione said dryly hmm i ll be right back ignoring her three gaping friends hermione got up and marched right up to the head table stopping in front of snape professor she said innocently snape looked up at her in surprise and then forced himself to scowl the way he always had before while in the presence of gryffindors what he asked sharply i was wondering if i could speak to you about something it very important she said willing him to understand he did though he gave no outward sign come to my office after dinner he growled now go away before i lose my appetite hermione grinned cheekily at him before practically skipping back to her seat you asked him in front of the entire staff table ron hissed no of course not i told him i wanted to talk to him i going to go to his office after dinner take ginny with you harry suggested it ll look too weird if ron or i go yeah i ll keep a lookout so malfoy doesntoverhear the plot ginny said although hey i ve got an idea minerva mcgonagall gaped at severus snape as hermione left unable to believe what she d seen severus would you care to explain explain what snape snapped shoving another bite of food into his mouth oh please i ve known you since you were eleven years old you re up to something what makes you say that he asked feigning shock come off it severus tell me snape didntsay a word hmm let me guess what could it be you acting all chummy with one of your three least favorite gryffindors acting chummy excuse me oh please severus i know you that flame of hatred got a bucket of water tossed on it but why wait donttell me you re getting involved in the prank war afraid so minerva he said sighing knowing she would drag it out of him eventually just like old times hmm though he and minerva could be bitter rivals at times they were still very close friends and their friendship had been cemented in his seventh year at hogwarts when he and minerva had bonded together to exact revenge on james potter and sirius black through the prank war what are you planning minerva asked eagerly anything like our old tricks perhaps snape said thoughtfully all sorts of things and apparently granger and potter have their own ideas too if granger wants to talk to me be careful minerva told him you could end up a target especially since you ll be going against your own house wontyou they started it snape said with a distant smile severus forgive me but you re smiling three seconds after mentioning your two least favorite students was there something in your food or are you having a midlife crisis ha ha snape told her with a mock glare then he grew serious the dark lord is dead minerva and now i can finally i dontknow live so i going to for the first time in a long time i plan on having a little fun draco malfoy had never felt so tense he d seen his four worst enemies plotting in the great hall and from the shouts and the laughing and the innocent looks they were trying to assume whatever they were going to do was going to be big and what was with granger going to talk to snape draco had seen them avoiding each other like mad werentthey angry at each other or at least embarrassed after the stunt draco had pulled he watched as granger and ginny weasley broke away from potter and ron and the girls now stood at the dungeon entrance oh great were the girls going to try to follow him and curse him no that would be something potter and his weasel lackey would do unless they were trying to be inconspicuous draco turned away from them tapped his ear with his wand and whispered a spell instantly his hearing magnified the spell took practice to be able to distinguish anything from the enormous throng of noise especially in a crowd but listening in on years of meetings with voldemort inner circle and his parents arguments and discussions allowed draco to comprehend the rush of sound nearly as naturally as regular hearing just donttell harry about this okay granger whispered to weasley as they turned and went down the stairs draco following cautiously able to hear everything the two girls said donttell harry what about ron you know your boyfriend i going to tell ron i just i have to break it to him gently herm there is no way to gently say i fancy professor snape and i cheating on you it a scientific impossibility draco nearly tripped and went flying down the stairs granger fancied snape how when what you know i didntmean to cheat on ron gin we were so upset and we got so drunk we were you know before we realized what we were doing drunk we draco thought in awe what the hell he knew snape had gotten trashed but granger little miss goody two shoes but the fact remains you re going to dump him dump ron for snape ginny said shuddering ginny i not going to date snape i just i cantkeep seeing ron when i so attracted to snape it not right ew ginny muttered that all i have to say ew hermione smiled i know it weird for you but if you could have been there do not finish that sentence ginny shuddered excuse me for a second herm i have to go vomit now ha ha i have to go vomit now too draco mumbled he realized with a start that the girls were headed for snape private office oh sick ginny wait outside okay hermione said draco heard a door opening and closing ginny sighed and murmured god how could she do this twice and this time she sober hello professor hermione purred inside snape office silencio she yelled and draco cursed now unable to hear anything inside the room he d heard enough though it would take a while but if he kept tailing granger and snape he would soon have enough blackmail material for anything he wanted hello professor hermione said her voice low and seductive snape raised his eyebrows too stunned to try and come up with a logical explanation then she whirled around cast a silencing charm on the door and promptly started laughing her head off hmm finally gone round the bend have you snape said dryly or did draco toy with your pumpkin juice again hermione straightened up getting control of herself i sorry professor i just well we ve set a plan for revenge into motion really do tell snape said curiously well the thing is i sure it something you re not going to like we can carry it off without your help but it would be a lot better if we had you on our side uh oh snape muttered tell me um heh well harry had this idea if malfoy thought you and i were conspiring against him together he d be beyond freaked out right she stammered true snape said slowly along the same train of thought what would freak malfoy out even more than that you re not suggesting it wouldntbe anything major she said hurriedly just like we let malfoy overhear us saying a few choice phrases snape thought about it for a long while and finally started laughing that disgusting but it brilliant an ongoing prank and meanwhile we can attack draco in several other ways exactly hermione said grinning so you ll do it snape nodded and hermione sagged in relief whew excellent do you have any ideas we re sending word to our contacts but it ll take awhile to receive the response naturally and ginny making a list of people we could call in for reinforcements sending word to your contacts reinforcements snape repeated you sound like you re planning some covert mission for a war i am hermione said firmly malfoy messed with the wrong person her fingers twitched as though she longed to throttle him which she did she took a deep breath to calm herself anyway what i meant is we sent owls to the weasley twins and stuff did you write to sirius black snape said smiling evilly well yes hermione admitted cringing snape and sirius still avidly hated each other to her surprise snape merely laughed in a purely evil way well i ve got a prank you re not going to hear from him he kept laughing so much that hermione took a nervous step backwards uncertain of what to think it was a long while before he stopped and began to tell her what he was talking about and the two of them laughed themselves sick as snape related the prank from why and how he d done it to the aftermath two hours after hermione arrived in snape office she finally remembered ginny oh my god i ve got to get going ginny outside guarding your door why exactly is weasley guarding my door snape asked confused well malfoy followed us down here eavesdropping so we made him think that why you cast a silencing charm snape said realization dawning so that draco wouldnthear what we were really saying and would think what exactly did you say earlier that draco overheard he asked his eyes narrowing suspiciously um see y you dontwant to know professor hermione stammered blushing furiously and half running to the door bye wait snape called stepping over to her he quickly started messing up her hair she stood there in shock for a moment dumbfounded what are you doing hermione demanded when she d regained her wits feeling beyond strange even though she d formed a sort of odd truce with the once hated potions master it was still way too weird to have him playing with her hair like he was harry or ron or ginny it for show snape explained in case draco sees you on the way back oh duh hermione good idea she said rearranging her robes and shirt for effect good snape said stepping back and looking her over appraisingly remember to smile and look happy on your way back he paused frowning dear lord this is unbelievably bizarre yup hermione agreed with a sigh the two of them stood there awkwardly for a moment not looking at each other then snape frowned and glared at her five points from gryffindor he barked at her suddenly what hermione demanded startled what for nothing it just makes me feel better snape said smiling coldly as she glowered at him it good to know that prank war or not i still an evil slytherin bastard chapter thirty nine brilliant harry dean seamus neville and ginny stood rather still staring openmouthed at hermione with odd expressions what hermione asked it a good plan guys it ll work of course it will draco said already relishing the look soon to be on ron face luna who had paused on their journey to the broom shed to examine a rock that looked rather like a finnish mimic wandered over at last and looked from the gaping gryffindors to hermione and draco even luna registered shock at their appearance hermione and draco were both half dressed and covered in dirt cuts grass leaves and twigs with their hair sticking out wildly and their mouths fixed in cheerful smiles hovering a few feet behind them was an acromantula as big as ginny wrackspurt got you luna asked looking concerned and sympathetic what draco said looking around nervously no we re fine hermione said with a smile i not sure they are though she nodded at harry and the others they haventsaid a word and they wontstop staring at me funny we i harry shook his head as if to knock his thoughts out of his ears hermione are you cooperating with malfoy we made a truce harry hermione said with a shrug it no big deal we still hate each other draco added harry chanted something under his breath that sounded like the dreams arentreal the dreams arentreal but neither hermione nor draco appeared to hear him so none of us should read anything into the fact that you two are happily working together after spending an hour alone in the forest and emerging with only half your clothes luna asked of course not hermione said promptly looking horrified draco did as well is that why you all look like you ve seen a ghost she demanded of dean seamus neville harry and ginny oh come on draco said grinning i d never do anything like that with her i mean she did try to seduce me for a minute there but i told her that i prefer my women a little more virtuous and a whole lot better looking and she backed off hermione turned to glare at him her wand held high gee malfoy want me to show you what an acromantula looks like when it poisoning someone oh now look i ve offended her again draco said with a gusty sigh i sorry granger i canthelp it if i prefer girls from good families who dontsleep around know how to use a hairbrush and realize that there life outside the library and i canthelp it if i tell everyone i meet how terrified you are of the forest hermione waved her arms and assumed a mocking scared expression making her voice sound high and panicky murderous centaur murderous centaur let me hide behind the muggle born girl who can kick my butt in every single class i hope she can save me because i dontthink i can outrun the centaur especially since i tired because i already ran like a terrified four year old from the big bad spider draco swelled indignantly and then tilted his head to the side his hands clamped to his cheeks in a mockery of grief oh woe is me i hermione granger my boyfriend doesntlike me because i a lying tramp let me just sob hysterically for a while in the middle of a forest filled with dangerous creatures i think we were worried about nothing ginny muttered to the others i d say so harry said watching them bicker with a slight grin hey ginny said loudly stepping forward if you two are through we should get on with this you two should take luna you might need a spare wand and i dontknow what the twins did with malfoy s good idea hermione said turning away from draco contemptuously trying to disguise the fact that she couldntthink of a comeback i ll tell luna on the way you can fly right luna she nodded okay does everyone know what to do there was a general murmur of assent make me proud guys let go dean neville seamus harry and ginny headed off towards the castle hermione turned to the broom shed raised her wand and blew the door off the hinges harry and ginny are dead wrong fred insisted come on you lot remember us we re the masters of practical joking not them if we say there a prank about to go down there a prank about to go down george added the crowd of gryffindors that had returned to the common room from the grounds eyed the twins suspiciously it doesntmatter anyway said one of ginny roommates with a slightly sullen air we d get caught if we left again now it too close to curfew muttering irritably the gryffindors turned towards their rooms before anyone had gone far however a first year by the window pointed out to the grounds and yelled look there was a mad scramble for the windows a dazzling display of light and color lit up the path to hagrid s turning the whomping willow shades of bright pink and orange fred george and ron exchanged uneasy glances they had sent everyone outside in the hopes that hermione and draco would be seen leaving the forest and therefore be incredibly humiliated this wasntat all what they d expected d you think that her ron muttered quietly could be fred said but i doubt it maybe it just another prank a coincidence george suggested but i doubt it fred repeated the portrait hole swung open and everyone in the common room turned to look as dean seamus ginny harry and neville came in all covered in globs of some sticky substance the same color as the lights below all right i admit it harry said heavily i was wrong there was a huge explosion neville said his eyes wide as though in awe who did it someone called from the crowd by the window harry shrugged no idea tell us everything lavender said pushing her way through the others to reach harry i need a shower first harry said firmly and he headed for the boys dormitory with dean seamus and neville while ginny went to her own room this doesntlook good fred said darkly it ll work ron said firmly if anyone else sees those lights they might head down there and check it out and run into her and if nothing else george said thoughtfully we could always just do this to them again now there a thought fred said with a grin harry threw open the dormitory window hermione and draco were floating on a broomstick just outside it the acromantula still floating above them luna was just behind them humming quietly while playing with her butterbeer cork necklace got the cloak hermione asked in low urgent tones neville ran up behind harry holding up the silvery invisibility cloak all right hermione said tersely stand back hermione directed the spider in through the window and steered it carefully onto ron bed before flipping it over looking disgusted and reluctant but still determined harry took the cloak and flung it over the spider then he picked up his trunk which had been repacked and tapped it with his wand to shrink it here he said handing the book sized trunk to hermione stick this in the guest room for me eh all right hermione said giving him an apologetic look she handed him ron things which she d grabbed from the guest room by flying in through the window on her way up harry returned them to their rightful size and place by ron bed everyone ready for phase two yeah dean seamus neville and harry chorused okay then go for it harry checked one last time to make sure that the acromantula was completely invisible before turning to the door the four guys headed back downstairs this really is brilliant draco said gleefully rubbing his hands together and then putting them back on the broom when hermione yelped thanks hermione said in surprise i wasntcomplimenting you draco snapped whatever rolling her eyes hermione turned to luna if it okay with you luna you d best head back to your own common room we probably shouldntlet ron know you re involved and you ll need a good alibi all right luna said serenely do tell me how it turned out we ll give you a full report hermione promised and luna flew off towards the west side of the castle so what now ron wondered aloud just as harry dean seamus and neville burst back into the common room looking terrified guys harry hissed sending a quick look around the room to make sure that no one was watching hermione and malfoy are in the dormitory looking murderous they re destroying your stuff hermione keeps growling about you three make her stop dean added angrily i think she destroyed my west ham poster and my mimbulus mimbletonia neville whimpered she really angry fred and george were already on their way to the stairs ron right behind shooting a triumphant look at dean seamus and neville harry signaled to ginny who was hiding on the girls dormitory staircase the four boys followed the twins and ron ginny sneaking along behind flinging open the door to the seventh years room fred and george burst inside intending to confront or perhaps gloat over hermione ron pushed his way past them looking around where is she ron demanded turning back to the door just as harry pulled it shut harry what colloportus harry shouted and the door sealed with a squelching noise george grabbed the handle and yanked but to no avail he gave up rather quickly however when another voice floated in from the window accio cloak something large and dark came into view on ron bed but the three weasleys had fixed their attention on the window hermione was clutching harry invisibility cloak and floating on a broomstick outside the window draco sitting behind her both of their faces shining victoriously hi boys hermione said with a purely terrifying smile rather like one carrie would have made if she d smiled after the pig blood had been dropped at the prom she raised her wand once more pointing it at ron bed exsuscito the three boys whipped around their eyes widening in horror as they caught sight of the four foot tall spider now clicking its pincers at them pushing itself up on its eight legs payback time boys hermione called cheerfully then yanked the window shut as the acromantula attacked and the screaming began we pranked fred and george dean whispered in awe looking dazed we ll go down in history for this not if we dontget away with it neville said nervously so what happens now seamus asked grinning as they listened to the screaming phase three harry reminded him dean seamus neville you know what to do ginny with me mcgonagall sighed as she approached the seventh floor she had been attempting to weasel answers out of albus severus had disappeared again and no one seemed to know where he d gone if albus knew he wasnttelling and she was pretty sure that was the case she figured she d pick up severus trail in the morning for now she was going back to her private quarters for some rest as she neared the top of the stairs she caught sight of dean seamus and neville racing down them longbottom she yelled and neville spun and nearly fell seamus grabbed his arm to steady him finnigan thomas where do you think you re going this late to get you dean gasped breathing hard the door to our dormitory is sealed and we can hear ron inside it screaming with a couple of other people there another weird noise but we re not sure what it is mcgonagall moved passed them and headed for gryffindor tower leaving the three boys to catch their breath on the stairs they were on the verge of collapse seeing as how they d run up to the tower from the grounds up seven flights of the boys stairs down the stairs up them again and down them again before reaching the seventh floor corridor what have they done now mcgonagall muttered to herself picturing poppy reaction to admitting potter weasley and granger to the hospital wing yet again along with malfoy probably poppy was already in a bad temper at the moment considering that severus new personality transplant meant he lived in some alternate reality where he wasntsupposed to be brewing potions for poppy to help with things like flu season mcgonagall stalked past the crowd of gryffindors in the common room and up the stairs without sparing much thought for why they were all staring fixedly out the windows as she neared the top of the staircase frantic shouts reached her ears argh help i hate spiders i ll kill you all sighing mcgonagall raised her wand and cast a spell to discover the door enchantments colloportus a moment later the counter spell was cast and the door swung open to reveal a comical but frightening scene fred george and ron weasley were running about like chicken little during an apocalypse firing spells around the room at a small acromantula who was chasing them about rasping out death threats as it clicked its pincers hungrily the jets of multicolored light from the spells made the room look like a discoth que gone horribly wrong kill it kill it i dontknow how why didnti pay more attention to hagrid you will all die horribly for this mcgonagall crouched low and aimed at the spider underside stupefy the three boys stopped running as the spider fell over looking around in relief and shaking badly the front of ron robes were actually quite wet as though he d had an accident their eyes fell on the professor thank you fred wailed running forward and throwing his arms around her followed quickly by his two brothers thank you thank you thank you oh we forgive you for the singing george said get off for heaven sake get hold of yourself mcgonagall barked thoroughly nonplussed they stepped back hastily does someone want to tell me what happened here it was hermione fred exclaimed immediately and malfoy and harry and ginny and probably dean seamus and neville how exactly did this happen that an acromantula one would have to go into the forbidden forest to secure one of those er then that what they must ve done fred said quickly mcgonagall raised a suspicious eyebrow but said nothing harry ginny dean seamus and neville came in and they all went to their rooms but harry dean seamus and neville came back down and said hermione was in here trashing the place and we ran up to stop her and harry locked us in and the spider was under harry cloak so we couldntsee it george added hermione was on a broomstick outside the window and she used her wand to summon the cloak off the spider and then she and malfoy flew off and ron began then suddenly turned away and retched violently do you have any proof mcgonagall asked well hermione and draco looked like they d been in the forest fred said slowly they had dirt and leaves all over themselves mcgonagall sighed to the hospital wing all of you i not certain but i believe acromantulas can spit poison you might have been infected at the very least you look like you could use a calming draught i ll go find hagrid and deal with miss granger and mr potter the three of them nodded and still trembling headed back downstairs mcgonagall cast a binding spell on the spider just in case and then headed for the guest room love and bunnies she called at the wall as it slid open she cast a stern look at the students in the common room to make sure no one followed then approached the portrait password the painting asked prank war all teachers were privileged to every password in the castle sorry it was just changed having no idea what the new password was she instead elected to use the password given personally to the professors for just such a situation which would open any password protected wall and was assigned by dumbledore catwoman she said heavily right professor the portrait swung open mcgonagall looked around there were the two beds standing a few feet from each other both unmade hermione and draco were sitting at the table yelling at each other books scattered between them loser know it all wimp freak idiot granger malfoy the two of them turned from their heated argument and looked around at mcgonagall professor hermione said in surprise is something wrong what do you know about the acromantula in weasley dormitory mcgonagall barked what an acromaculad draco asked there an acromantula in ron dormitory hermione repeated in alarm is he all right he fine mcgonagall said suspiciously badly shaken but fine he hates spiders hermione said worriedly are you sure he okay weasley hates spiders draco said gleefully what a wimp hey hermione ready to go to sleep said harry coming out of the bathroom in his bathrobe he stopped at the sight of mcgonagall professor what going on what are you doing in here mcgonagall asked i ve been staying in here harry said with a shrug sleeping on the couch and keeping hermione company she fights with malfoy too much if i not here to fight with him for her the weasley twins claim that you set an acromantula loose in your dormitory what why would i do that harry spluttered i hate acromantulas call me crazy but ever since they tried to kill me i ve steered clear of them how did it get in the dormitory that what i d like to know mcgonagall said they claim miss granger and mr malfoy flew up to the window on a broomstick but i hate flying hermione exclaimed tell me about it draco muttered sourly i wouldntfly all the way up here that would scare me to death ask anyone professor wood knows and madam hooch and i never getting back on a broom with her again draco said darkly are are you sure it wasntone of the twins hermione asked tentatively ron told me the reason he hates spiders is because fred turned his teddy bear into a spider once maybe it was their way of pranking him you know how they are mcgonagall knew that made perfect sense but she also knew it was certain that the three people in front of her were the culprits i suppose all three of you can account for your whereabouts this evening she inquired the ghost of a smile on her lips malfoy and i have been here all afternoon hermione said also smiling slightly i told ron i wanted to go research the chain more in the library time running out before christmas harry just got back from his detention he was covered in some strange globs of paint or something and he went straight for the shower we ll let you know if we hear anything though harry said i sure you will mcgonagall said with a small laugh now then you three wouldnthappen to know where severus is would you no harry said with a sigh after my detention i saw him heading for hogsmeade though and i followed him but he apparated as soon as he was past the winged boars so he probably wasntgoing to hogsmeade mcgonagall said thoughtfully all right then he must be going to visit a friend who lives farther away snape has friends harry blurted out yes mcgonagall said with a slight smile he may be a rude overgrown bully but even rude overgrown bullies have friends kind of like malfoy hermione said thoughtfully before she could stop herself hey draco growled if you ll excuse me mcgonagall said turning to leave with a grin i ve the matter of this acromantula to sort out i also need to inform albus that you three have alibis and couldntpossibly have been involved oh and by the way if you re going to put dangerous creatures in your friends beds try to make sure they arentpoisonous wontyou sorry hermione said sheepishly mcgonagall chuckled you really do remind me of myself at your age miss granger mcgonagall said then turned and left she she knows she knows and she not going to punish us draco breathed looking scandalized and indignant doesntsurprise me hermione admitted after all she figured out the quidditch goalpost prank she knew it was you draco shouted of course she did she helped pull off the same prank on my dad when he was seventeen harry said with a smirk looks like we ve gotten away with this too hermione said with a yawn now come on i ve got to get some sleep i exhausted the three of them headed to the bathroom hermione checked her hair again and discovering that she d missed a few twigs with her cleaning spells she insisted on getting in the shower wearily harry drew up a chair and draco summoned one from the bedroom the chairs he could conjure had a tendency to dump the user maliciously so what do you think of this snape having friends thing harry called to hermione over the noise of the shower now that i think of it there no reason he wouldnthave friends hermione said he may be a jerk to us but he nice to the slytherins of course he has friends draco said with a snort a lot of them actually you knew that harry demanded of course i did he was close with my father draco replied my father had connections all over the world and snape was part of his circle of friends my mother always said snape was one of her favorite people and fudge was fond of him too and obviously they re great judges of character harry muttered sarcastically rubbing the faint outline of the scar umbridge had forced him to cut into his hand snape could be going anywhere from london to australia draco continued with a yawn hurry up in there would you granger hermione shut off the water and reached for her towel we should make a list of everyone he knows friends acquaintances not tonight harry complained i tired in fact we should leave it for a few more days i thought we were going to try to research the chain and see if we could get it off before christmas yeah draco grumbled i dontwant that filthy mudblood in my h ow oops harry said innocently you re right hermione said loudly trying to stop another fight we ve got a lot of research to do and i exhausted it ll have to wait why does it even matter draco demanded after the cheese spirit incident he rather felt the snape mess was best left alone it well arentyou curious hermione asked emerging from the shower dried and dressed in her nightgown not really draco said bluntly i d just as soon ignore it so he acting weird so what harry and hermione frowned that just not the way it works hermione said loftily excuse me but dontyou think you re a bit old to be forming some cheesy detective club draco retorted i mean come on it none of our business if he gone a bit funny a bit harry repeated incredulously he lost his frigging mind let talk about it tomorrow hermione said interrupting draco we re all tired and we ve got a lot of books to read if we want to have any hopes of removing this chain and there the small matter of ron retaliation harry pointed out a very small matter draco said derisively let hope so harry muttered we re talking major mayhem here they have to die for this fred growled angrily humiliation factor just gone up we re talking every person on the planet gonna see this george added darkly what are we going to do ron asked shakily oh we know exactly what we re going to do fred said so tell me not in the hallway you idiot anyone could be listening dean seamus and neville had just started back up the steps when they heard fred george and ron approaching talking in loud pissed off voices phase four neville whispered and dean and seamus nodded what are you lot doing down here fred demanded glaring at them as he rounded the corner with his brothers after harry tried to open the door we went to find mcgonagall neville explained looking worried are you guys all right what happened tried to open the door george demanded he the one who sealed it shut harry wouldntdo that dean said frowning he cast about fourteen spells on it before telling us to go get mcgonagall while he kept trying you expect us to believe that ron demanded what d you mean seamus asked we were trying to help mate did mcgonagall get to you in time you werenthurt the three weasleys looked at each other fred nodded grudgingly i dontsuppose they would have gone for her if they were in on it he said they re probably telling the truth of course we are neville said indignantly harry might be our friend but you are too what do you think we d hear you screaming hysterically and not try and do something seamus asked thanks ron said gratefully i going to kill hermione how could she she knows i dontlike spiders if it hadntbeen us it would have been a bloody good prank george said grudgingly i wish we d have thought of it we ve already thought of something better fred reminded him now come on i ve got to get hagrid before that thing wakes up before any of them could take a step however a loud inhuman screeching met their ears what now ron moaned just as a giant pink and orange beast flew round the corner straight at him argh the three weasleys took off screaming for the second time in less than an hour leaving dean seamus and neville behind the three of them grinned as the flying monster chased ron fred and george around and around the seventh floor hermione really is brilliant dean said appreciatively as he seamus and neville stood back to watch yeah neville said who else would have thought to cover pig in that magical paint of hers and set him loose in the castle chapter forty ron retaliation the gigantic multicolored pig wasntstopped for nearly an hour by which time everyone in gryffindor tower had taken to watching from the portrait hole once they were alerted to the event by fred george and ron screams and the ravenclaws were doing likewise in their tower on the west side of the castle dean seamus and neville were unable to make it back through the seventh floor corridor or rather they were unwilling to risk life and limb to try and exhausted as they were had fallen asleep on the stairs neville snores drowned out by pig squawking and the weasleys screaming unfortunately mcgonagall was currently at hagrid hut as hagrid was the only staff member with experience with acromantulas so she was unaware of the situation it was trelawney who put a stop to it she emerged from her lodgings in north tower wearing her dressing gown and looking thoroughly annoyed to find the weasleys howling hysterically and pig twittering along behind as though he thought they were all playing some demented game of tag she went straight for the headmaster once dumbledore subdued the overgrown owl and returned it to its proper color he was forced to send someone else down to fetch hagrid from hogsmeade and a few groups of students from the gryffindor and ravenclaw common rooms to catch the twins and ron who were still running around and around the seventh floor in a panic at last a slightly tipsy hagrid was leaving with pig on a leash and the acromantula slung over a shoulder the three weasleys were escorted to the hospital wing by a few prefects and everyone was sent back to bed at which point lavender brown the patil twins and a few other girls cornered neville before he could get to the portrait hole and began the process of threatening him to extract information neville caved rather quickly tired as he was and before long he began telling the story with gusto relishing the girls impressed even admiring looks by morning the story was that hermione and draco had been stranded in the forest and had returned fire with the help of harry and ginny leaving out the names of neville dean seamus and luna had been a condition of neville when finally saying he d tell the girls everything and they kept their word hoping for more inside information in the future to the disappointment of fred george and ron no one seemed to think there was much credit to be given regarding their prank on hermione and draco but everyone agreed that the spider and the owl had been absolutely brilliant madam pomfrey normally would have kept the three boys for at least twenty four hours upon hearing that they d been attacked by an acromantula and a cursed owl but she was so tired of the frequent sight of ron and so nonplussed by the twins cameo that she sent them all back first thing in the morning after giving them a quick but thorough once over ron attempted to get through to the guest room only to discover that the password had been changed and he marched angrily back up to his dormitory cautiously opened the door and found his things back at the foot of his bed while harry were missing a fact he hadntnoticed while running from the spider the message harry and hermione were sending was clear when do we strike next ron asked his brothers flinging himself on his bed after checking to be sure that everyone else had left for breakfast er the twins looked at each other well said fred last night after you fell asleep we got to talking and we think it d be best if we left now what ron bellowed well we re arousing suspicion you know bull you re just scared of getting pranked again us scared ha of course we re not scared george insisted but he didntquite look sincere listen we ll help you pull off the retaliation prank and then we ll leave that way by the time it sets in no one will suspect you because you ll have an alibi and we ll be back in diagon alley fred continued after that well our little friend knows what to do come monday morning he grinned evilly the prank going to take a good long while to wear off especially since it difficult to remove without an antidote and snape run off again pomfrey doesnthave any either george added we checked when we were in the hospital wing odd considering it something that she had to treat you for she had to bring it up from snape office when i got hit with it ron said i remember her saying that some magic is so advanced that she asks snape to hang on to a lot of its antidotes as her cabinet space is crowded and it rare that anyone inside hogwarts would get hit with a spell or swallow a potion that we werenttaught about in class that good then fred said all right you stay here or better yet go to the common room or the library then people will see you and be able to confirm you couldntpossibly have done it how are you going to avoid being seen ron asked suspiciously fred went over to a small suitcase he d brought over from his home and pulled out two headless hats we ll put these on and hit them from the hall then even if someone sees us they wontbe able to identify us we re not going to leave through the front door we re going to take the secret passage into honeydukes we ve already nicked some robes from the laundry george added pulling them out of his own suitcase and stuffing them into his jacket this way we ll look like students hang on ron said slowly how are they going to know who it is if we re being so careful to avoid being seen they ll know fred promised harry hermione and malfoy arentgoing to have any doubt and we re hoping to pass it along from them although a lot of people will probably figure it out on their own what about ginny no trust us about ginny george said sparing ginny could be a really good move on our part fred added besides which it ll be even more hysterical if someone close to them is unaffected yeah then they ll be running around trying to sort it out okay ron said standing up this better be as good a prank as you say it will be oh dontworry fred said his eyes glinting evilly no one will forget this for a good long while harry hermione and draco were once again sitting at the gryffindor table with their wands out joined by neville as he too was trying to avoid gossip hounds after revealing last night secrets and ginny and luna both of whom were listening raptly to the dramatic tales regarding the newest installment in the prank war it was rather early on a sunday to be at breakfast only a few small groups of students sat at each table and the teachers had yet to show up most of them were becoming increasingly ragged as the prank war progressed harry hermione draco ginny neville and luna were having a blast hyped up on laughter and the events of the previous evening even with the low attendance there was still plenty of noise in the great hall to cover their conversation and few people bothered them most everyone was used to the fact that harry hermione draco and ginny werentgoing to be giving away any information and everyone was too busy discussing their own versions of the most recent pranks or planning the upcoming holidays to consider badgering harry and the others so the six of them had a long lighthearted talk over their breakfast all of them in great spirits even draco while the four gryffindors and luna werentexactly friendly to him they werentignoring him and they laughed occasionally when he related something particularly funny he didnteven care that a lot of these moments had him as the butt of the joke it was enough for him to be acknowledged and even though he couldntstand any of them he felt a surge of relief that at least he was no longer going to be bored out of his skull by a lack of interactive conversation he wasnthappy but it was an improvement and he couldnthelp but feel good when he imagined the horror ron must have felt during the acromantula incident so how did you know it was ronald who stranded you in the forest luna asked with interest what do you mean how did we know it was ron of course it was him the evidence fits hermione said that doesntmean he did it luna said calmly evidence can be misleading trust us luna harry said it was him luna shrugged smiled in her distinctly not quite there manner and took her leave why do you hang out with her draco asked curious rather than condescending she quite lovely once you get to know her hermione said but her tone suggested that she didntalways think so now where were we the part where you set off the explosion out on the grounds ginny said eagerly and they resumed the talk of the prank there was no warning save a flash of light caught out of the corner of the eye striking harry in the side of the head the moment it hit hermione was on her feet but the second spell got her squarely in the face before she could draw her wand and the third struck draco protego ginny shouted leaping up from her seat under cover of her shield charm but she only caught a glimpse of two headless figures in school robes before the culprits vanished up the marble staircase realizing they d be long gone before she could get to the doors and it would be useless to try and catch them she turned instead to harry hermione and draco are you all right she asked in concern the three of them stared at her blankly then as one they all burst out laughing ginny and neville looked at each other nervously then back at harry hermione and draco as they cackled like hyenas what so funny neville asked uncertainly this seemed to make them laugh harder for a very long time they continued to laugh loudly until quite a few people in the vicinity were staring that funny hermione yelled pointing at ginny wildly whacking harry upside the head on accident ow harry said through his laughter and hermione and draco pointed at him and laughed harder i hate you draco yelled suddenly still laughing and pointing at harry i hate you too harry gasped as though this was some sort of revelation about the things they had in common the three finally ceased their laughter looking at each other with wide eyes we hate each other draco agreed nodding seriously hermione suddenly threw an arm around harry shoulders and her other around draco s let hate each other together okay we re a team now harry added happily yes we re a team of of draco frowned and harry and hermione followed suit well we re a team draco finished with a shrug brightening is do you think wow neville said casting a suspicious glance behind him at luna remembering her hysterical mirth at one of ron jokes on the train before fifth year harry hermione and draco began rocking from side to side we re a teeeeaaamm hermione sang a team of people who um hate each other we need a name harry announced like like um fantastic four is already taken hermione said sadly plus there only three of us harry agreed i ve got it draco exclaimed we ll call ourselves the gobstones club er i think that taken too harry said apologetically yes but there arenttoo many people in the gobstones club draco countered we could beat them all up and make them give up their name yeah harry and hermione yelled by now most of the great hall was watching them curiously save the members of the gobstones club who were looking nervous and wondering if they should run for it or not i really getting sick of the prank war ginny said with a sigh it may be funny but i rather sick of the backlash hermione gasped in shock but the prank war is awesome yeah it is draco insisted hermione and draco looked at harry expectantly sorry i with ginny he said sheepishly oh hermione said turning back to ginny with a broad smile her arms still around draco and harry shoulders want to be on our team gin she asked squeezing the two guys closer to her they grinned up at her stupidly no thanks ginny said dryly i want to figure out just what you guys got hit with well you re not gonna draco yelled i ll be all sad and moping again if you fix me and i ll be not really caring ginny said i think you ve been cursed with that same spell the death eaters used on ron in the department of mysteries the one that made him go all funny and summon that brain that tried to kill him neville asked in alarm ginny nodded grimly so this is probably ron fault somehow she ignored the instant reaction to this as various people looked at each other in excitement she knew she had just given ron a lot of credit amongst the other students but she was pretty sure that she could keep it from getting out of hand well let go kill him harry said as though suggesting they go for a walk around the lake yeah hermione and draco shouted before anyone could stop them they were running out of the hall cackling once more wait ginny exclaimed starting to follow them she tripped in her haste and nearly pitched headfirst into the platters of food neville quickly reached out to steady her cursing ginny looked up harry hermione and draco were gone this probably isntgoing to end well ginny said in the ensuing silence she sighed as whispers broke out all over the hall are you with me neville she asked neville nodded of course i am then get ready this is really going to suck oliver stretched his arms over his head yawning widely as he headed for the door he would still make it to breakfast if he was lucky as soon as he pulled open his door strange shouts met his ears he looked around just in time to see harry hermione and draco running along the corridor all of them with their arms outstretched as they screamed whee happily like children taking their first broom ride they grinned gleefully as their robes flapped about them oliver blinked trying to process this new strange event through his early morning fog when he couldntquite manage it he simply stepped back and shut and bolted the door today was going to be one of those days and that meant he had to do one very important thing hide everything was bright and shiny and new for hermione the castle was so pretty why hadntshe noticed it before probably because she d been so sad but now she was happy everything was so funny she felt like she was being tickled by some invisible creature she felt like she was floating before she knew it she was running with her arms flung outward racing down the corridors her robes flying behind her whee she yelled draco and harry copied her i flying hermione shouted i peter pan me too said draco no you re wendy hermione said angrily i peter but peter was cooler draco whined stopping hermione turned to face him as he pouted harry helpfully ran around them in circles you re more of a captain hook hermione said gently you re you re not a peter pan type no fair draco stamped his foot i never get to be the good guy it always oh let do something evil cuz i not peter i the dude who gets eaten by an alligator crocodile harry corrected cheerfully as he wheeled round them again narrowly missing a suit of armor which leaned out of the way just in time i dont wanna get eaten by a crocodile i wanna save the world and be all happy but no i have to be the good little death eater son it no fair sometimes i get tired of being evil it not easy you know everybody hates me cept the slytherins and a lot of them dontlike me too now i donteven have a lot of nifty connections in the ministry cuz my dad had to broadcast the fact that he a friggin lunatic before the idiot got himself killed i wanted to save the world you know that why i tried to be potter friend at first i wanted to be in the in crowd wanted all that glory wanted everyone to say hey look there goes that kid who saved the world but no i m i m captain hook and then draco did the unthinkable draco began to sob there there hermione said unable to fathom what exactly was going on captain hook is a perfectly good character to be hermione thought except for that whole evil guy who dies thing oh wait realization dawning she patted him on the head you re not going to die malfoy at least not for a very long time i going to die draco yelped looking up in a panic no i just said you re not going to die silly you re gonna live but you re a bad guy it okay to be a bad guy if there werentbad guys who would the good guys kill you re going to kill me draco yelped louder no well i dontthink so anyway we only ever kill people who are going to try to take over the world and kill muggles and muggle borns cuz you know well i sure there a very good reason why we do that we um it just what we do so we re not going to kill you um not unless you are going to try to take over the world and kill people and stuff you re not are you no draco sniffled i was gonna once but then i was all like oh hey the aurors will chop my head off or oh hey prison doesntlook comfy and i was thinking you know it d be nice to not be all associated with the bad guys just because your dad a psycho killer no one would hate you except uh the other evil people it d be real nice to have all that glory you have glory dontyou you even get fan mail letters that say thanks for saving the world what do i get huh no glory no fame just there goes that evil bastard you know what a few weeks ago this really rude first year threw a rock at me and of course i cursed the little bugger and then his friends were all like oh hey you re really bad and i all like no actually i was all like and dontyou forget it you little snots but that wasntwhat i really meant no one ever nice to me you know cept snape and you had to go and shag him and now he gone all crazy i never shagged snape hermione couldntresist saying hesitant as she was to interrupt draco little monologue she was of the belief that if she let him get it all out of his system he d stop his confusing babble and she could go back to running around happily yes you did i have to believe that you shagged him granger because otherwise he just lost his marbles and hated me on his own well pranking him wasntvery nice and he cant hate me on his own no he the only teacher who likes me everyone else hates me you know how hard it going to be for me to get a job after hogwarts very everyone knows i a death eater kid and the ministry wontleave my mom alone they keep coming by to annoy us and glare at us and crabbe and goyle were all sad that they never got to fight in the war because hey you won the war before we could graduate and they keep saying stupid gryffindors ruined our chances for world domination and the dark lord was gonna give us madagascar when he took over and now we re gonna have to get jobs as janitors and i have to nod and smile when they say that even though i know i gonna end up a janitor too and you know what the worse part of life is i bored even the people i consider my friends wontcome near me cuz they re all unhappy i ve gotta sit with you and you know i going insane and i want to save the world i want to be the cool one or at least rule madagascar but no you had to go and save the world first how rude was that well uh you can save it with us next time hermione promised trying to figure out how to placate him it was now completely obvious that draco was just a raving lunatic she couldntreally comprehend most of his ramblings anymore and she really didntsee why he d want to rule madagascar with crabbe and goyle really draco asked petulantly you ll let me save the world um okay and give me all the glory and the fan mail and no jail cell and all that cool stuff we dontsave the world for glory harry said importantly on his thirty ninth lap around hermione and draco we save the world because someone has to be the biggest toughest coolest smartest argh harry cut himself off with a shout as he plunged headfirst into the suit of armor and both armor and harry clattered to the floor in a heap ow he muttered from beneath the armor legs you can save the world hermione repeated figuring it was best to calm draco down and then figure out what he was going on about some other time right now she just wanted to run round and yell whee not deal with some freakish rant that ll be our team new purpose okay every team has to have a purpose you know and a name draco agreed looking quite cheerful again we re the gobstones club hermione said happily at least we will be when we can beat up everyone in the gobstones club and they agree to give us their name right draco said nodding as though this made perfect sense but what ll we call ourselves until then uh the the save the world club hermione suggested okay potter what do you think grand harry said his voice echoing from beneath the armor we re just like superheroes hermione joked weakly wondering when draco was going to start running again she wanted to go have fun superheroes have their own names though dontthey draco said looking as excited as a five year old presented with an ice cream cone can we come up with names i suppose hermione said with a sigh hey guys harry called er could you help me out here this armor kind of heavy chapter forty one general ginny ginny closed her eyes trying to collect herself she was annoyed she was tired she hadntbeen able to sleep after last night escapade and she was sick of the prank war there had always been very few things you could count on to remain constant at hogwarts such as mcgonagall strictness and snape cruelty but even those things had shattered leaving her with a sense that the castle had been turned upside down or perhaps cast into an alternate dimension ginny was becoming more and more upset and chasing after harry and hermione wasntgoing to improve her mood still it was what she had to do given the unspoken laws of friendship which thankfully hadntbeen tossed out the window along with the rest of the universal truths she had to go stop them before they got hurt the charm was most assuredly one of the illegal spells that had been banned decades ago because of the dangerous mind altering effects harry hermione and draco had no judgment right now no sense of limitations which meant that if they got the bright idea to think they could fly without a broom they d race each other to the top of the astronomy tower and jump right off ginny opened her eyes and looked around plans already forming they knew snape was gone again possibly for the weekend and none of the other teachers had arrived that left her with the small group of people who would be willing to help her and able to stop hermione harry and draco if need be the seventh year ravenclaws were all out michael corner wasnttoo fond of ginny and neither were his friends they would help harry in an instant but they wouldnteven acknowledge her existence if she went over to ask them for help that left her with ernie macmillan and his posse of seventh year hufflepuffs hannah abbot justin finch fletchley susan bones and dean seamus neville and luna joy ginny muttered her eyes locking on to dean and seamus neville he looked up at her go get luna please and ask her to help he nodded and hurried towards the ravenclaw table ginny turned around throwing her leg over the bench and nearly knocking over lavender brown who was standing very close behind ginny with the patil twins on either side of her argh ginny shrieked clutching her heart you scared the crap out of me sorry lavender said ginny glowered at the three girls suspiciously wondering what they wanted lavender and the patil twins looked determined and were smiling in a fake and friendly way what ginny asked we want to help you lavender said as though that should be obvious ginny snorted you mean you want an inside scoop on what going on so what if we do padma said challengingly you re gonna need help it a big castle those three could be anywhere and they are for lack of a better phrase extremely high parvati added they could get into a lot of trouble especially given their magic and the fact harry and hermione hate malfoy and vice versa ginny nodded grudgingly she didntwant the three girls to help because anything they saw would be all over the school in a few hours but she needed more than the few people she had she climbed fully off the bench and turned to padma can you get terry michael and anthony to help sure padma said i could get a few more people if you d like no just them why padma asked suspiciously she had started dating michael just before halloween and seemed to be a bit of the jealous type because i only want people i know and to some degree trust with helping harry and hermione ginny said in exasperation and anyone who finds harry hermione and malfoy should know how to handle three highly skilled people who know how to use magic and arentin their right minds in case the three of them decide it may be funny to fling curses so d a members are ideal if you want to help get them and meet me in the entrance hall with that ginny flounced over to the hufflepuff tables ernie was quick to agree to help standing up with his usual pompous air and sounding like a cross between a war general and freddy from scooby doo as he asked his fellow hufflepuffs to join him hannah susan and justin took it in stride while the members of the hufflepuff quidditch team zacharias smith laura madley eleanor branstone kevin whitby and rose zeller rolled their eyes and offered to help as well ginny reluctantly said nothing when the last five offered their help while she disliked smith and laura eleanor kevin and rose were all fourth year and younger she could still use them all she was a tad worried about what would happen if harry hermione and draco got hostile with anyone who saw them and tried to calm them down but she figured the younger ones would be okay if they stayed with older ones all of them followed her to the entrance hall where they were joined by luna and neville who had thought to get seamus and dean as well and lavender parvati padma anthony michael and terry so what wrong with harry hermione and malfoy justin asked curiously i saw them laughing they ve been hit by a euphoria charm ginny said with a shrug at the moment they re currently running around possibly trying to fly off the astronomy tower i jumped off a balcony once after too much firewhisky zacharias smith said pity you lived muttered parvati those that heard her nodded in agreement so they could get hurt rose said her eyes wide yes they could they could also hurt someone else or just generally be a nuisance ginny said on the other hand they might be fine regardless they need to be found and subdued now then i going to check the places they re most likely to be i want luna with me ginny figured that was safest as luna had a tendency to be distracted by odd things when left to her own devices wontthey head straight for gryffindor tower neville asked they said they were going to kill ron i doubt it they ll probably be distracted on their way there when you re drunk you donttend to focus well and i assume they re operating the same way now dean you go up to the astronomy tower check it out and if they re not in it station yourself at the entrance seamus take the gryffindor tower and do the same michael west tower what about the other towers neville asked if they head for dumbledore office he ll stop them it d take a hell of a lot to get hermione or harry anywhere near north tower why asked hannah hermione hates trelawney lavender said which is really unreasonable of her you know trelawney was just being honest regardless ginny cut in not wanting to debate trelawney questionable divination skills at present i doubt they ll go that way dumbledore would stop them if they somehow got into the headmaster tower and they cantget into ravenclaw without the password hermione has it ernie said the head boy and head girl know all the common room passwords then anthony you take ravenclaw tower ginny said with a sigh hannah do the dungeons the same way check them then stand at the entrance susan the basement do the hufflepuff common room and the kitchens how do i get in there she asked tickle the pair on that one painting of fruit now ernie zacharias laura eleanor rose and kevin what happened to d a only padma demanded i leaving them with d a members ginny retorted why kevin asked we re old enough to handle have you ever seen hermione use a curse ginny snapped i have she the smartest person at hogwarts since dumbledore and she fought battles with death eaters you want to try to fight her alone kevin shook his head vigorously everybody now looked distinctly uneasy ginny sighed gustily look time is running out are you guys going to help or not you re really panicking about this arentyou justin said looking somewhat surprised right now harry hermione and draco are wandering around the castle alone three powerful magic users who hate each other and they are basically high when ron was under this charm he went completely psycho and nearly got himself killed there a reason those charms are illegal they make people do crazy potentially dangerous things those charms are illegal lavender asked curiously since 1983 ginny said grimly euphoria charms and potions became so widespread in the sixties and seventies that the accidental magic reversal squad went on strike they got tired of sorting out the mess the ministry was trying to deal with it when st mungo started threatening a strike themselves sick of treating people who took them or crossed paths with people who took them once the ministry got wind of that the wizengamot forced through legislation there are rehabilitation programs for people who are addicted to them there are wards in st mungo full of people who sustained such lasting damage from long term use of them that they cantfunction in society numerous muggles have been injured or had to have their memories modified and my brother bill told me that our parents once went dancing on the hood of a flying airplane after trying an ecstasy draft at a party in the late sixties they were almost sent to azkaban for breaking the statute of secrecy and they would have if it had been after the law was made my father said he broke his leg after trying one luna added and my cousin clara lost an eye while using one she has a very becoming eye patch though this is what we re dealing with ginny said nodding at luna so if you re not going to help me get the hell out of my meeting sorry a few people muttered no one made to leave you six search the grounds ginny continued ernie laura eleanor go one way rose and kevin and zacharias another one group go as far as the forbidden forest the other try and sneak into hogsmeade be careful of filch it a hogsmeade weekend but he likes to catch people going in early if you dontfind anything come back to the entrance hall and wait for susan and hannah when susan and hannah come up to the hall ernie and zacharias can start doing what the rest of us are going to be doing searching the castle we re going to go up floor by floor one of us breaking off on each floor once we ve all checked it and staying by the most common way down to the bottom floor that ll mean susan and hannah are on the ground floor ernie can do first zacharias second terry third parvati fourth padma fifth neville sixth and then dean seamus michael and anthony will all be on the seventh watching out for the towers justin i want you to head for that statue of the one eyed witch and stay by it luna and i will try and cover the rest we ll wander from floor to floor as well it wouldntbe hard for them to sneak into a secret passage you know ernie said moaning myrtle has a soft spot for harry i going to try and get her to rally a few ghosts and see if they ll help luna and i are going be mainly in secret passages too dean seamus anthony and michael you guys take the fastest route to the seventh floor through the secret passages the rest of you take the main corridors what about the teachers rose asked ginny frowned to be honest i not too keen on getting them involved any more than necessary if we can keep them out of this we will all the teachers have been acting odd lately like your campfire with snape lavender said i did not urgh ginny pinched the bridge of her nose and decided to go with what worked yes something like that they ve all gone psycho and i not too thrilled about the idea of asking them for help not to mention the fact that once this goes to a teacher we ll all be kept out of the loop while they take over the searching if you get the third degree though dontlie tell them what up once we ve searched this place well and good if we still dontfind them we ll tell someone but if anyone finds anything well most of us can do patronuses right the former d a members nodded conjure one and tell it to come find me and tell me what you know that should do it now everyone clear there was a general murmur of assent all right then ginny said welcome to life with harry let go the large group scattered dean seamus anthony and michael went straight for a secret passage that would cut out a good deal of time on the journey to the seventh floor you re very good at this luna commented as she and ginny headed for the second floor and moaning myrtle bathroom thanks ginny said dryly but i really wish i didnthave to be at last the suit of armor was off harry it had taken a lot longer to lift it than draco and hermione had thought when beginning the task not only was the armor very heavy but they kept getting distracted parts of the armor kept coming apart and once they got into a playful sword fight with its legs there hermione said as she set the suit head back on its neck upside down the suit hands reached up and put its head right then glared down at her hermione smiled back unfazed now what were we doing thinking up superhero names draco said excitedly what should i call myself erm evil boy hermione suggested it not very commanding harry said hey i know hermione exclaimed evil bastard that what snape called himself once when he was trying to remember that he was still bad even when he was helping us you ll need something to remind you that even though you re going to be saving the world you re still a jackass evil bastard draco mused yeah yeah i like it what about you potter going to go with the boy who lived or something like that nah if i used that everyone would know it was me and then my secret identity would be blown harry said as though this made perfect sense good point draco agreed nodding seriously i going to be the immortal harry continued importantly cuz you know no one ever seems to manage to bump me off but not for lack of trying draco said pouting a little what are you going to be granger the bookworm fine hermione said quickly hoping now they could return to running around and yelling whee we need costumes draco said hermione sighed in disappointment and a vehicle harry said and cool gadgets you ve got some of those haventyou draco asked that cool map and the cloak and who knows what else right let head back to the guest room we can look through our stuff and see what we can come up with harry said cheerfully hermione sighed again suddenly flashing back to the days of muggle childhood when all the girls were playing dumb games involving growing up and getting married and cleaning and all the boys were playing dumb games involving superheroes and construction equipment and toy cars and trucks she d never joined in such games as her mother had brought her up to be against such views of femininity and hermione readily agreed and the boys would never let her play with them and a catchphrase draco said as he and harry started walking towards gryffindor tower and cheesy puns to say when fighting bad guys harry added i never did get to say any of those you know always wanted to though hermione winced as the chain tugged on her arm and she followed draco hoping that now that she was allowed to play the superhero game with the boys things might be half as interesting as running around and yelling whee but for now harry continued stopping and throwing out his arms whee he took off at a dead run hermione and draco happily followed him ginny was starting to perk up luna had agreed to go into the bathroom and talk to moaning myrtle for her ginny while mostly at peace with the chamber of secrets found it a bit too painful to be in or even near the bathroom and she hadntgone inside since fawkes had set her down in it at the end of her first year even passing it brought on a lot of bad memories and nostalgia which she forced down under worries of harry and hermione until luna emerged and reported that moaning myrtle was going to try to help by the time that was settled the first three floors had been cleared and parvati padma and neville were searching the fourth floor ginny and luna proceeded to the fifth and started ducking into a few secret passages at last they headed for the seventh floor planning to see what the guys had found in the towers while they hadntfound harry hermione and draco they were running out of places to look and ginny was starting to feel that things were going to work out with any luck they d simply find them in the seventh year boys room beating ron to pulp both anthony and michael looked out of breath and grumpy when ginny and luna found them saying they d been all through their respective towers and hadntseen any sign of harry hermione or draco owls were all calm too reported an irritated michael corner whose tower encompassed the owlery so i think it safe to say that three people on an acid trip haventgone in there he yawned widely jeez it too early in the morning for this thanks anyway michael luna said serenely ginny simply jerked her head in acknowledgment and walked on ginny dean called coming out of the astronomy tower just as they approached he put his hands on his knees wheezing damn that a tall tower anyway i ve just spoken to professor sinistra and she said she was coming back from the kitchens when she heard someone yelling whee out in the corridors thought it was just a random passer by but it could be them sounds like a nutty thing to do you know i was just going to send word but i dontknow if it them or not thanks ginny called already heading towards seamus i ll see what i can find what so nutty about that luna wondered aloud as she followed ginny i do it all the time then we must be getting close ginny thought smiling at luna fondly she turned the corner to see seamus coming out of the portrait hole i ve been all through the tower he reported proudly though he looked as winded as the other three tower searchers i got a first year to go up through the girls dorms too said she didntsee anyone damn ginny growled she d been certain that they d be in the tower after dean discovery but given how long it would have taken him to come back down after running into sinistra the three of them could be long gone or possibly in the ravenclaw girls dorms michael wouldntbe able to get in there she bit her lip in indecision she could go check the ravenclaw girls dorms herself or go try the nearest floors and hope that harry hermione and draco hadntgone far doing either one could cost her valuable time if she made the wrong choice they d have to split up she could send luna to the girls dorms and hope that luna didntget sidetracked by a pretty butterfly or something and ginny could head down to did you check hermione room luna asked having learned that hermione and draco were staying in the guest room during the acromantula prank no seamus said his eyes widening i didntthink but i dontknow the password ginny smacked her forehead duh i cantbelieve i didntthink of that i ll go i the only one who knows the password besides them you two wait here seamus nodded luna shrugged and ginny turned towards the portrait hole just then however it swung open again and harry leaped out harry thank g harry it was indeed harry but he looked unlike anything they had ever seen he was wearing his snow boots and dragon hide gloves and his invisibility cloak was back over his shoulders like a cape more startling however was the fact that he was shirtless and wearing muggle jeans under a pair of green boxer shorts with snitches on them tied around his eyes underneath his glasses was what looked like one of hermione old scarves that she d knitted during her free the house elves phase with jagged holes cut out for his eyes i am the immortal harry yelled putting his hands on his hips in a classic superman pose psst someone hissed from inside the common room move so i can make my nifty dramatic entrance before ginny seamus or even luna could process the strangeness of this event harry stepped aside and hermione jumped out of the portrait hole as well and i am the bookworm hermione looked as strange as harry if that were possible she too was wearing her boots and gloves with her hogwarts cloak done cape style and had fashioned her mask from another hand knit scarf however her outfit was comprised of yellow capri pants that looked horrible with her boots and a tight yellow sweater under the same red bathing suit that dobby had brought her during the prefects bathroom fiasco crudely taped on the chest of the suit was what looked like the title page to an advanced guide to transfiguration and an unreadable title page was taped to her hand knit cap which was pulled down over her bushy hair as she stepped aside they glimpsed the title page of hogwarts a history on the back of her cloak they didntreally care about that discovery however as draco hopped out just then with a yell of and i am evil bastard ginny blinked her only conscious thought was that was one hell of a euphoria charm draco was wearing a tutu a pink tutu of course ginny was so fixated on the tutu that it took her a moment to notice the rest of him his outfit was a tad different his cloak wasntuniform standard but rather slytherin green and made of some rich satiny material his gloves were also green and his boots were more stylish than functional he was wearing plain gray muggle slacks beneath his tutu and a sweater that may have once been black but had been dyed various shades of orange with what was obviously a badly applied color charm his scarf mask was bright purple and his hair was tied back with what look like a blue scrunchie of hermione s you dontlook very evil you know said luna the first one to recover oh we figured it out draco said nodding seriously see we figure basic black and somber colors are for amateur evil people that why snape been dressing colorfully and why umbridge had that obsession with pink so i colorful where did you get the tutu luna asked curiously hermione transfigured it draco said cheerfully it quite nice luna told him kindly hush hermione admonished draco you ll give away our secret identities secret seamus began faintly yes harry said no one will know that we re really harry potter hermione granger and draco malfoy the world will know us only as the immortal the bookworm and evil bastard we re going to save the world anonymously so no evil reporters hermione said happily we re the save the world club draco yelled thrusting his fists in the air yeah hermione and harry yelled copying him i thought the world was already saved luna said surprised oh no we re going to save it again our first mission is to kill anti spider boy draco told her anti spider boy luna asked yes draco nodded vigorously a redheaded ugly super villain who fears spiders above all other creatures but we shall fight him with our super powers harry who sounded like he was reciting from something threw out his chest i can turn invisible and after a moment of rummaging around on his back he pulled his cloak over him and disappeared beneath it then he poked his head out of the cloak a proud expression on his face see i know everything hermione said she waved her wand over her head and large glowing neon letters appeared in midair spelling the words i know everything and i am evil draco planted his hands on the waistband of his pink tutu and gave an evil mwahaha sort of cackle right ginny said slowly back draco shouted suddenly waving his finger in her face you re anti spider boy sister dontthink your disguise has fooled us for we re the save the world club hermione yelled and i know everything and we wontlet you stop us harry added we re going to kick some serious ass we ll deal with you later hermione said pompously for now it time to kill anti spider boy save the world club away with that the three of them ran off down the corridor leaving seamus and luna to stare after them while ginny gazed blankly into the space they d just vacated but where are they going seamus wondered ron been sitting on the couch in the common room the whole time i saw him they re probably just off to terrorize the rest of the castle ginny said absently shouldntwe go after them luna asked ginny nodded and turned around send word to the others call them back post the hufflepuffs in the entrance hall and make sure they know not to let harry hermione or malfoy out tell the tower boys to go cover all the entrances to the seventh hall so that harry hermione and malfoy cantget back up here you two go down to sixth find the three lunatics and start chasing them force them down to the entrance hall picking up the others as you go you ll be able to trap them between all of you in the entrance hall and you ll get the drop on them if they somehow manage to escape go to professor wood and tell them you need his help and that it about hermione he ll do whatever you ask i counting on you guys seamus and luna nodded conjured their patronuses to send messages on ahead and ran off and ginny turned walked through the portrait hole and headed up for bed she was through with the prank war for now anyway ginny had given a lot to harry ron and hermione and helped them a great deal they were her friends and harry had saved her life but no way in hell was she getting involved with three psychotic people in makeshift superhero costumes chapter forty two neville the ignored voice of reason mcgonagall groaned as she heard the shouts and saw the flashes of light coming up from the entrance hall as she made her way to the marble staircase great more prank war idiocy she made it to the top of the stairs and stopped in her tracks horrified a number of hufflepuffs ravenclaws and gryffindors were gathered in the entrance hall fighting hard against hermione and draco mcgonagall startled by their superhero appearance stared at them for a moment before sweeping her gaze over the rest of the students the patil twins were huddled against a wall both sporting horns out of the top of their heads with green fur out of their faces shivering and watching in terror the hufflepuff quidditch team minus susan bones and ernie macmillan were clustered together near the top of the staircase zacharias smith hiding behind the younger students all of them covered in some sort of blue mud ernie was blocking the doors to the grounds even though no one else including hermione and draco seemed to care much about the doors and shouting imperious commands like duck and get him at justin and susan who were being repeatedly knocked over by disembodied arms and legs which on closer inspection turned out to be harry half hidden under an invisibility cloak running around and yelling whee while attacking dean thomas was lying on the floor not far from ernie obviously under the full body bind and seamus finnigan was hopping around on one foot in a circle and mindlessly yelling quack quack no doubt under the influence of some spell or another michael corner and terry boot were shouting all manner of curses at draco but draco kept yelling protego over and over in between bouts of evil laughter anthony goldstein neville longbottom hannah abbot and luna lovegood were facing off against hermione and failing miserably to make any sort of impression whatsoever away minions of anti spider boy hermione roared waving her wand in a sharp arch anthony and hannah screamed anthony in pain and hannah in terror he crumpled to the ground his skin a fascinating shade of purple and his hands tightly bound by red and gold rope while hannah dropped her wand and ran to hide behind zacharias mcgonagall pulled out her wand and conjured a patronus of her own she couldntleave the hall in the middle of all out battle to use the floo network but she didntthink she was going to be able to slip past to go fetch snape as his quarters were the closest go to the other teachers starting with severus she told it tell them there a battle in the entrance hall between the students it nodded and ran away interestingly enough in the direction of the front doors and right through ernie mcgonagall frowned wondering where it was going before remembering that snape had left last night and if last weekend was any indication wouldntbe back before monday morning draco meanwhile choked on a particularly nasty bit of evil laughter and spluttered then shrugged and kicked terry in the gut he rounded on michael who glared at him defiantly and then took off in the direction of the basement kitchens hermione neville said desperately now that only he and luna stood against her and we all know who would win that fight we dontwant to hurt you we just want to help you hermione raised an eyebrow at him you do yes yes we want to help you um feel better neville said hastily you do hermione repeated i can feel even better than i do right now all right it could be a trick draco warned her wandering over as evil bastard i know all of the deceitful wiles of evil and they re probably trying to trick you to save anti spider boy right hermione said nodding emphatically she turned back to neville and luna neville took a nervous step back while luna smiled at hermione cheerfully if you do indeed want to help us you must swear your allegiance to the save the world club and promise to help us destroy anti spider boy hermione said solemnly okay luna said with a shrug good enough for me draco said nodding and shaking her hand you re in wait hermione said and neville let out an eep and moved back even farther they need costumes and superhero names draco agreed hermione brandished her wand at neville who nearly fainted you she shrieked you shall be clumsy plant man a flash of light and a bang like a gunshot later neville was staring in horror at his brand new tarzan esque loincloth a strap over his shoulder holding it on it was orange and covered in little black triangles a la fred flintstone a wreath of vines encircled his head and his feet were bare even worse than the loincloth in his opinion anyway was that two thick vines that looked astonishingly like devil snare were wrapping around his wrists the ends dangling he held as still as he could which meant he was trembling violently but the vines made no move to strangle him and you hermione said turning to luna but draco tugged on the chain to distract her no no no draco said he needs a catchphrase first oh yeah um able to defeat many an enemy with his extensive knowledge of plants his strangling bracelets of enchanted devil snare and his uncanny tendency to fall over on his victims bit lengthy isntit yeah er clumsy plant man coolest nature lover ever draco nodded that works hermione nodded and waved her wand at luna before anyone could stop her when the light diminished luna was wearing a dress made out of butterbeer corks with straps of drooble wrappers some of the corks on her chest painted orange in the shape of a radish her long hair was teased out to its maximum length so that a two and a half foot blond afro distracted from the odd dress what looked like large stuffed eagle symbol of ravenclaw was perched on top of her straw colored hair on luna feet were pink bunny slippers and some sort of tail protruded from the back of her dress weird but helpful chick hermione explained proudly she scares people away without warning harry partially covered by the cloak slid in between the four students on his back harry hermione cried have you fallen prey to the evil minions of anti spider boy huh harry said oh no i just thought i d see how far i could skid across the tiles he sat up hey twelve feet hermione looked up glancing around where d the rest of them go ran off screaming harry said with a shrug he climbed to his feet and grinned at neville and luna welcome to the club guys neville looked down at his slightly pudgy belly not nearly hidden enough behind the thick strap for the loincloth he whimpered thank you luna said graciously ah the gang all here hermione said happily me and harry and malfoy and we re off to kill ron with the help of neville and luna just like the war wait harry said slowly something not right the outfits neville asked hopefully no that not it harry said waving his hand dismissively i ve got my cloak see outfits are just like they should be hmm ooh ooh i know i know draco said waving his hand enthusiastically like a student dying to impress a teacher it was harry hermione and ron off to kill malfoy i cantkill you hermione said shaking her head sadly not until the chain off i d have to lug you around all day and you re much too heavy oh yeah he patted her shoulder consolingly maybe later then we could dye your hair red though harry said thoughtfully so you d look more like ron and we could dye his hair once we killed him so everyone would think he was you potter i told you no one doing anything to my hair draco said sternly right okay so what missing ginny isnthere luna pointed out helpfully ginny harry and hermione exclaimed smacking their foreheads hermione seemed to think this was a lot of fun as she did it a few more times draco annoyed by the tugging on his wrist this caused grabbed her hand to stop her ginny harry said we ve got to get ginny she a very important part of the attack on anti spider boy who was anti spider boy again draco asked frowning um i forget hermione said apologetically i sure we ll figure it out eventually though ginny will help she good at that except when there lemon drops involved let go get her harry yelled he dove back under the cloak a moment later an invisible arm was flung around neville shoulders and another around luna s stumbling slightly the three toddled up the suitcase hermione and draco following leaving the mass of fallen students behind mcgonagall stared at them as they came towards her now was her chance to stop them to to fix whatever was wrong with them but as the hufflepuffs formerly huddled on the stairs ran past her fearfully she held back as the three gryffindors draco and luna came closer she made no move to raise her wand my patronus isntback yet with the other teachers they were coming closer hermione waved after all someone has to get the students up to poppy hi professor called harry disembodied voice i could always tell dumbledore i didntthink it wise to attack them myself they did kill voldemort after all and then they were past mcgonagall burst out laughing by the time she stopped they were gone and she simply shook her head and went to help the victims scattered about the entrance hall it took them a half hour to get back into the common room mostly because they couldntfigure out how to get neville luna and harry in all at once but once that was sorted out they tumbled inside and looked around happily for ginny numerous gryffindors stared at them oddly ron peeked at them over the back of the couch looking nervous where would you be if you were ginny harry asked hermione how should i know i not ginny at least i dontthink i am where would you be if you were ginny hermione asked draco erm hawaii i ll go get my broom harry said eagerly hawaii awfully far luna said serenely maybe we should check her bedroom before flying all the way there good idea harry hermione and draco chorused harry turned to go up the stairs to the girls dormitory made it up about six steps and came shooting back down the stone slide alarms accompanying his arrival oh yeah he said thoughtfully hopping up and pushing his cloak back hmm dontbe silly harry it girls only luna malfoy come on hermione marched up the staircase as soon as it reformed she made it to the tenth step when draco obliviously wandering after her set off the alarms again she toppled into him and they both went flying back to the common room landing on top of harry startled they looked up at luna and neville luna hermione said disapprovingly did you set off the alarms no i didntgo up the stairs hermione looked outraged at the blatant disregard for hermione orders malfoy isnta girl luna said by way of explanation oh hermione sighed and lay back sprawled across draco legs her feet flung across harry chest well you could have told me that earlier you know sorry luna said sincerely neville looked up the stairs torn on the one hand he didntwant to make ginny suffer on the other hand he knew he wasntcut out for this while he and luna had also helped harry ron and hermione in the final battles with voldemort ginny had been exponentially more useful to them she was the smart one not just the brave one and unlike luna she was wholly sane if anyone could save the day it would be ginny of the three of them ginny was the harry of the group or perhaps the hermione while neville was the ron luna was just sort of well luna was luna but ginny well he knew that if anyone could be counted on to pick up the wand once harry ron and hermione had fallen it would be her she most definitely would not be standing next to a pile of two heroes and one villain while a random but loveable girl with a blond afro stared dreamily into space a few feet away she probably wouldntbe wearing a loincloth either although that was a nice thought focus neville an inner voice that sounded a lot like his grandmother made him jump and he looked down at harry hermione and draco like it or not neville was not the person to single handedly do something this important you know neville said tentatively if we could just send luna alone i ve got it harry roared making the entire common room which was watching with interest jump badly and drowning out the last words of neville s hermione and luna can carry malfoy up the stairs then he wontset off the alarms and even if he does he ll be being carried so he wontfall back down brilliant harry hermione gushed giving him a hug as best she could while lying half on top of him she jumped up luna get his feet okay luna said serenely grabbing his ankles and lifting them up she looked expectantly at hermione hermione frowned down at draco you re too heavy she said irritably but you haventpicked him up neville said hermione ignored him and whirled around to face harry quick the immortal we need reinforcements harry nodded and looked sharply around the room a group of three fourth years sat over by the fire hey he yelled and suddenly ran at them like a nuclear missile bearing down upon a particularly annoying country it is worth mentioning that in crisis situations most people can be compared to rabbits sometimes rabbits will freeze in the shadow of a bird of prey sometimes they will run like hell to the safety of their burrows yet other times they ll kick the living stuffing out of that cocky ass bird with their nice strong hind legs the three fourth years appeared to be a good variety a girl with pigtails yelped and bolted for the portrait hole as if hoping harry would magically be confined to the room a pimply faced boy looked at the demented but still somehow heroic vision of harry potter running into battle and simply stared like the proverbial deer in the headlights knowing that the killer of voldemort was coming for him the moment made all the more surreal for him by harry outlandish attire thus it was up to the third a skinny girl with thick glasses to save her companions and teach that bird a lesson or rather as is probably the true meaning of the rabbit action to panic kick out her legs and hope for the best she seized a nearby copy of hogwarts a history madam pince simply couldntkeep that book in the library what with all the pranksters running around trying to learn the school secrets to attack their classmates with more precision with a strangled sound that might have been an attempt at a battle cry the girl flung the book at harry like a vindictive paperboy harry forward momentum was totally unprepared for the reverse direction in a complicated move that totally explained why hogwarts didntteach physics harry was knocked away from the fire over the back of the couch and onto ron ron stared at him in horror ron had been in the common room when the three had shown up had smirked and laughed with everyone else and then had slowly filled with terror when he realized the three extremely irrational people were trying to kill him he didnthave fred and george to ask for help and his only other support in situations like these was now the cause of situations like these so he stared at harry much like the fourth year boy waiting for harry move as bits of miscellaneous pages about hogwarts past rained down upon them oh hey ron harry said cheerfully and got back up hopped over the couch and turned in hermione general direction i dontthink those three wanted to help much herm harry shouted to her there a bunch of first year girls in the corner and dontforget to only use my superhero name when i in costume yeah potter draco yelled sorry hermione that okay harry now you d best try the sneak attack they all have books too right good idea hermione ooh can i say the poem you d best your super powers wontwork without it draco called but it a cloak neville whined desperately feeling rather like bursting into tears especially since hermione had forced neville and luna to memorize poems of their own on the way to gryffindor tower and he had a sinking feeling she was going to make them use them before long he doesnthave to say a poem he doesn t honest he gone invisible like sixty times today once again neville was ignored harry cleared his throat loud enough to get an echo magic super secret power of invisibility which has absolutely nothing to do with my cool silvery cloak honest activate so that i may sneak attack those first years over there he bellowed it not even a real poem neville moaned as hermione and draco beamed at harry approvingly harry threw the cloak over himself and disappeared normally this would be a spectacular way to sneak attack shaking first years but harry was yelling whee and knocking over tables and chairs and books and so on as he went so there was a nice trail of destruction to mark his location he skidded to a halt in the midst of five petrified first years and flung off his cloak hi harry boomed i the immortal legendary member of the save the world club i require the assistance of you insignificant human children please leave us alone asked a particularly brave girl dontyou want to help harry asked they all shook their heads frantically and harry deflated aghast um but i can pay you i wealthy see he reached beneath his green snitch covered boxers and into his pants pocket pulling out five galleons we ll do it said the same first year her hand snatching the money greedily author notes here it is the first never before seen chapter i working on the next but my interest in hp is still a lot lower than it used to be and i cantguarantee i ll be updating all that often i thank you all for being patient with me throughout the long arduous process of editing this monstrously long fic i a lot happier with the story the way it is now which makes it flow a lot better for

to everyone who sent abuse reports about anapplefromatree bit of plagiarism she gone now i really appreciate the support adriana blanco has been translating this fic into spanish for anyone who interested she been doing a wonderful job and now on with the war chapter forty three oliver last stand ginny lay in the nice comfy place between sleep and wakefulness where everything was hazy around the edges and nothing seemed to matter she was drifting aimlessly almost in a meditative state everything was okay she was relaxed and calm there was a simple spell placed on the dormitory to keep the sound of alarms from waking up the entire girls dormitories when an idiot guy tried to sneak in during the middle of the night put in place in the early sixties when boys were getting particularly stupid thus ginny did not hear the alarms didntknow that a tutu clad malfoy was now being carried up the stairs by a group of sweaty first year girls didnt know that the save the world club was about to intrude into her happy bubble it came as a complete shock when hermione masked and cap covered head suddenly filled ginny blurry vision and the yell of hi ginny shattered the peacefulness with the same sort of finesse as throwing an antique tiffany lamp off mt everest ginny stared horrified and not a little annoyed before she could say anything such as get the hell out of my room until you sober up you whack job a stuffed slightly moth eaten eagle came into view glued firmly on top of a blond afro by some spell or another hello said luna ginny gaped at her then shook her head and rolled her eyes she couldnteven pretend to be surprised that the first person hermione would join forces with under the circumstances would be luna hi weasel junior yelled another voice and a hand began waving in ginny face ginny batted it away and turned to look in its general direction only to see draco tutu and all born aloft by five irritated first years like a crack head version of a fairytale princess being carried about by her adoring slaves potter paid us said one by explanation she was standing on draco cloak which was dragging the ground damn rich people ginny growled gin it time to induct you into the save the world club hermione said cheerfully she pulled out her wand no ginny growled snatching the wand away and tossing it across the room that was a mistake and she knew it she should have held onto it snapped it if possible now it was retrievable but we need you luna said absently idly inspecting her butterbeer cork dress the gang isnt complete without you ginny hermione agreed me luna neville harry and malfoy doesntsound nearly as cool as me luna neville harry malfoy and ginny six is a much better number for a superhero team than five just look at power rangers who ginny asked frowning in confusion power rangers they always add in a sixth member almost always anyway besides we need you ginny we cantremember who anti spider boy is and we cantkill him if we cantremember him ginny sighed this was the first time that she had needed hermione and truly couldnt go to hermione for advice it was a disturbing feeling not having hermione solid support and logic still no matter how alone and lost ginny felt she wasntabout to end up in the save the world club i could totally get used to this draco said happily from the arms of the first years don t said one of the first years blackly i rather like this dress luna said contemplatively it surprisingly comfortable hermione dear ginny said sweetly i tell you what i ll tell you who anti spider boy is and then you can go kill him and i can go back to sleep okay if ron wanted to be an idiot about things then ginny had no qualms about dumping the mess he d created right back on him no ginny you need to be in the club hermione insisted oh i already in the club ginny assured her i just out of uniform right now really hermione stared at her oh i had no idea what your superhero name luna asked ginny shot her a dirty look luna wasntunder the influence and therefore she had no right to complicate things superhero name she repeated cautiously yes i weird but helpful chick and neville is clumsy plant man neville ginny hissed great ginny had a rather large soft spot for neville he was after all another person just like her close to harry ron and hermione and yet never part of their circle always in their shadow the thought that he had been sucked into this mess because ginny had sent him after harry and hermione was a disturbing thought i the sane one ginny told hermione slowly thinking fast i am exhausted from previous battles with anti spider boy and therefore i need to rest more so that my secret powers of um x ray vision will recharge so i ask that you try to take him on yourself i unable to fight myself at the moment i ll tell you who he is and you can go get him okay hermione nodded eagerly and ginny opened her mouth then stopped on a normal day ron was no match for harry or hermione though he was probably a match for draco neville or luna alone she could bet that neville and luna despite their odd induction into the club wouldnthave any part in the assassination attempt still ginny doubted ron could take on harry hermione and draco even in their psychotic state their current madness would lend an edge of unpredictability and a no holds barred duel was not something ginny wanted to see ron on the end of however ginny also doubted she d be able to get the save the world club to back off and therefore she had to send them after someone but who did ginny dislike that much wood the answer came to her out of nowhere she did owe wood one or two problems and he wasntparticularly innocent in this whole mess besides which he was the defense against the dark arts teacher ginny didntthink sending them after dumbledore would work out so by all rights she should send them to wood mcgonagall was too unpredictable and snape probably wasntin the castle so wood was the next best thing oliver ginny said oliver wood go get him eh oh and you might want to send neville into the room first she added as an afterthought good idea luna said his vines of enchanted devil snare can trap professor wood before he can escape exactly ginny said gratefully then glared at luna hey werentyou supposed to put an end to this yourself luna shrugged everyone else ran off or got cursed i figured you d be proud that i at least keeping an eye on them instead of running around screaming or hiding luna said sternly as though ginny was being ungrateful ginny stared at her for a long moment before dryly replying with gee thanks luna oliver was having one of the best mornings he d had in ages apparently the only way to avoid the insanity that was hogwarts was to hide so far it was working perfectly he was lounging around in his room sitting on his firebolt 2 for no reason other than he felt more comfortable on it than he did in a chair floating at his writing desk grading papers and singing along to fenrir offspring his favorite band the loud harsh song made him feel like his old self the carefree self that even in the midst of a grueling quidditch season and a depressing war and his missions for the order of the phoenix could still go out on friday night and party at a club with the guys love is like the cruciatus he half shouted as he corrected the spelling of expelliarmus on a first year essay it so excruciating i wish you and i had never been us i wish i could cut you out i hex your very name i wish i could banish you your curse is nothing but pain someone knocked on the door the sound barely distinguishable beneath the music oliver stopped singing for no reason other than he knew his voice sucked but he didntget off the broom or otherwise halt his actions whoever was at the door they d go away eventually like mcgonagall had when she d tried to reach him through the floo network and he d just hid behind a bookcase until she d given up the only creature to have interacted with him today was a house elf who d brought him his breakfast professor wood called the voice of neville longbottom his tone desperate and long suffering and all the things that oliver wasntbecause he was very emphatically hiding thank you very much oliver didntreply he started singing softly again hoping neville would be gone by the next verse love is like the cruciatus nothing but suffering never again will you and i be us oliver it me neville i will find a way to quit you remember that time when you were in fifth year and i was in first and you stopped those sixth year guys from beating me up and healed me so i wouldnthave to go up to the hospital wing all bloody oliver swallowed trying to force down the thought of poor kid that wandered through his brain i ll erase your very name and that time when i was in third year and you made those guys outside the greenhouses stop cursing me with all those horrible spells find some way to banish you i need that kind of help again please your curse is nothing but pain um i know where you can get some kikanto root oliver dropped his pen and looked round at the door in horror neville longbottom had just offered him a teacher access to a plant that was banned at hogwarts and in several countries oliver wasntsure what was more shocking that neville knew how to find that plant or that neville was desperate enough to risk getting kicked out of school or worse just to get oliver to open the door dontdo it groaned the part of him that was just as long suffering as neville currently sounded oliver sighed he had to it was neville neville whose grandmother had played bridge with oliver grandmother neville whose father had been oliver father favorite cousin neville whose parents had sent oliver a pocket sneakoscope for oliver fourth birthday that oliver still treasured neville who made for some great comedic relief whenever the two branches of their families got together even if most of it was by accident neville who had once healed oliver cat with an herbal concoction that even the experts at magical menagerie hadnt thought to try neville who oliver had tried to watch out for during the three years they d been at hogwarts together even going so far as to remind anyone who ridiculed neville that neville had scored gryffindor the house cup in his very first year they werent exactly friends and they werentclose family but oliver knew and liked neville well enough that he couldntleave him out in the hallway after neville had basically offered to sell his soul in exchange for relief from whatever nightmare was on the other side of the door with a flick of his wand the music was silenced and oliver hopped off his broom he kept the broom in his hand mostly for comfort though he told himself that he was not the sort of wanker who needed a security blanket and that whatever might be on the other side of that door could be something oliver would need to run from and fast given how often he d had to retreat over the past few days oliver started to head for the door but then decided it might be best to keep his distance he raised his wand and lifted the numerous locking spells he d placed upon it come in he called neville burst into the room and threw himself against the door closing it firmly and leaning against it as if afraid others would barge in at any moment oliver you ve got to help me he whispered urgently oliver stared at neville incredulously taking in the loincloth and the wreath on his brow is that is that devil snare round your wrists oliver demanded it enchanted neville said absently it ll only attack on my command why the hell are you harry hermione and malfoy they ve completely lost it from what we can tell fred and george hit them with some really powerful euphoria charms i haventseen anyone that addled since ron in the department of mysteries and he was so out of it that he summoned that brain that nearly killed him they re calling themselves the save the world club and they made these freak costumes and put me and luna in these stupid outfits and they re out to kill ron only they were calling him anti spider boy and they forgot that ron was anti spider boy oliver erased the mental note to get fred a good christmas gift for the cherry thing take them up to the hospital wing he interrupted poppy will sort them out i can t see ginny organized a bunch of us to stop them and they completely slaughtered us the only reason luna and i didntget hexed into oblivion is because we pretended to go along with it if they think i not with them they ll hex me too and for some reason when they went to go get ginny to help them remember who anti spider boy was she said it was you oliver gaped at him me yeah i guess she thought you could stop them she told them to send me in first i guess to explain i supposed to subdue you with the devil snare so i figure you and me can come up with a plan and then we ll let them in and get the drop on them oliver shook his head and stared at neville with increasing horror neville let me get this straight you re telling me that there are three people in that hallway one is the son of you know who right hand man the other two killed you know who and several death eaters all three of them are stoned out of their minds and they re here to kill me neville nodded apologetically yeah there luna too but i not certain if she ll help them or us or just sort of you know stand there blankly well that just great oliver growled just great this is so typical typical neville repeated faintly he was not sure any word could be less applicable to their current situation three and a half years i ve been friends with hermione friends with benefits really you have neville asked startled oliver ignored him and every time i hung out with her there was always something going on some freak accident or dangerous intrigue even in the summer when she d try to just be with her little muggle friends and pretend she was a normal muggle girl with no magical powers it was alarming to see just how extraordinary she was always wrapped up in something inside information on the order and harry scar is some sort of conduit and of course i can do a spell that you didntlearn until you were halfway through your seventh year and of course there nothing creepy about being roommates with sirius black he a lovely man really and i really love rules but this one time i freed a hippogriff from ministry execution and even though that could put me in azkaban for up to five years i sure no one would ever find out and i sorry i cantsee you over christmas oliver but didntyou hear from the order that harry psychically deduced that mr weasley been almost eaten by a giant snake and i have to spend the holidays at headquarters but i d love it if you d drop by and damn it neville i sick of this neville who had never known that oliver had any connection to harry ron and hermione save quidditch and his friendship with the weasley twins was rather taken aback by this outburst moreover he couldntreally see what oliver problem was hermione was unusual yes but that was part of what neville and everyone else who called her a friend liked about her i not sure i understand neville said slowly of course you don t oliver bellowed gesturing so wildly with his broom that neville ducked you re one of them you let yourself get sucked in and you surf through the chaos with them until they let you go back to sitting on the beach but that doesnt happen to me neville when they suck me in i cantget out of the water until i half drowned i cantsurf neville surf neville repeated blankly surfing was a muggle invention and as a pureblood neville had never heard of it oliver however had chatted up a few of hermione friends about the subject it always the same with them i just wanted a seeker and instead i got some bizarre kid predestined to fight dark wizards and always end up in the hospital wing come quidditch cup time there never a normal moment around those three what made me think i could actually date her she like that teacup ride at the muggle carnival she took me to it might have been fun at first but pretty soon it just makes you queasy i neville sighed and cleared his throat look oliver do you mind oliver blinked huh i understand that you re having some sort of breakdown and i feel for you i really do but i wearing a loincloth cantyou go ahead and break down after we sort this out oliver stared at him a little outraged this was not very supportive of neville however given the fact that oliver had over the course of the prank war let slip two of hermione secrets her tattoo and her relationship with him abandoned her during quidditch practice gotten drunk and terrorized the twins and ron cracked up when trying to help hermione clean herself after the food fight upset harry badly enough to make him inflate draco head and most recently hidden in his room at the first sign of impending weirdness oliver didntreally think he could fault neville for not wanting to hear oliver whine oliver could at least place partial blame for his problems upon himself whereas neville was innocent and suffering not to mention the fact that oliver was a teacher and was behaving quite poorly not only had he played favorites and allowed students to get away with things they shouldn t he d ignored harry and hermione this morning and he couldntignore neville now not when oliver had turned a blind eye and let it get this out of control sorry oliver said taking a deep calming breath i ve just been a little out of sorts lately i understand and um once this is over if you want to talk neville called hermione from the other side of the door have you restrained anti spider boy yet we re bored neville sighed pathetically and began to reply but oliver motioned at him to keep quiet and step away from the door hermione is that you oliver shouted injecting a note of hopefulness into his voice you ve got to help me neville gone crazy the door flew open and hit the wall with a bang harry marched in dressed like a superhero designed by a drug addict hands on his hips i the immortal have come to destroy you anti spider boy harry yelled oliver stared at him there wasntreally much he could say to that harry ran straight at him and suddenly oliver felt incredibly silly between harry outfit neville hiding behind oliver desk and every ludicrous occurrence that had led up to this situation oliver simply couldnt take this seriously this wasntthe man who triumphed over he who must not be named charging at him valiantly with righteous justice in his eyes this was a cracked out kid who oliver used to wake up at five in the morning for quidditch practice now thrown into oliver path at a time when the entire world had gone mad oliver didnteven bother raising his wand instead he hefted his broomstick waited for harry to come within reach and rapped the firebolt 2 across harry forehead the biggest hero the wizarding world had ever known dropped like a sack of bricks hermione and draco had just crossed the threshold into oliver room hermione gasped at the sight of harry look evil bastard anti spider boy has killed the immortal good on you mate draco said deeply impressed you have no idea how many people have tried and failed to knock potter off if you d managed to do that a year ago the dark lord probably would have made you king of asia or something by now hermione smacked his arm mal foy we re a team remember the save the world club you re not supposed to be happy that oliver killed harry oh right draco said apologetically habit you understand of course you re forgiven hermione tossed her hair back and leveled her wand at oliver now then she began as oliver cautiously approached you anti spider boy are going to be destroyed for numerous reasons most of which i forgot by the time we got here but most recently for killing the immortal and ouch hermione didntget to finish draco had been grinning happily down at harry unconscious form and hadntnoticed oliver come around to draco side and raise the broomstick draco had also crumpled and his descent to the floor had yanked painfully on hermione wrist before she could regain her balance oliver had raised the broom once again one more swing and the once crazed wannabe superheroes were nothing more than shallowly breathing piles on his sitting room floor well came luna dreamy voice from the doorway oliver jumped and raised his broom instinctively i glad that over then it was getting a little dull with that luna turned and drifted away oliver returned to staring down at the three hexed students on his rug an odd sense of closure stealing over him then he held his hand out to neville give me your wand neville mutely handed it over staring down at the fallen heroes in a sort of numb shock oliver swished neville wand through the air and harry hermione and draco rose gently up until they were floating eerily at shoulder height oliver directed them out into the hallway then handed the wand back to neville there enchantment should last long enough to get them to the hospital wing give madam pomfrey a full report and then go ask professor mcgonagall to de transfigure your clothing neville nodded and left oliver smiled to himself and flicked his wand filling his room with the blaring hard rock music of fenrir offspring finally he breathed peace and quiet chapter forty four stuck hermione groaned as she was dragged back to consciousness the sound of laughter filled her ears and she struggled to figure out why the last thing she remembered was going down to breakfast on saturday morning being high on the thrills of bitch slapping ron she slid her eyes open and yelped draco was lying not three feet away from her sleeping peacefully smiling slightly around the thumb in his mouth the laughter in the background paused at her startled cry then started back up again louder now great she was probably caught in the middle of yet another prank no she was in the hospital wing someone had pushed her and draco cots together probably because of the chain and the railings had been raised on the other side of his cot she reached behind her and felt another railing behind her odd madam pomfrey usually only put the railings up when the patient using the cot was having fits or seizures of some kind hermione pushed herself up on one elbow and started to call out to whomever was laughing behind her but the sight of draco attire stopped her dead he was wearing a black sweater gray slacks mismatched socks a green cape and a fluffy pink tutu hermione looked down at herself startled to see her own bizarre outfit what the hey hermione said a weary voice behind her neville for crying out loud who is that laughing that would be harry you all got hit with a euphoria charm yesterday a euphoria charm but those are so difficult to do not to mention highly illegal is that why harry laughing nope neville said he laughing because i trying to tell him what all you lot did while under the effects of the euphoria charm hermione groaned tell me there werentwitnesses neville cleared his throat but before he could reply draco suddenly let out a mad cackle in his sleep and started spasming like mad malfoy malfoy hermione called anxiously trying to wake him neville what wrong with him oh he does that a lot you all did neville came around to draco side of the bed so that he could face her shortly after he stopped a few feet back from the railing draco fit subsided and he lay still a moment later he curled up and stuck his thumb back in his mouth hermione exhaled slowly relaxing well that was wait yesterday huh neville asked blankly you said we got hit with a euphoria charm yesterday hermione reminded him neville nodded apologetically it sunday afternoon sunday afternoon we ve missed almost the entire hogsmeade weekend she complained sighing i imagine you ll miss the rest of today too obviously you cantgo anywhere until malfoy isntunder the influence anymore she heard the sounds of bare feet hitting the floor and a moment later harry came round to stand beside neville hmm malfoy in a tutu did someone already take pictures or should i go try to find a camera colin was here and a half dozen other people neville told him i hear you can contact dennis creevey to order prints hermione groaned i dontsuppose they left us alone did they she asked pointing to herself and harry neville shook his head sorry a lot of hufflepuffs and gryffindors arenttoo happy with you after that thing in the entrance hall hermione blanched oh i dontthink they re really angry neville assured her hastily a few of them maybe but most understand they re just not looking to do you any favors is all as if recalling a particularly unpleasant memory he shuddered she sighed who all did we alienate neville well um let see the patil twins lavender dean seamus michael terry anthony ernie hannah justin the hufflepuff quidditch team the entire team she repeated incredulously neville nodded as far as i know but i not familiar with their reserve players harry chuckled well now that we ve made enemies out of all four houses we might as well up and drop out of school eh go our own way start a little detective agency or something i ll put up the starter loan we are not dropping out of school harry hermione said severely she sighed again i has anyone brought me spare clothes or anything neville nodded ginny took care of it she feels slightly guilty skiving off and everything but she was just a tad worn out is all everybody cracking up really you should have heard poor wood ranting about insanity wood hermione repeated oh dear tell me we didntupset him too much come to think of it no neville said he the one who knocked you lot unconscious with his broomstick he knocked us unconscious harry asked sounding mildly affronted what did we do to him then you tried to assassinate him neville told them conversationally rummaging through a pile of clothes and books on a nearby chair oh well then i guess we ll have to forgive him harry joked reaching up to check his head for lumps fingers automatically going first to his inactive scar and then over the rest of his skull why are you in such a good mood hermione asked him rubbing the invisible chain idly harry shrugged it all kind of funny really at least so far neville still hasnttold me how malfoy got in the tutu well after you lot decided you wanted to form a club of world saving superheroes and ran out of the entrance hall what hermione interrupted neville smiled sympathetically at her and handed her copies of hogwarts a history the standard book of spells grade seven and an advanced guide to transfiguration dontworry hermione ginny managed to mend the scarves you cut up and she even mended your books hermione eyes widened in horror and fury who damaged my books she demanded you did neville replied well one of you three you taped them to your cape and stuff my cape hermione repeated cradling the books to her chest my cape yes right of course i had a cape why not harry shook his head that how i felt for the first few minutes wait until he gets to the part where we were running around yelling whee i like that part neville admitted that was before you put me in a loincloth seeing the startled look on harry and hermione faces he laughed nervously well then let me explain first of all ginny fairly certain fred and george hit you with those charms before they left school ron had an alibi in the common room the whole time but we dontneed to talk it over it not hard to figure out hermione interrupted go on well the charms made you pretty much insane until wood knocked you out and i brought you up here the antidote had to be special ordered snape run off again so you re lucky dumbledore managed to get some so soon lucky right that what we are harry drawled madam pomfrey says everyone different so malfoy could still be out a while neville said well that something hermione said feeling a large weight lift from her shoulders nothing like an unconscious malfoy to cheer a person up neville released the rail on the edge of her bed and he and harry sat down on the corners of her cot while neville explained the whole thing by the time neville finished ginny had arrived with dinner for them all and she apologized profusely for not stepping up but neither harry nor hermione faulted her for not wanting to cope draco continued to spasm periodically but didntawaken so the only annoyance he created was when his flailing limbs yanked hermione arm about painfully ginny drew the curtains around the cot and kept watch over draco while hermione changed and once she was clothed in comfortable attire and full of the best food ginny could procure and certain that her books had suffered no lasting damage hermione joined harry in laughing cheerfully about the entire psychotic event the more neville described the more they remembered of their own volition until most of the details of the event were sketchily outlined in their own memories madam pomfrey came in to check on them shortly after they ate shoveling some more of the antidote potion down draco throat and muttering irritably about how she should have taken up a nice safe hassle free profession like dragon taming around eight o clock the chain jerked again on hermione wrist and she turned to make sure draco flailing wouldntharm her she found draco sitting up instead peering blearily around at them all bloody gryffindors he grumbled why the hell am i in the hospital wing and how in god name did you get me in a tutu madam pomfrey released them all the moment she saw draco awake and past the effects of the euphoria charm ginny had forgotten to bring draco a change of clothes but he was a tad too weary and irritated to bother being upset with her or with the large numbers of laughing gryffindors in the common room harry hermione and ginny said goodbye to neville in the common room and accompanied malfoy through the wall and into the relative safety of the guestroom i think i ll stay with you lot tonight ginny said everyone been asking me all sorts of questions and i think some of them suspect that i ditched the party last night what party draco asked ginny rolled her eyes the one where we tried to save you three from yourselves do you remember anything yet he shrugged uncomfortably bits and pieces telling granger i didntwant to be captain hook congratulating wood for killing potter he shook his head it all kind of a blur the way stuff you did while drunk starts coming back to you during the hangover well we ve managed to alienate some of our strongest allies harry said thoughtfully including most of the gryffindor hufflepuff and ravenclaw students in our year and the hufflepuff quidditch team i suppose we should work on some way to get back on their good sides again before ron can manage it if he poisons them completely against us well we cantfight the slytherins ron and the rest of the school too at best we can count on maybe neville support and snape s harry frowned wow and here i thought our lives would get less weird once we killed voldemort let not think about it tonight hermione said wearily no one can get into this room but the four of us and anyway the train will be here tomorrow to take us away for the holidays oh god draco groaned my mum going to treat you like you re a friend of mine and the guys will want to come over what will i tell them i not looking forward to it either but it probably a lot better than running around here with everyone staring at us and plotting against us hermione said besides i imagine attitudes will cool down over the holidays or heat up once everyone had a little time to plan and hit the joke shops in diagon alley and hogsmeade harry finished dryly regardless let just pack up our things and get some sleep okay harry ginny and even draco muttered their agreement the effects of the euphoria charm left harry hermione and draco feeling rather odd their energy levels began spiking so that one minute they were wide awake and the next they were practically zombies ginny went and collected her things from her bedroom and they all prepared for tomorrow train ride harry hermione and draco fell on the bed without complaint for once while ginny curled up in one of the armchairs and they all managed to get a good night rest for the first time in quite a while harry hermione and draco awoke to ginny frantically shouting for them to awaken but the euphoria charm aftereffects were still making them all groggy and they continued to doze finally harry managed to open an eye and peek at his watch oh my god he shouted sitting bolt upright we ve got twenty minutes until the train leaves what draco hissed jerking awake and pushing hermione away from him that what i ve been trying to tell you ginny exclaimed i woke you guys up before i went down to breakfast or at least i thought i did and when i got back draco tried to scramble out of the bed forgetting the chain and nearly dislocating his shoulder wake her up he snapped at harry i will not miss the train on account of her shut up malfoy i trying harry snarled shaking her shoulder hermione hermione come on listen ginny said i really dontwant to be late and you know what it like to find a compartment no go ahead harry told her save us seats will you ginny nodded hurry she said and darted out of the hall hermione herm wake up hermione granger get up draco shouted yanking hard on the chain hermione yelped as pain lanced through her arm what your problem she demanded rolling onto her side and cradling her arm my problem is we re about to miss the train what hermione sat up and stared at the clock in alarm oh my god the three of them dove as one for the piles of muggle clothing and robes they d laid out the night before and then rushed for the bathroom hermione leaped into the shower and pulled the curtain closed we donthave time for another one of your showers draco said i not showering i changing we donthave time for harry to hold you at wand point she retorted already ripping her shirt and robes apart with spells can you do that spell to brush my teeth harry called through the curtain as he jumped into his jeans hermione wand poked out between the curtain and a jet of orange light hit him in the mouth thanks he said yanking a comb through his hair just because it never lay flat was no excuse to give up on it and then rushing out of the bathroom draco finished dressing and considered asking hermione to perform the same spell but his pride won out and he went to the sink himself scrubbing irritably at his teeth with one hand while brushing his hair with the other hermione leaped out of the shower fully clothed and groaned at the sight of her hair in the mirror it was worse than usual for crying out loud she groaned attacking it with her hairbrush i ought to just shave my head draco spat out a mouthful of toothpaste and grinned at her hopelessly tangled hair i d tell you not to bother with the brush but if you leave the room looking like that you re liable to scare the first years hermione to his surprise merely chuckled you sound like parvati she doesntseem to get that we cantall be as exotically beautiful as her draco snorted if you ask me the patil twins arenthalf as pretty as they think they are he said darkly remembering with a pang of anger how padma patil had turned down his invitation to go to the yule ball citing her sister being in gryffindor as a reason and ended up going with that clod weasley they have gorgeous hair she said her tone distracted and a little wistful draco blinked startled to realize he and hermione were actually having a civil conversation deciding to chalk it up to the euphoria charm aftereffects he said well not if you re standing behind them they have this horrible habit of tossing their hair i got hit by parvati hair once full in the face felt like i d stood a little too close to the back end of a horse hermione burst out laughing oh that priceless she breathed they do that all the time too they think it so pretty draco could help but feel a surge of pride and pleasure the same way he always did whenever someone reacted well to one of his stories it not pretty when it slapping you in the eyes he replied and you know what it smells kind of funny like eggs it all those products they use to keep it healthy hermione explained parvati used to try and get me to use some of them your hair smells way better draco told her emphatically and i ve never seen you try to use it as a weapon hermione laughed again and draco grinned at her harry poked his head into the bathroom and gave them a suspicious look what are you doing he asked confused nothing harry mind your own business potter draco snapped his good mood evaporating waiting on granger to finish her hair hermione sighed and put her brush down come on she muttered let just i ll wear a hat harry stepped back to let them out of the bathroom listen um we re really running out of time and i already packed we ll hurry dontworry hermione said go ahead malfoy isntstupid enough to pick a fight with me when we might risk missing the train crookshanks come hermione cat leaped down from its perch on the desk and padded over to her reluctantly allowing her to stuff him in his carrying basket harry nodded i ll try and stall them hurry harry grabbed hedwig cage and his trunk and rushed out the door draco groaned oh great i completely forgot we re on the seventh floor how the hell do you people manage to come up and down here all day without collapsing from exhaustion practice hermione muttered as she began outfitting herself with scarves gloves and other cold weather gear that why the gryffindors and ravenclaws tend to be leaner than the hufflepuffs and slytherins be thankful we re not up in my dormitory my year is on the top floor draco grimaced and shoved a few more items into his trunk huge castle like this and most of it isntbeing used for anything you d think they d put everyone lower to the ground the castle wasntalways empty she said and the spells on the gryffindor and ravenclaw rooms have stood for thousands of years and we d have to come up here anyway for astronomy oh for crying out loud draco groaned as he pulled the hood of his cloak carefully up over his hair you re not the only one who read hogwarts a history you know she stared at him in pure undiluted shock you ve read it too he nodded rolling his eyes i may not have memorized the damned thing but anyone with half a brain reads that book before they get here and keeps a copy lying around how else are you supposed to know anything about the secrets in this place her shock increased to near comical proportions i ve been trying to get harry and ron to read it since first year he shrugged i did say anyone with half a brain didnti he expected her to take offense but she just chuckled and seized the handle of her trunk in one hand crookshanks basket in the other hang on where your owl she asked he scowled dead probably i was sending my father a letter with him when the death eaters broke out of azkaban summer after fifth year i never saw him again i sorry hermione said quietly looking down at crookshanks basket draco ignored her can we get going please hermione nodded and led the way out of the guestroom into the empty common room oh forget this she muttered dropping her heavy trunk students were discouraged from bewitching their trunks to follow them down to the train platform primarily because it was a spell not everyone could manage and hundreds of heavy trunks floating around in a throng of pushing shoving students could get downright deadly but as they were undoubtedly some of the last students left in the castle there wasntmuch point hermione however knew more than enough spells to get their trunks down to the entrance hall without carrying them and speed was of the essence she jabbed her wand at their trunks and crookshanks basket and all three pieces of luggage went flying out of the common room knocking the fat lady portrait out of the way as they went mcgonagall will have a fit if she catches you draco said even as he hurried to follow hermione through the portrait hole hermione shrugged we ll never make it in time if we dontrun and i cantrun with that stupid trunk she said as she slammed the portrait behind them ignoring the fat lady indignant protests she and draco began to jog through the castle draco shook his head typical what is that supposed to mean hermione asked dangerously as she darted into a secret passage without warning forcing draco to skid to a halt and follow her before his arm jerked it means that you always act like you never do anything wrong but you break rules all the time even when you arentrunning around saving the school just like that bit with the damned dragon in first year and oh shut up hermione said with a sniff i do not act like i dontbreak the rules i break the rules when i have to i do not however think it intelligent to risk getting expelled just to have a bit of fun i can have plenty of fun without risking my magical career doing it draco rolled his eyes for a gryffindor you sure worry about consequences too much of course i do she snapped do you have any idea what would happen to me if i got expelled huh your father might have been killed supporting voldemort but from what i understand your mother managed to save the majority of her reputation and you ve got dozens of ministry contacts to say nothing of what advantages your bloodline gives you elsewhere i am muggle born i ll have no connections in the outside world besides those i make here and being harry friend much as i love him is a tad time consuming why do you think i try so damned hard i cantrely on the family fortune and having a cousin in position to get me a job if i lose magic if they snap my wand in half i wonthave any opportunity to succeed in the muggle world either even if i could fake having an education i haventbeen to high school i dontknow advanced math and advanced literature and advanced physics i couldntkeep up with muggle schooling and magic too not with all the intrigues and the war on top of everything else you will have a mansion and a name that holds weight in the wizarding world i ll be an expelled student with nowhere to go like hagrid or pince who dropped out in her fifth year when she got pregnant or filch who a squib the best i could hope for would be working behind the counter at fred and george joke shop or serving ale with madam rosmerta whatever draco muttered but he found her words distinctly unsettling he had never really worried about getting kicked out of school the malfoy name had always carried too much weight for that until the war last year which had been too tense and depressing for him to risk drawing attention to himself now that he thought about it though he wasntsure his mother would lobby to keep him in the school the same way his father would have she was not as concerned with appearances as he had been and lucius death had put a considerable strain on their finances they were still wealthy to be sure but their assets had been frozen temporarily at the end of his fifth year and they had been forced to pay certain fines and reparations his mother had started getting a lot more careful about their spending even going so far as to sell some of their possessions they burst out of the secret passage and draco was startled to realize he had absolutely no idea where they were hermione however turned left and started jogging purposefully how do you know about all of these passages he asked harry map shows the entire school she told him darting behind a painting this one leads to the third floor corridor that was out of bounds in our first year are you sure it isnt still out of bounds draco asked nervously i seem to remember something about most painful death that was when fluffy lived there fluffy giant three headed dog fluffy what the hell was it doing in the castle guarding the sorcerer stone hermione replied coolly was doing a damned fine job of it too until quirrell figured out that playing music puts him right to sleep bewitched a harp to keep playing until he d snuck past fluffy thankfully harry had gotten a flute that christmas look draco said feeling a strong sense of curiosity i not saying that it was a bad thing you saving the school from the psychotic professor who wanted to bring the dark lord back to life but what in god name possessed you lot to go up against a three headed dog with nothing but a flute hermione shot him a startled look surprised that he at his interest and apparent lack of condemnation but she tried to take it in stride someone had to do it she said with a shrug besides fluffy as it turned out was one of the simplest challenges involved you didntknow that at the time no but we didntexactly think it would be easy she replied we knew that quirrell or rather snape whom we thought was the culprit at the time was a full grown fully qualified wizard we were three eleven year old kids what all went on down there draco asked curiously why do you care she asked frowning he shrugged and tried to look less interested than he was there were all sorts of rumors about it but no one knew the full story rumor had it there was a troll and a puzzle that would poison anyone who messed it up technically it only had three doses of poison for whoever messed it up she said two were wine one bottle let you move forward one bottle let you move backward you had to drink something or else be trapped in the room indefinitely i surprised potter figured it out he didn t i did she shot a glance at draco to gauge his reaction as they climbed out of a hole in the third floor corridor hidden by a large portrait of a dungeon she couldntbe sure but she thought that for just a moment he d looked a tad impressed watching him closely out of the corner of her eye as they resumed jogging she added i also figured out how to get us out of the devil snare devil snare mm hmm it was waiting at the bottom of the trapdoor beneath fluffy by the time i came down it had already started strangling harry and ron she smiled as they leaped over the same trapdoor she and harry and ron had jumped through in their first year i almost panicked before i remembered that alohomora hermione interrupted herself pointing her wand at a large wooden door in their path she reached for the handle and yanked and yanked and yanked some more what the she muttered and pointed her wand at the door again alohomora she tugged at the handle again but it refused to give come on granger draco drawled you should have mastered that spell in second year i mastered it two weeks after my first trip to diagon alley she snapped she tried it a few more times then tried another spell and another the door refused to budge would you give it up already draco said impatiently we ll have to go around there is no going around hermione snapped other than the passage we came through the only way out of this corridor is through that trapdoor draco glanced down at it where does it lead the last time i took it to a big patch of devil snare she sighed and spun around we ll have to go back up to the fifth floor and that ll take forever have you got a better plan grumbling draco turned to follow her back to the passage entrance they were still a good twenty feet away from the portrait when hermione stopped frowning what now draco demanded in irritation the portrait it empty so realization hit him a moment later oh great good going granger led us to a locked door and the guy we re supposed to give a password to has wondered off he canthave hermione exclaimed peering frantically at each corner of the painting well he did malfoy it a dungeon painting you prat the guy in it was chained to the wall see his chains are missing one of the other portraits cut him out my god cyrus skullovitch is loose in the castle cyrus skullovitch the cyrus skullovitch wizard serial killer cyrus skullovitch that who the portrait was of hermione confirmed that why the picture has him chained up here great so he probably off killing a half dozen other portraits who would do something that stupid i dontknow peeves maybe but he isnta portrait so he can only maim canvas or came peeves voice from directly overhead he can persuade one of the other portraits to rescue poor poor cyrus chained up in a dungeon peeves cackled as they looked up double double toil and trouble peevesie got you trapped in a bubble you unleashed cyrus hermione demanded i i would never do something that foolish of course i might have mentioned it to cadogan how poor misunderstood cyrus been chained up for centuries they were right he went rushing off to free cyrus babbling about noble quests who were right draco asked isntit obvious hermione asked eyes narrowing the weasley twins peeves cackled and blew a raspberry at them before zooming out through the wall hermione glowered after him and stomped over to the door she knelt down and peered into the lock jammed she reported something been stuffed in the keyhole then get it out we re missing the train exactly hermione said grimly just as fred and george intended us to she pulled out her wand and brandished it at the lock waddiwasi she shouted and the soft ball of gunk flew from the keyhole and landed on the floor alohomora hurry up hermione reached for the handle and discovered it hadntbudged she frowned and peered into the keyhole again and discovered the gunk was back what alohomora draco shouted pointing his wand at the door he leaned over hermione to tug at the handle again to no avail damn it granger move over hermione did frowning thoughtfully as draco attempted to remove the ball of gunk and unlock the door again hermione bent down and picked up the first bit from the keyhole it keeps coming back draco growled kicking the door in frustration what is this rubbish weasley wizard wheezes hermione said miserably it a double fire spitball basic refilling charm that lasts for ages meaning you can spit dozens of you mean to tell me those rat bastards had peeves stick some sort of refillable spitball in our only exit and set a serial killer loose in the freaking castle portraits just to make us miss the train draco demanded his voice rising furiously or worse hermione said with a sigh leaning against the wall and closing her eyes theoretically we could be here for ages without anyone ever finding us there nothing in this corridor to give anyone a reason to come here we ll have to wait for a ghost or a deafening roar sounded followed by a loud splintering noise hermione eyes snapped open to see draco standing in front of the shattered door with his wand raised his expression black bits of wood clinging to his hair and clothing the door had been completely decimated and before the dust had finished settling draco started forward tugging impatiently on the chain that destruction of school property hermione said shocked but if she was being honest with herself slightly impressed she had never seen draco do such a strong bit of magic before she knew he couldntbe all thumbs to have been made a prefect as deputy headmistress mcgonagall had to approve all choices so snape favoritism wasntenough to earn draco a badge watching him cut loose especially in such a destructive manner was a sight to see and though she hated to admit it it would have taken her quite a while to come up with the idea to blow up the door no one uses that corridor anyway draco muttered running faster now fast enough that hermione had to struggle to keep up it not like this place hasntseen its fair share of damage i ll repair it when we get back if it still there provided you dontrat me out to dumbledore first i wonthave time hermione said crossly what kind of charm did you use he smirked at her cantblow up a door on your own can you i could have done it a number of ways if i d thought it up she retorted i was just wondering which incantation you used yes well i doubt you could have managed it anyway he replied grinning viciously at her oh please your side lost remember she snapped shut up he hissed no longer smiling hermione did so if only because she was running out of breath from exertion she wasntmuch of a sprinter let alone a distance runner and it appeared draco was not that it surprised her he probably had a lot of practice running away from things they didntslow down until they reached the marble staircase at which point hermione skidded to a halt and draco nearly fell he rounded angrily on her and stopped at the horrified look on her face our stuff she gasped it should be right here it must be on the train already draco said cursing he rushed down the stairs half dragging hermione behind him and out onto the lawn oh no he wailed the carriages are gone we ll never make it in time now she groaned my trunk my broomstick my trunk this is all your fault she gaped up at him my fault you had to brush your hair and take your stupid shortcuts and you ve sent our luggage to a train we re not on we ll never catch it without my broomstick it wasntmy fault peeves trapped us in there you re the one who pissed off the weasley twins you re the one who started this whole mess you were asking for it you stupid bloody gryffindors with your stupid hermione ignored him and stalked off down the trail are you coming or not she demanded of draco we ve got to get on that train no way am i spending the holidays alone here with you draco refused to move folding his arms across his chest dontbe stupid if we miss the train we can take the floo how exactly are two people chained to each other going to floo draco cursed again and muttered a phrase in what sounded like latin the bus the knight bus where your money draco snorted contemptuously i not paying for you granger well if you want to take the bus you re going to have to my money is in my trunk so i ll draco broke off with a curse my money on the train too damn it granger this isntmy fault malfoy it fred and george and peeves s i aware of that he snapped we re stranded here no money no brooms we ll go down to hogsmeade and apparate hermione said i sure that if we i failed my test draco muttered avoiding her gaze i dontget to try again until march hermione made a frustrated noise i ll take you side along apparition he snorted again even if i did trust you not to accidentally splinch me you dontknow where we re going you ve never been to my house before and it probably too far away for you to manage it anyway i ll take us to the order london isnt that far away draco shook his head he didntfail to miss the worry in her voice i dontthink so besides we re staying at my house until christmas remember we can go there and and hermione broke off with a sigh and i wontbe able to take you in without clearance and i donthave it because we re not due there for another couple of days i not letting you apparate me anyway draco pointed out we ll we ll get a portkey hermione floundered for something anything to get them out of hogwarts we ll never get clearance for one anytime soon especially not around the holidays draco said with a sigh as if it wasntbad enough to be stuck to you now i have to be stuck here alone with you author notes no i not dead i simply struggling to work on this my interest in hp has waned and life has a funny habit of trying to kill me i fully intend to finish this story someday it taking far longer than i ever imagined it could but i wontabandon it

i try chapter four ideas ginny had long since given up standing around and had flopped down on the cold stone floor humming absently and wondering what exactly had happened to hermione two hours had gone by had snape killed her for suggesting they pretend to be lovers or something why hadnthermione come out yet all sorts of worried thoughts filtered through her head the what could have happened scenarios getting wackier and wackier maybe she thought with a giggle they really are having sex her thoughts broke off and her jaw dropped open as hermione came out just then her already unruly hair was so tousled hermione might as well have been struck by lightning her shirt was unbuttoned enough to give ginny a glimpse of her bra and her robe was hanging off one shoulder to top it all off hermione had the look of a girl who d just had a lot of fun she was practically glowing and she had a huge smile plastered on her face what ginny began stupidly unable to get her brain to function it for show hermione mouthed ginny could have collapsed in relief i thought you were shagging ginny mouthed back hermione giggled and shook her head emphatically it about time ginny complained as per their plan i ve had a heck of a time keeping people from guessing anything it a little weird to see a gryffindor let alone a close friend of the boy who lived sitting outside snape door and malfoy been past twice to irritate me do you think he suspects something hermione asked doing her best to sound panicked ginny shook her head and hermione put a smile back on her face looking as dreamy as luna lovegood draco was on his way back from the bathroom heading to snape office where he d been checking out the granger snape situation for most of the past two hours he froze when he heard the sound of ginny weasley voice and paused to listen malfoy been past twice to irritate me weasley grumbled do you think he suspects something it was granger draco eyes widened was she really talking about what he thought she was talking about part of him had been ready to believe he was losing it or had misunderstood the two girls came around the corner just then draco gaped at hermione disheveled appearance overhearing something shocking and seeing proof of it were two different things no way he told himself firmly no way in hell ugh get out of my face malfoy hermione said her dreamy smile slipping momentarily before returning full force i having too good a day for you to spoil it the two girls pushed past him leaving draco to stare after them in astonishment it was almost eleven o clock by the time the girls returned the common room already empty where the hell have you been harry demanded then got a good look at hermione and felt his jaw unhinge ron entire face was already turning a horrible shade of red it not what it looks like hermione said in a rush we messed up my hair and clothes in case malfoy saw me leaving snape office did he harry asked eagerly yup ginny said gleefully she walked over and sat in an armchair next to harry you should have seen the look on his face guys hermione sat down on ron lap and began to button up her shirt ron grabbed her hand to stop her grinning she smiled back and snuggled against him did you get him to help harry wanted to know yeah he said he would hermione told him and that not all he gave me a great idea for the prank war do tell ron said eyes glinting mischievously well see where do i start mcgonagall was teaching during the seventh year of the marauders you know james sirius lupin and wormtail and snape and harry mum were in the same year well lily was head girl and she got in a fight with james and sirius and ended up docking points they were really pissed and james yelled some comment about getting her knickers in a twist sirius joked that james was always thinking about her knickers and somehow that led to a dare in which james and sirius snuck into lily room and stole some of her nicer bras and underwear harry had a bit of a grossed out look on his face at the idea of his dad and sirius stealing his mum underwear ron looked beyond disgusted and said flatly i not stealing malfoy underwear mione sorry that not what i meant she said quickly you see lily found out what had happened and went to chat with her old pal mcgonagall and mcgonagall told snape she knew snape liked lily the two of them had been friends before he realized lily was muggle born and a gryffindor but anyway mcgonagall held snape after class and said she wanted to get revenge for lily yet mcgonagall couldntdo it herself she d have been risking her job and she d only been teaching a year or two so snape came up with a really great idea he and lily executed the prank he and mcgonagall planned it and mcgonagall gave them both alibis should they be up for suspicion so what did they do ginny asked impatiently she d been dying to hear the story but hermione hadntwanted to tell it before they d gotten back to the common room well lily stole back her underwear a day or so before the prank and used a spell to duplicate them mcgonagall went to the morning gryffindor quidditch practice the day of the prank and held james and sirius after giving them a talk about something or other in the locker rooms the rest of the team had gone on ahead to the castle so james and sirius started walking back alone well snape and lily put on masks and stuff and ambushed james and sirius on the way back they cast an impediment jinx took james and sirius clothes well lily did most of that part and then put james and sirius in the duplicated copies of lily bras and knickers they tied james to one of the quidditch goalposts sirius to another and then left some students came out on the grounds eventually and discovered them later that afternoon told the whole school about it it a hogwarts legend people still talk about it sometimes according to snape the four of them snickered at the image of james and sirius hanging from the goalpost in leopard print women underwear did anyone catch lily and snape ginny said tentatively no james and sirius swore up and down that it was snape and even though james liked lily too much to incriminate her sirius insisted she be punished but mcgonagall claimed she d asked lily and snape to wait in her office while she talked to james and sirius in the locker rooms and said that lily and snape were still in the office by the time she got back when sirius said he could prove it was lily underwear she showed that her underwear was safe and sound in her room we wonthave that sort of alibi harry pointed out yes we will snape will tell dumbledore hopefully in front of malfoy just to creep malfoy out more that i was in his office along with whichever one of you wants to come with me the two who dontpull the prank will be in the common room or something in plain view of plenty of students i was thinking ginny and harry could stay in the common room and ron and i could pull the prank snape could say he d caught us kissing in the hallway and had taken us to his office to deal out punishment it sounds pretty foolproof to me ron said slowly so snape will detain malfoy after quidditch practice ginny said actually i was thinking of ambushing him inside the castle and carrying him out to the field hermione said casually as though she was discussing an essay topic after all that what he did to me knocked me out carried me to snape room and took my clothes let return the favor shouldntbe too hard harry agreed all the quidditch captains have access to the training schedules so i ll look up a time when there no practice it would be best if it was a while before ravenclaw or hufflepuff practice ron pointed out if the gryffindor team came out and found him they might get blamed and if the slytherins came out they might cut malfoy down before anyone saw him not a lot of people go out to the pitch on saturdays of their own accord this time of year with all the quidditch practices going on so a quidditch team would have to find them make it hufflepuff hermione said malfoy pranked justin finch fletchley not too long ago removed his eyebrows or something yeah and hannah abbot sprouted purple fur they re trying to prove it was slytherin but no luck yet ginny added hufflepuff it is harry said he looked up as a soft tapping noise came from the direction of the common room window the outline of an owl was just visible in the dim outdoor lights hedwig she ll have lupin and sirius replies he got up and opened the window admitting his beautiful snowy owl hedwig landed on harry arm and stuck out her leg for harry to remove the letter read it aloud harry ginny said harry cleared his throat and began to read harry ah the seventh year prank war brings back some great memories you know your father and remus and i nailed so many slytherins well mostly just your father and i did but remus helped occasionally whether he admits it or not rosier wilkes avery the lestrange brothers and snape the best ones usually involved snape we even got some of the girls anyway here a list of what we did 1 we transfigured a water goblet into a chimpanzee and put it in the slytherin dormitory apparently it crapped all over the slytherins beds and then it started throwing its crap at the slytherin guys when they entered highly recommend that one 2 rabastan lestrange said something snotty to your mum and james grew his butt to about seven times its normal size and then made some comment about you always were a giant ass everyone made fun of him for the rest of the school year it was great 3 we hit snape and all of his slytherin pals with a charm that made them sing opera style instead of speak normally 4 james did this charm that grew huge boobs on snape interesting to say the least the charm is in an issue of witch weekly from the 1970 s check the library 5 a friend of lily in ravenclaw cantrecall her name found out that her boyfriend was cheating on her to get back at him lily cast this rather horrifying charm that made him go completely impotent for a good long while he never did live it down 6 childish yes but we hit snape with this charm that made him fart every two minutes it in the same book as the butt enlargement spell i dontremember the title but it had curse your enemies and avenge your friends in it 7 we booby trapped the slytherin common room every time a slytherin tried to go in or out they got hit by a spell that turned half their face red and the other half gold they knew it was us though since we used gryffindor colors i suggest you use different ones we served detention for a week if you cantfigure out how to do the spell hermione should know 8 we cast this charm that split open the back of snape robes and pants every time he d cast a spell to fix it the material would split open again and eventually he had to spend three hours with mcgonagall while the two of them tried to fix it poor woman had to see more than anyone should but hey all fair in love war and quidditch well i hope that helps you out some let me know if you need more i stole lily school diary not long after we graduated still have it lying around somewhere it should have more have fun and kick some slytherin ass all right sirius all four gryffindors were laughing their heads off as they finished reading that should be helpful ron gasped there another letter harry said through his laughter from lupin harry did his best to gain control and started reading harry i certain sirius is filling your head with all sorts of stories about our pasts in the prank war however i strongly advise you not to get involved i hope telling you this doesntgive you ideas but james and sirius and sometimes peter and i when one of their victims was extremely ticked off were hit with as many pranks as james and sirius executed if not more they both spent a day and a half unable to say or write any phrase other than i an annoying stupid prat which took quite a while for madam pomfrey to sort out another time amelia bones yes the current minister of magic got so angry at them she forged pictures of them holding hands and wearing dresses then posted the photographs all over the school moreover if hogwarts was holding a prank war it was nothing compared to the war between your father and sirius and lily evans please donttell sirius i told you this but he and james once stole from lily and in return she somehow knocked them out put them in bras and underwear and tied them to the quidditch goalposts in retaliation they well okay they threatened me until i agreed to use my access to the prefects bathroom to steal her clothes while she showered she knew it was me unfortunately since neither james nor sirius were prefects and the next thing i know i waking up nude in a clearing in the forbidden forest i knew better to strike back but james and sirius perpetuated the vicious cycle often enlisting peter help my seventh year was the most embarrassing time of my life by the time lily was through with us not to mention the wrath my two best friends managed to incur from the slytherins minerva mcgonagall and the majority of the hufflepuffs and ravenclaws and gryffindors if that not enough to discourage you think of what molly will do to you she ll have a fit if you lot get into trouble i d hate to see what would happen if you got caught putting a chimp in the slytherin dormitory or causing draco malfoy to sprout horns be careful harry even if you manage to avoid getting yourself in trouble you cantavoid being on the receiving end of pranks sometimes take a while to imagine how difficult it is to escape the forbidden forest clothed let alone nude and wandless and when you ve a nice clear picture imagine getting from the forbidden forest to gryffindor tower with nothing but some leaves try to stay out of trouble will you remus poor lupin ginny chuckled what do you think malfoy would do if he ended up naked in the middle of the forbidden forest hermione asked grinning wickedly why dontwe grow breasts on him and then leave him naked in the middle of the forbidden forest and find out ginny suggested now there a thought ron said with a mischievous glint in his eye author notes this chapter contains a bit more action between snape and hermione than i d intended it to have but the story just really flowed out this way it wontbe too bad and i swear this is the worst of it for the rest of the fic and probably the last of it you ll see at least for a good long while they ll still remain friends though probably this fic will always be a draco hermione story chapter five messing with malfoy hermione was doing her best not to laugh as she crept down the dungeon stairs to snape office she knew malfoy was following her during dinner she had winked at snape and smiled while malfoy was watching snape had grinned back and raised an eyebrow before leaving the great hall she had left not long afterwards and a discreet glance at the slytherin table on her way out had told her malfoy was leaving too she knocked on snape office and entered looking around and glimpsing malfoy blond hair around the corner the moment she closed the door she nodded at snape to let him know malfoy was listening hello professor she said in the same seductive voice she d used the previous night snape smiled deciding he might as well have some fun with their little game you re late miss granger i was beginning to worry you werentgoing to come hermione grinned and forced herself not to laugh i never have to worry about that she purred snape eyes widened and his jaw dropped slightly before he recovered yes and i ll make sure you never do he said making his voice sound a bit deeper ooh i love it when you use that tone she said with a giggle not to be outdone she added can we do it on the desk this time just this once outside the office draco was feeling faint this couldntbe happening could it snape couldntreally be screwing granger that was just no no way without thinking draco stepped up to the door and banged on it he didntknow what he was going to do but he had to find out for sure if they were really about to do what they were talking about hermione and snape both froze in horror malfoy she mouthed then promptly unzipped her robe what are you doing snape mouthed back startled she pointed at the door and began to untuck and unbutton her shirt stopping before the amount of skin uncovered became indecent and messing up her hair snape caught on and shucked off his own robe undoing the buttons at his shirt collar and cuffs and shaking his head to make his hair look a little messier before heading for the door and throwing it open draco he said coldly as a shocked draco stared up at him what can i do for you draco turned to look at hermione who blushed then glanced at her shirt widening her eyes as if only just realizing how she looked she tugged the shirt up around herself and then turned her back to him i was just stopping by to ask you about our homework draco said in a strangled voice i ll i ll um i didntknow you were busy i ll leave you alone now feel free to talk to me before class snape told him sounding irritated he closed the door in malfoy face and turned to hermione cantbelieve we forgot the silencing charm he told her throwing his voice in the direction of the door for malfoy benefit before pointing his wand at the door and saying silencio the two of them started laughing hysterically it was a long time before they got control and hermione managed to do it first an idea had occurred to her and the very thought made her cringe but she knew it was a good plan and had to pitch the idea to snape professor she said seriously oh the look on his face what hermione he asked she blinked having heard snape use her first name for the first time since she d met him she remembered her idea however and closed her eyes not wanting to see the look on his face when she told him professor she said her voice much more high pitched than usual give me a hickey snape was dumbfounded to say the least it was quite awhile before he could form a coherent thought whaaat he choked out malfoy will eventually start thinking we re playing him if he sees me with a hickey though so get weasley to give you one snape told her staring at her with an expression that clearly said oh hell no hermione shook her head her eyes still tightly shut first of all ron wouldntdo it once he figured out why i was asking him to do it which wonttake long considering i ve always told him i d hex him straight into st mungo if he ever did it before second malfoy going to be waiting for me the moment i step outside here if i donthave a hickey until tomorrow morning he going to know it was ron not you or at least suspect it was ron if he starts trying to weigh all the evidence that points to you and i doing well you know or not snape frowned he could definitely see the merit in marking her neck but that didntchange the fact he didntwant to do it i could get fired he said searching desperately for excuses hermione sighed and finally opened her eyes thirty galleons says dumbledore not only knows exactly what we re up to he thinks it hysterical snape couldnthelp but chuckle yes you re right fine i ll do it but if you ever tell anyone about this i ll avada kedavra your gryffindor arse hermione smiled slightly privately thinking that he didntneed to worry about her telling anyone she and snape stepped closer and she tilted her neck to the left and swept her hair away feeling as though she was presenting herself as a sacrifice to a vampire snape gave a small shudder and grabbed her shoulders lowering his mouth to her neck she cringed far more than creeped out as her professor who just a few weeks ago had been one of her least favorite people began sucking on her skin okay this is beyond weird she whispered a few moments later snape snorted and cracked up tickling her neck as he laughed against her she shivered slightly and tensed at the strangely pleasant feeling snape pulled back to appraise his work it barely noticeable he told her give me a second a second turned into a minute and a minute turned into several snape spent a while on the same spot and then moved up and down her neck covering the whole side of it hermione was starting to feel a little light headed somewhere along the line she d forgotten she was letting her professor mark her neck and had given in to the pleasurable feeling as he moved his mouth from one point of her neck to another his lips brushed her and she let out a strangled barely audible groan it was enough for snape to realize what he was doing and pull back quickly surprised at himself i may have overdone it he said ruefully hermione eyes stayed closed half in embarrassment and half in a deranged sort of delight oh the more the better she said off handedly should i do the other side then snape asked trying to keep the hopefulness out of his voice he was mildly surprised when hermione nodded and tilted her neck the other way it was a very long time before he stopped and he only did so because he was running out of space and wishing more and more that he could nibble her ear or go lower or perhaps do more it had been way too long since he d done this sort of thing well he said slowly draco will be downright frightened i do hope you ve thought of an explanation for weasley hermione blushed i not going to tell ron i going to tell him i used a spell if he sees me before i can do a concealment charm why didnt you use a spell snape asked suspiciously because i dontknow any duh she said rolling her eyes why on earth would i bother to go learn a hickey faking spell if there even is such a thing good point snape said with a smile well you should get going yes definitely oh she told him about the letters from sirius and remus leaving out the pranks that had been done to snape the two of them were soon laughing the bizarre feeling of the neck incident forgotten i helped lily put lupin in the forest snape explained she lured him outside by asking him to go for a walk with her i followed knocked him out and dragged him into the woods we stayed away from the major monsters kept to the outskirts of the forest and all but it was still difficult for him to get out never mind get into the castle a ravenclaw girl saw him and snapped some pictures she used them to blackmail him into taking her to a dance he failed to mention that hermione said cracking up i not surprised well it getting late you should get back before curfew hermione nodded same time tomorrow i have papers to grade snape said regretfully she frowned i have papers to write come to think of it trying to stay ahead and all all right maybe the day after tomorrow no that saturday remember you have to catch the head girl kissing her boyfriend and detain them in your office then tell professor dumbledore about it so they have an alibi when malfoy is discovered hanging from the quidditch goalpost in a black lace thong and bra where are you going to get a black lace thong and bra snape teased smiling uh ginny hermione said blushing ginny huh yes from ginny she repeated firmly honest oh no dontsay that she scolded herself oops damn hadntthat word caused enough trouble sure granger sure fine i using my own knickers you happy hermione snapped i using my old worn out former favorite black bra and a thong that too small now i own black underwear i admit it i own more than one pair too snape held up his hands in surrender sorry couldntresist he cleared his throat a touch of the awkwardness returning anyway start snogging weasley at noon right outside the library i ll be waiting gotcha bye hermione called she picked up her robe and left hurriedly she d just turned the corner in the hallway when she ran smack into malfoy and stumbled back nearly falling on her butt watch where you re going she snapped draco grabbed her arm as she tried to walk away his eyes glinting what happened to your neck granger been having a little fun with snape are you mad hermione retorted schooling her features into a slightly worried but mostly defiant expression and keeping her voice less than confident for the proper effect me and snape what potions have you been drinking draco suddenly pushed her against the wall glaring into her eyes she glowered back not wanting to let him know he was getting to her draco glanced down straight down her still half opened shirt hermione gaped at him unable to believe he was actually checking her out you should button up your shirt draco said staring at her chest and smirking he met her eye again with a mocking gaze she pushed him with strength she didntknow she had shoving him off her and against the opposite wall hard dontconcern yourself with my shirt she snarled her voice dangerous and low her body shaking with rage she drew her wand pointing it right between his eyes draco merely smirked back maintaining eye contact for a long while before letting his eyes slip to her chest once again hermione lip curled and she stomped away knowing he was just trying to get to her ginny looked up in surprise as hermione returned late once again as disheveled as the previous night but also infuriated looking like she was ready to throttle someone what wrong ginny asked as hermione turned towards the girls dormitory staircase hermione spun her expression softening as she spotted ginny hey she said trying to calm herself where are harry and ron the hospital wing ginny replied absently what wrong hermione eyes widened the hospital wing why are they okay they re fine pansy parkinson tried to do that one spell remus told us about the one where james and sirius could only say i an annoying stupid prat it didntwork right no surprise considering this is pansy parkinson we re talking about they both went half blind and have been constantly repeating omelette du fromage for the past hour and a half how exactly does one go from i an annoying stupid prat to the french phrase for cheese omelet hermione demanded honestly and she a prefect puh lease ginny smiled oh so that what omelette du fromage means i thought it was gibberish anyway madam pomfrey is trying to alter the antidote potion but she has to figure out just how the curse was botched they should be out by morning though so question number one what the hell did you do with snape that got you covered in hickeys and number two why are you so pissed off he didntdo something no of course not hermione said hastily she cast a concealment charm on her neck and filled ginny in on the story of letting snape mark her so malfoy would freak then explained what malfoy had done he just trying to upset you herm ginny told her her eyes still wide from the shock of hearing about snape sucking neck hermione neck which was even more bizarre and malfoy scoping her out true but it was thoroughly disgusting especially considering he seen me naked what ginny shrieked duh ginny the prank remember he took my clothes and put me in bed with snape hermione shivered oh yeah almost forgot ginny said sheepishly then her eyes narrowed well perhaps an interrogation is in order dontyou think what do you mean when you ve got him hanging from the goalpost maybe you should ask him a few questions you know hit him with a truth spell or threaten to leave him there if he doesnttalk leave him there anyway of course yes of course that not a bad idea but then he ll have proof it was me proof he cantuse malfoy would be incriminating himself if he told about the prank he played on you and snape hmm true an interrogation that could get interesting chapter six gryffindor strikes back hermione and ron left the common room at ten in the morning calling out their good byes to ginny and harry who were sitting together on the couch chatting about quidditch it was a bleak day and the majority of the school had gotten a lot of homework so the common room was nearly filled with people studying or else goofing off indoors where it was warm dozens of people saw ginny and harry sitting together in the middle of the room just as they d planned ron and hermione went to the library hermione checked out some books and they left a little before noon she started kissing ron in the hallway outside the library glad to lose herself in her boyfriend and forget the things she d done with snape which still grossed her out ever since her last visit to his office her logical side kept trying to go back to the day and explain away her feelings and emotions and actions or get her to examine them her stubborn more humane side however was perfectly happy to never ever think about what she d done again she didnteven hear snape when he first arrived lost as she was with ron between the prank war homework ron quidditch practices and hermione meetings with snape she hadntgotten to see her boyfriend as much as she liked weasley granger stop that at once ron reluctantly pulled away and hermione pouted and tried to pull him back down to kiss her before ron turned to glare at snape remembering the plan hermione spun around trying to act like she usually would if she d been caught snogging her boyfriend by a teacher like snape ten points from gryffindor each follow me snape growled the two sighed and followed him down to the dungeons everything was going according to plan not far from his office was a shadowy alcove where malfoy lay face down immobilized by the full body bind did he see you hermione whispered no snape said changing his voice to hide his identity he handed them an inkbottle which had been changed into a portkey the quidditch pitch is clear the closest person to it is hagrid but he hung over and asleep snape added did you have to take points off ron asked snape sourly while he knew the whole snape hermione thing was a good idea he hated snape and he hated the thought of snape spending time with ron girlfriend even more yes snape said smiling coldly hermione rolled her eyes not now guys we re behind schedule she said she placed the inkbottle on malfoy back her and ron each keeping a finger on it hermione handed snape her library books as the portkey activated as they landed near the gryffindor side goalposts hermione and ron pulled up the hoods on their cloaks so that they wouldntbe recognizable from a distance i not looking forward to this part ron muttered as they rolled a furious petrified malfoy over i ll do it hermione told him reluctantly ron shot her a grateful look and turned his back hermione smirked down at malfoy and began to tug off his clothes the spell was starting to wear off enough so that he could twitch his fingers and make faint facial expressions and he looked absolutely enraged he managed the choke out the word kill as she removed his knickers doing her best not to look but eventually looking anyway blushing as she did so and casting a furtive glance in the direction of her boyfriend back making sure neither of them could see her expression she put her old fraying underwear on his chest chanting a spell to make it the right size for him and slipping it on him which was a bit difficult to do to a rigid person and involved a lot of embarrassment and lifting and flipping him over he was quite dirty by the time he was dressed another spell lifted malfoy into the air golden ropes that appeared to be pure light and energy binding his wrists and ankles she cast a silencing charm then a counter curse to the immobilizing spell malfoy immediately began screaming but no sound left his mouth hermione grinned as with a motion of her wand the ropes extended and dragged draco to the center goalpost fastening him to the pole lightly giving him the appearance of a ritual sacrifice awaiting the dragon to come feast hermione and ron laughed as they picked up the empty inkbottle hufflepuff quidditch practice in fourteen minutes and counting ron said the portkey would return them to snape office ten minutes before the hufflepuffs practice hermione nodded and cast the minor truth spell she d found the day before it wasntvery powerful but if during the casting the victim wasntprepared and if they werentvery good at shaking off mind control spells like the imperius curse it would work for a short time malfoy eyes glazed slightly as it took effect hermione smile widened as she lifted the silencing charm malfoy she said cheerfully you re going to tell me exactly how you played that little prank on me and snape arentyou malfoy malfoy nodded stupidly and began to speak the prank took six and a half weeks to plan i even worked on it over the summer pansy parkinson crabbe goyle and i made polyjuice potion and stole lavender brown hairbrush during care of magical creatures class to get her hair the sleeping potion took me three weeks to make so i brewed it at the same time as the polyjuice one i diluted the sleeping potion in the same dose for both of you knowing snape would get farther than you based on body weight and physical strength he made it to his room you made it up the stairs in the entrance hall the day before we followed snape and got the password to his private chambers and then we tailed some gryffindor first years found out where the common room was and what the password was then we gave you and snape the potion and followed you out of the great hall we waited for you to collapse goyle picked you up and carried you to a secret passage in the dungeons i took all your clothes and your wand and gave them to pansy she took crabbe as a lookout mostly and went to the gryffindor common room drank the polyjuice potion with lavender hair and put your stuff on your bed i checked to make sure you were definitely out cold how hermione asked suspiciously something in the way he d said it smiling even through the mental fog the spell created gave her a sickened feeling i touched you goyle and i had a good laugh about it where did you touch me hermione roared oh gross oh nothing will prevent me from killing you ron growled his neck and ears red and his wand out hermione put a restraining hand on his arm though she wasntsure if it was to keep ron from getting into trouble or to prevent him from kicking malfoy ass before she could it was nothing major malfoy said smirking the spell was wearing off he was regaining some of his emotions just ran my hands over her awhile then i broke into snape room and carried her in myself goyle stood watch snape had passed out on his bed so i turned him over used a spell to remove his clothes and arranged granger on top of him put the blanket on them and left hermione couldntthink straight her hand tightened around the inkbottle until her knuckles turned white he had drugged her kidnapped her stripped her put his hands on her body while she slept and then put her in a compromising position with snape snape of all people she would kill him she would kill him kill him kill him she took a step forward but before she could get her wand up she felt the familiar tug behind her navel as the portkey activated and she was thrown against ron as they landed in snape office how did it go snape asked eagerly hermione didntanswer she regained her balance turned and headed for the door i ll kill him she whispered i ll kill him ron stared at her having never seen her so angry snape a former fairly good quidditch player had enough reflexes to get over his shock run to her before she could reach the door and throw his arms around her waist from behind lifting her up and halting her i ll kill him she shouted again and again kicking and flailing as she fought to reach the door nearly overturning the spindly snape calm down snape growled wrestling with her as she struggled to get free easy for you to say malfoy wasnttouching you in your sleep she yelled ron who couldnthelp finding the entire scene very comical did his best not to laugh at the disgusting mental picture of malfoy running his hands over snape while snape snored hermione he began slowly trying to reason with her after all he could kill malfoy later provided hermione didntget there first so he had to calm her down i ll kill him i should have guessed when he looked down my shirt yesterday listen to me snape hissed too busy trying to detain her to let the shock of that statement sink in ron however now looked nearly as angry as hermione he was obviously struggling not to go marching off himself you cantkill him so stop trying if you want to go to dumbledore about it we can try but you d have to explain a lot of things that are going to be difficult to explain we can however get revenge eye for an eye tooth for a tooth prank for a prank it the uncut version of the hogwarts way understand hermione stopped kicking and snape set her down malfoy hadntstared at her the other night any more than some of the other guys at hogwarts hell she d caught ron and even harry looking down her shirt or up her skirt staring at her chest or her rear before she didntreally think it warranted her filing a complaint especially not when her shirt had been half open but touching her in her sleep was unacceptable it would warrant much stronger revenge than a prank what would happen if she complained about what malfoy had done would his mother connections get him out of it narcissa malfoy who had never been a death eater had done a lot to restore the malfoys reputation after lucius death and still had plenty of ties to the ministry plus draco wasntout of school yet so the majority of the punishment he would have faced from the ministry would be nullified anyway sure she could press formal charges but the ministry had ways of making her admit that she d just tied malfoy to a goalpost in a bra and thong even if she tried to lie at a trial and had he even been telling the truth the truth spell wasntvery potent and he had shown emotion under it was that really natural with the spell she didntthink so people regained their emotions pretty slowly as the spell wore off and surely the spell would have lasted longer than that malfoy could have faked the whole confession telling her half truths lying just to piss her off that was exactly malfoy style she didntdoubt what he d said about how he d executed the prank but touching her in her sleep she wasntexactly malfoy type at least she sincerely hoped she wasn t and something told her malfoy wouldntdo that his animosity towards her had probably kept him from caring about anything but the prank and slytherins werentones to look at muggle born witches and see anything but a mudblood it was possible he d added the whole touching thing in knowing she d be upset maybe of course malfoy assumed she would tell dumbledore the truth if she thought malfoy had done something that horrid to her and then the story of malfoy prank would be all over school and she d get nailed for the crime of tying him to the goalpost while he went free because he hadntreally done anything she was becoming more and more certain that the spell hadntworked at all and malfoy wouldnthave told her he d done that if he really had he didntexactly want to get expelled so he probably hadntfelt her in her sleep still he had acted in a way that was unsavory enough to unleash her complete fury she wouldntgo to dumbledore but whether or not he d touched her she d get revenge on him as if he had there was still the matter of him checking her out in the hallway too trivial or not she wasntgoing to let that go hermione are you okay ron asked tentatively i fine she said absently i was just thinking she told them her ideas and both snape and ron agreed they started to talk about ideas for revenge which was a lot more awkward with ron there before they could come up with any plan of action the fireplace flared with green fire and mcgonagall head appeared in the flames severus she said excitedly it just like what we did to potter and black draco malfoy is hanging from the quidditch goalpost in women underwear she said gleefully she blinked when she caught sight of hermione and ron i mean uh it horrible when w we discover whoever did this we ll have to to um severely punish them most of the school is out there now and we better hurry and see er see if we can discover who did this of course right snape said dryly mcgonagall head vanished same old minerva you re just like her granger come on you two let go look for the culprit draco screamed in frustration as granger and weasley disappeared he d been hoping his fake story about what he d done to her would piss granger off enough that she would stay on the pitch too long and get caught her lame truth spell was utterly useless he might not be the smartest person in school but he was a death eater son for crying out loud resisting mind altering spells like the imperius curse and truth agents had been part of his elementary magical training he hadntthought they d actually leave him on the pitch he d figured it was an empty threat to get him to confess to the prank and as such he d told her what he d done then made it sound worse to make her even angrier though he d tried not to make it bad enough that they d kill him oh the look her face on weasley face all right team a voice said from the direction of the locker rooms let practice like it the quidditch world cup oh no what was that weasley had said about the hufflepuff team practicing soon seven hufflepuff quidditch players came into view a few seconds later catching sight of him almost immediately they gaped at him for a good long while before all of them burst out laughing in unison i ve got to go tell hannah susan bones gasped turning towards the castle wait ernie macmillan captain of the quidditch team called her back we cantjust run off and tell our friends that wouldntbe right draco stared at him in disbelief and then groaned inwardly as an evil gleam appeared in macmillan eyes susan you go tell every hufflepuff you see eleanor tell the ravenclaws kevin you take gryffindor and make absolutely sure you tell harry potter hermione granger and the weasleys laura go for the library rose you take the great hall and zacharias i staying with you zacharias smith interrupted this is great besides you dontwant anyone to accuse you and they might if you re standing out here alone all right hey and susan while you re in the dorms grab my camera ernie called after the departing quidditch team draco vowed in that instant that no matter what it took he would make granger pay for this and pay dearly chapter seven no one messes with a gryffindor see you harry ginny seamus finnigan called bye harry dean thomas said pointedly ignoring ginny his relationship with her had ended rather badly last year though that was mostly thanks to the overprotective ron bye both of them replied absently they were rather absorbed in the whispered conversation they d been having while sitting on the couch together mostly oblivious to the common room as they discussed what hermione and ron were up to as dean and seamus opened the portrait hole to leave however a small hufflepuff fourth year boy named kevin whitby who was the seeker for the hufflepuff quidditch team and currently dressed in his yellow quidditch robes hurtled inside listen up he yelled the gryffindors all turned to stare at him in astonishment few members of other houses had the guts to barge into gryffindor common room uninvited and those that were brave enough were rarely in hufflepuff if any of you are interested draco malfoy is tied up on the quidditch field in lingerie what several people exclaimed half the room ran for the portrait hole and the others ran to the window trying in vain to see the quidditch pitch harry and ginny looked appropriately shocked and eager as they rushed for the exit harry ginny kevin called have you seen hermione and ron ernie told me to tell them they went to the library kevin ginny told him come on this is a must see dontjust stand there by the time the gryffindors made it to the pitch virtually every ravenclaw and hufflepuff in the school was already there even some slytherins had turned up to see cameras went off like crazy and laughter and mocking remarks filled the stadium mcgonagall came hurrying over followed closely by snape ron and hermione you malfoy shouted glaring at hermione snape broke the spell that bound malfoy and tossed his cloak at malfoy as he fell to the ground snape and mcgonagall forced the crowd to disperse holding harry ginny ron hermione and ernie macmillan who was head boy and after all the one who found malfoy behind it was them malfoy snarled pointing at hermione and ron is that true miss granger mcgonagall asked in a no nonsense tone hermione shook her head but before she could reply snape asked how long were you out here draco about a half hour maybe forty five minutes malfoy said the two of them used a portkey about ten minutes before the hufflepuffs they ve been in my office since a little after noon snape interrupted discussing how best to serve detention malfoy blinked then it must have been potter and the little weasel pretending to be them he exclaimed glaring at harry and ginny we ve been in the common room since about ten ten thirty harry snapped ask anyone dean and seamus were leaving the common room when kevin whitby came in and told us you were out here couldntresist coming to look he grinned coldly mcgonagall shot a knowing glance at snape any other guesses mr malfoy malfoy eyes widened as he realized what was going on it was granger and weasley you re covering for them he yelled at snape the day i cover for potter and his friends is the day you marry a muggle born snape said coldly they were in my office anyone else you d like to try to frame where would we get a portkey by the way hermione added it illegal to create an unauthorized one but i bet you know how anyway you know it all mudblood malfoy shouted mr malfoy i will not have slurs like that in this school ten points from slytherin miss granger your wand if you please mcgonagall said hermione handed it over priori incantatem mcgonagall intoned wisps of smoke formed a mockery of the silencing charm hermione had lifted mcgonagall handed hermione wand back and both professors fixed malfoy with calm expressions that is most certainly not the spell for creating portkeys mcgonagall told malfoy coolly interrupting him before he could argue she performed the same spell on harry ron and ginny wands but none of them had used anything remotely resembling a portkey spell that settles it mr malfoy if you didntget a good look at your attackers i did it was them he insisted he shot an angry look at snape knowing better than to accuse a teacher of casting an illegal spell especially a teacher like snape snape gave him a quick evil grin that vanished before mcgonagall saw it then i will talk to the headmaster about finding other forms of evidence mcgonagall continued calmly unfazed until then i suggest you return to your dormitory at once and put on some proper clothes dontforget to return my cloak snape added shortly draco glowered at all of them before hurrying off his usually pale face tinged pink they all watched him go doing their best not to smile surprisingly it was mcgonagall who cracked up first harry ron hermione ginny and ernie stared at her rather stunned to see the usually prim and proper professor doubled over with laughter oh that was priceless she gasped through her laughter did you see his face snape smiled wiped the smirk right off him didntwe he said slyly he too started laughing and harry ron ginny and ernie who d never seen snape laugh in the seven years they d known him edged away cautiously as though snape might be dangerous oh and twenty points to gryffindor mcgonagall said five for each of you harry ron hermione and ginny gulped horrified that mcgonagall had caught them for what harry asked desperately trying to look innocent come off it potter mcgonagall told him still laughing tears streaming down her face it was i after all who helped do the same thing to your father twenty five years ago hermione sighed realizing she should have expected mcgonagall to figure it out as they were copycatting a prank involving her and sirius and james are you going to turn us in she asked in a small voice you tied him to the goalpost ernie exclaimed looking scandalized he puffed out his chest so that his head boy badge gleamed in the sunlight but but you re head girl hermione and you three are prefects the four gryffindors shrugged smiling guiltily you have alibis too alibis can be faked macmillan snape said coldly he straightened up and gave ernie his most threatening look and if you tell another soul what you ve just learned you ll wish you d never heard of hogwarts am i clear yes yes crystal clear ernie said quickly more shocked that snape was suggesting he was covering for ron and hermione than he was afraid of retribution he turned back to his fellow students so so you he trailed off shaking his head and starting to laugh also that was great you guys the look on his face when we found him how did you do it where d you even get the idea for something like that from a friend hermione said innocently glancing at snape out of the corner of her eye a friend ernie repeated following her gaze and looking at snape in disbelief the whole school gone mad tell me about it ron muttered looking at mcgonagall who was still laughing ernie shook his head thanks for the laugh guys this ll go down in hogwarts history it right up there with the weasley twins escaping that umbridge beast well i have to go find my quidditch team and get some practice time in this was worth cutting into quidditch practice though well i ll see you i have to write sirius harry said as ernie left shifting awkwardly from foot to foot as he looked at his two strictest professors now shaking with mirth like deranged hyenas i need to write fred and george guess i ll use a school owl pig still isntback from taking my last letter to them ron said watching snape and mcgonagall warily as though worried their lapse in character was going to develop into something more frightening i ve got a letter to send too bill said to fill him in when it was over ginny said absently chuckling at the two laughing professors i told him about it when we first started planning i ll come with you hermione said i expect it d be a good idea to hide before we get mobbed by people wanting the full story though we do need to plan how we re going to top this that for sure if all else fails harry said mischievously i hear some slytherin or another once helped my mum knock out remus and leave him naked in the forbidden forest snape tried to glare at him but was laughing too hard to get the proper effect we need to keep up on our other plan granger snape called after her as the gryffindors walked off tomorrow at seven hermione nodded and left with her friends mcgonagall did her best to get control of herself oh yes i d forgotten about what you and lily did to remus she said chuckling that was excellent also yes it was wasntit snape said mildly so malfoy said something about a portkey mcgonagall said nice touch we should have thought of that all those years ago it was granger idea snape said with a shrug what your other plan by the way mcgonagall asked as she and snape made their way back to the castle i expect you ll find out soon enough snape said ruefully come now severus you can trust me mcgonagall pleaded i know but the other prank we re working on is hideously embarrassing snape replied with a shudder ooh you have to tell me now mcgonagall insisted more embarrassing than what mr malfoy just went through in my book yes snape said though i cantsay i ve ever had the pleasure of being tied to a goalpost in granger underwear mcgonagall raised an eyebrow fine i ll find out myself snape winced at the idea of mcgonagall happening upon one of his faked conversations with hermione oh boy still as he and mcgonagall approached the castle he couldnthelp smiling again he hadnthad so much fun since his own days at hogwarts before the death eaters had convinced him to join them he felt alive in a strange sort of way as though he were back in school and working out how to take james potter down a notch suddenly he found himself wondering what he would have done if it hadntbeen for the dark lord if he would have found a wife and had a family and maybe even gotten a job other than teaching idiot children wondering if he would have gotten over his rotten childhood and become happy what do you think i would have done if the first war had never happened minerva he blurted out mcgonagall raised her eyebrows at him why he shrugged just curious she gave him a shrewd look seeing right through the casual demeanor well severus i doubt you d have taught here she said thoughtfully snape was a pureblood and had inherited a fortune almost as large as lucius malfoy had he had become a teacher when he had turned spy for dumbledore maybe in the beginning he d entertained the notion of being considered a good teacher or being respected but that had passed as he grew more and more unhappy and bitter because of the war i dontknow mcgonagall went on i suppose you would have moved on lived a normal life snape nodded i suppose so mcgonagall glanced at him out of the corner of her eye you know severus it not too late it never too late snape snorted at the clich but he couldnthelp hoping she was right by the time harry ron hermione and ginny made it back to the castle the entire school was buzzing with the story when they entered the common room nearly every gryffindor was there applauding and cheering oh what the hell hermione muttered and climbed onto a table grinning her head off she bowed to the common room with a flourish thank you thank you she called over the noise let it be known throughout hogwarts that no one messes with a gryffindor harry ron and ginny laughed ron climbing up next to hermione and harry and ginny following suit on another table and there plenty more where that came from ron shouted close the bets ginny yelled nothing will top this i guarantee it harry ron hermione and ginny were regarded as heroes after they unofficially claimed responsibility for the prank several people gave them pictures taken of malfoy hanging from the goalpost calling the photos both souvenirs and thank you gifts the majority of the students who d betted on whether or not harry ron hermione and ginny would have the best prank went ahead and cashed in not caring in the slightest that the year wasnteven half over and the prank war was far from finished the next day hermione once again headed to snape office after dinner with a very sour furious draco malfoy following discreetly harry and ron had both protested her going to the dungeon alone now that malfoy was likely to be murderous but she d pointed out that harry and ron werentsupposed to know she was going down there it would be even more dangerous for her to take ginny and have ginny stand outside snape door alone and wait where malfoy could sneak up on her and hermione would be unable to hear if he did thanks to the silencing charms she and snape used hermione doubted malfoy would ambush her for the simple fact that malfoy would figure snape was expecting her and would realize that snape might come looking for her if she didntshow plus it was too risky so soon after he d just accused them all of performing a prank if hermione ended up cursed it wouldntbe too difficult to pin it on malfoy malfoy would not only know that but would assume snape might try to frame him or set him up if something happened to snape lover as far as walking back from snape office however she had agreed to meet up with harry in the entrance hall two hours after dinner officially ended just to make certain malfoy wasntgoing to attack her as she left the office was close enough to the entrance hall that malfoy wouldnthurt her before she reached it for fear snape might overhear so unless malfoy was stupid enough to get caught she was covered either way still that didntprevent her from being nervous at the idea that draco malfoy a death eater son with an extensive background in the dark arts was very angry and following her which gave him a clear shot at her back she increased her speed as she took the stairs to the dungeon and practically ran along the corridor anxious to get in the office before malfoy decided he didntgive a damn if he got caught as long as she got hurt snape called come in a split second after she started knocking and she rushed inside and shut the door hurriedly behind her is something wrong miss granger he asked hermione shook her head mouthed later and smiled jerking her head at the door to let snape know malfoy was behind her again i just missed you she said grinning at the thought of what malfoy would be thinking right now you re late again snape remarked i terribly sorry she gushed harry and ron think i in the library but it still makes them suspicious when i just start running off make sure your tardiness doesntbecome a habit snape said a fiendish grin appeared on his face or i shall have to give you a detention he added and then cracked up muffling his laughter with his hand hermione gaped at him biting back a giggle you could give me one anyway she said in as sultry a voice as she could manage while desperately wanting to laugh you d like that wouldntyou snape said trying his best to keep his voice even donti always she said innocently snape decided now would be a good time to cast the silencing charm before he could however a loud retching noise sounded in the hallway quickly shucking off his robe and unbuttoning a few shirt buttons he strode past hermione and opened the door draco malfoy was a few feet away his hands braced on his knees as he puked violently on the stone floor snape wrinkled his noise and waited for the vomiting to stop before casting a vanishing spell and fixing malfoy with a cold stare i suggest you go see madam pomfrey draco he said coolly before going back inside the office casting a silencing charm and bursting into peals of laughter was he throwing up hermione exclaimed yes snape laughed hard too oh this is fun wait you never told me what he thought of your neck hermione frowned and told him the story i was beyond pissed off about it she said talk about sick well he a boy boys do that snape said i know you find it disgusting but try to take it in stride and add it to your reasons i going to get him if it the last thing i do list hermione nodded yeah well i better get going harry and ron are waiting for me in the entrance hall you know making sure malfoy doesnthit me snape frowned maybe i should walk with you she shook her head no if harry and ron saw you it could screw things up all right then well until next time hermione nodded and left heading back up to the entrance hall at high speed her fear of malfoy keeping her from thinking about anything else harry and ron were waiting at the top of the stairs when they saw her both of them stared in shock their eyes widening she stopped confused what going on guys she asked harry swallowed hard his face reddening as he turned his back to her um mione where are your clothes hermione looked down she was wearing nothing but a black lace bra and thong chapter eight nuclear war ginny was watching the portrait hole eagerly waiting for her friends to come back after the latest rendezvous with snape at last ron walked in alone ginny frowned as her brother approached what wrong she asked where hermione and harry ron cringed uh we had a slight problem he lowered his voice to a whisper grab some clothes of hers as discreetly as you can and meet us in the room of requirement less than ten minutes later ginny arrived carrying a change of clothes hermione was absolutely livid she was pacing around in harry robe which was so large on hermione that the shoulders slipped down and made it obvious that hermione was wearing no shirt beneath it uh oh ginny said wincing what happened malfoy must ve got her as she was leaving snape s ron explained gee do you think hermione snarled i cantbelieve i didntnotice i could have been seen by anyone in the school by everyone in the school what did he do ginny asked hermione opened harry robe in front revealing the bra and thong she d put on malfoy it an illusion spell hermione growled it lasts for about three hours well at least your clothes will come back ron said and your wand harry added all four of them had gotten special arm cuffs during the last hogsmeade weekend the cuff sent their wand shooting into their hand with a flick of their wrist and had protective spells built in so that the wand could not be damaged in any way or removed by anyone other than the owner hermione arm cuff had also been affected by malfoy spell look on the bright side at least you made him puke hermione sighed as she closed up the robe well i guess it the forbidden forest for malfoy hermione said grimly of course it is ginny said soothingly handing over the outfit she d brought to hermione we ll take him real deep in too can we put him near aragog ron asked hopefully i d love it if malfoy was eaten by a giant spider harry and ginny laughed hermione mouth twitched until she finally let herself giggle a small part of me says no she said the rest of me says hell yeah the small part of you is an idiot ginny said firmly the small part of me is my logical part actually hermione said as she slipped on the extra clothes and the three of them headed back toward the common room it says that malfoy will retaliate with something major if we do something like that malfoy will retaliate no matter what we do harry pointed out hermione nodded slowly yeah i know i just well part of me knows that the further i take this the more likely it is i ll eventually end up in azkaban for strangling him dontbe ridiculous ron said you d never be put in azkaban you d be commended and even if they tried to take you away we d help you escape ginny said brightly of course but then if you started strangling malfoy the rest of us would probably join in harry said i mean if one of us gets to kill him we all do so we d have to go on the run with you hermione laughed well you better ask sirius for tips on hiding from dementors then she said because i going to make him suffer the school was in total chaos most of the time the prank war was not incredibly large this time however it had gone nuclear as there was increased tension between slytherin and the rest of the houses this was mostly because of the war against voldemort and harry presence at hogwarts many slytherins had lost parents to death or imprisonment in the final battles between voldemort and the order of the phoenix and many students from every house had lost relatives to voldemort and the death eaters then too there was the fact that thanks to the large and elaborate pranks that had already happened far more people wanted in on the fun the fun that sent dozens of people to the hospital wing each day almost every class that snape mcgonagall or flitwick taught was interrupted by someone coming in requesting an antidote or counter curse as per the teacher specialty few students in seventh year and almost as few in some of the years below didntfind themselves disfigured discolored covered in slime or otherwise victimized by a prank in between the major league pranks minor practical jokes were frequent and annoying in the same day harry sprouted a tail ron somehow ended up with a butt so large he couldntwalk ginny was turned slytherin green and silver and hermione was hit with a charm that made her hair frizz out into an afro extending four feet from her head all over hogwarts classes were missed detention was given and the house points were dropping at an alarming rate after malfoy illusion spell on her clothes wore off hermione eventually calmed down enough to realize that the forbidden forest was in fact their best idea so they decided to save it for a good long while instead of waking up in the forbidden forest malfoy and crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson for good measure woke up levitating over the lake their clothes and entire bodies painted with red and gold stripes where they screamed hysterically at the sight of the amused giant squid poking at them from below with its tentacles it was obviously a gryffindor prank and it was beyond obvious that harry ron hermione and ginny had done it and in years past the slytherin head of house would have given them detentions and docked points as punishment harry ron hermione and ginny received quite a few souvenir pictures from other students and twenty points to gryffindor from mcgonagall malfoy response wasntbad compared to some of the other pranks the backs of harry ron hermione and ginny clothing were hit by a vanishing spell which unfortunately meant that the front of their clothing didntwant to stay up they were all forced to wrap the front of their robes around them like they would towels after a shower and seek out professor flitwick who had to stop a second year charms class to restore their clothes the four gryffindors had to get snape help to retaliate they transfigured a pair of water goblets into two male chimpanzees then stunned them to keep them quiet as snape went into the slytherin dormitory and put one in the seventh year girls bedroom and one in the boys when the seventh year slytherins discovered the chimps they were immediately hit with large amounts of chimp feces and no small amount of jokes were made in the days following about the fact that one chimp had tried to hump both pansy and millicent bulstrode the cleaning of the slytherin dormitory took hours and malfoy was treated for a nasty bite on one arm malfoy revenge was sure to include nothing less than pure undiluted horror the idea that malfoy would use a repeated phrase spell was laughable therefore no one expected it one week after the chimp incident hermione was sitting in the great hall for dinner next to harry and across from ron surrounding them were their fellow gryffindor seventh year students and a few girls in ginny year hermione turned to harry and said pass the salt harry just after malfoy seeing her about to speak to harry hit her with the spell so everyone but hermione heard do you want to want to have sex in the library dean seamus lavender parvati neville and ginny roommates the only ones sitting close enough to hear stopped what they were doing and stared at her in shock as ron neck and ears went red um wha what harry choked out pass the salt harry hermione repeated not noticing or hearing anything strange do you want to have sex in the library was what harry ron and the others heard er hermione would you stop staring at me like that and hand me the damn salt hermione said exasperated do you want to have sex in the library hermione demanded harry swallowed and looked at ron now she sounded annoyed that harry wasntgiving her an answer ron looked ready to explode with fury why hello granger malfoy said having come over to stand behind her smirking down at her feeling all right go away malfoy hermione said coldly narrowing her eyes at him to harry and ron her expression made it seem like she was looking at malfoy appraisingly before asking him to have sex maybe some other time granger malfoy said laughing what the hell are you doing ron bellowed at hermione so suddenly that everyone in the vicinity jumped what wrong with you ron hermione said in confusion wondering why he was angry that she d told malfoy to go away to everyone watching it looked as though hermione had propositioned ron uncertainly as if she was sure he wouldntwant to at least not as much as harry or malfoy would harry took one look at malfoy face and understood it a repeated phrase spell ron malfoy must have hit her with it harry hissed quietly not wanting anyone to overhear hopefully he and ron could get hermione to the hospital wing before anyone figured out what malfoy had done hermione didntcatch everything harry said all she could hear was malfoy must have hit her with it and assuming malfoy had pulled some prank on her that she couldntsee yet she stood up and glared at malfoy angrily i ll make you pay for this malfoy she screamed fed up with his antics clangs and loud clattering noises sounded throughout the hall as goblets and silverware were dropped people froze in mid bite or with food or drink halfway to their mouths hermione stopped just before drawing her wand wondering why there was complete and utter silence in the great hall no one was moving at the staff table the teachers were too shocked to react harry winced and put his face in his hands ron was utterly mortified and looked ready to faint hermione had just loudly asked malfoy to have sex we ll get you for this malfoy harry snarled finally regaining his senses and jumping to his feet grabbing hermione arm what are you mad at me for potter malfoy retorted smirking granger the one who wants to have sex not me hermione jaw dropped unable to believe what he had just suggested oblivious about what she had said although now that i think about it malfoy went on grinning at the furious ron hermione come on we ll get you to the hospital wing harry said he had half a mind to curse malfoy into oblivion and probably would have teachers presence be damned but he knew that he had to get ron out of there fast seeing hermione about to protest he clamped a hand over her mouth and half dragged her out of the hall ron following quickly i knew books werentthe only reason she spent so much time in the library malfoy called after them cackling madly as he went back to his seat hermione kept trying to talk through harry hand as he pulled her out of the hall and up the stairs hermione listen you ve been hit with a repeated phrase spell harry told her donttalk okay someone might hear hermione nodded and harry released her she followed him to the hospital wing in silence wondering what she d been repeating and for how long oh dear what happened to you lot now madam pomfrey said irritably harry ron and hermione had visited the hospital wing so much over the years that pomfrey was starting to feel as if the infirmary was their real dormitory and with the prank war she d been seeing them even more hermione opened her mouth without thinking malfoy cast a repeated madam pomfrey eyes widened at hermione words well miss granger either there something i dontknow about you or you ve been hit with a speech repetition charm i think it been altered harry said she doesntknow what she saying obviously not or she wouldntcontinue to speak madam pomfrey said dryly what am i saying harry hermione said worriedly but of course all harry heard was another plea for sex lay down over there granger i ve got to go talk to professor dumbledore madam pomfrey said wearily he might have an idea of what happened to the spell hermione sighed and lay down on a hospital cot harry and ron sitting on either side of her carefully avoiding each other eyes now that the public humiliation part was over it was all starting to seem slightly funny dontyou two dare start laughing hermione snapped dangerously both of them let out little snorts of laughter at how angry a proposition to have sex in the library could sound but they managed to hold the majority of their mirth in
