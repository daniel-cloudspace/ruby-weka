 disclaimer all characters settings and generally recognizable properties belong to jkr warner bros scholastic etc i can take credit only for the plot or lack thereof a n i first started posting this story more than a year ago on this site moved to ashwinder which is still my fave archive and decided after majorly re vamping it that i wanted to re post it here as well so this is the newest most updated version and i flatter myself that it is far better than the previous incarnation enjoy the wheel turns granger hermione none of the students heard the catch in professor mcgonagall voice and even if they had they would have attributed it to dryness of her throat not to sudden shock as the eager girl half ran half stumbled to the stool to jam the sorting hat on her head the head table went absolutely silent and heads turned first to albus dumbledore and then to severus snape the sallow skinned hollow cheeked coldly distant and always composed potions master was anything but his black eyes glittered brightly the high cheekbones were tinged with red his mouth trembled and both hands were gripping the edge of the table white knuckled no student would notice but those on the staff who knew what to look for found it in his expression before them in the space of breaths it took to say her name their colleague aged thirty one years had dissolved leaving a blossoming adolescent of seventeen but she will be a gryffindor snape thought bleakly watching the girl with the hat she always was one a lamb amongst wolves the gryffindor who penetrated the slytherin hierarchy and survived my hermione but the child that had just emerged from under that hat triumphant gryffindor was not the curvaceous self assured young woman who had captured him all those years ago she was stick thin and small her fizzy hair tumbling in all directions around her as she hurried forward smiling nervously desperately seeking approval she was a flat chested impressionable child not a woman at all but it was she and all the questions he had pressed her for answers to those many years ago suddenly raced through his mind their answers falling in neatly after them it was as he had suspected she had traveled in time he closed his eyes as the sorting continued deaf to the rest the name of his old enemy son barely penetrating his spinning thoughts traveled through time and now she was one of his students 888 frankly i dont understand the fuss filius sinistra was saying to flitwick the short head of ravenclaw house was nodding gravely you werentthere gwen he replied as snape swept past them into the staff room minerva mcgonagall reached out to touch his arm in sympathy he shrugged her away taking his usual seat by the fire one long finger coming to rest on his temple as he stared unseeing into the flames wasntwhere i find myself at a bit of a loss as well marietta lewis teacher of muggle studies said pointedly staring at dumbledore albus if you would care to fill us in severus if you wish to tell the story to those who do not know the headmaster voice was gentle as ever though the eyes behind his spectacles were unusually grave it is your right there is nothing for me to say snape said roughly wh what g going on quirrell stuttered most of the staff were here for it but for those who were not well dumbledore paused giving snape one last chance to jump in snape stared directly into the flames there was no indication that he had heard the headmaster at all except for his tense arms and straight back nothing in the world could relax him now eighteen years ago i received a great shock dumbledore started quietly i walked into my office to find a young woman standing there looking mildly surprised and faintly confused i asked her what she was doing she replied that she had been sent snape and mcgonagall heads snapped to him in an identical motion the first in uncomprehending shock the second with a light of understanding she told me her name was hermione granger she was not one of my students at the school nor had she ever been but she seemed quite well aware of who i was leading me to surmise that she was probably from a not too distant future which she confirmed having no idea how she had been delivered i also did not know how to send her back time is a tricky business and while time turners can be used in exact ways with careful planning this occurrence was too strange to simply send her forward and hope she ended up in the same year hopefully the same day as when she departed she also implied that she had arrived to learn something very specific and necessary for her own age what she was there to learn i only partially discovered and to this day i do not know why but we agreed that only i would know the truth that she would tell a story of having transferred from the salem witches institute in america she was sorted into gryffindor much as we saw tonight as a third year though she was quite obviously physically matured beyond thirteen but not knowing how many years it would take for her to learn what she was seeking or to return her to her own time we decided to sort her as young as conceivably possible to give ourselves enough time the year she arrived in was as you may have deduced 1973 interestingly enough attending the school at that time and in her year were james potter sirius black there were assorted grumblings and various ugly faces at this name and our own potions master severus snape i was on the staff mcgonagall added her voice unusually subdued and much more human sounding that her normal crisp tones as were filius vector hooch pomona and kettleburn severus it was clear the headmaster thought it was time he speak snape gave him a swift look which the headmaster countered with a slight shake of his head they do not need to hear all of it severus snorted and returned his gaze to the fire weighing what he wanted to reveal she had been sent the rage started a slow simmering it was so like dumbledore not to reveal crucial information like that well sent or not there were parts of this tale that even the headmaster did not know the silence grew in the room curiosity burning for all that he would leave unsaid it nearly made him smile the untold story would fill volumes and leave him raw neither was a prospect he relished his voice was coldly impersonal flat and disdainful when he spoke miss granger had has an astonishing ability to forgive others and find their good points especially if they display intelligence i quickly found that her ability in potions mcgonagall and dumbledore eyelids flickered just barely was the only one in the school equal to my own he swallowed and stopped realizing belatedly just how open this wound still gaped but dumbledore cleared his throat clearly snape was not allowed to be quite finished she remained at hogwarts for four years by the time she left we were he groped for the right word to give nothing away to his often nosy and entirely too cloistered colleagues close he closed the subject carefully still not looking up dumbledore was apparently satisfied for he returned to the narrative himself towards the middle of her sixth year i created a rift in time using a powerful magic and sent her back through it hopefully to the exact moment of her disappearance for fourteen years i have wondered whether we were successful sometime in miss granger career at hogwarts we will all get to know dumbledore smiled brightly shattering the solemnity and looking around as if they were children who had just finished a thoroughly delightful story hour and with that i think it time for most of us especially one old man to turn in does anyone care to join me for a nightcap most of the staff looked as if they would indeed like to but snape voice grated from the chair before you depart headmaster a word it was not a request nor did anyone doubt that they would rather not be around for this particular confrontation the staff room emptied instantly how dare you the cold controlled voice that snape used on his students seeped out in his anger and dumbledore could see the arms on the chair shaking how dare you not warn me snape surged to his feet turning for the first time to look the headmaster in the eye why did you not tell me she was coming the rage snapping in his black eyes would have terrified another dumbledore quietly waited meeting the fury allowing it to flame unchecked to burn itself out as much as i loved her as desperately as i missed her much as i searched for her and you didntthink to warn me when you sent the owls this summer that hermione granger was coming to school here what would you have done severus expected the girl of seventeen to come out of the boats as they docked worrying about your own conduct fearing meeting her again dumbledore questions were quiet inquiries which infuriated the younger man the headmaster should scream back at him something to break the dam release the pressure slowly closing around him since he had heard her name out of minerva mouth what would have been gained by telling you you haventseen her for fourteen years and this eleven year old girl is not the node you knew and fought with i told no one even minerva didntknow i handled miss granger letter personally and sent she was sent snape continued to rage with a deliberate purpose in mind simply dropped in and then removed when the job is done she is not a surgical tool do you know do you have any idea he stopped even this man who bared a soul with a single incisive look would not hear the anguished words trapped in his throat i cantchange the past severus or the future that she will face i couldnthave told the seventeen year old grieving boy that the girl he had fallen in love with was returning to a violent time to fight a war for by the time miss granger leaves us and returns we will once again be embroiled in turmoil none of us except her knew then what would happen now and what the future will bring dumbledore sighed it does however go without saying she is your student in this timeline severus of course snape acquiesced what did this man take him for and brushed past the headmaster into the hallway but once there he stopped his eyes wide headmaster yes severus she will have to enjoy and endure all that you remember images from his school days kaleidoscoped through his mind snatches of a foreign land he was irrevocably removed from snape drew the curtain over the fractured riot of memories the girl had inspired closing himself once more once he would have rejoiced to see her now he saw only the ironic pain of the situation his adolescent fantasy had come to life hermione granger had returned to hogwarts 888 remus lupin called the names in a perfunctory fashion scrolling down the list carefully looking at each face as they answered trying to put them together his very first day grang he stumbled lifted his head looked straight at hermione she blushed and lowered her eyes he stared for barely an instant longer before saying i see miss granger is here with us already and moving on to the next name after class lupin sat back reflectively hermione granger after her disappearance in his sixth year he had never thought to see her again certainly not as a thirteen year old hermione had always hated boggarts it was one of the reasons he hadntwanted her to tackle one today in class but there was only one way to be sure it was the girl he thought it would be wincing at the necessity he nevertheless grabbed a handful of powder threw it in the fire place and called severus if you have a moment snape stepped out frowning what do you want lupin hermione granger is that our yes snape eyes closed briefly in pain and he pinched the bridge of his nose yes the two men looked at each other one of their rare moments of understanding bridging the feud that had always separated them i am so sorry severus so am i 888 each year day by day snape waited to see the sudden breath of understanding the day when she would approach him she was a know it all friends with harry potter whom he hated as intensely as he had ever hated the boy father and ron weasley all mouth and no brains that one his cruelty to the three of them increased purposefully year by year triumph by narrowly won triumph his loathing a combination of spite bitterness and the battles of his youth and still he waited for the day she would rush into his dungeon office and ask the questions for there would be questions third year turned to fourth he mocked her sneered at her gladly deducted points for her intelligence and love of learning and jealously watched viktor krum take her to the ball his heart seared watching the sweeping robes of periwinkle dance with someone else hermione granger was slowly transforming from the little girl at the sorting to the woman he had known it was fitting that the eighteen year old quidditch star would notice what none of the boys at hogwarts had wit to see hermione granger could be heart stoppingly beautiful if she so chose fourth year became fifth his blood stopped in his veins when he realized that she was in the ministry with potter the fool boy unable to trust that he would get the message and understand he summoned the order prayed fervently that all would be well from his isolated position in hogwarts and kept his face coldly aloof when the bodies had been brought through she had a great slash across her chest but she was breathing and he had gazed at her face only briefly and discreetly before exiting the hospital with the other staff fifth crossed to sixth the war in full swing his role as a double agent stretching the limits at both ends an unbreakable vow to narcissa malfoy and he would have to show his colors let everyone on both sides understand where his loyalties lay but it was too late now to change that it will be this year he thought looking down at hermione from the head table where she sat eating and talking animatedly with the two hated boys who were like her brothers this was the hermione he had known the young woman from the hogwarts of his time it must be soon this year let it be this year by the end of this year he would be gone there was no hope that draco might accomplish his task and if she went in seventh year he would never know 888 the vibrant notes of the harp hung on the air shimmering into silence as the strings vibrated themselves to stillness she smiled ruefully to no one she was out of practice allowing her head to rest against the harp for a moment she gathered her breath before reaching out to close the music warlock shervin fifth concerto wizard classical music fascinated her it seemed that it altered the very air she breathed when played rebounding off the stone walls not more than an arm length in any direction to make the air glisten the music almost tangible fred and george marauder map had not only the school secret passages but the small rooms that pocketed them and she had selected one not a hundred yards below gryffindor tower as a perfect place to keep her harp since third year though practice had become an infrequent pastime she had never found much time to explore music with ron and harry or anyone else the weasleys had no money and harry aunt and uncle had taken no interest so she had always assumed that the regular rigmarole of dance pottery drawing piano voice football softball and karate that muggle children endured had been skipped by her two best friends there had never been a place to discuss it or the slightest indication from either of them that they even knew music or art existed outside the weird sisters and the moving paintings that covered the castle walls now it was march of her sixth year and she had kept her harp and her voice to herself an oddly protected private thing as if she were waiting for the right person to receive the secret which was a ridiculous notion who would she tell harry and ron and even neville and ginny were the best friends she had ever had who to expose herself to if not to them but it was a thought she could not shake a thought that had stilled her tongue for nearly five and a half years on the subject she had thought she might tell viktor but when he had given her the perfect opening mentioning the music that some of his classmates played under karkaroff instruction her tongue seemed to have sealed itself and would not come unglued on that subject in spite of the fact that it was the only time she had ever heard music and magical education in the same breath what she really wanted desperately wished for was another musician which viktor had not been someone who would understand the the thrill the intensely solemn joy that came from playing a piece to perfection a wizard who could feel the gathering power of the notes penned by magic history books had recorded orders and societies of wizards and witches dedicated to music and magic and some of the tales of what they had accomplished were legendary in scale but the most recent records indicated dwindling numbers due to ministry law restricting the study of music and the last remaining order had faded out of existence over two centuries prior there were almost no professional mage musicians left and for all its thoroughness in some ways hogwarts did not offer classes in music or any of the arts traditional or contemporary in fact the subject seemed to be not so much neglected as taboo at the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in europe hagrid had given harry a rough pipe their first year which harry had used to play fluffy to sleep but no other time in five years had the topic even been presented much less given a practical application she set the music on the floor next to her stool in a neat stack yawned stretched and stood it was nearly nine in a few minutes she would be outside curfew and out of bounds there was a stretch of corridor she had to pass through to get to the fat lady and there was no point getting caught for foolishness she spelled the door behind her to remain locked to anyone except herself and started up the granite floored corridor which would spill her out behind a large tapestry of the wizengamot convention of 1712 bordered in gold as she reached the top fingers latched around the heavy brocade to thrust it aside she heard the one sound that she could never explain herself to footfalls soft and light and accompanied by the cold voice of her potions professor but snape coldness had been replaced by fear and a sense of urgency she was sure he would never display in front of a student thread knotted cloth still clutched in her hand hermione breathed lightly and slowly and listened he knows then that was dumbledore tired aging voice laced with defeat hermione throat squeezed with an indefinable panic she had never heard the abundantly energetic headmaster sound so completely beaten he knows i have used every trick of occlumency for the past twenty years to keep him from knowing but he knows the echo was only temporarily bound to her it broke free of lily potter at the moment of her death and now well now he has discovered that it was not destroyed with her but to the contrary it was released with as much power as he has already gained this time we would be much harder pressed to stop him from gaining access to it and manipulating it indeed we worked two decades ago to prevent it from happening even though we only partially succeeded and here the sentence stopped a peculiar note creeping into snape voice he sounded cramped almost chained as if it took a great deal of effort to push the rest of the words through the obstacle of his lips and here now miss granger does not know anything yet she was born the node but training is essential we cannot speak to her or ask her to help us again not yet hermione heart thudded loudly responding to the mention of her name she hoped snape hearing was not as good as she feared and retreated a few steps down the passage severus surprised disappointment tinged the older man soft utterance surely after twenty years no you re not are you a snort and obliquely your friend alastor moody or rather bartemius crouch junior told me once that there are marks that never come off he was right a sigh the decision to press no farther well perhaps it is time there does not seem to be a better one we need her considerable talents now yes hermione had crept forward again unable to resist the temptation of listening to something that so plainly concerned her what had made dumbledore so very sadly disappointed but the footsteps were drifting out of earshot and the sound decreased first to a mumble then to a few punctuated sighs and finally drizzled into nothing in the dark when hermione was sure they had gone she tore the tapestry aside her gaze tracking down the long hall where they had disappeared miss granger does not know anything yet the words had not been sneered or sullen or angry they had carried none of the deadly voiced threats he hurtled in class on a daily basis they had been factual and regretful but it had been snape who had said them surely after twenty years what could that mean twenty years of spying of being a death eater and what was a node the notion of being born anything made her skin itch harry could keep his highly individual chosen one from birth status her astronomy essay held no interest for her as she sat in gryffindor tower listening to ron patiently explain to harry why his chess pieces insisted in their cockney accents that he make a different move than queen to c5 what would she know from whom would she learn jupiter orbit crossed pluto as the conversation ran on repeat through her mind 888 now albus mcgonagall asked softly are we sure is she ready she will never be ready snape voice came out sandpaper rough but she will survive one of the benefits of knowing the past is the knowledge that it all must remain pristinely untouched for this future to exist will she know enough to help us now though we can only hope dumbledore replied a small smile unusually sad touched the headmaster features as he looked at his potions master drawn countenance and over bright eyes she gave me a date you know the exact date of her departure the sharpness on snape face as it jerked to him was hungry hungry in a pure honest way that belied his intense loneliness and longing for the girl a ghost of his beloved past that had the misfortune to be amongst the living when he asked past caring that his voice was stressed and low his thoughts obvious to both dumbledore and mcgonagall tomorrow severus the older man replied the date she gave me was tomorrow march 14th 1997 so you are already determined to send her i was determined from the instant her name was brought to my attention as a talented muggle born witch there was no chance that it was coincidence and i cantnot send her she already went mcgonagall closed her eyes time travel and the implications that spun so readily from it made her dizzy if she pondered it too long she loved the practical application of magic but the theoretical wrappings of time and the magic involved seemed so fruitless few traveled and many of those few died for the headmaster to send a student back deliberately seemed irresponsible except that they already knew she had gone and succeeded and vanished and now they desperately needed the knowledge she would bring back with her will her information of then be useful now i believe so snape hesitated last time we found what was clearly a temporary solution this time i hope to find a more permanent one i fear however that like the philosopher stone the echo can be only either well hidden with the potential to be found by the wrong person or destroyed five years ago nicholas flamel agreed to demolish the stone in the greater interests of humanity i think it is likely time to find a way to obliterate the echo as well it is a constantly changing magic not an object mcgonagall warned destruction might be impossible do not lecture me on the things i studied he spat it was written by men it can be unwritten by them but before we can do that dumbledore intervened gently miss granger must go must learn all she will and must return tomorrow snape tone held both hope and dread for a closed man he was remarkably open tomorrow i do not wish to be here you must we have to deliberately open the rift she steps into a time turner cannot handle the move of decades as the most powerful wizard in my employ i will require your assistance in opening the rift and sending her back i cannot headmaster surely another no severus and the blue eyes promised that there was nothing to appeal to behind them i want you to be here do not ask me to face her as she is leaving or returning snape whispered eyes closed he was not in the habit of begging but the rigidly imposed self control of five and a half years was beginning to disintegrate as he contemplated facing a hermione that remembered all he did you have never run dumbledore voice was equally quiet but burned with clarity of purpose never from a fight or a lecture or a class room you have never shied from what i have asked of you dontrun from yourself severus no matter how fast you fly you always reach the end of the road to find that you re right there with you headmaster no you will assist me you donthave a choice severus this is not a request snape glowered at the headmaster but the firm sky colored eyes won snape lived under his protection alone and he played by dumbledore rules no matter the game dumbledore turned to mcgonagall and asked lightly as if requesting a book can i persuade you to bring me miss granger tomorrow at noon of course albus snape could not stand the all too understanding pity that glittered in mcgonagall eyes as he turned from them and strode out of the office disclaimer alas tis not mine pity that a n thank you all for reading and reviewing even though i made you go back several chapters to do so many thanks go out to my beta for this piece trinka unpleasant revelations ii hermione pelted toward the small chest high wrought iron gate and it burst forward at her hastily murmured alohomora allowing her to charge through it without slowing or breaking her stride twisting through leaves feeling her robes snag and rip on the long thorns she had no time to appreciate the minor miracle of the full roses and their soft petals as the flute continued to weave the magic of a muggle composer over the cold winter night she paused her breath frosting the air in front of her as klytemnestra and snape nearly ran into her skidding to a halt right behind her as she cocked her head listening for the correct direction they were quite close now but it seemed as though the sound floated to them from two different directions a trick no doubt of the maze of greenery surrounding them point me she whispered hoping that the spell would work for whatever she wanted and not simply spin uselessly she had never tried to locate a person using it before but the wood spun on her palm and directed her straight down the path to her right she started off again snape voice panting in her wake what was that shhh his cousin shushed him quickly another turn and at a bush full of violet flowers looking healthy in their full bloom even as they were frosted over by the cold they found lily sitting on a bench made of gleaming white marble her eyes fixed on a series of sheets of paper that she had charmed to levitate in front of her and switch places whenever she was ready hermione opened her mouth hand stretched forward to snatch the dangerous pipe when another head full of black hair hurtled into the small niche in the path from the opposite direction a single word tumbling from her lips don t hermione hand changed trajectory her wand snapping up as she closed on her friend recognizing the second zabini twin 888 kassandra sat on a gentle slope next to the lake watching the dark grey water lap the shore and wishing that her life were as smooth as the surface after delivering her ultimatum over christmas her sister had steadfastly avoided her and kassandra could not meet her younger cousin eyes her heart pinched painfully as she realized that between her owl preparation in classes his insistence on playing music and her new relationship with the crown prince of slytherin she had allowed herself to drift away from the cousin that she had protected equally with klytemnestra for the past two years to see the revulsion in his eyes when he had understood the nature of her association with lucius malfoy had hurt her deeply caustic as he was severus was matured well beyond his thirteen years and kassandra had genuinely enjoyed his company until this fall and her sister klytemnestra was not quick to forgive like most of the family and there was no denying that kassandra had to apologize for not displaying even an ounce of cunning in giving her silver tongued suitor exactly what he wanted but klytemnestra seemed determined to continue not speaking to her spending more and more of her time with severus but there had to be a way they were twins inseparable until they had arrived at hogwarts and close until now she skipped a rock over the lake watching it sink into the cold depths before rising she would just have to make an effective argument she froze halfway to standing knees still bent in a half crouch as she heard the sound a flute remembering lucius intense interest in the musician she straightened and dashed for the sound at a sprint the american witch was a friend of the evans girl and granger had saved her from lucius when coming back to school she owed the young gryffindor and her cousin seemed to have some kind of friendship with the girl as well this was as good a way as any to convince them of her intentions 888 one of the objects of kassandra zabini brooding sat in the library grey eyes the same color as the stone behind him as he attempted to read studying for his newt in potions he gritted his teeth as his eyes unfocused once more and he instead concentrated on an internal dilemma kassandra total rejection at the train platform had been unexpected and baffling what had happened over break to turn her against him he knew her sister klytemnestra had never cared for him but kassandra hadntseemed to mind that her twin opinion of him differed from her own but strangest of all that impossible transfer in gryffindor had challenged him forcing him to back away from his carefully cultivated prize he had never seen them together and knew that kassandra was jealous of the other witch because of his persistent interest in her but hermione granger had charged to kassandra defense as certainly as she would defend her own housemates and the posse that seemed at her permanent disposal and he had bowed out unwilling to fight a witch who generated so much magic that it poured from her in tangible physical form as to the youngest cousin his master had idly enquired into the snape family after lucius had remarked on the young wizard adept handling of himself and the curses he cast but in spite of his influence wealth and popularity lucius had never been able to get the boy to take advantage of his repeated offers of companionship and instead snape had spurned all affiliation with malfoy and any who regularly associated with him in the shifting politics of slytherin house the boy had rejected those who might help him sown the seeds of many enmities and yet had stilled carved himself an undeniably unique role in the games of his housemates the dark lord had discovered that snape was a half blood and that had cooled his desire to see the then twelve year old boy take his mark immediately but lucius had given his lord regular updates on the boy until this new girl had arrived in england and the power hungry wizard had become obsessed with her but there had been a knowing look melded with the contempt in the black eyes at the return feast the night before and lucius had the nasty feeling that snape had somehow discovered what he was after and that he had warned kassandra against lucius he had after all summarily turned aside all members of slytherin only to entangle himself with a gryffindor a snip of a girl who was far too perceptive for his tastes the gryffindor his lord wanted and without kassandra lucius still did not know how he would subdue a musician who was growing into her power the dark lord was unlikely to accept another flurry of excuses about his consistent failure his vicious imagination detailed what he would like to do to the snide insufferable thirteen year old who gave the appearance of knowing so much and the gryffindor witch that he clearly had some strange affection for increasingly dark ponderings were interrupted by a sound he had not hope to hear again and his platinum head rose sharply even though the closed window he could hear the flute 888 don t stay away from her accio a summoning charm snagged the instrument which flew neatly into kassandra outstretched hand expelliarmus both kassandra wand and the flute flashed in the starlight as the soared towards hermione she caught the straight length of silver but a black robed arm flickered upward and klytemnestra grabbed her sister wand a tense moment followed where wide green eyes stared back and forth between three pairs of black and one brown what are you doing here the twins asked one another at the same time hermione was relieved that klytemnestra was keeping a tight hold on her twin wand and showed little inclination to hand it back there are more of us than there are of you hermione said coldly wand still pointed at the now defenseless girl you first kassandra shot her a malevolent glare all thoughts of gratitude forgone in the face of the gryffindor command but the look didntseem to faze the other young woman at all and hermione lifted one eyebrow as the silence stretched the expression absurdly reminding kassandra of severus kly she turned to address her family kly i not here to i came to warn her warn me of what lily eyes had narrowed as the seconds ticked past there was much more going on here than would initially meet the eye but snape and one zabini had pounded into her space on hermione heels and both seemed willing to allow her to set the tone when had hermione had time to develop a friendship with two slytherins especially one that the marauders hated you mustntplay that lucius malfoy gave it to you kassandra told her facing her lily eyes widened again as they flew to hermione and the two girls shared an even look what snape asked malfoy didntgive it to her he gave it to me hermione replied slowly her gaze was back kassandra how do you know it was him he gave me a gift of a similar nature she answered evenly he what klytemnestra snapped fingers tightening around kassandra wand knuckles going white in her furious grip kassandra black eyes studied the ground he gave me sheet music too her voice was less distinct muffled with shame so he must have been part of the theft of the musical instruments snape said slowly more likely he knew someone who was or who could get him some of the merchandise klytemnestra replied her eyes turned diamond hard to her sister has he gone on any extended absences could he have been directly involved in the missing shipment kassandra shook her head glad that her now much regretted afternoons spent with malfoy could yield something useful no i would say not but given what they saw in knockturn alley i would say it undeniable that he knows someone did you show them that letter hermione had rounded on snape at kassandra last words he looked at her unperturbed they were at the table when i opened it i showed it to them that was supposed to be private information hermione hissed snape glanced around unconcerned it is the five people who know it are standing right here and remus lupin lily volunteered from the bench what snape snapped black eyes locked on hermione face did you tell him too no he was with us in the alley lily defended at this snape face darkened inexplicably and he turned away twisting his body with some violence to indicate his displeasure ignoring him hermione sat down next to her friend and snape started pacing robes flickering as they caught up to his body at each turn klytemnestra and kassandra remained still as if a little uncertain of each other klytemnestra still had her sister wand as they weighed one another d you think he connected to the men who wear red snape finally asked after stillness settled over them again hermione back straightened she had almost forgotten that she included them in the note she had been so surprised about malfoy malfoy and the music and his connection to kassandra you know them she said suddenly her voice a half whisper as she looked to klytemnestra the men in red you got off you know them the wand which had been lying cock eyed in her lap was now up and pointing firmly at the slytherin girl what klytemnestra started then her eyes narrowed no you ve got the wrong set many wizards wear red robes just because they wear the same color it doesntmean that they re the same they used music hermione interrupted inexorably the owner of flourish and blotts heard it if they were not members of the keeper concilium who were after all hunting music here at hogwarts then who were they kassandra gasped and klytemnestra leveled both wands at hermione the dynamic shifting fluidly in seconds snape froze apart from the rest dark eyes resting on each face in turn baffled but understanding that whatever hermione had said it hardly met with his cousins approval kassandra stepped next to her twin who allowed her to take her wand keeping it pointed directly at the gryffindor hermione and lily had both of their wands extended as well one focused on each slytherin girl how do you know their name klytemnestra whispered no one knows that they re one of britain best guarded secrets the consular who found us mrozcek wanted to he told me who he was and where he was from hermione changed tacks mid sentence it was too much to hope that the three slytherins wouldntnotice and wouldnt press told you klytemnestra repeated coldly while kassandra snorted the only reason he would have told you the truth about the concilium is that you are someone of importance to them she took a step closer and hermione watched her draw on the lessons ingrained since birth an air of nobility wrapping her like a skin tight gown as her wand point drew closer to hermione heart the aristocratic arrogance of the next question reminded the gryffindor witch strongly of the only time she had ever met narcissa malfoy as an adult and made her skin crawl are you someone they deem to be of importance hermione granger of america lily had surged to her feet and her wand was now mere inches from kassandra nose leave off she hissed or no one will have difficulty telling the two of you apart ever again hermione and klytemnestra didntmove eyes locked on one another tamed hostility released once more the image of the immaculate blonde mother of spoiled draco superimposed on the night black tresses and darker but no less fair features of klytemnestra zabini hermione blinked to clear her vision the strength and frequency of these attacks where the two timelines would merge in her memory were growing ever weaker and farther apart but sometimes still had the clarity to take her breath away maybe he didnttell me the truth hermione whispered quietly into the taut silence maybe they did attack diagon alley and he came here to ensure that no students with a talent for music learned the arts that could stop him maybe someone other than voldemort had an interest in grindelwald research regarding music the concilium has existed for centuries grindelwald has nothing to do with it snarled kassandra eyes still fixed on lily wand which was hovering closer she had none of her sister poise possibly because lily looked a breath away from hexing her into oblivion if he told you the nature of what they do then you know that they do not use their mastery for attack klytemnestra said as if her twin had not spoken hermione arched an eyebrow no she said slowly she had assumed that the consular meant her well he had seemed an essentially decent man not a fan of dumbledore but then everyone that didntnecessarily agree with the headmaster was hardly a death eater or dark wizard if a little hidebound his offer to train her while unwelcome had felt sincere when she had been standing in the headmaster office almost two months ago but that was the problem there was no way to know and all the evidence now pointed to the contrary that if she had agreed to go with them she would have been incarcerated or worse i have no guarantees of what they actually do or accomplish with their vast knowledge of music hermione continued softly only that they are all proficient and have an enormous amount of knowledge but i am curious the imperious look on klytemnestra face likely worked on most slytherins but hermione had looked into the face of half a dozen death eaters and the prospect of asking the zabini girl questions was only tiring not intimidating i would love to know if they are one of britain best kept secret societies how do you know about them the girls stiffened and exchanged a glance snape spoke from where he had almost blended with the leaves of the rose bushes the night making the green nearly as black as his robes i didntknow any of that his voice murmured but i am also most interested to know cousin the emphasis on the family connection was not a kind one and sounded faintly of betrayal how you come by this information we have the right connections klytemnestra finally answered hermione snorted long since used to oblique and sneering answers but lily exploded the subject was one of her weak points the right connections you slytherins make me sick your pureblood mania your holier than thou attitude your swaggering arrogance no wonder the rising dark lord is reputed to harvest most of his recruits from your house you re ready made and rubber stamped for him to take you off the assembly line muggle hating power grubbing wealthy sycophants just his for the taking her chest heaving lily yanked her wand from kassandra face as if it took considerable effort to deny herself the satisfaction of hexing her hermione stared lily was always so even tempered so sweet so understanding now she looked positively dangerous and harry flashed in her green eyes in front of hermione face she smiled without joy lily outburst was worthy of her son in his worst moments these red robed men wrecked diagon alley destroyed homes and shops and they killed people this isntsome stupid game to hold information over children and lord over others like whose parents sat closest to the minster family at the last gala if you know them or know about them and you re not telling that makes you as guilty as they are if they decide to rampage again her green eyes glittered as she surveyed the two sisters both frozen in shock the mantle of her high birth completely vanished as klytemnestra simply stared at the young witch when no response was forthcoming she turned away from them c mon hermione she whispered hoarsely and hermione wasntquite surprised to see lily eyes a brilliant jade with unshed tears let go hermione agreed her wand remained on the two as she backed away running into several thorns she didntcomplain it was clear that she would rather run into the spines than turn her back on the sister s knowing what they knew she need not have bothered neither twin moved until they were well out of sight hidden by the roses and then one arm snaked out to check snape as he strode past intent on going after the two girls are they right snape rounded on his cousins though two years younger he was already some inches taller and was not above using his height to intimidate she said in the note that they had did they attack the alley no of course not klytemnestra replied harshly i dontknow what she playing at come on snape hesitated undecided kassandra pinned him with a glare but it was her sister who spoke again her hand tight on his forearm family severus he glowered but nodded stiffly in assent and without speaking they turned their robes swirling around their ankles as they strode back to their common room each with a package of their own thoughts 888 lucius cocked his head sharply to listen and smiled the music had ceased some moments before but it was replaced by a furious half whispered argument treading lightly he murmured a spell to part the branches with their treacherous thorns in front of him leaving just enough space for his eyes to take in the scene the silver flute flashed in the dim light drawing his eye to its holder the american he had been correct kassandra had lied to him he ignored the surge of anger that accompanied this thought as he strained to identify the rest of the small group their black robes on the dark green bushes making it difficult to distinguish where one ended and the other began he could see that the granger girl was holding her wand on one figure and another form also had their wand arm extended towards that same person seated on a marble bench and looking slightly confused was another gryffindor lily evans another recent addition to the slug club fascinating perhaps this was why she and granger were such good friends there had been more than one instrument being played in the forest that night nearly two months ago it would make sense if she were one of them although he hadntheard the distinct tones of a flute that evening he pushed that puzzle aside needing to hear later he could weed through the pieces and put them together granger said something in their heated voices that brought identical gasps and lucius recognized his ex lover and her twin he frowned this was unexpected but it went a long way to explaining kassandra sudden coldness but the other twin was holding two wands and now both were pointed at granger whereas previously they had been directed towards kassandra clearly she had said something to displease them he grinned with delight at the abrupt turning of the tables how do you know their name klytemnestra was whispering and he strained to hear no one knows that they re one of britain best guarded secrets the consular who found us mrozcek wanted to he told me who he was and where he was from told you klytemnestra repeated and lucius smile grew wider at the ice in her voice the only reason he would have told you the truth about the concilium is that you are someone of importance to them are you someone they deem to be of importance hermione granger of america the concilium lucius racked his brain desperately reaching for a reference point a memory that would allow him to decipher what they were talking about but his mind only drew a blank and he twisted his head trying to hear as their voices dropped in fierce discussion he gathered a few phrases as tones rose and fell in pitch maybe they did attack diagon alley granger said and kassandra responded some moments later the concilium has existed for centuries grindelwald cursing his ears and the thickness of the screen that separated them lucius leaned so far he felt thorns prick and knew they would draw blood if they are one of britain best kept secret societies how do you know about them granger was asking silence greeted this question and a figure melted forward from the brush that lucius had not seen previously however he was completely unsurprised when the lanky form spoke with severus snape voice i didntknow any of that but i am also most interested to know cousin how you come by this information a secret society and kassandra knew about it he started earnestly thinking of ways to get back in her good books for her to trust him again whole societies of wizards only existed in secret if they protected something powerful the consular who found us mrozcek his grey eyes widened mrozcek had been one of the inspectors at the school first term all of lucius contacts and numerous called in favors from both students and alumni had availed him nothing when they had been there no one could tell him a single thing about the strange visitors but it seemed that at least three of the girls standing in front of him had a good idea these red robed men wrecked diagon alley destroyed homes and shops and they killed people lily evans was storming in front of him and had been for several minutes but this statement sent his mind on another jog a memory of rookwood pained face and whispers through the death eaters that someone had found a way to use music before their lord had and that he was not happy red robes mrozcek the concilium an inspection at hogwarts as the two gryffindor witches walked away he saw granger hand the flute to evans a flurry of action as snape started after the younger girls only to have his cousins stop him and then they too turned and went in the opposite direction silence falling over the place where they had been standing lucius sighed a smirk quirking the corner of one mouth he might not deliver the girl next time he reported to his lord but there was certainly plenty to say 888 as hermione clambered back into the common room at fifteen minutes past nine o clock and curfew grateful that she and lily had not encountered any teachers a group of four boys rose from their places by the fire arms crossed and eyebrows raised absurdly they reminded her of four stern parents about to launch into a diatribe evans james had caught sight of hermione companion and his face brightened losing its father like cast in favor of delight sirius rolled his eyes and aimed a kick at james shin have fun lily muttered passing quickly through the room and darting up the girl staircase where the boys could not follow calling her good night over her shoulder the flute would be placed back in the case and disillusioned to live under lily bed hermione felt vaguely abandoned but she knew that after her furious tirade at the zabini twins lily had no interest in dealing with the marauders second night back and you go disappearing sirius started i thought we had a project to work on i was in the library to her surprise it was not james who picked up her partial lie but remus and she was dismayed to see the pronounced disappointment there we looked you werentthere i was until about 8 30 she replied feeling her face heat uncomfortably she didntwant to have to start lying to them now especially since her friendship with snape would be both unexplainable to them and impossible to maintain with their constant interference then again perhaps it wouldnt matter as long as his snake like cousins had their claws sunk into him any sort of positive connection seemed unlikely the girls had said nothing except to deny hermione claims and questions and they had offered not a single shred of proof to disabuse her of her notions consequently they had simply deepened them and hermione would not associate with those who kept secrets for murderers until a couple of years ago the death eaters had been largely a closed society until voldemort had begun his open ascent to power and hermione wondered who these men were that she had never heard of them especially with the attack on diagon alley e which leaves a grand total of sirius checked his watch forty five minutes for you to get yourself into all kinds of trouble she was with lily sirius james had re joined the conversation now that the object of his thirteen year old desires had vanished out of sight up the spiral staircase they canthave gotten into that much trouble this appeared to take some of the wind out of sirius sails of righteous indignation and peter who always followed suit was looking slightly more apologetic than stern now but remus gentle eyes had flared with something like happiness at this composition of two and two what did snape give you for christmas sirius switched subjects so quickly that hermione stared at him for a moment her mind still on puzzling out why this group of troublemakers and rule breakers cared that she was out past curfew i dontsee that any business of yours black she deliberately frosted her voice with the same disdain of the girls of her dormitory severely displeased with their version of interrogation if snape wants to give me a present that his prerogative it wasntdangerous remus and james asked together looking both hopeful and relieved hermione knew they would gladly take any excuse to hex the unpopular slytherin into next week no it was a bauble all right an ornament that had the village of hogsmeade in miniature inside it she lied quickly knowing where she could get such an item by owl order why sirius asked you d have to ask him she responded tartly and then realized what she had just said dontyou dare ask she snapped in a low voice i dontunderstand why you guys cantleave him alone and if we continue to talk about snape i not going to help determine anything further about our project this silenced them completely much as they hated snape and wanted answers the ability to become animagi was far more important to them and it was already clear that without hermione their chances of success collapsed from slim to none all right sirius muttered sulkily but james was already reaching for his bag where dwelled all the books that hermione had brought back with her remus was frowning as he watched the other four flip open the three books she had purchased for this purpose he was genuinely relieved to know that snape had not given her a dangerous item but what continued to puzzle him was why he had thought to give her anything at all they were hardly close they never even sat together in class perhaps the slytherin boy bore some watching there are three more that we ll need i ve owled for them but since our trunks were looked through coming back to school i thought it was best not to have six books that essentially comprise the do it yourself handbook to becoming animagi she was explaining these books will help us through the first phases the problem is i think we ll eventually need a special receptacle that housed in the ministry something tied to animal magic animals have magic remus asked just a little less even than muggles but we still need to connect to it to complete the process my dad works at the ministry james volunteered and mine peter added hastily we could ask them if they would allow us to go in with them then sneak off and find whatever this thing is over the summer maybe hermione said absently but it more important now to figure out what we re going to be she had opened the transfiguration book to an early chapter and four heads bent in to scan the opening paragraph every witch or wizard has one or more animal representations most often the strongest connection between a wizard and a particular type of animal manifests in an individual patronus charm their protector and message sender when seeking to become an animagus however a witch or a wizard is often given a choice between two or three forms that they can focus on becoming once they choose one that form is forever theirs and the other forms become an impossibility the first step in transformation is understanding what you as an individual have the ability to become underneath the paragraph there was an ingredients list followed by complicated looking instructions a potion james yelped in dismay we have to brew a potion to get to know our forms the first of many james hermione sighed potions transfiguration and arithmancy all figure heavily into becoming animagi as do herbology and charms this is going to take time possibly years when hermione had learned in her third year how long it had taken two of the best students of transfiguration at hogwarts the better part of three years to become animagi she had wondered why but extensive reading had given her the answer becoming an animagus was not at all the same as turning inanimate objects into animals or even turning a person into an animal though to the outward eye it was identical to change at will always to the same form and retain both a human mind and have all the instincts of the animal required a solid understanding of the animal one became and a respect for the creature and the world that it came from it also required permanent physiological changes hermione was convinced that there were so few animagi in the wizarding population due to the complexity of the process to become one and the side effects she had found to her dismay that witches became sterile in the process of becoming animagi probably a leading reason why there was only one registered female animagus in the entire twentieth century and she had only met one other illegal one she marked the place for the potion and shut the book with a sigh once an animagus the alteration from human to animal form was painless and immediate but the many steps to get there were not and given some of the consequences she was starting to wonder if she would complete the journey 888 waiting at the back of the room the least important of his lord informants and followers lucius did not dare to sit even as the hour he had been there stretched to two then to three and midnight arrived and passed as others moved forward and back power flowing and eddying in the room as the self styled lord bestowed favors and the cruciatus with equal dispassion the clock in the hall chimed one and lucius felt a stirring of apprehension he could not be missed which meant that he should return to hogwarts by five in the morning so that his dormitory mates would not notice his absence what information do you bring me from the ministry calitus came the soft question from the throne like upholstered chair near the hearth my lord the minister is ripe to fall lucius studied the planks of wood under his feet the dark green color of the paper on the wall the silver trim lining floor and ceiling the dark lord obsession with things that represented hogwarts in any way especially slytherin was a much discussed subject between the death eaters apparently anyone who could bring the lord an object belonging to one of the founders was richly rewarded excellent you have done well the lord bestowed a smile that was more like a grimace on his bowed over servant and finally his eyes came to rest on lucius standing stiffly near the back as the room grew emptier and emptier the ministry contingent filing out calitus looking quite smug until there were only three people left i believe you have been quite patient lucius the lord almost purred from his seat come a skeletal finger beckoned and lucius hastened forward blond hair swinging into his face you arrive voluntarily perhaps you bring me something i seek lucius swallowed he had not brought his lord the girl and he was wondering now whether his rush to gain the dark lord approval with what suddenly seemed irrelevant musings had been folly but it was too late now the mark on his wrist was heating as he failed to answer voldemort question not a girl master he replied mouth dry with dread i bring information the words tumbled from his lips as fast as he could shove them off he relayed everything he had heard the girls say placing careful emphasis on the red robed men their attack on diagon alley their connection with music and the zabini twins apparent knowledge of their activities voldemort expression moved from thunderous to curious to cunning the almost non existent eyebrows smoothing as his eyes turned to some internal object all redness vanished in his absorption with his thoughts well done lucius well done he said at last he tapped his thin lips with a slender finger you have discovered what even rookwood failed to uncover silence and then if you cannot bring me the you said she is an american girl then bring me one of the daughters of zabini redness lanced through his gaze as he turned it back on the young blond in front of him do not return here until you have her lucius bowed grateful that his spying had reaped at least a partial pardon from his master yes my lord disclaimer standard applies no money respects to those to whom respect is due a n i apologize for how long this has taken me to put out thank you all for reviewing and sticking with it though it means a great deal to me a huge thanks to my beta trinka for all of her work on this and my promise that chapter fifteen is actually with her now so hopefully there will be more updating soon read and enjoy kassandra bargain as hermione carefully marked the page of an old tome in the library two spots on either side of her spine began to itch her body sixth sense and warning that she was being watched years of study in the art of subtlety learned the hard way an unfortunate side effect of being a best friend of harry potter kept her from sitting up straight in her chair and turning to find the source of her vague discomfort her stalker gaze felt uncertain not malevolent and so was instantly categorized as a curiosity instead of a threat to be dealt with immediately either they would walk into her line of vision as they left the room or she would see them when she stood and collected her own books she tapped her parchment with the end of her quill frustration settling in once again since the encounter in the ever in bloom rose garden she had been in the library for almost all of her spare time seeking any information on the keeper concilium after the meeting with mroczek several months ago she had not consulted the shelves that had always stood her in good stead but had put the information in the back of her mind to be oft retrieved and mulled over the matter of whom they were a secondary interest to understanding the enigma she was proving to be she was uncertain now what she was intended to do she had discovered both what the echo was and who the clarinetist was fulfilling the orders professor snape had given her months ago and now was at a loss as to how to proceed in the absence of instruction she had turned back to the mystery of the concilium her curiosity renewed with the news of the attack from diagon alley and the strange connection the zabini family had to them in a recent review of the night mroczek had caught them in the forest she recalled vividly the way that klytemnestra had ordered him not to report them if the headmaster can forgive our presence in this forest my father can forgive yours but information on the concilium did not exist on printed pages and hermione could not confess herself surprised that the library was once again refusing to yield her desired goal a society shrouded in mystery could hardly remain so if information on it was available on school bookcases she reflected ruefully that as she got older and the fight against voldemort took on different strange magic not taught at hogwarts the trusted volumes gathering dust on the shelves contained less and less of what she needed if the headmaster can forgive our presence in this forest my father can forgive yours perhaps it was time to put aside the secret organization and focus on mr zabini a wizard who wielded such political and social power that his sixteen year old daughter was at ease commanding a man of mr mrozcek supposed standing she rose stretched caught sight of the eyes watching her snape his hair slung over his face in the curtain that would become his customary hiding place as an adult and walked out of the bookshelves and towards the limited selection of periodicals pointedly ignoring the boy who had been shadowing her for four weeks she had read almost all of the books about great wizards and achievements of the twentieth century and she did not recall zabini name being amongst them so it was likely that his work was extremely modern and would be recorded in the glossy pages of witch weekly or probably galleons and knuts britain greatest working wizards or thyme snape hesitated some rows away unaware that the object of his observation knew he was watching her debating as he had been for weeks how to approach her his cousins had been as closed lipped with him about the mysterious concilium as they had been with the gryffindor girls and his frustration with their evasive answers was growing added to this was the gnawing sense that lucius malfoy was planning something that would affect snape family snape had lifted his head from his toast and coffee this morning to see the platinum crowned prince of slytherin eyeing kassandra with a speculative smirk and the younger wizard spine had chilled there had been something predatory in malfoy eyes not in the way that a boy seeks a girl he likes but the way a hunter stalks when intending to kill having no true friends to speak of the young slytherin connection to his family was thusly strengthened and in spite of his disgust at kassandra obvious lack of taste in men and his irritation at his cousins obsessive secrecy a threat to her heightened snape sense of alarm through it all the gryffindor witches sat whatever information they possessed sealed away the american transfer student squashed between despised potter and loathed black in every class they shared just a few meters from him and seeming as inaccessible as the bottom of the ocean he could remember quite clearly the morning after the fight on the grounds their gazes had collided in the middle of their transfiguration classroom as they pulled chairs away from desks and dropped bags to prepare for class and after a moment she had arched her eyebrow in a gesture of courteous invitation and turned her back her meaning had been perfectly clear she would not come to him he had struggled for a month with whether he would go to her part of him a part that was desperate for answers to his many questions prodded him to move forward to seek the information he was oddly certain she could provide the part that understood the full weight and meaning of angering the only two people in his house that truly cared for him the family he valued so highly urged him to forget her and a third part a part that he had been squirming away from acknowledging for months quietly egged him onwards caring little for answers and for family only for the physical nearness of the wild tresses that seemed untamable by magic or brush or plait and the slender limbs that were deceptively small for the power they housed as always house allegiances and family security stayed his footsteps and his tongue and he merely stood gaze fastened on her from his place behind the volumes unwilling to move as long as he could see her without being seen watch her without fearing the scrutiny of his housemates and her friends he had not counted on the ever present glance of his cousins who were seated not far from hermione studying for their owls kassandra was making a list of the twelve uses of dragon blood as klytemnestra screwed up her face in concentration memorizing the steps to a basic catch all antidote there was always a risk that a mild poison would be in the practical part of the exam and rumor was that lethal toxins had been used until too many students had died at the end of their fifth year by failing their potions exams snape had heard this story and while he privately thought that it sounded like something invented by the staff to scare students into studying he would simply carry a bezoar with him for the exam when his turn came in two years all attempts to remember schoolwork ceased as kassandra elbowed her sister in the ribs and pointed silently to where severus stood as unmoving as the shelf he was partially tucked behind his eyes trained intently on a third point of focus craning their necks revealed the recipient of his attention and the sisters locked eyes in complete accord once more suspicion and family in fighting had been instantly suspended in the face of opposition from an outside source and the twins were enjoying their renewed closeness even when it was expressed in mutual exasperation over their cousin peculiar attachment to a witch who asked too many uncomfortable questions and knew entirely too much kassandra bent her head inwards to breathe in a whisper he completely infatuated with her klytemnestra made a low noise of agreement i would be pleased she the first person he ever indicated an interest in outside of a purely intellectual plane except that she the worst possible choice he could make in the entirety of hogwarts or all england for that matter her sister muttered she too powerful klytemnestra said bleakly she wondered if the gryffindor girl raw power were the attraction for her cousin but she doubted it it had to be the girl voice in part and her brains it ll run its course i think kassandra said diffidently sitting back to return to her owls klytemnestra watched severus a little longer her thin dark brows drawn together to crease in the middle creating worry lines from the steady unwavering quality to severus countenance klytemnestra doubted that whatever he felt for the strangely talented witch would run its course in so short a period of time 888 a thick heavy parcel landed in front of hermione the tawny owl depositing it carefully between pumpkin juice and eggs at breakfast flaring its large wings as it landed and leaving the table untouched by its arrival it received an extra piece of bacon for its trouble and scooted off to the owlery hastily clearly afraid that it was about to be laden with an equally weighty burden the young witch sighed in relief grateful that something in her life seemed to be working smoothly the periodicals last night had born essentially no fruit anthony zabini name had appeared in the covering of several charity and ministry events one of which had been thrown at his manor on the island of sicily but as to his professional work or where his great quantities of money came from the magazines either didntknow or werenttelling and knowing publishers it certainly wasntthe latter are those the other books we need remus asked leaning in eagerly and deliberately allowing his shoulder to nestle firmly against hers from the left side and remain he slanted a glance at her face trying to guess at her reaction to his touch but hermione dark eyes belonged solely to the package that james and sirius were already reaching for she swiftly placed the bulky delivery in her bag dislodging remus and setting it out of reach of the other boys at the same time we want to see are they the ones sirius was halfway out of his seat and leaning across the table hand outstretched like a demanding toddler reaching for his favorite toy it two of them the last one i ordered into folio we can pick it up there but as professor mcgonagall is approximately fifteen feet away i somehow think it an unwise idea to simply open them where she could easily see what we re looking at hermione said neatly zipping her bag again we can look at them after class today the two black haired boys across from her exchanged pained looks that bespoke pure impatience as sirius slumped back into his place and hermione laughed genuine delight ringing in her voice if only she had ever seen ron and harry look so excited about a set of textbooks and uh the other part are we going to get started on that soon james asked hopefully we still need ingredients james and hogsmeade isntfor another two weekends a flurry of looks passed between the boys at the mention of the trip james and sirius giving remus an intent stare and remus returning the look with equal heat his cheeks coloring red hermione head swung between them nonplussed by the peculiar nonverbal exchange what she asked nothing james rose pointedly from the table making an exaggerated show of checking his watch oh look at that five minutes to class siri i think i left my potions essay in our room you know i pretty sure i did too peter can help us retrieve them sirius all but yanked peter away from his breakfast sending marmalade on a spoon skittering down the table as the three friends marched out evidently leaving remus some task for james and sirius both turned at the great doors and grinned at him saucily before disappearing in the direction of the staircase what going on hermione asked looking at him to her surprise he was watching his plate as if it were quite the most fascinating thing he d seen in a long time remus she prompted worriedly in the future there were only the three of them comprising the center of her world and the workings of a five person group sometimes baffled her although none of the personalities were as volatile as ron and harry when they were angry with one another were james and sirius planning some prank erm well it nothing he mumbled shoving a bit of partially melted butter across his plate to leave a long pale streak i think the last time it was nothing for either james or sirius was the day before they were born what are they doing hermione asked dryly reaching for her bag and preparing to give chase to the mischievous duo and their mismatched third no actually they really aren t gryffindor having a valentine day bash he blurted changing the subject mid sentence as soon as his nerve mounted hermione blinked at the abrupt change of direction she knew about the party of course having heard trina and other girls in her dormitory giggling about it behind their closed curtains and she had seen flickers of dress robes made in satin and shining silk as they whispered and shrieked and swapped clothes but when she had casually asked lily if she were going the red headed witch had given her a blank look and answered with whom which had opened and closed the subject for both of them they had a tentative plan to do some arithmancy work that evening when their bedroom was sure to be silent owing to the large amount of noise being made in the common room i know hermione said hesitantly suddenly wondering with a faint apprehension where this was leading and there a hogsmeade trip that day he continued right another pause punctuated their halting conversation and to relieve the tension and hopefully some of his anxiety she lowered her voice and leaned closer to him to murmur dontworry none of the ingredients we buy have to be used fresh for this potion you guys can go to the party we ll brew it on the sunday afterwards no no he sighed that not i mean i was wondering just say it his mind screamed at him frustrated with his fumbling he finally shoved the question off his tongue would you come with me oh she sat back relieved that it wasntmore serious and caught utterly off guard to hogsmeade or to the party she asked her voice automatically filling space so that she could think without the weight of an awkward silence well both really we ll all be in hogsmeade together anyway and there a really good new greek place i could take you to for lunch and there supposed to be dancing and games at the party his mouth had run away with him and remus hastily closed it before he could make too big a fool out of himself hermione had cocked her head to one side while listening and she smiled at him as he colored worse than before and fastened his eyes back on his china yeah i ll go with you it ll be fun she said shrugging she glanced down the table speculatively to where lily was thumbing through their runes text and had an idea that would make it unnecessary to explain to the other witch why she suddenly couldntstudy that night d you reckon you could get ludo friend walt to ask lily the beater why remus asked perplexed cause he good at potions and arithmancy she replied rising and slinging her bag over her shoulder and lily thinks he cute come on james and sirius are probably waiting to jump on us right outside the door but they were right we do only have two minutes til potions 888 are you being miss kassandra zabini the high pitched voice behind her made kassandra jump fingers slipping as she tried to tie her bathrobe her cry of surprise clipped and short as she pressed her lips together annoyed at the house elf abrupt appearance one rarely saw them here being as students from the old families were forbidden from bringing their personal elves to the castle and those employed by the school kept themselves well out of the way of students and staff as they performed the chores that kept the school running i am she told the solemn eyed little creature and further questions on her part were not necessary as a stick thin arm extended scrap of parchment clutched there the tiny fingers wrapped around the now scrunched paper as if it were a precious jewel mister lucius malfoy says to give this to you the elf squeaked and as soon as kassandra lifted the paper from the elf fist it disappeared with a crack kassandra eyed the short note with extreme misgiving tempted to throw it directly into the fire without reading it she had made a thorough effort in avoiding slytherin favored son this term helped largely in this effort by the once more almost constant company of her twin whose disdain for the heir to britain largest fortune was well known kassandra suspected narcissa was also pleased that malfoy attentions had turned elsewhere yet again the daughter of aries black seemed unmoved by her intended inability to remain faithful to her now that their betrothal papers had been signed but disliked it when lucius seemed to be actively more interested in a particular girl than he was in her the burning of shame and self disgust that always accompanied thoughts of lucius malfoy a feeling that was gradually receding in minute increments with time returned as she unfolded the scrap and read the curt message unable to make herself throw it away unread meet me at 6 30 in the owlery on february 14th it just to talk just to talk he had deliberately chosen a time when everyone else would be in the great hall having dinner and preparing for whatever activities that night held for them he clearly intended the meeting to be uninterrupted it just to talk painful as it was to admit she had been a fool to think that she might be more than a diversion for him and now it was worse because instead of just bedding him she had unwittingly given him valuable information she folded the parchment and threw it into the flames watching the orange lick over the faintly yellowed page eagerly hurriedly turning it a deep brown she had yet to atone for the mistake of her revelations she had ten days to plan how to turn his own game back on him and it was time to discover how much and whom he knew 888 guess who asked me to go with him to the valentine party hermione grinned at lily genuine bounciness as the older girl entered their dormitory the red haired witch maturity fading to leave only a smitten thirteen year old impatiently waiting for hermione to participate in the age old game of guesswork books set aside on her bed cover as the door clicked closed hmmm you mean other than james potter hermione teased a look of annoyance was her reward for this remark but the other girl swiftly shrugged it away i said no to him lily brushed the question away with a flutter of her hand guess who else sirius black hermione i not joking someone did ask me someone i would go with she clarified the older girl shrugged eyes sparkling if it wasntone of your two worst enemies who could it be walt winters the name exploded in a breath of excitement and apprehension the gryffindor beater hermione laughed outright now pleased with herself for her successful machinations i know who he is you only canttake your eyes off him every match that not true lily challenged sometimes i watch ludo once an hour for about five seconds hermione retorted smiling walt is much better looking lily responded firmly plans for arithmancy study had clearly gone out of lily head as the younger witch strode to her trunk and flung it open in an uncharacteristic display of sudden caring for her appearance like hermione lily woke in the morning wiggled into whatever clean school robes were closest to hand and washed her face swiftly her one concession to female vanity were the waist length locks of rich red gold auburn that she carefully brushed and pulled into a plait or clips or a ponytail every day but now she was tugging at the end of one strand of hair as she caught one side of her mouth in her teeth and then she was pulling school robes and casual wear out of her trunk with both hands most of it flying to drape itself over the duvet but some of it crumpling to the floor in her enthusiasm as she reached the bottom she slowed and carefully lifted out her two sets of dress robes the ones she had worn to their first slughorn dinner and the much fancier ones from cornwall complete with elbow length black gloves as lily smoothed both out on her bedclothes hermione cleared her throat to capture the other girl attention i guess this means no studying on the fourteenth then dismay colored lily jade eyes dampening her high immediately oh hermione i so sorry when he asked me i completely forgot she halted her friend amusement plain on her face what i think i ll be all right seeing as i have a date for the evening too what why didntyou tell me before dress robes lay neat and forgotten as lily threw herself at hermione bed with a shriek of delight sitting next to her as she breathed who as she opened her mouth to answer hermione felt a warmth gifted by total contentment douse her from head to toe even her gradually deepening friendship with ginny weasley did not contain this wholly girlish and unsullied interaction she would not hesitate to call it childish but it was a slice of childishness she had been denied and so drank it in all the more eagerly now lily was often too adult for her years and the older girl treasured the rare moments that the other witch allowed herself to be the thirteen year old girl she was as she dragged hermione with her into a world of young teenage dramas unworried by academics and the grinding war that had wholly consumed hermione childhood and now seemed likely to take her adulthood as well remus i knew it lily cried flopping over backwards on hermione bed he liked you for ages you know almost ever since you got here hermione froze he liked you for ages and she recalled how long it had taken him to work up the nerve to talk this morning the way that he had stared so steadfastly at his plate and she barely restrained a groan as she pressed one slender digit to her temple she hadntmeant it like that how could she have been so stupid as to miss the telltale signs of nervousness that she had been so quick to observe in harry around cho and ginny and in james whenever lily walked into his line of sight you and remus will be cute together lily continued blithely totally unaware of her friend dismay you re both library rats he much nicer than the other three and walt asked me to go to lunch with him in hogsmeade lunch just the two of us that good hermione murmured distractedly her mind tearing down corridors of thought in search of a polite way to extricate herself from this situation without hurting remus and bringing down the wrath of the marauders upon her person she was a formidable witch but they were more devious by far and she doubted she could handle all of them at once what wrong with her friend abrupt switch of mood lily had once again become the grave serious girl that hermione knew best rhapsodies for walt winters put aside as lily worriedly peered into hermione concerned face hermione are you all right yes i just hermione almost laughed at the absurdity of her situation she had never been in such an awkward position having skipped over the intrigues and romances of her classmates in favor of fighting basilisks peter pettigrew and death eaters abruptly longing seized her violently lodging in its familiar place between her ribs and below her heart as she thought of ron ron whom she had spent the better part of two years yearning after ron who had recently turned his eyes to her and away from lavender brown after his poisoning if only it had been him asking instead of the hapless gentle remus and she suddenly remembered her first defense against the dark arts class her third year the classroom warm in the late summer afternoon sun remus lupin her memory of his greying hair contrasting sharply with the solid brown of the present day boy had been calling off the list of names familiarizing himself with their owners as each member of the class announced their presence he paused when he got to her and it seemed to her that he stumbled as he said grang and lifted his head to stare directly at her thirteen year old hermione had thought she d seen surprise amazement a hint of unhappiness and a touch of pain glisten there i see hermione granger is with us already he said quietly and did not call her name for her response hermione had wondered at the time at the peculiar recognition he seemed to grant her harry was the famous one that everyone knew by sight and the strangeness of the new professor seeming familiarity puzzled her but she had not asked him at the time and as he had never looked like that again she had become convinced that she imagined it was this why had she hurt him over this seven years before her birth and twenty before she would see him standing at the head of her class desire to laugh vanished as suddenly as it had arrived and quashing the homesickness that swamped her as memories of ron flooded through her hermione looked to lily helplessly grounding herself once more in time i didntmean it like that i remus is great but i don t i cantdate a boy three years younger than i am who will be my professor that just too unnerving you dontlike him like that lily guessed shrewdly yes hermione swiftly took refuge in the age old excuse that is no i don t that a shame he really is perfect for you lily said tapping her lips with her index finger at this a sound somewhere between a laugh and a snort escaped hermione he we re thirteen lily do you think walt winters is perfect for you no she admitted with a shrug and her eyes sparkled with excitement but he is very good looking and he said he d pay for lunch i ve never been invited on a date before by anyone except james potter hermione amended who doesntcount because he more monkey than human lily countered what can i tell remus that you thought he meant going as friends lily told her seriously returning to her bed to continue her appraisal of her potential dresses that is what you thought when he invited you yes hermione replied firmly so tell him that lily shrugged as she straightened each finger of the gloves spread on her four poster but i d do it before valentine day if i were you 888 valentine day dawned clear and crisp the sun shining over the snow in a distant way making it glitter brilliantly and warning the staff and students of hogwarts that the day would be bitterly cold hermione sighed as she rose to dress pulling on her robes slowly her fingers slipping over the buttons lily observed this behavior the opposite of her swift preparations including the curled hair that fell to her mid back in ringlets as she cast the charm on them you haventtalked to him yet have you she asked quietly as pushed her last bobby pin in place to hold her hair in a frame around her face tendrils deliberately falling to brush the edges of her cheeks what d you think she asked not waiting for hermione to answer the first question as lily nodded at her reflection and twisting her head around as far as she could to see the back i think you look stunning hermione said honestly walt isntgoing to know what hit him it was small wonder seeing lily look like this now that james potter tripped over his tongue every time she walked into the room and hermione recalled vividly her first impression upon seeing lily that she already moved like a woman having skipped the awkward stage of adolescent clumsiness hermione felt a stab of surprise that others had not expressed interest in the beautiful young witch unaware that like herself lily bookish tendencies and perfectionist attitude towards her work superceded her beauty and no i haventtalked to him yet she said softly do it on the way into hogsmeade right with all of his friends standing there good point well do it before the dance yeah hermione agreed half heartedly giving her appearance a cursory check in the mirror knowing that next to lily she looked drab and dull she had been dreading the idea of the sure to be awkward conversation with remus so ardently that she had avoided the marauders as much as possible over the past few days something that was growing increasingly harder as their keenness to continue researching how to become animagi had them actively seeking her company every moment that quidditch and class did not occupy them come on lily demanded impatiently from the door we re making them wait feeling that she would happily make them wait all day if it werentfor the ingredients she needed from the apothecary and the book she needed from folio s hermione reluctantly followed her excited friend down the spiral staircase 888 looks like loony lupin has got himself a girlfriend michael avery drawled as the slytherins jostled past them on the road to hogsmeade lestrange ensuring that his shoulder collided with peter s sending the smaller rounder boy sprawling face first into the snow remus dropped hermione hand to help him up as he sputtered james sirius and hermione placing themselves between peter and their slytherin tormentors wands out they were barely outside the gates of the school and hermione tossed the wrought iron spikes a swift glance hoping that none of the chaperones were close at hand to be paying attention to this not quite unexpected altercation between students shove off with your dogs lestrange sirius spat long willow wand pointed directly at the acknowledged leader of the pack what did you call me black tim wilkes had his wand out now as well avery and rosier were drawing theirs and lestrange was rolling his between his palms as if contemplating it a would be casual gesture that fooled no one for a long moment none of them moved in the chilly morning air unwilling to be the first to break the rules about fighting but equally incapable of backing down snape was next through the gate flanked by both of his cousins who walked perhaps five paces behind him deep in conversation great snivellus james muttered out of the side of his mouth dont call him that hermione snarled sirius and james exchanged exasperated looks in fighting dear me whatever next lestrange smirked at hermione what does it matter to you what they call him i ve had enough foul names sent my way to last me a lifetime she responded coolly snape had halted to assess the situation taking in remus and peter still crouched in the snow behind the front rank of gryffindors protecting them shoulder to shoulder he felt something burn within him as he looked at hermione scarf fluttering away from her head to loose her plaited hair ears already reddening with the cold snape lestrange greeted him without taking his eyes from the gryffindor triad les you seem to be having a touch of trouble with potty and his merry men your assistance would not be remiss lestrange replied in a light tone wouldntit snape had made no move for his wand and looking towards the trio once more he saw their triangle had shifted leaving him facing the american witch who increasingly haunted him he crossed his arms in a gesture of refusal to join the fight and ten seconds later he was extremely glad he had done so through the snow billowed professors mcgonagall and flitwick their escorts for this trip and no sooner had her red robes appeared over the hill than mcgonagall was running towards them angry impatience clear in her tone though wind carried away the words before they could reach the group of students who were hastily stowing their wands as if their professors didntknow precisely what they were up to five minutes and you re already at it potter black lestrange i see those wands pettigrew stand up boy are you hurt he shook his head to indicate the negative and she turned away from him to glower at the entire group in turn twenty five points from gryffindor for fighting thirty five from slytherin a cry of outrage rose at this injustice only to have professor mcgonagall silence it with a wave of her hand that took in the four boys that comprised slytherin pack and snape and his cousins there are more of you she snapped curtly professor hermione ventured quietly snape and the zabinis werent fighting total silence greeted this unexpected slice of honesty and hermione looked past her mildly astonished professor to meet the black eyes of klytemnestra zabini she could feel the other girl weighing her wondering what prompted this generosity and what hermione would expect in exchange for it thank you miss granger mcgonagall recovered herself and corrected the takings make that twenty points from slytherin and five points to gryffindor for telling me the truth and a detention for all of you her sweeping finger took in the nine combatants sirius and james looked positively mutinous at this pronouncement especially as snape stood behind their transfiguration teacher features stamped with sheer delight at witnessing their punishment i dontknow what will keep you from this kind of irresponsible irrational behavior the older witch lectured tiredly we ve tried everything with you potter and black and you too lestrange she turned her dark eyes on hermione disappointment glittering strongly in their depths and you miss granger i would have thought you d have better sense than to join in this childishness potter black wilkes and rosier you will report to filch on monday night for your detention granger lupin pettigrew lestrange and avery you will report to hagrid they will expect you at eight o clock sharp lateness will result in a further loss of house points have i made myself perfectly clear nine heads bobbed up and down precisely once the students waiting as her judgment hung in the air legs tensing to bolt when it was obvious she had nothing more to say the two rival houses turned firmly from one another and hurried to continue their trek across the snow leaving their professors behind them to shake their heads and roll their eyes snape fell into step behind the slytherins far enough back not to have to speak to them close enough to observe the group of gryffindors creating a parallel track not thirty feet away james and sirius breaking the trail and occasionally floundering in snow up to their knees for their trouble laughing as they wrestled with one another their black heads thick with clumps of white he was watching when remus lupin reached for hermione and tangled his fingers in hers and his black eyes took in the shyly pleased smile that graced the quiet boy features the slytherin halted dead unaware of his legs sinking into the snow as it collapsed under him an emotion comprised of searing hatred and desire flooding through him darkening his vision making it difficult to breathe with its weight and ferocity granger was looking at the other boy her face and reaction obscured from snape but he couldnttear his eyes from their co mingled fingers until the figures had grown too small to make out the detail and only then did rational thought start infringing on blind emotion he stood in the cold until he was sure he had his envy under control and continued towards hogsmeade at a slower pace unaware of his cousins observing his reaction and trading glances the brightness of his day permanently dimmed 888 hermione cursed soundly and almost silently as she stood in the apothecary staring at the empty display case and closest to her sirius placed a hand on her back in concern what is it he asked quietly they donthave crushed elderflower she sighed and we cantmake the potion without it sirius groaned aloud a sound quickly silenced as hermione shushed him they had already waited so long to brew it he felt his patience would snap under the strain if they had to waste another day do they order it in maybe james and i could sneak out with the invisibility cloak if they re going to get a new stock soon he suggested hermione hesitated unwilling to outright condone their insistence on breaking every rule they could but knowing they needed the crushed leaves if they were to continue and the next hogsmeade weekend wouldntbe for at least another ten weeks we can ask she conceded blowing a long breath as the need to help remus won over her ingrained compulsion for obedience she approached the clerk behind the counter and smiled shyly will you be getting a new stock of elderflower leaves soon elderflower he reached for a complicated looking table and ran one stubby finger across the parchment not soon as it not a product we have a lot of demand for next order is due in five weeks he glanced at her school project er yes she lied frowning with displeasure thank you she rejoined the boys on the other side of the small musty shop verdict remus muttered no good five weeks until the next order arrives five weeks james sputtered that forever from now can we order it from diagon alley yeah but it the price plus shipping if we get it from the apothecary there which i was hoping to avoid hermione sighed i ll cover it sirius volunteered immediately you know money no object with me she smiled wearily grateful for sirius complete selflessness when it came to the needs of his friends his eyes had brightened with this new plan all the impatience of a teenage boy clear in his immediate need to do something we can go to the post office now and send an order with one of their owls he straightened to his full height and looked around the shop is everything else here yes hermione answered i going to pay for this stuff wait for me at the post office galleons and sickles tumbled into her hands from theirs as each of the boys made their contribution to the purchase and filed out the door to run their next errand sprinting towards the post office in a rush of streaming black cloaks and red and gold scarves peter predictably lagging behind his pudgy middle and short legs in sharp contrast with the slender long forms of his friends as she stepped back towards the counter she found herself behind a lean figure with long dark hair buying a number of the ingredients commonly required for third year potions students she hesitated the long fingers she had observed for so many years in a dungeon classroom tapping the pitted stained wood apparently oblivious that she stood directly behind him much as she did not trust his cousins snape face had told its own story of betrayal and surprise that night in the rose garden and hermione felt that she needed his help as much now as she had when she had arrived but he seemed ill inclined to do more than shadow her and she had come to the conclusion that she would have to move first snape she finally greeted him he did not startle and his slow turn around confirmed that his failure to acknowledge her had been a deliberate choice not out of ignorance of her presence granger the coldness in tone and eyes solidified as dread in her abdomen he had not been so distant with her since before he had heard her sing and she thought she saw hurt underlying the ice in his black gaze snape could not help the next words that tumbled from his mouth shaped to wound where your boyfriend shouldnthe be licking your heels with the rest of your friends hermione recoiled from the verbal slap and her defenses honed after six years of word battles with draco malfoy wrapped her own exterior of indifference over the sharp unsettling pain of having caused him grief she purposefully chose not to correct his misimpression of her relationship with remus fire rising to meet ice they re doing something else snape she flickered a glance towards a shelf not far off where his cousins lingered absorbed in weighing mercury and counting unicorn hairs unlike you i dontneed bodyguards at my beck and call your total is nine galleons seven sickles and ten knuts the clerk interrupted them cheerfully unaware of the battle going on in front of his nose snape paid without looking at the man tilted his head with a sneer at hermione and departed the girl watched him leave his robes catching the wind at the doorframe to widen and fill the bottom area with black before the door slammed on his heels erm miss the clerk prompted sorry hermione turned back to the counter placing her items on the wooden top she barely paid attention as the man rang her up and she passed him money without thinking it was the first time she had spoken to snape since the fight and if the hardness of his voice told the whole story his cousins seemed to have turned him against her but there had been something else there a new look a clearer harder tenor to his glance than he had had while in the library not two weeks before some factor had clearly changed since then to turn him from uncertainty to dislike and she could only guess at what had caused the difference 888 kassandra mounted the stairs to the owlery with growing misgiving moving slower with every ascended step she had never sent lucius a reply but the look he had slanted her today as they passed each other in honeydukes made it clear that he was expecting her the same way one would expect a bitch puppy trained to heel to come when called she had not told klytemnestra anything about his note her twin would have tried to talk her out of going and now kassandra wondered why she hadntgiven her the chance she fingered the wand in her robe pocket reassuring herself that the dueling lessons she had taken every summer since her tenth birthday had adequately prepared her if lucius tried to use force just to talk she took a moment hand on the owlery door to quietly damn her consuming curiosity she had never just talked to lucius malfoy and his inclusion of that assurance in the message had tipped the scales ensuring her willingness to respond to him swallowing the part of her that was inclined to simply back down the stairs and go to dinner she pushed open the wooden door and entered the tower that smelled of feathers bird droppings and damp from the constantly open windows shivering as the wind greeted her entrance by swooping along her neck lifting her hair and sending cold down her spine kassandra lucius voice sounded its usual blend of honey and milk smoothness and as kassandra really looked at him for the first time in the six weeks since she had stopped sleeping with him she wondered how she had ever found the too coifed coldly patrician features attractive enough to bed in the first place he exemplified their house emblem a snake from his boots to his silver coated tongue and she shuddered faintly unease peaking malfoy she returned coolly you wanted to talk yes he replied and a frowning creased his pale forehead i have a question for you about music unexpected bitterness choked her and kassandra beat back sudden disappointment furious with herself of course it was about music she didntknow why she should have expected it to be anything else she opened her mouth to snap that music was a subject she would never again discuss with him and hesitated if she really wanted to know what he knew she had to string him along not shut him out she changed direction before her vocal cords could respond scathingly and her reply came out neutrally instead of course i guessed as much what about music precisely and why i need to know how to bind a musician power the malfoy heir replied kassandra eyebrows hit her hairline his reply was both direct and risky and it was unlike the boy she knew to be so honest how much power a lot who she asked he slotted her a glance his grey eyes cold and troubled and shook his head you dontneed to know in the half light of torches and snow reflecting the last late evening rays of sunlight kassandra saw that the features she had passed as his normal refined looks were in fact a shade too sharp and slightly nervous as if he were under great strain and not eating enough her mental evaluation of his situation climbed seemingly unflappable he was the ruler in any student situation and kassandra seriously doubted the pressure came from within who or what was he beholden to outside the castle walls i beg to differ we both know that kly and i are musicians i will not help you work against us he tilted his head in acknowledgement of her statement and waited a moment before he replied quietly the american hermione granger kassandra interest sharpened abruptly as for the first time she considered giving him what he wanted two months ago she had been furious when he had persevered over the transfer in witch jealous of her status as his only lover now however she and her sister had their own problems with the intelligent third year gryffindor her knowledge of the concilium a society that had to remain secret due to its very nature was too puzzling for comfort and the clear head she had for research and puzzle solving was bound to yield future difficulties as she discovered some nugget of information relating to their family klytemnestra had spoken of the virtuosic talent and power of the other witch voice which was in all likelihood the reason mrozcek had been interested in speaking to hermione to begin with and here stood lucius malfoy offering to essentially put an end to all their troubles at one stroke for him to remove her from the picture was almost too perfect a solution bloodless and blameless for kassandra and her twin and her cousin he might be broken hearted in the manner of young teens for a week or two but today he had been left to stand cold and alone in the snow as she walked off hand in hand with one of the gryffindor brats she counted amongst her friends and kassandra resolve hardened what do you intend to do with her kassandra carefully kept her tone bland granger there is someone who wants to meet her very badly and she will not accompany me by invite so i afraid i will have to use a different method of persuasion who wants to meet her i cannot say he returned and the firmness of both eyes and voice told kassandra that she would not get him to reveal this name she switched to the topic that truly interested her will she be leaving hogwarts yes for good the black haired girl pressed he dipped his head in the affirmative and gave her a strange look one corner of his mouth twitching do you hate her so much why is it important to you that she be gone reasons of my own she replied lightly she could almost hear the beat of the dance could feel the movement in her taut body point and counterpoint the exchange of information between two people who knew precisely what value it had cooperated only because they had to and were playing for high stakes elaborate what will you give me in return she directed the conversation away from her dislike of hermione granger lucius did not need a soliloquy on the subject she did not think that he was aware of her cousin interest in the girl and did not intend to tell him let him presume it was leftover jealousy for telling me how to subdue her kassandra nodded once he eyed her warily and asked cautiously what do you want the dark witch considered him seriously the sparseness of his conversation betrayed him in the circles they inhabited one only asked directly for something when one cared very little about receiving it or else desperately needed it within a given time constraint the pinched quality of his mouth the frustration in his eyes when he spoke of the transferred in witch told her that it was not the former lucius was clearly under intense pressure to deliver her and so kassandra knew that her price for her knowledge could climb the answers to his questions were a direct threat to many in her family and loyalty to bloodline had been long trained into the young woman if i tell you you must swear an oath not to come near anyone who bears the same blood i do and never to use this against them you included he asked a shade snidely using his sarcasm to cover how deeply he cared about the answer a blood oath of restraint was not one to be made lightly his wand would not work against any of her family including snape if he swore nor would his fists it was a high price to pay for the information he needed but this was his last chance of capturing the american witch instead of presenting his master with the second best choice either the girl standing in front of him or her twin and the oath would put them permanently out of his reach but the reward would be all the sweeter if he could hand over the girl the dark lord truly wanted i have to be exempt she replied contempt coloring her voice you will not be capable of performing the magic yourself unless you are hiding some musical prowess i am unaware of to bind a musician you have to be one he asked incredulous irritation in his tone even as some part of him acknowledged that it was far from surprising to discover this prerequisite of course your blood oath he looked into her black eyes and saw the same arrogant unyielding firmness that klytemnestra always draped around her and the coldness that was identical to her younger cousin s even in his desperation he could admire the aloof composure that dictated the terms of her compliance and he knew their careful dance had come to an end no choices his polished wand flashed almost gold in the light of the setting sun and a strip of red slashed across his white palm crimson trickling into the creases of his lifeline and joints crimson met crimson as she split her hand to match his and they clasped scarlet smearing and seeping through cracks in their palms to drip to the floor spots freckling the wood my oath to your bloodline that my wand and my fist should never be raised against one of you he whispered and his wand held in his left hand flared the yellow light of a protection spell streaming from it to soak into their joined hands as the after tingle faded they dropped arms immediately wands healing the tissue so that nothing but vermillion strips remained on either skin so tell me disclaimer not mine making no money a n many thanks to my beta trinka please read and enjoy trap laid sirius james hissed from across the table claiming their attention with his urgent snap a look of wounded disbelief followed by unhappiness alighting on his face as he jabbed his friend in the ribs with a sharp elbow his quick nod indicating what he was seeing rubbing his ribcage and muttering under his breath sirius swiveled his head to follow james glance in a unified motion eyes drawn by the attention of the two boys hermione remus and peter looked as well is that walt with evans sirius asked bruised body forgotten as he twisted fully torquing his spine and abandoning his excellently bred manners i cantbelieve this he knows i like her james whispered indignantly hermione smiled to herself watching lily curls bounce reflecting the candlelight as she walked down the length of the great hall hand tucked into the crook of walt winters arm head cocked as she listened attentively to some words none of them could make out without a glance for the group of boys staring at her she drew level with them and passed them by allowing her date for the evening to help her into her seat towards the far end of the table near ludo bagman why would he do this to me james was moaning the food appearing in front of them completely ignored in favor of watching the girl of his dreams chattering eagerly with the other boy bad form that sirius agreed sagely moving in on her especially with you guys on the team together i know i ve staked her out he knows i have next to hermione remus shifted guiltily the unknown agent of his friend distress after all it had been he who had spoken to ludo and the round faced quidditch captain had delightedly told remus that walt had in fact been eyeing lily for some months trying to work up the nerve to invite her out hermione rolled her eyes at this overt dramatic display of disappointment at walt having broken the complicated rules of honor that govern teenage boys and rose grabbing a roll to assuage her grumbling stomach her first instinct was to visit the library and continue her research regarding the still elusive mr zabini but a hand settled over hers as she stood to go smooth fingertips brushing over the back of her hand in a gesture of comfortable possession and query and she swallowed a groan his touch was a physical reminder of the task she had left unfinished the chore she had been avoiding that she had to handle before either of them did something spectacularly embarrassing pushing aside the large part of her that urged her simply to run to her haven she spoke instead remus want to go for a walk while these guys indulge in their pity party sure he agreed readily reaching for the bread basket that had appeared in front of his face a few moments before and picking up his goblet full of pumpkin juice they were forbidden to carry cutlery and dinnerware from the great hall but in the confusion surrounding the beginning of the feast necks craning and whispers scurrying from table to table about new couples and more importantly those who were not coupled and should have been no one noticed the small cup clutched in his hand as he followed her out she blindly started for the side door almost instinctively needing the freedom and privacy of the sky and the grounds and stopped herself the low shafts of light still streaming through the windows pooled in orange squares the color of the setting sun and the day had indeed been biting the wind piercing cloaks and charms it would only be getting colder now as the sun dipped towards the horizon she changed direction and instead went up the stairs her feet treading another familiar path towards the library remus at her side 888 as hermione rounded the corner with remus lupin kassandra was descending the staircase that led to the owlery her hand itched faintly with the after effects of lucius promise and she curled her fingers as if she could wrap them around her intangible goal she had debated for a moment telling her twin about her meeting with malfoy and the fruits it had yielded and almost instantly decided against it much as she treasured their re established closeness kassandra knew her sister would never approve of her actions and she might warn granger kassandra had seen the look of wary surprise on klytemnestra face this morning when the younger witch had defended them to professor mcgonagall and her sister firm sense of fair play something kassandra was discovering she lacked might cause her to spoil their plan and for the future should granger ever figure out who was behind her removal the fewer people implicated the better kassandra barely heard the voices as her foot reached for the bottom of the stairs and she snatched it back before it could betray her position head cocked as she listened intently something about the cadence of the female voice was irritatingly familiar granger walking with her new boyfriend a grim smile of satisfaction turned the corners of her mouth the hard ruthlessness she had inherited from her father pronounced in her eyes it was an expression klytemnestra hated not for what it was but for what it invariably foretold luck stood with her tonight the first step towards getting rid of the girl was knowing when and where they could do it and for that they needed kassandra folded herself into the shadow of the stone wall hoping that granger course with lupin would not bring her to the owlery and thus face to face with the raven haired witch she could hear her own heartbeat the blood that seemed too loud rushing in her ears as their voices grew louder though still muffled as if they were trying to have a private conversation in the large public space they did not glance in the slytherin direction as they passed and she pointed the wand hidden in her sleeve towards the younger girl a whispered spell sent a faint ghost of light to catch onto granger tangled hair glow brighter at contact and fade as it soaked into the strands kassandra waited until they had rounded the corner walls interrupting her view of the absorbed pair and murmured another spell her wand spun towards where they were walking and continued to slowly inscribe a circle in the air as they moved farther away the point tracing hermione kassandra pushed the narrow strip of wood into her pocket with determination her eyes diamond sharp and glittering like obsidian 888 unaware of the locator hex making the ends of her hair flare with silver fire hermione was nervously composing herself wishing fervently that she had begged off going to the bash tonight in favor of arithmancy study her books seemed like paradise in comparison to the silence she had allowed to become oppressive as she continued to delay remus she started hesitantly as he strode next to her hermione was grateful that he seemed to sense her mood for he had not reached to take her hand or wrap an arm around her waist she glanced around saw the passageway was empty and inhaled deeply a diver preparing to plunge remus i flattered you asked me to the dance tonight and you re a great friend somehow i think i know where this is headed he cut her off dryly sipping his pumpkin juice but you want to go as friends not like we re together she almost visibly winced at the swallowed disappointment she heard in the treble of his voice in his reaching for an aloofness that did not quite pass as genuine but truth was truth and she had allowed her cowardice to still her tongue for long enough yes the word left her mouth in a whoosh of sound carried on a breath she didntknow she was holding is that okay of course another sip of juice and then he frowned hurt and puzzlement married on his features but why didntyou tell me when i asked you when you first asked i thought you meant as friends i ve never at my old school i haventbeen asked out a lot she stumbled lamely searching for the right way to express herself without giving away any details and then when i figured it out i felt so stupid and i didntwant to hurt your feelings he smiled thank you for your consideration they re a bit battered but i think they ll be all right i sorry remus the sincerity in her voice soothed him and the grin stretched to finally light his eyes i ll just have to stand in a corner tonight and pine away with james both of us dying for the love of a woman he said dramatically throwing the hand with a bread roll across his forehead like a distressed damsel from a 1930 melodrama whatever shall we do when the lights of our lives are engaged elsewhere all right romeo she laughed cutting short his performance as he made to drop to one knee in his pathos let go back to dinner she checked her watch it been almost twenty minutes hopefully james will have stopped brooding 888 james had not stopped brooding and he sulked all night throwing jealous glares from a darkened corner where he stood ensconced with peter muttering dire imprecations under his breath though highly unpopular with the girls of her dormitory sirius seemed to be the rest of gryffindor house idea of hogwarts most eligible bachelor and he barely left the dance floor to attend to his best friend as he partnered nearly every girl in the room including hermione who delighted in the party now that she was no longer worried about remus at some point she had seen lily red curls slipping out the fat lady with walt and hermione made a mental note to ask her roommate about it the following day breakfast time came james still sullenly shoving his kippers around his plate as he sipped his coffee and with it the mail a smart looking owl dropped an envelope on sirius plate stuck out its leg to allow the yawning wizard to put five knuts in the small leather bag tied there and took off again what is it hermione asked curiously fingers already stretched towards the envelope in anticipation from the apothecary in diagon alley sirius replied voice still heavy with sleep he squinted at the ceiling which was currently filled with the warm light of a full strength winter sun how can it be so bright this early in the morning sirius black it ten o clock hermione said with affectionate exasperation just because we chose not to go to sleep until three am doesnt make it early now she tilted her chin towards the paper what did they say he slit the envelope scanned the message and rolled his eyes tossing the short crisply folded parchment onto the table as one the other four leaned in to read it they donthave it james said in disbelief irritation at this new obstacle replacing his pouting over lily immediately is there anywhere else we can get it from sirius groaned i dontthink so at least not easily we might have to wait until hogsmeade has a new shipment hermione replied her mouth twisting in annoyance elderflower was hardly an obscure plant but it was not a commonly used ingredient in potion making as the acidic pollen interacted poorly with many minerals she drummed her fingers on the table as she thought half listening as sirius and james roundly abused every apothecary they could think of for not carrying what they needed well she said to no one in particular if that all i going to the library hermione it sunday james said his bafflement clear in his voice why are you working you know if you spent half the time on the quidditch pitch that you do on your essays you d be a world class flyer sirius added be that as it may flying makes me queasy and unlike quidditch our professors care that we complete our schoolwork and in case you ve forgotten we have a detention tomorrow night she responded i want to get my homework done before then 888 hagrid was standing the in great hall when hermione remus and peter hurried in to meet him hermione started to smile to call a familiar greeting and stopped herself right before the words left her lips a faint feeling of disappointment ghosting through her as she stilled her tongue but the hermione who was friends with hagrid did not exist here and now and she had had almost no interaction with half giant since her arrival six months ago a sudden sense of loss spiked through her and she allowed it to wash over her and fade to a dull regret as the look he turned on them was kind but impersonally so as they stopped in front of him hagrid pulled out a large tarnishing pocket watch that was almost the size of hermione face and she was surprised to discover that she had actually forgotten how large he really was dwarfed by the soaring towers of the castle the massive mountains and ancient trees as he went about his duties as keeper of the keys it was easy to forget after glimpsing him for months only through the windows or briefly at dinner righ on time he smiled approvingly and glanced at a scrap of paper that had probably been crisp when the possession of professor mcgonagall but now bore water marks and dirt streaks from his handling and had one corner shredded likely lost to the claws of yet another creature that hagrid would call interesting while the rest of the world classified it with a triple x warning we re waitin fer two more he shook his great head black beard swaying back and forth slytherins he winked at them i reckon you lot gave em no more n they deserved eh peter and remus both laughed and hermione could not contain her smile twenty years would only further entrench hagrid dismal view of the serpents house and given what they had discovered during the second opening of the chamber of secrets hermione was unsurprised that he already had a negative attitude towards them the double doors opened once again and lestrange and avery raced in they doubled over as they reached hagrid and hermione peter and remus traded glances at their theatrical wheezing even if they had run all the way from the slytherin common room they were not this out of breath but hermione quickly called to mind draco malfoy slurs and insults more directed at hagrid than any other hogwarts professor and it seemed that like many things doubting the kind hearted man intelligence had passed from one generation to the next stan up he ordered them gruffly glancing back at his watch again before stowing it in his pocket yer three minutes late so that ll be another three points from each o yeh fer makin us wait both boys were upright in a flash anger replacing the flush from running in their cheeks as six emeralds flew upwards in the slytherin hourglass come on the big man ordered starting for one of the many side doors that would lead them outside what are we doing for detention tonight hermione asked and hastily tacked on a sir as she realized her tone had been far too conversational for the person he thought she was gatherin a few things fer professor sprout in th fores hagrid rumbled his reply as he started across the law forging another path through the unbroken snow his wide passage allowing hermione and remus to walk behind him side by side aw that so cute hermione heard lestrange drawl behind them a moon lit stroll together how romantic hermione felt remus tense next to her and saw both him and peter automatically glance skyward even though the full moon was another week and a half away and it was a slightly more than half orb that shed cold pale light over the refracting snowscape they even have a chaperone avery sniggered indicating hagrid tha enough talk hagrid growled from his place in front of them turning around to glower at the boys insolently bringing up the rear and keeping themselves fifteen feet behind the gryffindors in front of them yer not out here on a social jaunt you two we have plants ter gather now here he thrust several pages of parchment at each of them shivering gloved fingers extending to take them the five students gathered around him in a close packed half circle dislike suspended in favor of warmth are we going into the forest avery tone quavered slightly and peter looked positively panic stricken at this suggestion hagrid gave the slytherin a contemptuous look o course yeh don see these lyin around on the snow do yeh but on y a few hun red yards all of these plants can be found in th outer layer of the forest just past th unnergrowth but long before yeh find th really big trees don get too far in most things are hibernatin just now but there re some nasty things in there that never sleep can we go in pairs hermione asked quietly she had served her first ever detention in the forest although the circumstances then had been far worse they had been hunting voldemort albeit in the form of professor quirrell and she had been comforted by the presence of first harry and then neville as companions natur ly he replied good naturedly an use yer wands ter keep yerselves warm and light up where yer searching did yer bring knives five silver blades gleamed in the wand light and hagrid nodded good go to it we have three hours ter get everything on yer lists if yeh collect it faster yeh can finish earlier remus and peter had both scooted closer to hermione when she had asked the question about partners and now so smoothly it looked coordinated both turned to her mouths open to stream faint clouds of heat in the frozen air i sure all three of us can go together she cut them both off and started for the tree line only a few paces in front of them the boys looking quite relieved at this solution followed when he would think about it years later remus lupin would recall this moment as one of many where hermione did not fully make sense to him the swiftness with which she moved towards the forbidding gnarled branches iced with frost and the ease of her stride and straight unafraid slant of her shoulders indicated a knowledge of the place too intimate for her short span of time at hogwarts and spoke of a confidence that no thirteen year old girl could possess but even as his brain absorbed the image of her silhouette against stars and frozen trees his cold feet hurried him forward into the forest the more immediate concern of completing his task so that he could get inside and sit by the fire overriding his need to puzzle through his new friend i found the silver jewelweed peter announced delightedly ahead of him hermione wand tip joined that of peter and remus saw the crystallized sigh rather than hearing her exhale no peter it the right color this silver blue but remember what professor sprout said about jewelweed last week in herbology it has four leaves this has seven oh peter face fell but hermione wasntpaying attention she was examining the flower more closely a look of incredulous surprise on her face when she looked up at remus she was grinning on the other hand elderflower is almost the same color generally a little more purple than jewelweed and does have seven leaves you found it peter what peter blinked baffled at this sudden turnabout from correction to praise elderflower breathed remus kneeling next to hermione the snow melting through his outer robe ignored as he stared at the vine wrapping a slender trunk we can use this for the potion i ll have to harvest and dry it but yes she replied eyes shining remus blade was already stretching for it ready to skin the many flowers from the vine with a sweep of his arm but hermione hand stopped him not now hagrid is taking everything we get tonight and students arentallowed to take herbs directly from the forest for personal use i can come back another time this week let me help remus said probably not hermione shook her head one is much less noticeable than a crowd and you know that if sirius and james hear about it they ll come too you dontwant to tell them remus said in surprise after they ve been harping non stop for the past two days of course i do after i get it she responded with a smile less chatterin an more gatherin hagrid bellowed from fifty feet away the three of them jumped guiltily but hermione heard lestrange voice raised with hers to say yes sir before the trio turned back to the weed glittering blue with the frost i ll come back for it tomorrow or wednesday we wonthave to wait long 888 leave your samples on my desk good weekend everyone severus miss granger miss evans a moment lily and hermione swapped exasperated glances as they stoppered their beakers and evanesco d their cauldrons lily had been delighted to learn the cleaning spell and hermione twinge of guilt for teaching the other witch a spell they hadntlearned until their fourth or fifth year had been mild one charm would hardly make a difference ten galleons says it another one of those rotten dinners hermione muttered out of the side of her mouth as they approached the desk at the front of the dungeon i not taking that bet lily replied smartly hermione we ll be outside james bellowed over the din both hermione and lily turned at the sound of the older girl name and as james eyes settled inevitably on lily he flushed bright red and dashed from the room lily rolled her eyes but hermione heart squeezed lily and walt had been walking around holding hands all week causing james to lapse into fits of sulking whenever they walked by and ludo had remarked to sirius and remus that the locker room had developed a certain chilliness this past week hermione had found herself wishing that she could tell her impulsive and demanding but devoted funny and ever hopeful friend that he shouldntworry that in the end it would be his ring on lily finger and your bodies in ashes less than two years after that she thought bleakly and batted the thought away before the familiar depression could ambush her at slughorn desk snape stood poker backed and exuding coldness lily ignored him as a matter of course but hermione frowned the truce forged when he had heard her sing had been completely broken and what truly bothered her was that she didntknow why she reflected that as an adult the leash on his temper was short and that she should not be surprised that as a teen it seemed almost nonexistent but he prickled so easily like a hedgehog raising its spines and hermione did not know how to avoid provoking him i having a get together tomorrow night slughorn said jovially my office six thirty hermione stifled her instinct to groan she wanted to harvest the flowers tomorrow between homework lily and the marauders she had not found time as quickly as she d hoped to escape the castle and get the final ingredient for their potion remus eyes sparkled with their secret every time james or sirius mentioned it and peter was close to giving it away tomorrow would have been perfect i see that look missy it means you re going to beg off for studying but tomorrow is a saturday and i know you dontneed to spend the whole night working i expect the three of you here her round professor said jovially cutting off her potential objection with a twinkle in his eye that he probably thought made him charming yes sir the girls said in unison trying to sound pleased to be invited rather than bored severus murmured his acceptance before hurrying back towards his desk the gryffindors glass vials hit the desk with dull thunks at the same time and they turned together to walk out i noticed remus wasntin your pocket today you did finally talk to him lily asked hermione as they grabbed their bags from their seats neither of them noticed the slytherin near the door slow as he heard his rival name head turning to allow his ears to catch more of the conversation i did before the dance you might have seen it earlier if you hadnt developed a sudden addiction to the quidditch pitch hermione teased it ludo fault for having practice four days a week lily said her blush easy to see in the torch lit dungeon but he seems to have taken it well he did hermione answered quietly grateful beyond measure for the younger boy complete acceptance of her decision his evident lack of heartbreak had made the transition smoother for the rest of the tight knit quad and sirius and james had given her little grief i glad he more mature than the others lily pulled a face as they started for the door i wish james would bugger off so easily then her features brightened green eyes almost glowing with their intensity did i tell you walt and i are going to have dinner together tonight they walked past snape busily digging for something in his bag as an excuse to continue standing there as they made their way out lily filling hermione ear with excited details his face scrupulously turned towards the floor and his things neither girl could see the peculiar shielded expression comprised of surprise relief and hope inscribed on the normally somber face as they exited the room 888 after their first dinner around slughorn own miniature version of a round table hermione and lily had made a point of being early when they couldntwiggle out of coming the late entrance had been a mistake highlighting their arrival and consequently their positions as two of the youngest and the only two gryffindors to be invited into the club hermione felt that inter house politics had not been a large part of her life at the hogwarts of her own time but knew that they were intricately intertwined with it now and that an important aspect of survival was understanding the rules of the complicated game to that end she had also made a conscious effort always to sit where lucius malfoy could be far enough away from her that interaction with him was little but close enough to observe his reactions to the discussion fighting her gut instinct to ignore him completely he had proven himself a threat during her first term and the old adage keep your friends close and your enemies closer had run through her mind on more than one occasion as she watched him play the prince with his slytherin courtiers and betrothed those accustomed to getting what they wanted were all the more dangerous because no was not a word in their experience unless they were the ones saying it tonight as planned they were the first to arrive and hermione purposefully picked up her water glass she and lily had also made a point of never drinking anything other than clear water standing near the door with her friend refusing to sit until lucius arrived with the slytherin contingent at which point the table would fill and hermione could choose her place they did not have long to wait a few friendly sentences exchanged with their professor saw lucius sweeping in the door walden macnair and narcissa black right behind him the zabini twins paired together behind them and last in the line up came severus snape hands jammed into his pockets his shoulders hunched in a gesture of defense from the world hermione unobtrusively slid around the table as chair legs scraped across stone bringing her glass to her mouth to mask the movement of her eyes as she observed in an offhand motion lucius deftly pulled out narcissa chair for her even as macnair moved one for him it was a repetition of what they did every meal in slughorn office and it reminded hermione of nothing so much as a vain petty lord and his attendants this sequence did not intrigue her but as the zabini twins brushed by him to come around the table kassandra dark eyes locked with lucius grey over narcissa head for an instant questioning smiles curving both mouths even as their eyes remained flint hard klytemnestra in front of her sister missed the moment but the youngest member of the family entering behind his cousins did not and as kassandra and lucius broke their brief connection hermione and snape eyes locked over the table acknowledgement of what they d seen solidifying as it was shared hermione set down her water marking her seat but her hand touched the back of the still unclaimed chair to her right her brown eyes still on the tall slytherin her gesture one of invitation hesitation in the black eyes was followed by a flicker of recklessness a decided acceptance and a touch of hope that flared and dimmed as he hastily throttled the emotion as lily sank onto the plush seat to hermione left snape pulled out the chair on her other side what was that she muttered to him voice covered by the rustling movement of their dinner companions i dontknow he admitted his mind whirring engaged in wondering what had transpired recently between the malfoy heir and his cousin who had been assiduously pointedly avoiding him for the past seven weeks a slanted glance towards klytemnestra told him that the elder twin bore just as much malice towards malfoy that she always had and the easy way she sat with her sister meant she had no inkling of what had just occurred maybe she started seeing him again from her place down the table kassandra eye was caught by severus imbedded in conversation with the gryffindor witch as if they had not been deliberately not speaking to each other for the past six weeks and frowned nudging her twin as klytemnestra turned her head hermione laughed and the tiny smile quirking her cousin mouth gave her a sharp jolt of misgiving his longing and feelings obvious in his rising color in his usually guarded eye had kassandra made a mistake in telling lucius what he had wanted to know as she swung her head back to her menu her gaze snagged on the cold sea colored eyes of slytherin crown prince and she felt her stomach drop the determination glittering there left her with no doubts mistake or no it was too late to change her mind 888 where are you going lily asked as hermione seized her heavy cloak black scarf and gloves from their dormitory and started for the door i have an errand to run at ten o clock on a saturday night outside in the middle of february hermione there one and a half feet of snow on the ground hermione grimaced crossed back to her trunk and rooted for the heavy boots she had waterproofed the year before with a spell is this some crazy plan with the boys hermione schooled herself not to smile for lily tone though laden with genuine exasperation was also graced by the slightest touch of affection a new note hermione was sure since the witch from the future had arrived lily was already warming to remus and though hermione was sure it would take time the older girl no longer thought it quite so impossible as it had seemed that her fiery friend would wed james yes in a roundabout way hermione replied quickly lacing up her boots i should be back in thirty minutes what are you doing lily asked unable to contain her curiosity hermione merely flashed her a smile and vanished out the door black clothes melding with shadows in the darkened staircase 888 the forest loomed ahead of her the sun white reflected light from her sister orb striking the frost covered trees and making them glow with a luminescence that lent the already eerie grounds a ghost like cast as if they would vanish upon closer inspection a mirage to entrap the unwary but as hermione crunched through the snow wincing at the noise her feet made while cracking the icy covering the twisted trunks and jutting branches of pine birch ash rowan beech and dozens of others only sharpened in her vision and snatched at her clothing as she crossed the boundary from sparkling lawn into the silent giants she had no trouble locating the colony of trees wrapped with frozen elderflower but as she reached into her pocket for her knife her fingers found only the smooth wood of her wand not the cold metal she was seeking uttering a low clipped cry of frustration hermione glared at the vine in front of her ice coated it in thick beautiful patterns sealing it to the tree and rendering her hands useless but if she went back inside hogwarts she knew she would not want to come back out the memory of singing with snape clarinet and klytemnestra viola popped to the front of her mind and she vividly recalled transfiguring snape rat she bit one side of her lower lip speculatively as she gazed at the glittering ice encasing the elderflower she had no idea how she might sing to melt it but she had also not known before she started singing what sounds would produce a rat from a teacup they had been discovered but then mroczek had been here looking for her there was no one seeking her now and she could feel her spirit began to soar as her throat prepared to open the desire to perform for the night as immediate as her thoughts humming a scale to warm cords rough with cold hermione let out one quiet but swooping note allowing her voice to run from the bottom of her range to the top and watched in delight as the ice began to drip and then to run with her voice in rivulets of water over the frozen tree bark 888 kassandra wand told her the girl had left the castle walls the tip glowing red hot briefly before fading she rose from her bed swiftly jamming her feet into her boots preparations for sleep abandoned as she saw their opportunity unexpectedly arrive it had taken little discussion to reach the conclusion that removing anyone from within the walls of the castle would be difficult to the point of impossibility so she and lucius had decided that they would have to find a time that the girl left the castle walls not a common occurrence in the dead of winter especially with hogsmeade just behind them but luck had provided for them again and she would not spurn what was likely to be their only chance for some time in spite of her premature chills as her body anticipated breathing air that was well below zero sending another prayer of thanks to whichever god had decided to help her that klytemnestra was buried in studying with one of their sixth year friends and not present to ask her perceptive and awkward questions kassandra grabbed her heavy cloak and descended into the slytherin common room where she knew she would find the white blond slytherin surrounded by his many hangers on 888 they could hear the singing well in advance of being able to see her and kassandra felt her breath catch her heart pinching as her soul nearly winged from her body greedily drinking the sound klytemnestra was right the girl skill was beyond beautiful the quality of the notes ringing over the snow ice and earth seemed to come from the stars rather than a human being and kassandra felt tears streaming down her face as she listened to the young woman feeling spring stir in her voice she making it easier for us the gloating smooth tones of lucius malfoy broke the spell that had halted the raven haired witch in the middle of the grounds mindless of her total exposure as a black shadow on pure white she glared at him in the dark watching his teeth flash brighter than the snow underfoot as he shot her a hard smile true kassandra allowed quietly clearing her throat to force it back to normality turning her head to wipe her unseen tears from her face with her scarf she tossed a glance over her shoulder at a wary walden macnair she had not been overly thrilled at lucius insistence on his coming no more had he since that meant a foray into the winter night but the arrogant prince got his way lucius always got his way but now life danced up her spine as she listened her ears eagerly straining for every dip every slide every note piping from the trees and the daughter of anthony zabini wanted nothing more than to pull out the shrunk instrument in her pocket and meld with that perfect sound add to it multiply it until it filled not just the ring of mountains surrounding the castle but the entire world granger voice spoke of beginnings of snow melt and rivers roaring of saplings rising and flowers turning out their new leaves it contained the passion of mating animals the ferocity of their competition and the calmer but no less consuming love of a new made mother without conscious thought the case that had fit in her pocket was in the palm of her hand and she had enlarged it fingers on the cold metal of the clasp what are you doing lucius hissed his kid gloved hand seizing hers and tearing it away from the bronze i thought you said we were going into the forest so as not to be seen for a moment hatred and fury blazed in her black eyes the mantle of her aristocracy merging with anger at being denied that which she most desired lucius released her stunned by the intensity of the dark orbs that blistered as they focused on him stepping back as the force of her rage threatened to wash over him in the form of hexes from her wand kassandra i made you a promise he hissed as the fire began to dim rationality replacing the compulsion to obey the story told by the voice in the trees lucius was flexing the hand he d sliced open to persuade her we re going to do this now the young woman breathed deeply focusing all of her thought on letting the freezing air in and out of her lungs blocking out the sound that beckoned from the trees glittering in the moon light like massive upside down icicles lucius had sworn for him for her sister for her cousin for her family she could not refuse him now regardless of the lightness she felt as wave after wave of sound rebounded from her eardrums right she nodded shortly and cast a spell on her ears filling them with a faint irritating buzzing it would be too easy to fall prey to that incomparable voice again she gestured with one hand for walden to fan to her right entering the forest to stand at the due south point lucius would stand to the east and she would be northwest playing her own perfectly made french horn the boys would be using incantations to bounce hermione song back on her and the added impetus of kassandra horn would confine the younger girl power rendering her helpless and allowing lucius to do what he wanted with her as she passed the first layer of foliage kassandra halted hidden from the castle windows by the tangle of branches her lips tucked into the round piece it fit so well and she hesitated shame guilt and fear ripping through her stealing her breath if she did this she would be in violation of nearly every law both those made by the ministry and her family own stringent code she could think of she was using her power and knowledge to hurt another and not only another but one of her kind a fellow musician someone she should be willing to protect at all costs not betray and that voice was something to be valued beyond measure a priceless pearl she is different kassandra told herself firmly taking a deep breath as she regained control of her lungs she is a threat regardless of her talent my father would do the same refusing to examine that last thought too closely part of her knowing that introspection would cause it to evaporate she funneled her exhale into the mouthpiece its answering vibration rumbling through her in a welcome homecoming thought took second place as music soared in her ears quickening her blood with a deep tolling note the horn began to sound disclaimer not mine all respects paid to their proper owners a n i owe a huge thank you to my beta trinka and to everyone who has been reading and reviewing this story thank you all for your support i hope this next chapter does not disappoint trap sprung the song had long ceased to be about melting the ice it had taken a life of its own and vaulted through the frost rimmed canopy arching over her leaping into the sky bouncing off the stone both man and nature made to layer over itself again and again had hermione been listening she would have heard many voices raised with hers in song the world around her responding to its mistress joyous sound but for her there was nothing but the music and the narrow strip of her throat that produced a sound inhuman in its flawless beauty not only the ice trapping the elderflower she needed had faded under the coaxing of her voice snow was retreating visibly in a circle from where she knelt and in its place new grass sprang to life the process of many days accomplished in a matter of seconds as white ceded its dominance of the earth to a rich verdant green and the tiny purple and white spring flowers that blossomed instantly saplings began to push through next as the ground went from slush to thick mud to comfortable springy firmness under her knees in the space of a few minutes the music rebounding from the trees was so thick that the horn did not immediately penetrate into her world its sound one amongst many but these notes blared against her current the brass did not weave the same tapestry as the rest of the night it was not about growth and newness but about binding about entrapment about a trust betrayed and a waiting hell hermione felt physical illness swell and crash over her real as any ocean tide as the french horn went to war with her voice and she struggled to her feet bent double with the effort of defending herself from the thrusts interrupting her creation she threw her hands out to touch the trees on either side of her begging for their help in the only way she knew how grow her voice ordered her alto range reaching for its lowest pitches shuddering through the massive frames towering over her like guardians sliding into the trees roots and waking them from their winter induced slumber protect me her cry of desperation was echoed in the half scream of her voice an instrument no longer under her control but battling for her life acting without her thought or permission as the trees awakened and fueled by magic began to spread their limbs branches extended around her meeting and crossing to create a basket like cage she was dimly aware of the ice entombing the trees cracking and flying upwards in a whirlwind of unleashed song as other trees began to sprout leaves her view of the world outside thinned rapidly as they appeared like so many large green raindrops the magic of the natural world defending the too frail young woman who was its safeguard hermione could see through the rapidly closing gaps in her song made blockade the gaping mouthed completely astonished face of lucius malfoy crowned by the white blond hair that glowed almost like a halo in the starlight instinctively she felt that he was only the secondary threat that the wielder of the anti music stood behind her and as she whirled on the spot she found herself staring into the black shocked and horrified gaze of kassandra zabini ensnared by tree branches some twenty yards distant the french horn half sunk in a snow bank the bronze bell gleaming dully from refracted moon light amazement hurt and comprehension did not have time to order themselves before exhaustion claimed the gryffindor and she collapsed on the thick patch of grass that she had summoned in the middle of winter to be her resting place 888 something was wrong kassandra felt the music notice her counter playing and shift immediately an impossible improvisation funneling the notes into consummate anger generating protection the young slytherin had the distinct feeling that she was trying to remove someone important from the world and that the world had altered to stand in her way horn still sending daggers of sound into the night kassandra began to duck through the trees and bushes towards the source of the now strident music sucking air furiously through her nose supplying oxygen to her horn and her legs at the same time ignoring her lungs violent protest at this mistreatment as she plunged onwards towards the other witch the very air grew thicker impeding her passage and trees blew in a sudden stiff wind to grab at her clothing narrowly avoiding several one finally caught her robe and jerked her backwards momentum yanking the horn from her lips suddenly causing it to fall silent as it tumbled from her hands to imprint the soft snow peace blazed briefly in the interim the cacophony of warring vibrations abruptly ceased and as kassandra twisted trying to prize herself from the branches that had tangled around her to prevent her from moving closer she glimpsed her goal through the gleaming trunks and stopped foliage bent towards hermione granger from all directions magic fueled to make an impregnable fortress of wood leaves and vines but these were not winter spare branches enfolding the young witch they were new healthy and green like the birth of spring and kassandra felt terror and a sense of betrayal so deep her stomach roiled as if she were falling without end the deal she had struck with lucius was indeed a devil bargain nature had made it clear that hermione granger was no mere virtuoso she was legend molded in flesh 888 ice shattered upward in a whipping maelstrom of silver as the great trees of the forbidden forest groaned shuddered and fell still sealing hermione granger from sight sound and spells as the girl lucius had hunted for six months vanished in front of his eyes the ruthlessness that would become his trademark in wizarding politics seamlessly pushed his secondary plan to the forefront of his brain he had hoped not to use it but the magic he and walden had so carefully practiced using was misfiring off the stout tree limbs hiding the american witch their considerable power negligible in the face of what she controlled he cocked an eyebrow at his best friend walden ducked as another blast from his wand ratcheted off bark without so much as singeing it and shot back towards him and then met his friend gaze plan two he mouthed lucius nodded shortly and jerked his blond head in the direction of the dumbstruck kassandra still hung up by the trees in unison the boys raised their wands knowing that they had only seconds while the after ring of music still quivered in their ears to bind kassandra power and salvage lucius promise to the dark lord smug satisfaction curved lucius mouth as kassandra neck wrenched her head towards this new threat a light of unwanted understanding adding to the growing fear in her eyes as the spells struck home the horn only five feet away from her five feet too far to help the gnarled branches preventing her from reaching her wand what her face contorted with pain and rage and complex magic completed smoothly by the two friends long used to teamwork lucius stepped close to her close enough to warm her cold sharp cheeks with his breath her black eyes held all the panic of a caged doe and she wrestled fruitlessly with the branches and spells that had immobilized her what are you doing she whispered using the only tool left to her her voice i have a pledge to fulfill granger would have been better but he smirked broadly one of your family will do and as you made yourself exempt from the blood oath i swore to the rest of them he allowed the statement to twist in the cold air dangling her failed salvation over her and exulting in her dawning comprehension and fury now since the anti apparition wards you were so kind as to disrupt in your eagerness to remove granger will be operational again in a few seconds shall we behind him walden lifted the abandoned instrument from its place in the snow shining metal throwing lines of light across the shadow patched ground the sound of disapparation unsettled the remaining snow from the nearest trees as the three students vanished 888 the sound first tingled in bones a low level vibration just enough to discomfit and the more than a thousand residents of hogwarts squirmed slightly in their office chairs in their common rooms in the library snogging in the astronomy tower but as it spiraled up and out as the lone voice grew into a symphony the unsettled feeling moved from bone to blood to skin and fear rippled through students and staff as they sought the source a tide of humanity surging to windows to corridors to stairwells in his office dumbledore shot to his feet and strode to his arrow loop shaped window the school protective magic once more fluctuating painfully unable to respond to this music that recollected the re birth of the world and he felt more than he heard the challenger the sound that buckled the wards wreaking havoc on the spells that served as guardians and bringing pressure into the old wizard lungs lances of fire in his ribs making it difficult to breathe the brassy notes of a horn blazed in the frozen night cutting across the beauty seemingly woven by the grounds themselves this second sound issued commands instead of coaxing and the resulting clash was hideous to hear music fighting music under the pale almost full moon dumbledore readied to turn away to hobble down to the grounds and halt this unpredicted lethally dangerous duel when he saw the spire of ice shooting like a geyser from the edge of the forest on the far side of the lake each tiny piece catching starlight as it rose their slow fall back to earth glittering like a shower of diamonds the horn stopped abruptly mid note as if it had been whipped from its player and the headmaster of hogwarts watched wind spring up where the shards of water had descended dread lodged in his throat he had insisted on keeping the girl here certain that her unknown mission required her presence at hogwarts in the absence of other information but this was beyond his reckoning a magic more powerful than any he had ever felt a girl with more potential for destruction than anyone he had ever heard of as he stood staring unable to tear himself away from the lattice even as his breath began to send streaks of fog up the glass and obscure his view albus dumbledore prayed that he had not made a fatal mistake 888 spring passion and vitality surged through her the sound almost painful in its intensity even as klytemnestra fingers curled into their string positions and her right hand longed for nothing more than the feeling of her polished bow but whispers had turned to murmurs trickled to conversation deluged into cries of fear as students flooded upwards from slytherin common room taking her with them the disturbance rattling not just in their ears but thrumming in their veins and shivering in their marrow remembrances of the attack on diagon alley came from so many lips it sounded as if the castle itself was issuing warning klytemnestra zabini was deaf to all of it as she surged with the tide of black and pajama clad students frantically scanning the sea of teenagers for two faces in the many suddenly packing hogwarts ground level corridors granger her cousin was at her side making her jump with the name that announced his arrival what she stopped as the music radically altered the sound of a french horn cutting across the notes of creation throwing the sky and the grounds beneath them into conflict she would know the sound of that brass anywhere her sister name left her tongue in a whisper hoarse with disappointment and fear kassandra and lucius malfoy is not here either severus realized the blond head that was so easily seen distinctly missing from the crush of people and he recalled the strange look that had passed between his temperamental cousin and the spoiled aristocrat earlier that evening and the fact that granger had noticed it too and both kassandra and granger were on the grounds right now there were no two other people who could produce these chords of terrifying clarity and ruthless beauty his legs were eating the ground before his brain had completed its thought and he was dimly aware of klytemnestra in his wake parting students before them with nothing more than the purpose in their strides desperately wishing for his clarinet to weigh in and soothe the building fury severus reached the entryway and made for the side door klytemnestra now ahead of him her shorter legs breaking into a stumbling run as the cold air struck their faces and their feet hit the snow 888 lily breath stopped as she watched the spire of ice reach its peak catch the moonlight like so many knives and whistle back towards the earth she stood frozen tears running down her face hands clutching the flute she had yanked from beneath her bed in an automatic instinctive need to join the world in its celebration the resounding joy that she had first heard resonated at the core of her being transcending words and thought and even feeling as she sought to lose herself in a sound that promised a world reborn but those vibrations had been clipped short by a harsh blatting that had caused the red head to physically recoil her left hand rising to vaguely ward away the blow her insides felt squeezed as if a large hand had come along and wrapped around her ribs bent on slowly breaking them hermione she remembered abruptly and a new horror bubbled up hermione was out there fulfilling some mysterious task unprotected by stone and glass under the stars that flared too brightly as if heaven itself were part of the unexpected battle shrinking her flute knowing she needed the length of silver more than she had ever required her wand lily seized her cloak and tore for the door black streaming behind her like a banner as she tumbled down the stairs praying she was not too late to save her best friend 888 you have talent daughter of creation but if you would rule you require much in the way of training the voice recalling hermione to consciousness was gravelly and rough in a way that no human being could ever sound its sandpaper quality told of the struggle of new roots pushing through topsoil to reach for the life giving light of the sun of the creaking and snapping of branches under winter weight of the warmth and stickiness of sap running in march and the blossoming wetness of summer it was not a voice that had ever fallen on her mortal ears and yet one she felt she had always known as memories of a childhood spent scrambling up great trees and swinging down her graceful descent the result of a power she did not understand shafted through her mind but though something in the ancient tone warmed her instinctively her mind retreated from the words it had spoken and opened her eyes to study their deliverer her first dizzying thought as she sat up and pressed her hands to her temples in an effort to get her head to stop spinning with its sudden change of position was that she had imagined it her barrier of many shades of green and brown seemed empty of other sentient life as her gaze swept over the small enclosure but as she listened she heard the rasping of breath from near one of the oak trees she had touched in seeking protection and strained her eyesight lumos hermione whispered lifting her wand her eyes relaxed in relief at the flare of illumination and as the light filled the tiny dome distinguishing her visitor from the interlaced greenery the young witch stared her speaker was almost exactly her height and made entirely of oak the bottom half looked as though someone had hewn half a goat from once massive tree for the finely carved muscles cloven feet and twitching tail belonged to the four legged mountain climber but the top half belonged to an older man sunken abdominal muscles clearly etched in the wand light leading to strong if narrow shoulders a tree bark beard neither as long as dumbledore nor as short as muggle men kept them curling to end in the middle of his chest flecks of bark creased worn facial features and sap coated his tail and had crusted over his hooves he looked ancient beyond measure and hermione knew even as she thought it that it was so this creature standing in front of her was as old as the tree he resembled had weathered as many seasons as the forest surrounding them and as hermione searched the face for some signal of friend or foe she had the sense that the headmaster himself would feel like a babe in arms if presented with this visage his eyes alone looked human as they were not made of wood but large and liquid earth colored orbs shot through with jade and currently slotted whether in displeasure or against the sudden light hermione could not tell a faun the young woman whispered staring at this evidence of one more fairytale of her childhood brought to life his beard twitched and hermione was relieved to see a glint of approval in the widening eyes we are a race so long ago consigned to silent observation in the world of magic that i will confess that i had not expected you to recognize me i am one of pan folk he confirmed with a nod a faun though that is merely my shape i am a dryad the spirit of the oak you used wind rustled the trees above them cold and piercing reminding hermione that outside of her grove winter still reigned the wooden head tilted one pointed ear listening carefully when he turned back to her respect had been added to the other things in his face the trees say that the school no longer teaches such things are they mistaken no hermione answered dimly impressed by her ability not to stammer while trying to process too much i learned when i was younger from here she hesitated fiction and fairytales were the truth but somehow it seemed highly impolite to say so books of gods and legends she finished this was also true although it was genially understood in the muggle world that gods legends and fiction were synonymous but the spirit seemed to understand her meaning perfectly for he nodded sharply surrendering the power of creation to humans meant that we would one day be relegated to the world of the fairie and mist we knew that would be the price we paid when we agreed to it do not be ashamed of how you know child power of creation daughter of creation i do not seek to rule hermione told the creature softly you were born to rule daughter of creation the dryad corrected her quietly seek it or not it is what you must do that i am standing here before you is proof of your power for you summoned life to do your bidding turned nature to your needs you were born a witch the first since we allowed merlin to harness the power to human form for a purpose he cocked his head again and added however it is better to ask than to demand young one you will find that you get better results a desperate sense of entrapment closed around hermione with the words this creature uttered certainty permeating them with all the unstoppable force of a tolling bell with a sudden flash of insight she knew what harry had felt when he had heard the prophecy tying him to the death of voldemort naming him either the destroyer or the destroyed the life she planned the one she wanted seemed to have slid through her grasp more quickly than she could blink slipped away while she was looking the other direction seek the echo her professors had sent her here to learn this to tame this power to mold her into another instrument just as harry was being honed to kill we are sending you elsewhere to learn something vital to the war resentment flared strong and furious only to be met by her ferocious sense of duty she had committed her life to the defeat of voldemort when she had fallen into a devil snare at the end of her first year she could only imagine her regret if dumbledore had not sent her and she had later learned that her immense natural talent could be used to win the war and with the same resolve that had stiffened her spine at twelve to follow harry potter through a trapdoor guarded by a three headed monster and face a variety of traps and dangers hermione turned back to this new tutor ready to learn whatever he might teach her if you would rule the young woman had no interest in being a ruler of the masses but if she could master her own magic she might save her world mroczek had explained the echo of creation to her but now there was no way of trusting what he had said and even with his explanation there was too much that she had yet to understand about her purpose the young woman mouth twitched in a bitter smile as she reflected on mroczek words to her you intend to use this knowledge as a weapon child do you have any idea what you could do with your power your voice is not a plaything to be used at whim it was not a plaything and the problem was that she didntknow what she could do with it but from the attack on diagon alley and her own fresh experience it was clear that the sheer amount of power carried by music could be a large factor in any battle she intended to defeat voldemort in any way she could and she had discovered in the department of mysteries that the weapon she carried and did not know how to use belonged to her enemy will you teach me sir she asked adding the honorific hesitantly there was no doubt he deserved her veneration but what was the proper address for a tree spirit the dry rumbling laughed that shook his beard told her that he had seen the many emotions and thoughts crossing her features and that he approved of her careful thought and her courage that is why i am here you summoned me through your need and the world has offered me that others might hear understand and follow you though you are mistress of this magic by right of birth there will be trials you must bear rituals you must follow to gain acknowledgement of your mastery from the old races and only when you have managed to inspire their respect will you be capable of challenging the other voldemort it was not a question and the dryad gave her a cold look his is a name we do not speak he has no respect for the world from which he sprang the earth that birthed the magic he twists to his own ends he demands daughter of creation but he does so with much strength and many cannot stand before his onslaught be wary of him he lacks your innate ability but has long since made up for it by study and the capture of those who have a shadow of what you possess his strength is growing his knowledge formidable you will have to learn quickly if you wish to gain enough power to conquer him he paused and hermione ready to ask another question instead stilled her tongue and observed him as he swung his head slowly listening she was amazed at how easy the motion looked for a faun made entirely of wood how naturally he moved in spite of the brittleness of the material he was made from his eyes were smiling when they alighted on her again you will require help daughter of creation and it has arrived hermione frowned for an instant at this obscure statement but then she heard a voice worming through the heavy coat of leaves and moss shielding her from the forest there was distress and awe in the tone as it cried her name hermione it was lily and filling her other ear was granger in two different pitches one deeper and one higher genuine worry stamped on both open your cocoon young mistress and let them in the dryad prompted gently they are your orchestra hermione stared in dismay at the tangle of branches that had protected her she had not thought through the process of undoing what she had done and the woven wood had all the form and pattern of a toddler attempt at working a loom how she asked helplessly undo what you did the dryad instructed but slowly it is easier to grow than to shrink hermione thought about pointing out that one could simply slice through the trees but felt herself flinch at that option these trees had fulfilled her desperate orders and probably saved her life and they were living things she could not simply take off their limbs at whim she opened her throat and let sound run through it like water forming notes without words asking the earth to reclaim that which she had taken from it again gaining strength and momentum as if a conductor had lifted his baton the forest sang with her and the rocks from the mountains and the snow underfoot and another voice a boy voice reaching for adulthood undeveloped but showing great promise in flexibility and tone it was snape voice and her eyes were shining in wonder as the trees peeled back their leaves and retracted their branches as the earth turned to mud underneath her and swallowed the grass and the tiny flowers and then froze over the white carpet creeping forward once more to overtake her shoes and soak the bottom of her cloak as dark tree trunks and the star studded sky became visible once more hermione found herself gazing into the face of severus snape the passionate intensity that had been so remarkable in dumbledore office on the face of a man more than twenty years this boy senior blazing there once more as his black eyes locked on her the remarkable transfiguration of his features robbed her of breath and for a moment they stood frozen as if it were just the two of them clarity of purpose and power throbbing between them almost tangibly lily saw what she had suspected to be true two months ago when hermione had opened the christmas present from snape and klytemnestra could see the opposite and equal reaction that the girl had to her young cousin the rising tide between two people who were not so much human beings as forces of nature for a moment they both seemed limned by the golden glow emanating from hermione wand and then it had passed and four teenaged voices chimed together what are you doing here 888 kassandra first impressions while struggling back to consciousness was that she was freezing cold and that the surface she was lying on was far from the comfortable bed where she usually greeted the waking world her third realization as discomfort put the finishing touches on rousing her and she opened her eyes was that she was not alone the shadows were too dark in one corner of the smoky clouded room where she lay still bound and as she struggled into sitting position part of the shade stretched and detached itself dropping the dark hood as it glided towards her the girl raised in glittering aristocratic society recoiled sharply the face was far too pale the nose slotted as no human feature should be the brown eyes narrowed and diamond hard as he studied her breathing slowly to even her heartbeat as he advanced on her kassandra gathered together the dignity granted by many years of training as a daughter of anthony zabini and elizabeth prince and when he halted no more than three feet away she said in a cold voice lord voldemort i presume she had never met the self proclaimed dark wizard but his tread his fearless ease in dominating the room the movements that betrayed how accustomed he was to command made it clear who he was he stared at her sharply with this disdainful pronouncement of his name and kassandra was uncertain whether he would brush it aside or torture her on the spot to her complete surprise he burst into laughter the sound that bounced back from the stones was surprisingly warm for such a face a genuinely human sound uttered from features composed of all hard angles and slashing lines lucius is correct there is much spirit in you kassandra zabini ignoring the blinding flash of rage that seared her at the sound of malfoy name dropped so casually from the reptilian mouth kassandra curled her lip abduction and holding someone against their will is a crime punishable by imprisonment in azkaban she returned voice flat in the face of his merriment only for those fools careless enough to get caught he replied and though he did not laugh again the amusement in his dark eyes grew more pronounced kassandra eyes narrowed her father was owed money and favors by more than half of the senior staff of the ministry and the wizengamot voldemort might be a very clever and powerful wizard but when her father heard she was missing especially since she had already told him about the connection between the malfoy heir and the stolen instruments the lord could not hope to hide her in the face of all the resources her family had at its disposal ah but you see your father will not be demanding such things or rather he will tie them up in going the wrong direction expending ministry energy and galleons and ensuring my safety at the same time your presence here is my shall we say insurance for the meeting that i will have with your father the lord smirked a doubly unattractive expression on his face at her look of betrayed surprise at the easy way he read her mind the smile deepened as dismay replaced shock in her black eyes and kassandra felt suddenly cold as if ice had been blown through her mouth and nose to freeze her spine the cold came from knowing that she was looking into the face of a man without mercy or conscience voldemort enjoyed discomfort and pain in all its forms mild and severe physical and mental in an exaggerated gesture the dark lord dragged an old pocket watch of battered but gleaming silver from his robes kassandra mouth twisted slightly with disapproval in spite of her sudden terror as the guttering torch light caught the engraving of snakes twining over it slytherin colors were all very well green and silver was an excellent combination for displaying wealth and power but the obsession with snakes was a trifle childish and melodramatic not when you can speak to them the tall wizard in front of her said quietly and there was no amusement in his face as he looked at her now i have nothing but admiration for you miss zabini i would urge you to remember that you have a talent that i need your bloodlines are flawless and your intelligence obvious from your high marks at hogwarts your father has stood against me but i would hope that all of his children are not so blind as he in this world your talent in shackled as a crime i wish to loose it to allow you to study what you want to give you a free reign what is that you find objectionable about that this declaration and question rolled together was met with a stony silence kassandra frantically focusing on what little she had learned of occlumency from passing references and reading voldemort studied her for a moment longer then strode to the door when she did not speak i will meet your father in half an hour and you will be summoned then you will not be there to speak or see but merely to be seen and i would also ask you to bear in mind miss zabini in case you are one for rash stunts that no one will be coming for you i am not a careless man nor a foolish one i have been working for three decades to learn what i need to know to conquer the world and i have taken great pains to harness your family there will be no rescue party for you either now or in the future he waited until he saw the impact of his words on her fine features then tilted his head in the model of pure blood courtesy and let himself out of her dungeon wards of magic and the distinct sound of an iron key grating in the lock to replace his disturbing presence kassandra let her head fall back against the rough hewn stone and allowed tears to flow unchecked down her face the only one who had any clues as to her whereabouts was hermione granger and the raven haired witch had seen the expression of shocked hurt on the girl face before the trees had hidden her from view the echo of creation she had learned the truth of the power of music at her father knee and also of the legendary node a unique rank in the world a title consigned to a muggle who would never understand their virtuosic talent and never be capable of ruling could the slender third year from across the atlantic really be one the world of nature seemed to think so and if half the legends were true a magical node could effect a rescue their command of magic capable of slicing though any and all magic set by a mortal creature but the slytherin had sold out the gryffindor who was rapidly beginning to look like her only chance at salvation and she could not hide the truth that voldemort had so baldly stated no one would be coming for her disclaimer not mine all respects paid a n once more a devout thanks to beta trinka and my readers and reviewers it always a pleasure to get your thoughts please enjoy allies and enemies i anthony zabini eyed the ruined manor topping the neglected overgrown hill in front of him and once again cursed the over confidence that had led to his being here what had possessed him to apparate to the ministry and leave his wand behind this evening yes he had only meant to go find a few papers and return home but a wizard should always have his wand as the two well muscled white masked and heavily robed men at his back were pointedly reminding him the sharp ends of their wands politely lodged between his ribs and digging deeper holes as they voicelessly urged him to start walking again zabini debated resisting knowing his physical condition was well up to the task of sprinting through darkened alleys and streets until he could hide and then apparate to safety but an instinct more powerful than intellect drove his feet to obey their commands and start ascending the broken stone steps of a once fine garden he was a man who gave a lot of orders and the gloating arrogant confidence with which these men who were after all merely lackeys for some greater power had delivered theirs told him that they had some kind of insurance that made their plan absolutely failsafe and the death eaters were no strangers to murder he already knew so he walked back straight and head level weighing the probability that they would not want to risk exposing themselves by killing one of britain pre emminent business wizards against the knowledge that men like lord voldemort tended to simply dispose of those who would not obey his commands for zabini had no intention of bowing to the self proclaimed lord wishes he had never met the man himself only a few of his followers perhaps more than a decade ago when they had come oozing charm and oiled obeisance to ask for financial support from the owner of a european wide economic empire zabini had turned them away after fifteen minutes of listening to their drivel their nonsense and propaganda about purity of blood and race eugenics had earned only his contempt not the support they needed and as nobby had closed the door on their heels zabini had never expected to hear from them again there were always a few wizards who made a fuss about bloodline chaste magic and the negative influence of muggle borns on the wizarding world they were in the main largely ignored and so passed through the world with a great deal of noise and no visible effect except this lord voldemort who had been steadily kidnapping his customers for several years who seemed to have an eternity of patience and appeared to have amassed a considerable following no matter what his ideals there were rumors of giants and werewolves and of wizards and witches flocking to his banner from every inhabited continent instead of a blind megalomaniac anthony zabini was preparing to meet a far worse foe a rational logical patient mind utterly convinced of a falsehood so vast it wrapped around madness to come at sanity from the other side his thoughts had carried them up the hill and the house looked even worse on closer inspection as a pair of guards clipped out gruff questions his captors apparently had the right answers for after a few monosyllabic replies the double doors in front of him were pushed open to the sound of much squealing of hinges and he was shoved up a creaking staircase to a long corridor at the end of this dank hallway light shafted across a decaying carpet and mildew rotted wall from the far room he obeyed the wood prodding him and started towards it feeling neither dread nor fear but a peculiar tightness that he recognized as his body anticipation of swift action he would not leave this house in a coffin if he could help it after all a wand wasnta normal wizard only tool a fact his colleagues often forgot and he was far from a normal wizard drawing level with the room zabini stopped dead staring in surprise in contrast to the unsteady state of the rest of the house which seemed ready to collapse at the first hint of a stiff breeze this room was flawlessly decorated a sense of power and wealth drenching teak and cherry furniture velvet drapes and satin couches and armchairs the light in the room came from regularly spaced flickering sconces and a huge marble fireplace currently roaring with orange flame he estimated it could comfortably seat at least a dozen with standing room for another twelve to fifteen but there was only one man seated there now facing the fire as zabini stepped onto the plush green rug felt the wood withdraw from his back and heard the door close solidly behind him at the sound of the click of the latch the figure rose and zabini muscles tensed ready to fight or fly but the man who turned to face him white blond hair reflecting the glow of the flame and making it look as if his hair were afire was not the lord that anthony zabini had expected and he froze as his thoughts vanished eyes seeing the image before his face and wishing they were not a man he had spent half a year searching for a man he had trusted and needed as a brother the man who had betrayed him and everything they had once held dear when his voice returned he exhaled in a hoarse whisper abraxas malfoy 888 the sound of her song had gone straight to his spine sending chills rippling outward and covering his arms and legs with goosebumps even under the warm layers of his robes as nature retracted reverting to the winter world that had existed before her premature introduction of spring snape felt his soul longing to come out of his mouth and so he had opened his lips to let it his voice was an instrument he rarely used prefering his expertise at clarinet but lacking the woodwind it would do to raise his long unused cords to the stars with the rest of the world around them coaxing forth the mistress of such glorious sound and now the quiet murmur of nature swallowing what it had produced was the only noise amongst the iced trees the four of them breathing clouds over one another as they waited for the others to answer the mutual question what are you doing here it was klytemnestra who broke the silence first although it was not to answer the query but merely add another after much twisting about in circles and craning her neck where is kassandra her voice was hard angry and unyielding as she continued the scan the darkened trees both gryffindor witches glanced towards her in cautious surprise lily green eyes betraying confusion hermione dark brown eyes cool with mistrust the young woman from the future wondered at the wisdom of revealing herself in light of klytemnestra presence here she could trust lily with her life and the blazing look on snape face reminding her of the professor who had sent her here had eradicated the six week of his withdrawal as if they had never been but the zabini girl the dryad had seemed so sure when he had announced that her help had arrived but did he mean klytemnestra or only snape and lily and would klytemnestra soaked to the bone in aristocracy and slytherin tradition be an ally or a hindrance kassandra music and the clarity of its intent had shaken the young woman badly and she was disinclined to expose herself so completely again especially to the girl closest sibling where is kassandra klytemnestra repeated urgently but hermione thought she could detect a hint of disappointment now underlying the other emotions in the question disappointment at hermione for not replying the wild haired witch wondered or was the mixture of anger and deep disapproval directed elsewhere either way klytemnestra zabini had to be held at arm length until the gryffindor knew where she stood she might be here to finish that which her twin had been interrupted in doing hermione spoke steadily voice cold as the winter air seeping through their cloaks i dontknow she pointed to the tangle of trees where she had last seen the younger twin she was standing over there and her horn was in the snow i suppose she dropped it when the branches stopped her from deliberately causing me harm hermione expected the other witch to spark angrily at the accusation the italian temper of her father coming to the fore to berate hermione for the carelessness of her tone to leap to the defense of the family she held so dearly and indeed all of these emotions and more crossed the girl face a fractured kaliedoscope of feelings and logic twisting mouth and eyebrows eyes narrowing but instead of heat and the commanding dominance that seemed to come so easily to her clan submission surfaced as the black crowned head drooped and her shoulders rounded in an almost shameful stance making the slender girl look younger smaller and vulnerable i am sorry klytemnestra said quietly it was not a mumbled apology for all its low volume and hermione felt an abrupt wrench in her gut at this unexpected turn of character the other girl was being sincere klytemnestra took a deep breath and with the exhale she lifted her head again turned and started towards the trees to inspect the area where hermione had last seen her twin are you all right lily asked hermione quietly as klytemnestra was engaged in studying the snow i think so hermione said slowly uncertain what to tell them after the dryad announcements of rulership and the need to use her talent to battle voldemort the tree spirit appearance and unexpected declarations were almost as traumatic as the events that had summoned this triad into the winter night i have no idea where kassandra zabini is though or why she came out here with lucius malfoy malfoy lily and snape spat together their mutual hatred was evident in the venemous way they pronounced his name and they eyed each other with some ironic amusement following this disgusted cry yes malfoy they were hermione hesitated trying to recall the immediate fear their presence and music had summoned up in her they were it felt like they were trying to to isolate me it was almost strangling her gloved fingertips touched her throat as she recalled the panicked constriction of her voice but i dontknow what for or how they knew i would be here do you suppose it about what we saw earlier tonight snape asked quietly you mean at slughorn dinner but they didntsay anything hermione replied frowning clearly they didnthave to maybe they had it arranged beforehand what happened at dinner lily asked with a frown she had seen the twins sit down together flagrantly ignoring the rest of the slytherin contingent hermione shrugged we dontknow really but in spite of her flagrant show of disdaining lucius malfoy company for the past six weeks they had some kind of she trailed off unable to find words to express what they had witnessed understanding is i believe the polite way of phrasing it snape finished dryly what kind of understanding lily pressed one that theoretically would have led them to being here tonight snape answered silence descended as the three of them digested this and finally klytemnestra came tramping back through the powder her black eyes locked with hermione s and she appeared not at all to like what she had found nevertheless manners took precedence thank you the imprint of the horn is indeed there along with three different sets of shoeprints a beat and then did you see anyone else here with her malfoy snape told his cousin instantly they shared a look that surpassed loathing at the mention of the name klytemnestra disappointment and evident betrayal etched on her face small wonder she has not waited for us to be her welcoming committee the slytherin witch muttered kicking the snow but when her focus returned to hermione her manner had resumed the calm of her upbringing though the easy arrogance she carried daily remained at bay my sister has violated every commandment our family holds dear in addition to several ministry and wizengamot laws i recognized what she was playing and i think i could sense why the witch swallowed her pain and released a silent sigh do you know where they might have gone my father must be told and she removed from hogwarts what she did tonight is fantastically dangerous as well as significantly lacking in common sense and an abhorrent breach of protocol especially in regards to another musician such as yourself klytemnestra shook her head and a look of old bitterness passed over her face lucius malfoy i never thought she would be so abysmally foolish she is a threat now to herself and others a pause and then as hermione voice did not fill the gap klytemnestra whispered please hermione do you know where i can find her the use of her given name gave the other girl pause klytemnestra pleading tone made her genuine concern for her sister only too plain but the unyielding hardness to her voice as well as her words told a different story than mere sisterly affection and squabbles family shame the gryffindor realized suddenly the family defended itself fiercely but the actions of the daughter would cast a pall over the whole house if it became public knowledge hermione hesitated slowly replaying in memory the events before her collapse wanting to be as accurate as possible she had seen lucius malfoy and kassandra zabini and the music had told her that there was a third member of the ambush but she had not seen anyone else and her fainting fit had kept her from hearing or seeing any avenue they might have used to escape might they have simply returned to the castle lily offered but before anyone could ponder this entirely likely solution a different voice grated from near the massive oak tree she sought to betray and found herself snared instead the dryad addressed the group for the first time moving forward slightly in a rustle of leaves and creaking wooden joints all four pairs of eyes landed on him squarely three widening in shock as the tree spirit moved into the moonlight and they could define his shape from the trees his form oddly out of place his figure belonging to a world of stories who are you snape asked suspicion rife in his voice as his hand went instantly to his wand and he moved forward to place himself between the three girls and this new unknown and entirely alien looking creature hermione checked his stride with a hand on his upper arm fingers curling around his heavy cloak it all right snape he a friend what makes you so sure severus murmured keeping one eye on the dryad even as he glanced down at her for confirmation but klytemnestra did not have the patience for her cousin instinctive paranoia in the face of losing her sister to some unknown force or person what do you mean she found herself snared instead she demanded exactly what i said daughter of men the girl horn told of her impure intent her desire to help two sons of men remove the daughter of creation by force using music to turn her gift back on her they failed as the weak do when confronted with power that they cannot understand or control the one who shares your bloodline was removed as her allies betrayed her and used the binding spells meant for the daughter of creation against her instead 888 surprised tony the blond stretched luxuriously as he asked the question smiling warmly at the dumbstruck man in front of him grey eyes glittering with humor i knew you had turned your back on me i had no idea you would go so far as to join this madman careful what you say about the dark lord malfoy said quietly and zabini could see that the warning was sincere he is not overly fond of being criticised he waved for his one time friend to seat himself with a friendly gesture i will stand thank you zabini said coldly malfoy shrugged and perched on the silver cloaked arm of his chair and actually i hadntadded our numbers to his force until about six weeks ago when he sought me out to present some of his views and request our alliegance i know you stand against pureblood only radicalism what sane wizard doesn t but i think you might find the rest of what he has to say about music and the potential it has to serve mankind quite interesting i did why in merlin name do you think i would have any desire to listen to you zabini asked quietly the question was scathing for its disturbing lack of emotion terrifying in its flatness and it was clear from the distant look clouding the canny black eyes that zabini was no longer seeing the dark wood paneled walls around him his memory had pulled the scene of a morning in late august before his vision he had entered the small caverns inhabited by the keeper concilium as the rising sun was gilding the late summer trees in gold expecting to be greeted by the sound of their morning salutation dead silence had fallen on his ears instead and a hasty search had yielded janco mroczek lying on the ground in the barracks red smeared in long streaks around him as he bled freely from a wound at his temple and another of their order was mending his clearly broken arm the grim expressions on their faces had told him that this was no accident and the few clustered on the far side of the room started for him as he entered twisted looks that betrayed a hunger for revenge bending their faces out of joint as they reached for their instruments or opened their mouths it anthony he told them swiftly his own hand reaching into his pocket for his wand it would be a woefully inadequate defense against the musicians most of whom he had trained himself over many years but it would be better than nothing but to his relief the instruments lowered and the violent anger in their eyes had been instantly extinguished returning to a haggard look comprised of exhuastion and immense personal pain his insides seemed to fill with iron these men that he had led for more than two decades had the worn shell shocked air of people scrambling to right themselves in a world abruptly turned upside down wishing he wouldntask knowing that he had to he said gently what happened when he received no reply he focused on one of their youngest members standing in front of him and directed the question to him john what happened he glanced about instinctively seeking his second in command where rax the name snapped in the room like a whip and every head jerked to him loathing formenting in each pair of eyes it blazed so strongly zabini thought he might be ill from the weight of palpable hatred seething against the stone walls when john answered his voice was rough with grief and disillusionment he came here last night and was a different man he said it was time to stretch our muscles to stop living underground and acting like the gift we had been born with was a crime for which we had to atone he we here the younger man faltered and zabini heard the dry but steady voice of mroczek take up the narrative i argued with him he wanted us to go out and demonstrate what music and magic could do together breaking centuries worth of laws and traditions mroczek coughed spat blood out of his mouth accepted water from the wizard who had just finished healing his arm and continued he ordered me to join him or get out of his way i refused mroczek glanced around and smiled wryly wincing as throbbing pain lanced behind his eyes briefly darkening his vision you can see the rest twenty of our order followed him and they killed a dozen others in their escape volunteered another voice raggedly zabini righted a chair that had gotten the worse end of a battle with something and slumped into it feeling it sag as it took his weight running a hand over his face he looked to mroczek the man eyes were lively in spite of the alarming amount of crimson fresh and dried lodged in the creases of his face he would survive and zabini was surprised at the strength of the feeling of his own gratitude that came with this knowledge janco mroczek was the public face such as a secret society could have of the keeper concilium and had never made any bones about the fact that he thought two members of the wizarding elite had no right to be in charge of the ancient order zabini reflected ruefully that this event seemed to have proved his point he had not been here and abraxas his mild friend had clearly changed and had now hijacked the concilium for some purpose of his own we tried to summon you but abraxas knows all the ways to communicate from within and made sure we couldntreach you i sorry the hoarse whisper had been wholly inadequate to convey the depth of his feeling but no other words had found their way to his tongue and the faces around him reflected his angry sorrow expressions conveying what words could not and so the keeper concilium the last remaining order of musician mages in the entirety of europe the order that had looked to him for twenty three years for guidance and protection had been sliced from forty two to ten in the space of a night they were battered and exhausted and had no time to indulge in recovery for abraxas and the rogue members of the concilium must be found their power bound to them and permanently imprisoned before they could do more harm the prophet article in september about the use of music by those who counter attacked both the death eaters and the innocent in diagon alley had nearly torn his heart in half part of him had cherished the hope that abraxas would go to st mungo and offer their immense talent for healing that the wizarding world might indeed reconcile itself to the fact that music could be used for great good as well as tremendous evil but abraxas malfoy top political figure at the ministry flawless moderate and consummate family man could not expose himself as the right hand man in a music playing order and so he had kept his identity anonymous and violence had become his tool for glorying in the power of music tony lord voldemort has a ability to offer us freedom malfoy was saying and zabini wrenched himself back to the dark house and plush room surrounding his physical body by dent of much effort real freedom the right to play to learn to use what we are born with the ability to grow to branch out to help other musicians discover themselves in the muggle world there a whole industry based on music and i dontmean the strictly controlled noise that the ministry censors before putting on wwn i mean the real thing symphonies tony orchestras wouldntyou like your daughters or that young nephew of yours to have the opportunity to enthrall audiences leave my family out of this zabini ordered no flicker of emotion touched his black eyes but the command sent a chill down malfoy back he had known anthony zabini since the sicilian had stepped out of the immigrants apparition office in the ministry twenty five years ago and had spent hours a day and weeks at a stretch in his company but the smooth politician had never heard this tone of voice it was the voice of a rational man suppressing feelings so strong they might find their outlet in locking around someone neck and slowly thoroughly completely dispassionately throttling them i cantbelieve you re not even willing to think about it malfoy returned irritably recovering his footing it irrational what re a few ideals you donteven have to believe in compared to what we can accomplish when voldemort topples the ministry hell tony you can even expand your business whole markets that have gone unexplored because of their intolerance i have one fortune i dontneed a second one zabini returned icily and somehow all i can see when i listen to you talk about freedom and opportunity is janco mroczek who was supposed to be your friend and brother lying in the dust pouring blood after you attacked him he was in the way i gave him a choice malfoy flipped a careless hand and diagon alley was that also in the way we went there to challenge the death eater attack malfoy snapped angrily mood changing instantly at the scathing scorn in zabini voice but of course having been cloistered and never allowed to expand our talents in the field of say dueling there were a few civilian casualties we were proving a point that music has great power that can be placed at man disposal i would say you proved it marvelously zabini snapped back i play music i own music i send music to people all over the continent but when i heard what the rest of the concilium had to say malfoy i hated myself and when i read the prophet account of the diagon alley disaster i despised the art i had spent a lifetime striving to perfect i hated the fact that i had encouraged driven all my children to play i hated that i led you all to that massacre you single handedly have justified everything the ministry has ever feared about music and magic malfoy eyes had grown harder as zabini talked and as the shorter italian finished the tall blond rose shrugging his shoulders in a gesture of careless resignation and starting to pace as you wish i sorry that you re not more amenable to our way of thinking you were delusional to think that i would ever want to see you again anywhere but azkaban silence descended and zabini waited he had refused would he meet the dark lord who would threaten him with death if he would not comply or would he be released the next statement malfoy threw out as his circuit of the room brought him close to a darkened window was casual almost as if the last exchange had not taken place you were summoned tonight because the dark lord requires a conductor for his orchestra orchestra zabini knew that some of his panic had translated to his suddenly rigid stance for malfoy saw the abrupt shift in position in the window glass and turned with a smirk oh yes what with the musicians the dark lord has been capturing for several years and the added ranks of almost half the concilium he has amassed a sizable group of the best musicians the western world has to offer but he seeks the best to lead it the supple voice shifted to friendly seductive you are undeniably the best musician in europe and probably the entire planet who should do the job if not you zabini knew he was being offered a large slice of power within the organization as well as the chance to do what he had wanted since he was old enough to pronounce the word but the thought gave him no pleasure as his lips twisted in grim amusement the best was it he doubted it mroczek had been sent to investigate hogwarts during the fall term when a musician or group of musicians were causing the school wards to fail zabini had been praying that it was malfoy and the rogue concilium there were few better places to hide than the countryside surrounding the wizarding school but mroczek had told him on his return that he had instead encountered a young witch of thirteen who was the source of the problem a gryffindor named hermione granger who was also the node for the age capable of tapping such incredible musical power that one note could scatter even this orchestra of experts into the wind the first such witch born since the power had been concentrated in the hands of an individual malfoy bribe suddenly looked distinctly less tempting no the dark lord does not like to hear that as an answer malfoy snapped please tony dontmake this harder on yourself than you have to zabini took a deep breath the understanding that he would not leave the mansion alive sinking through him he wished briefly that he had gone to bid elizabeth goodbye tonight but he would not bend his knee to this racist violent lord the answer stands your friend was afraid that would be your unconditional reply said a cold voice behind him zabini startled and jerked around to see the owner he hadnteven heard the door open this was clearly lord voldemort he had black hair black eyes shot through with occasional disturbing flecks of red and wore entirely midnight robes that swept over his feet these stood in stark contrast to the almost corpse pale quality of his skin and zabini recoiled both from the sight and feeling of malevolence that draped over the lord as thickly as his cloak following the dark wizard came a burly man clutching a bound captive with long dreadfully familiar shining if tousled black curls voldemort long hand tucked under her chin and wrenched her neck around and zabini found the bottom of his world dropping from underneath him as he looked into the tear stained face of his youngest daughter her desperate father was distinctive even against the gag shoved in her mouth kassandra he glared at the most dangerous wizard in all of the isles the heat previously submerged in forced calm scorching the barrier of propriety to ash and rushing into his clenched fists his voice simmering how dare you lay hands on one of my daughers let her go voldemort arched one pencil thin eyebrow that is of course up to you mister zabini will you conduct my orchestra if you do she will be safe the thin shoulders rose and fell carelessly if you don t she dies 888 stillness had followed the dryad solemn words but it was broken again when klytemnestra whispered and where did they take her where did she go how do we get her back the dryad tilted his head for a moment and listened to wind as for where she is i cannot answer for my roots know only this forest and these mountains all i can tell you with certainty that she is not here voldemort hermione said softly the dryad narrowed his liquid eyes at her but she ignored his displeasure what why lily asked in confusion what do you mean voldemort your twin was taken to voldemort hermione repeated looking at klytemnestra the absolute weight of her certitude sank into the other girl as lead in a lake how do you know voldemort has been capturing musicians snape answered suddenly and turned to his cousin in a gesture of abrupt remembrance remember the article in the prophet about the people that he has kidnapped you told me they were all musicians malfoy obviously knew that kassandra was one and we know he has access to instruments because lily and i saw lucius malfoy with one going into knockturn alley hermione interjected she frowned at snape voldemort is kidnapping musicians yes klytemnestra answered for him i didntsee that in the prophet lily countered that because the fools at the prophet dontknow the thread that connects them all klytemnestra replied distractedly mind whirring ahead they just think he making random intellectuals at the tops of their various fields disappear but she exhaled heavily and wavered suddenly as if she were going to collapse looking very pale and cold in the starlight snape took her elbow encouraging her indirectly to lean on him which she gratefully did his solidity abruptly making him look older in the face of her vulnerability she looked to hermione after further musing and said slowly but how do you know that malfoy would take kassandra to voldemort because i know what i must do and why i was sent here and now to learn it because it is my turn to master my power and destroy that which voldemort seeks to become because i know what malfoy is and what he will become a ruthless man with a hunger for power that outstrips all of his other ambitions because it almost impossible that he hasnttaken the mark by now that his interest in me was purely for the sake of his master and he has no use for kassandra except as a stepping stone to his place at voldemort side because he spent all of the first term bothering me i a thirteen year old gryffindor who all brains and no looks so clearly it was about something else like musical talent but malfoy had no way of knowing that i have an inclination for music which means someone must have told him someone who is seeking musicians and has no problem with taking what he wants and who is willing to patiently acquire them one murdered family at a time over the course of several years i would say voldemort fits that bill you seem to have a rather informed opinion of him klytemnestra said and now it was her turn to be suspicious he hasntbeen a high profile figure for more than eighteen months just because it doesnthappen in america doesntmean we dontread about it our foreign correspondence has been full of reports on him for the past two or three years if those publicized disappearances are all musicians then the pieces of the puzzle fit hermione lied without pausing for breath or thought it briefly occurred to her to be proud of her improving skills to cover all the knowledge she had that was so out of time but all she felt was relief that no one questioned this story fortunately apart from a few muttered wishes that the prophet would report as diligently as their opposite number across the atlantic they left off the subject of her convienent knowledge and returned to the greater problem what were they going to do about it i suppose magical law enforcement is out of the question lily mused all three of them snorted in response klytemnestra and snape with the contempt that all powerful families have for those who keep order and hermione with a cynicism born of having watched them fail again and again in her own time are you eager to reserve yourself a room in azkaban for the rest of your life klytemnestra asked lily arched an eyebrow at the older girl green eyes glittering with irritation she did not trust or like the pureblood twins especially as the last month had illuminated their medieval attitudes that were cherished by so many of their class her willingness to help the slytherin find her sister did not extend to tolerating her superiority it was a thought she returned coldly klytemnestra looked as if she would like to respond but snape gently squeezed her arm where she still clung to him and she held her silence thought absorbed the cold night for a moment before the quiet chill was broken once more by the rough sound of wood on wood that characterized the dryad speech i submit that what you stand here considering is the wrong question daughters and son your talents the confluence of your lives the presence of the daughter of creation indicates a larger destiny to be yours look beyond the petty details to the whole you are here to rule and to mend not merely rescue the world is out of joint the balance of nature tested by the other to contort it further he has taken one you love and value but she is not the only one who matters there are many other lives you might save or destroy his dark gaze swept over them sternly it is for you to restore the scale of life to even measure at the first gravelly word their attention snapped to him like four fired arrows and they listened gravely but the silence that penetrated their bones as his last words faded in the air was loaded with no small measure of confusion green and black gazes swapping non physical shrugs as they tried to absorb the cryptic command what does it mean to restore the scale of life to even measure snape finally asked what balance and how has the balance been upset the balance is the music of all living things and as such it encompasses and connects the entire world son of earth the daughter of creation was born to defend this delicate dance the balance between music magic and earth light and dark night and day summer and winter birth and death are the symbols on the scale the other has distorted it and will only warp it further in his quest for those things that are denied to men the liquid eyes focused steadily on klytemnestra your sister has in all likelihood been added to the weapons working in his favor removing her from his employ will help you but it will not solve the problem his use of music in every realm of life must be halted the four stared at him and it was snape again who voiced their collective immediate response surely there is someone better to accomplish this task than four students the dryad tilted his head at them is there your world fears music and has allowed that fear to strangle and cripple it outlawing the whole in ignorance instead of seeking the knowledge that would lead them to freedom but i sense no fear in you curiosity wariness caution all laudable traits when brokering in a power that you do not know but you are not afraid to learn to try or to defy the laws made by men only talented musicians who are willing to undertake the journey on the difficult road of true understanding can accomplish what must be done there is no argument as to your abilities and combined with your courage they make you the cure to the world ailment kings and nations will fall before the other but if you unlock the secrets of your magic you will stand victorious before him but still why us lily asked in a baffled tone why not other musicians because no other musicians stand with the node she has chosen you whether on purpose or subconciously to rise with her as her champions what is a node snape asked swiftly seeking the answer at the middle of what seemed a long riddle but klytemnestra silent through the dryad calm delivery had worked out this answer since she had first heard hermione sing and seen mroczek reaction to her a moth drawn to the flame that would sear his wings and render him lifeless she had known janco mroczek for all of her life and there was only one human being who could inspire the awe and fear she had seen in his eyes the music tonight that had filled her with beauty and dread had confirmed her suspicions and the tree spirit had just put the finishing touches on her certainty her father had told her stories since she had been in her cradle of ancient orders and musicians their truth now shrouded by myth and here she stood in the presence of one whom every witch and wizard for a millinium and a half had been seeking hermione granger you are the safeguard of the echo of creation arentyou i am hermione confirmed quietly hoping that these two words would not trigger the secrecy curse that mroczek had bound her to but they seemed to be safe for the moment passed in silence the only change in the world the complete comprehension lighting klytemnestra features she looked directly into hermione chocolate colored eyes and understanding passed between the two almost women on a plane that the gryffindor had never before experienced the black eyes were warm with respect and unexpected loyalty and the quiet intense words following were almost unnecessary forgive my sister hermione she would never have attempted to challenge you had she known service to you runs in our blood part of our tradition as surely as the instruments we have passed down for centuries from now until you leave this earth you have the fidelity of my family our lives are dedicated to your pursuits in every arena and we live to see you victorious on every battlefield everything we have everything we are is yours disclaimer not mine this is a non profit tribute to the work of jkr a n my deepest apologies to those who have been waiting i hope i still have some readers after such a hiatus this story is not and never will be abandoned it can be very difficult to write at times but it will definitely be getting finished thank you all for your patience as always thanks go to my beta trinka who has re worded many an awkward sentence for me as well as regularly tending my muse in her sulks limits of power after his quiet declaration the spirit of oak stepped back into deep shadow allowing himself to be re absorbed by the wood from which he had sprung returning the forest to the creatures of the present as tree bark eyelids closed over his solitary human feature hermione gazed at her unconsciously but undeniably well chosen companions their exhales streamed like steam from the hogwarts express crystals mingling starlight highlighting features both familiar and utterly foreign the mysticism lent by the night by the music by what they had learned and the duty they had been called upon to fulfill casting them in older molds from a time of kings when wizards with their power had ruled the world hermione shivered with an abrupt premonition they were no longer students but warriors it freezing out here lily declared abruptly teeth chattering violently her words and youthful voice broke the mood and erased the grander vision returning them to their reality as just four stiff and chilled teenagers standing on grounds that would certainly earn them each detentions for a week if they were caught hermione lifted her head to study the darkened castle with some misgiving trying to remember where all of the entrances into the castle itself would be marked on the marauder map entering via the main door or even the smaller one of the caretaker would be exceedingly risky it was too much to hope that only these select few had heard the melodies that had rebounded from the mountains as if being created by the blanketing sky teachers were probably already crawling over the lawns looking for them for her dumbledore would already know that the music shaking the foundations of stones and trees had stemmed from her command we can use the slytherin entrance severus said quietly as if following her thoughts and she glanced at him sharply faintly unnerved that her teacher had always seemed aware of their antics was something she had chalked up to his formidable skills of observation and his compulsive relationship as the hated protector of harry potter for this fourteen year old to already hint at the trait that had harry muttering darkly about illegal mind reading was unsettling to say the least we ll have to klytemnestra agreed with a puff she and her cousin started off the gryffindor girls following them when hermione eye was caught by the frost glazed purple ish tones of the elderflower vine that had been her initial reason for this late foray into the night her gaze travelled up the vine as it looped around the trunk climbing in circular patterns as was its nature where it would tangle with greenery when the tree bloomed again in spring such a very simple task and yet coming to perform it had changed the course of her life and her world she leaned over and began stripping the flowers no longer encased in ice storing them in the leather pouch she had thrust into her pocket for this purpose hermione what hermione could hear lily hypothermia induced exasperation the tremors of her body coming through her voice of all times to be gathering plants these are what i came for you dontthink i left our dormitory in the middle of the night when the temperature is well below freezing just to give lucius malfoy a chance to capture me and end up meeting a tree spirit do you lily opened her mouth inclined her head in acknowledgement of the older witch dry words and shut her lips moving forward to assist in stripping the vine what do you need these for we dontuse them in potions professor slughorn said their acid make them a poor base so he did these are for a bit of extracurricular research hermione replied blandly lily threw her a sharp look practically wasted in the dark but the witch from the future could tell her friend was displeased with her secrecy by the tilt to her head and the flip of her red hair the boys she wasntasking perhaps hermione conceded quietly shooting a glance over her shoulder to see the slytherin duo standing a few feet away still shrouded by the barren branches of winter and likely frowning at her sudden interest in herb picking they had both proven themselves beyond doubt tonight but she dreaded the confrontations that would occur if slytherin dark prince and gryffindor golden son ever knew the import they both had in her world are we going to stand here all night oath of fealty or not klytemnestra voice rang sharply in the cold air as hermione stuffed the last elderflowers into the small bag pulling the drawstring tightly of course not she replied as she and lily floundered back to them through the snow and the four teenagers commenced dodging and weaving through the shadows rampant at the edge of the tree line keeping themselves off the glittering white expanse of the hogwarts lawn 888 hermione entered the great hall slowly the following morning scroll in hand james and sirius half rose from their coffee everything had been declared normal by the standards set for such a state at an institution of magic at seven o clock allowing them all to rush to their dormitories change and hastily perform their hygienic routines while the elves re set the hall but in spite of the reassurances of their teachers a defined heaviness had settled over the school the air charged with suspicion born of fear limbs trapped closer to bodies as if afraid of stirring the dread with flamboyant movement and the hall and corridors remaining unnaturally silent for a body of a thousand adolescents james blinked as hermione ignored them and made an arc towards the slytherin half of the room instead walking with an understated dignity that somehow fully matched the more formal mood of the castle he hesitated his impulse to meet her in the middle of the room and demand where she had been the previous evening arrested as she broke tradition and crossed the invisible line running between the rival tables what the devil sirius muttered a frown marring his face as he likewise checked his forward momentum james shrugged darting a glance to the doors again as another witch strode through them evans he said brightly flicking his fingers in that direction following hermione sirius countered as indeed the red head spared no glance for her new boyfriend her dormmates or breakfast and instantly joined hermione with snivellus the incredulity in sirius voice brought remus lupin to his feet joining them in staring to where hermione was now deftly inserting herself into the slytherin table gently pushing aside the fourth year that had been seated next to snape lily flanked his other side and the parchment hermione had been clutching was unrolled before them a terse whispered conference taking place between the triad and the striking young woman sitting across from them the rest of the table recoiled from the unlikely quartet as if associating with gryffindors was an air borne disease sirius and james both heard the hiss of remus breath as snape laid his hand over hermione forearm the gesture politely solicitous but assured enough to know that his touch would not be re buffed his half seen expression betraying anxiety their friend smiled at him briefly shook her head in response to an unheard question and stood lily coming with her as they crossed to their own side of the hall what was so important you had to talk to snivelly about it before even saying good morning to us sirius snapped snidely as hermione walked up to them the handsome gryffindor doubly irritated both on remus behalf and her clear evasions regarding the sarcastic slytherin in their previous conversations his kind hearted friend clearly knew the greasy awkward boy who highest aspiration seemed to be creating more curses than the rest of the student body combined and she had also found some cause to be civil even friendly and the pureblood scorned by both his family and his lifelong peers couldntreconcile a world where severus snape was worthy of hermione notice oh for merlin sake sirius dumbledore asked me to meet with him later today and he asked me to bring severus and lily hermione replied in kind the stress she placed on hogwarts least favorite child given name was almost a physical slap and all three boys winced it would be stupid to send an owl when he sits right there so i just told him myself morning james remus she smiled at the others the boys nodded stiffly the tension in their stances a wordless support of the tallest marauder and an unspoken indictment of hermione she ignored them in favor of seating herself pretending enthusiasm for the laden breakfast table why with sni snape remus quickly corrected himself hermione had made it clear that she would brook no insults directed towards the sallow slytherin that had for some unfathomable reason acquired her favor so much so that he could touch her with ease despite his acceptance of her decision regarding their friendship envy bared its green fangs in the werewolf gentle heart hermione shrugged as she fabricated deliberately moving to fill her plate and cup so that she would not have to meet their eyes we were all working in the library last night when everything happened i sure he just wants to fill us in on what he told you weird james said thoughtfully stirring his coffee he didntreally say much just a warning about not being outside after hours and not to worry too much because the castle safe sirius shivered and hermione watched a look of deep concern cross her friend usually cheerful devilish face when he spoke she was grateful that the previous night unusual events seemed to have expelled severus from his thoughts though she shifted uncomfortably at the grave fear tinging his tone a hint of the older man emerging from the carefree boy i d wager there a lot he wasntsaying though we all felt that it was powerful james and no matter what the headmaster said i dontthink they have it under control he probably just doesntwant a bunch of kids worrying about it since we couldntdo anything anyway it was beautiful remus said eyes lighting rapturously did you hear the way it started i could smell cherry blossoms just the way it is in the last week of april when they start coming out everywhere that was dandy until the brass came in sirius muttered shut it a fifth year near them snapped irritably shifting uncomfortably in her seat we re not supposed to talk about it hermione sighed and pulled out yet another textbook knowing her studying would erect a much needed barrier between herself and her peers it was obvious from this morning solemn pall that they needed to find a solution to their practicing and the effect it had on their surroundings very quickly as she started to read she noticed that the boys were not engaged in their usual cheerful banter that customarily revolved around two things quidditch and gently teasing peter about whatever he had forgotten the day before a swift glance over the top of her book revealed the pudgy boy busily scribbling another two lines on their history of magic essay but remus sirius and james were all watching snape with a single minded intensity that fomented a pit of unease in her stomach their glances were anything but kind 888 lily craned her neck looking for the slytherin pair as they neared the gargoyle hermione merely smiled i pretty sure they want us to go up without them we committed a breach today crossing to their side of the table and forcing them to acknowledge us it doesntdo to be seen getting too friendly with a pair of gryffindors the younger witch shook her red hair in exasperation as they muttered the password and stepped onto the spiral staircase house rivalry is probably the stupidest thing about hogwarts i dontknow why the founders were so short sided as to actually build it into the institution of the school lily cocked her head to one side as the stairs moved them upwards if they wanted a way to break us up why not by age they could have a different dormer for every year but instead we re all involved in this ridiculous internal war just because some ragged piece of head gear roots around in our minds and declares that we re more suited to this house or that house hermione smothered a smile recognizing another lily rant in the brewing she had thought the very same thing several times the sorting hat had given lectures on unity the past two years in her own life a peculiar turn for the very thing that divided them into warring camps at age eleven think about professor mcgonagall lily was continuing she a brilliant witch but if you ever watch her argue about gryffindor quidditch prospects with professor slughorn she instantly gets red in the face and is more likely to deduct points from the next slytherin she can it so senseless a very astute observation miss evans dumbledore sparkling blue eyes greeted them at the top of the stairs and lily face went scarlet as if being drenched with beetroot juice that is no disrespect the girl fumbled making an intense study of her shoes but hermione could see the headmaster struggling valiantly not to laugh i sure you meant none and i shall take none he said gaily waving them in i too have wondered why we indulge in such a peculiar tradition but the house system does have some good benefits as well older students taking the chance to mentor younger ones for example and ravenclaw and hufflepuff have very little difficulty co existing with the other houses i am afraid gryffindor and slytherin however we suffer from some very old prejudices he steepled his fingers as he sat down behind his desk gaze more serious now behind the half moon spectacles prejudices that unfortunately get stirred and re stirred spitting sparks like a cauldron never allowed to properly settle to that end he brightened again slightly i am delighted to see the two of you working with some slytherins in a true gesture of inter house he stopped for severus and klytemnestra had just appeared in the doorway hermione was grateful for the interruption he knew they were working together and she didnthave to think hard to extrapolate that the seemingly omniscient wizard therefore also knew what they were working on and with she swallowed dumbledore had saved her from mrozcek would he be so sanguine about her latent and largely uncontrolled power now that she had accidentally thrust it through the bones and blood of the castle thousand plus inhabitants come in come in dumbledore gestured severus instantly claimed the seat next to hermione tossing both girls a quirked smile hermione could not help herself as her mouth twitched in response coming from the reclusive boy the unguarded glint in his eye was practically a beaming grin his black haired cousin made to sit next to him frowning as she took in not one but two remaining chairs her expression of puzzlement was matched by the headmaster s forgive me miss zabini but is your sister indisposed i thought the note made it clear that she was to attend as well sir she klytemnestra cursed herself for her instant collapse of composure in front of the powerful wizard she had come prepared to address this very issue after all they could hardly hide it from him and he could probably help them took a deep breath to control herself and lifted her chin to look the aging man in the eye my sister is no longer at hogwarts professor dumbledore stared at her unmoving for a moment as fear coagulated in his abdomen if news of last night occurrence had already leaked out so swiftly that the zabinis were removing at least one daughter damage control would be nearly impossible i see precisely what does that mean your parents have not notified me my parents will have received my owl just this morning it was not their decision or doing kassandra was taken from the grounds sir for all of her years practicing manners under stress the sixteen year old voice shook as she whispered the last by force the fear materialized abruptly taking a far more immediate form this was an entirely unforeseen conclusion to last night already cataclysmic events by force he repeated carefully as if begging her to reconsider her wording when her affirmative nod was the only answer he continued heavily this is a serious charge indeed please tell me exactly what you witnessed or heard to bring this accusation against a fellow student or staff member hermione took over deftly allowing her proud ally to regain a dimmed mantle of the regal arrogance that came to her so secondarily the gryffindor witch told most of the story as she had been the only one actually present when kassandra had vanished a thunderous look settled over the bushy eyebrows as she painted lucius malfoy role in the abduction by the time she had finished severus lily and klytemnestra adding their short testimony as to how and where they had found her the headmaster usually cheery eyes held a mix of sorrow and anger so palpable they seemed to surge from him in waves permeating the office you said voldemort hermione jerked her chin downwards in confirmation and the blue and brown gazes locked information bypassing words her steady gaze telling the older wizard that this was not a statement born of wild hysteria but based on true knowledge hermione knew what lucius malfoy had become and she had a scar running across her chest to prove it if he is marking them so young the long nostrils flared in a physical outlet of otherwise suppressed emotion and then questioning eyes turned away from their internal focus and back on the youngsters in front of him you have named kassandra zabini now missing as the primary assailant playing the french horn and assisted by lucius malfoy you also felt with your music that there was a third person you did not see am i correct miss granger yes sir she answered the learned wizard rose in a fluid motion that belied the aching of his joints seizing a pinch of floo powder from a silver dish on his desk and tossing it into the fireplace as the flames roared their neon green he bent over at the waist in a flexible gesture and his head disappeared the tail of his beard flickering between the office and the other side no more than a few seconds later he was standing back and the portly form of horace slughorn was materializing under the immaculately polished grey veined marble mantle yes albus their easy going potions professor sounded distinctly disgruntled as he brushed ash from his teaching robes and straightened the forest green vest straining slightly at the belly i really dontappreciate being interrupted while revising my newt schedule he stopped abruptly as he took in four of his favorites sitting poker backed and apprehensive in front of the headmaster desk the same quad plus kassandra zabini that had been so markedly absent from the great hall the night before in a moment that hermione would recall for the rest of her life one that greatly altered her opinion of rotund wizard she saw genuine relief spark in his eyes as his eyes met the four of them tense but unharmed and his first words blew through his walrus mustache with the swiftness of one who has been holding his breath thank merlin you re all right an unexpected surge of compassion and respect filled the gryffindor witch slughorn might like to sculpt the ministry through his years worth of cultivation but it couldntbe denied that he had a genuine fondness perhaps akin to an uncle regard for those he had dubbed his rising stars yes horace these four are all right slughorn halted mid step hearing the emphasis and following it his gaze quickly darting over them again he paled slightly as he noticed the missing daughter of his house his head snapped to klytemnestra your sister kassandra gone dumbledore offered softly as he re seated himself sky colored eyes drenched with sadness as well as fatigue where slughorn head swiveled like an owl to the older wizard around his private table backed with rich heavy green drapes and impressively silhouetted by the fire it would have been funny here the daylight refracting harshly from the snow to combine with the sun pale winter rays streaming through the narrow windows his obvious desperation could not have made it less amusing we dontknow miss granger was just telling me a thoroughly disquieting story however i need you for a quick verification horace was lucius malfoy present last night when you counted your slytherins in the great hall slughorn frowned faintly his mind not following the headmaster s and his shrewd eyes adopted the slightly far away look of a man in recollection to hermione total dismay he began to nod his head balding pate glaring in the white mid morning light yes he was there i told you last night albus that the only three missing from my number were the zabini twins and severus here dumbledore let out a long breath as he turned his concerned eyes back to his students so you see you are going to have difficulty proving your story he told them seriously horace can testify that at the time we took stock of the situation mr malfoy was squarely where he belonged we can no more account for his movements before we all gathered in the great hall than we can for anyone else malfoy could claim that he was in the library doing homework and we would only have your word miss granger against his hermione ground her teeth and the wise man she had looked up to for years allowed his mouth to curve with a mixture of sorrow and sympathy his words the echo of those he would say in the hospital wing twenty years from now when the subject was the innocence of sirius black i believe you hermione but you will find that not many others will lucius malfoy father abraxas is extremely well thought of at the ministry he been out of the country on a special assignment for the department of mysteries for the past six months but there are plenty of his colleagues who will defend his son his mouth faded back into a grim line although his gentle compassion grew more pronounced as the spectacles turned towards klytemnestra i fear that your sister disappearance is going to create more trouble for the four of you than anyone else why lily asked this time he inhaled deeply as if bracing them for the words to come because unfortunately the only people we can show were missing at the time kassandra zabini vanished are the four of you 888 you have it the raw excitement vibrating from james potter wrangled the first genuine grin hermione had bestowed upon them all day her demeanor through all of their classes had been one of tight worry likely to snap at any sign of interruption since her meeting in dumbledore circular office that morning there had been nothing to say following their professor grim and accurate pronouncement if the blond aristocrat had managed to deliver kassandra to where he had taken her and return in time to gather in the great hall with the others there was no objective proof and if voldemort was willing to mark those still at hogwarts simply pulling up lucius malfoy left sleeve and hoping to see the gruesome skull betraying his oath was a laughably naive thought the newly forged quartet had left the office in seething silence each burning with the desire to do something and all knowing that their hands and wands were tied at first eager for details none of the marauders had yet made it inside the head of school private domain sirius questions had abated with her increasingly heated glares as the sun had set dinner had come and gone and even homework had been finished but all queries had now been abandoned in favor of sifting through the now pressed and ready for use elderflower leaves that she had tumbled out across sirius crimson duvet cover splashes of lavender the boys were collecting cautiously like precious amethyst when did you get it sirius asked carefully stowing a handful in a special pocket and where in the forbidden forest yesterday she answered wryly yesterday when did you have wait you werent in the library with snive the severity of her glance caused james to grudgingly swallow the taunting nickname and force a resentful snape then last night you were outside yes she admitted and before indignation could cloud james face hermione hurried to explain but i wasntgoing to say that aloud in front of the whole hall all of us were missing professor dumbledore assumed we were all together remus and james swapped intensely relieved looks in front of her baffled eyes but before she could ask sirius pressed quietly but then did you see what caused it she had clearly momentarily derailed from the purpose that had been driving him since before christmas or who remus put in no she lied calmly i heard it of course but we needed the flowers and her shiver was unfeigned as she reflected on the potential fall out of their actions less than twenty four hours before i wasntgoing to stay out there with it some of her distress had clearly cracked the facade she had constructed for the day because she found herself engulfed in a tight hug on both sides sirius and remus wrapping their long arms around her and tangling in her hair so that the mahogany curls obscured her vision and invaded her mouth boys she protested though she could clearly hear the laugh in her voice i cantbreathe with a final squeeze both friends pulled back remus shyly clearing the hair from her face with one gentle hand before his tongue could voice what the soft hazel eyes were already asking hermione was forging ahead rising from the bed and forcing a sparkle of adventure to banish her fears for the moment she had a potion to brew a complex potion that made polyjuice look like child play and in spite of the world that had radically shifted between last night and this morning she was still looking forward to standing over it watching it bubble the unique smell of heated metal magical flame and various ingredients tickling her nose where are we going to make it peter finally asked the question she had been waiting for i ll show you her excitement transmuted from act to reality as they scrambled to their feet bags bulging with the weight of the books they were using for research and she gestured to the door with a waggle of her fingers they would not be brewing in the girl bathroom where she had worked with harry and ron cracked mirrors slippery floors moaning myrtle and the entrance to the chamber of secrets were hardly ideal conditions for potion making they had long since discovered a better site it on the seventh floor along a certain stretch of corridor a little unplottable place called the room of requirement 888 you said there was a witness present when kassandra disappeared anthony zabini asked sharply drumming his fingers on the small intricately carved side table holding his untouched cup of tea that had long ago stopped steaming and was now decidedly lukewarm dumbledore inclined his head to the temperamental italian wizard making no attempt to hide his severe grief at having to impart such news kassandra had disappeared two nights ago her parents had spent the previous day with magical law enforcement and had now come to hogwarts to comfort their remaining daughter and hear first hand the account of events as given by hermione granger there was indeed he said quietly a young woman in her third year by the name of hermione granger she is ready to answer your questions if you want me to show her in please elizabeth zabini voice was stiff and strained with repressed emotion and the headmaster could not help but be impressed by the enormous force of will at the aristocrat beck and call raised in a society of rigidly adhered to rules and manners the descendant of the ancient and powerful prince line loved her children dearly and only the faint redness rimming her eyelids betrayed her grief in this public setting the aged wizard bowed his head and moved to his office door without further words though his knowledge was vast and the breadth of his experience with healing wounds of all kinds was unparalleled there were some pains for which even the best wordsmiths could not craft comfort though childless in the traditional sense of the word the headmaster had dedicated his life to literally thousands of them and he felt quite acutely the loss of his student how much worse it was for her parents knowing that the slender witch from another time had been waiting on the stairs for some minutes he turned the brass doorknob and pulled back the heavy oak to allow her entrance hermione stepped over the threshold for the second time in as many days giving him a nod of deference before turning her eyes to the parents of the dichotomous slytherin twins one had tried to kidnap her and the other had sworn her undying loyalty where would one of britain highest ranking couples fall in the balance the gryffindor eyes first fell on the wife and as she met the woman dark gaze something of the rather handsome face reminded her of professor snape from her original age perhaps it was the high cheekbones or the space black eyes that had such potential for expression and were just as plainly strangling those feelings as she stood there but the comfortable queen like carriage of her tall well proportioned frame spoke volumes about klytemnestra demeanor and without meaning to hermione found herself dipping her head in a half bow her neck gracefully arching in an acknowledgement of the social order and their respective places within it from mrs zabini striking but remote features hermione allowed her amber eyes to travel to the husband the same height as his wife deeply tanned and unable to keep completely still his feet and hands tapping unconsciously though whether out of discomfort or sheer anxiety the teen could not tell but when she locked eyes with him curiosity meeting curiosity the world tilted one hundred and eighty degrees the office faded and as with alexander mrozcek when she had first met him face to face in the forest several months ago music replaced speech lines of notes flooding her brain and arranging her vocal cords this man knew music understood its power respected the magic it drew on she could hear chords reverberating in her ears as she stared at him their lives shared passion bridging the gap between them filling the void a wrong note sounded through her mental symphony like velvet rubbed the opposite way similar to kassandra invasive horn two nights prior and wholly unlike the unified joyous recognition she had subconsciously granted mrozcek the knowledge they both possessed betrayed him and hermione jerked her gaze away as she began to squirm with the wrongness of the notes fear instinctively fixed her eyes steadily on her shoes to prevent a re connection and she saw neither the paling of anthony zabini face or the torturous pain that replaced the momentary ecstasy there the sicilian stared at the wild haired brown and golden eyed gryffindor girl in front of him and swallowed hard the rush of life still trembled in his limbs summoned by his many years of learning and practice coming to their pinnacle meeting the latent power of the echo magical safeguard there could be no doubt that mrozcek had been absolutely correct the girl standing in front of him was the node the most powerful witch born in a millennium and a half and one day he would either kill her or die himself in the attempt 888 lucius malfoy mrs zabini repeated quietly after hermione had completed her tale the young witch nodded sharply she knew little of lucius father although she had gathered from a brief interaction between draco malfoy and professor slughorn at the beginning of her sixth year that he had been widely regarded as a good man nevertheless this family likely orbited the same stars as the malfoys and probably knew them personally they would take exception to her accusations already significantly doctored because they could not reveal what kassandra role in the abduction had been without breaking the oath of silence they had sworn to mrozcek hermione knew that mr zabini was already too well aware of who she was but their peculiar moment had apparently gone unnoticed by both her professor and his wife and she was reluctant to illuminate any further understanding on his part but anthony abraxas clearly the dark haired witch had no need to complete her thought out loud for her husband to fully catch her meaning but hermione saw a brief look comprised of disgust loathing and anger flash through the wizard bright black eyes before his face smoothed back to his business visage abraxas has been a close colleague but we ve not seen his son since before the boy started at hogwarts and he is here there was an infinitesimally small pause as if zabini were forcing his next words off his tongue in a civilized tone currently out of the country for the ministry often away on business who knows what guidance lucius has had in the past seven years many sons do not choose to follow in the paths of their fathers and unfortunately some do he thought bitterly but the brand that was still new enough to ache under his long silk sleeve throbbed at the traitorous flicker and he managed to keep his features impassive the tilt to her chin indicated mrs zabini acceptance of her husband explanation and she turned her sorrow lined but piercing gaze to the headmaster effectively dismissing hermione now that she had filled in the details do you have any authority to act she asked and a coldness previously lacking imbuing her refined voice dumbledore shook his head slowly making his beard sway to my great displeasure madam i do not there is no tangible evidence supporting miss granger story except of course that i returned my daughter to school for the second half of her fifth year and she is no longer present the witch returned the gracious older man spread his hands in a gesture of deference madam zabini i will not claim to understand the fullness of your distress but believe me i share in its essence in all my years at hogwarts we have never had a student deliberately abducted from these grounds the wards make it impossible or so he raised a long finger to forestall the inevitable objection we thought to have this happen at all much less while i am responsible for your daughter well being is a source of the deepest worry and shame i cannot convey how much i wish to see justice done and truth served but how we have no idea where your daughter has been taken and the world is all too easy to hide in the word of an unknown thirteen year old against that of a wizard from a well respected family with eighteen years she was the only witness madam and there are any number of scenarios to be conjured up by a defense lawyer how do we know that your daughter didntsimply arrange to flee leaving miss granger behind to make her excuses and point the finger of blame at the look of outrage painted on the faces of all three members of his audience the corners of his mustache lifted sadly in a smile that did not reach his eyes we all know that version to be false but the defense could throw it and another dozen like it in our faces and the wizengamot truly would not know for all the proof that we cannot produce no authority indeed mr zabini murmured aware of the young witch wary eyes on him he had no idea what she had felt during their unspoken but revealing encounter but if her guarded expressions and words were to be trusted she had in some way divined his purpose and he did not know whether to feel fear or relief for such knowledge they were interrupted as the door thrust inward all further questions or inner musings cut short as his elder daughter by six minutes pushed open the door and stepped into the office miss zabini the headmaster voice managed to carry a trace of rebuke for her unannounced arrival even as the overlying tone was one of sympathy headmaster the slytherin returned the greeting quietly and then turned to her parents the training of a lifetime keeping her quick steps from turning into an all out run but the eagerness with which she reached out to her mother warmed hermione even as she felt her chest tighten with longing for her own though she had embraced a world that excluded her parents at the beginning of her magical education her mother would always remain one of her needed anchors outside the war torn environment and she treasured the peaceful harbor of her parents house and affection i dontsuppose you have any further information kly mr zabini asked gently and as hermione caught the morphing state of his handsome features her perception adjusted slightly the magic she knew next to nothing of had told her he wished her ill but the burning of a father love softened his composed face as he took in the sight of his remaining daughter and the young woman felt her innate sense of justice prick her uncomfortably unable to consign him purely to the world of those who wished her harm none the fifth year regret was genuine i wish i could even add my word to hermione s all three adults took notice of the casually dropped first name dumbledore was delighted that the civility he had noted at the beginning of this term had deepened to friendly interaction and her parents both lifted eyebrows in surprise the gryffindor had never before been mentioned in letters or conversation yet their child clearly knew her reasonably well but i wasntthere an awkward pause fell over the office following this demurral the family unused to experiencing their emotions in front of others the two gryffindors wondering whether their presence was still required when it was clear from the cut of mr zabini glance that they wished to be alone the headmaster of hogwarts bowed his head miss granger if you would be so kind to accompany me i have a few matters i wish to consult with you about mr and mrs zabini you are of course welcome to stay here for as long as you wish i will have one of the house elves attend you and miss zabini should you require anything hermione took her cue from the twitch of his hand towards the exit and started down the staircase hearing the sweep of his heavy velvet robes as they scrapped down the stairs behind her when she reached the bottom she automatically moved to step out to the right the way that would return her to gryffindor tower possibly by way of the room of requirement where she could check their simmering potion for all its complexity this particular formula only needed four days to brew for which she was grateful sirius was practically ready to boil over himself with impatience she would not hesitate to classify the man she had known as impetuous but as a boy the handsome youth was very nearly recklessness personified she glanced at her watch feeling the nip of time at her own heels sirius and james would probably be slicing and adding dung beetle eyes right now miss granger i would appreciate it if you would take a walk with me the headmaster halted her footsteps and she spun eyes widening he chuckled i did not merely use that as a ruse to get us both out of my office though it may have seemed that way there is a subject of the utmost importance that we ought to discuss sir she queried hesitantly was this the part where he told her she had to take her dangerous and attention attracting powers and leave she had been surprised at his lack of questions the previous day in the meeting with the others perhaps he had simply been saving them for a private reprimand and dismissal he smiled semi apologetically twinkle returning to his gaze as a mischievous tone invaded his voice i find that the forbidden forest has much to recommend it as a place for a bit of thinking at this time of year hermione felt as if she d been sucker punched all the breath leaving her in one audible whooosh he knew he wanted her to take him to the site of their unintentional summoning she could hardly deny him to her knowledge no one said no to albus dumbledore of course sir she replied maturity betrayed by recovering her aplomb much faster than any third year and many grown witches would have in the same situation she reversed direction and started down the passage to her left leading them it would be my honor 888 i am not going to expel you miss granger the soft almost amused voice came from behind her as they stamped through the snow hermione winced involuntarily at the powerful wizard inadvertent reading of her dismal thoughts no she responded and turned to look him full in the face worrying creasing her forehead and bringing her teeth forward to nibble on her lower lip no i sent you here and if your story about mr malfoy and the misguided miss zabini has brought one thing very much to light it is the constant danger you are in alex mrozcek said that your station as the node makes you the most powerful witch in the world i imagine that lord voldemort would go to great lengths to secure such a talisman in his arsenal he cleared his throat and the eyes that radiated such abundant energy glowed with compassion i cannot cast you out for him to find in addition to the damage a long term incarceration with tom riddle would do to you it would be a terrible mistake in the war in spite of mr malfoy breach hogwarts remains one of the safest places in britain and i confess the sky colored orbs crackled with eccentricity the familiarity of the doddering dumbledore from her first welcoming feast oddly soothing her you are quite a puzzle i have no wish to let such a fascinating study out of my sight the young woman arched an eyebrow at her headmaster wondering if he was pulling her leg awkwardly certain that part of him was dead serious she too possessed a scholar mind and the idea of studying someone deliberately inserted into history like the deft slice of a surgeon knife tingled in her brain as well but it was peculiar to be the object of such curiosity what are you hoping to find in the forest sir she asked him find i am not so sure that i am seeking miss granger but i do believe that returning you to the place where you performed such astonishing magic will answer a few questions placing the animal back into its native habitat and observing how it reacts she replied dryly he surprised her by laughing aloud a rich barrel chested sound entirely at variance with the slender frame that housed it he did not color in embarrassment nor counter her claim but tilted his head conceding her victory astute miss granger but then your intelligence has not been in doubt since your very first lesson here a memory of professor mcgonagall praising her eleven year old self as the elder witch held up a matchstick just beginning to show signs of going silver at the ends danced in front of hermione eyes and it was with a strange jolt in her mid section that the young witch realized that this memory was not accompanied by the bittersweet longing that had become an almost permanent backdrop on her emotional landscape it was removed as if it had happened to someone else or so many years ago that it was now simply a remembrance without feeling of any kind attached like an event from her very young childhood frantically hermione scrambled to summon up memories of harry ron and her other friends from the hogwarts that she defined as her own dashing madly through the past few months discarding recollections of sirius laugh of james exploding card castle of snape secretive and delighted smile swimming past lily bright eyes as if diving deep into a pensieve to re discover something precious and as the stream came ron white face after his poisoning on his birthday the bright smile he had turned on her only a few days before she left harry eyes shining with glee as they watched catherine wheels cavort inside the great hall setting fire to umbridge robes the caress of loneliness twined around her she reached for it wrapping herself in it savoring the sting she had fought for so long clutching the line that led to the future and the life she would return to relief accompanied the pain she had focused on submerging for months she could not grow accustomed to this world she was here to learn only to learn lily gleaming jade gaze replaced harry s snape solemn but not yet hardened and cynical face covering ron boyish one and the feeling of loss sharpened abruptly she might have come as a student and a soldier but there was no denying her attachment to this place so like and unlike her own especially the inhabitants who overlapped themselves in the shifting patterns of her recollections miss granger the headmaster voice cut short her too oft repeated spiral into worry and anger the ever present disadvantages to knowing what the future held sorry sir she murmured and realized that she had stopped at the frozen shore of the steel grey lake staring at the hard surface where late afternoon rays skated to pool in blinding puddles her gut was shivering she had not gone to the headmaster office equipped for another journey into february unforgiving weather i should have let you return to gryffindor tower for your cloak he noticed her suppressed trembling and waved his wand a delicious warmth settled over her and she watched the snow around them fold in on itself as it melted slightly from the warming charm i afraid my eagerness to start out on this tempting quest for knowledge interfered with my common sense do accept my apologies hermione smiled i can hardly refuse them sir when you have made me warm anyway most gracious shall we continue were you actually in the forest or just on the other side of the lake in the forest sir the gentle wave of his hand was an invisible push forward and hermione continued finding a trail of hagrid massive tracks and stepping in his footprints preferring not to break her own new path in the glittering and crusted snow they reached the far side of the lake surprisingly quickly and the young witch was grateful for her curious headmaster unexpected silence in spite of the quantity of information the dryad had imparted to them there was much she simply could not explain satisfactorily like the automatic instinctive and almost entirely uncontrolled use of music that had rippling effects on the world as a whole as they crossed the tree line into the darker world of the forest the large oak she thought she might recognize now in her dreams looming only a few yards in front of them the node felt a frisson of power tingle in the soles of her feet climbing up her bones it was distant but with a steady cadence that fell into rhythm with her beating heart the ground suddenly molded to her prints as if making specific spaces for her feet guiding her homecoming she was abruptly and completely aware of the mud under the snow and the slumbering roots of the giants around her buried in the frozen ground this was the land that had come to her direct aid and she could feel its recognition running through her a complex matrix in muscle and collective memory what do you feel dumbledore quiet neutral voice asked behind her sensitive as always to changes in his environment connection hermione whispered and she closed her eyes opening her hands so that her palms faced the oak still partially obscured by several smaller specimens breathing in the air that also seemed to stream into and around her bathing her ready to perform whatsoever she willed fascinating on what scale faint if a brass band marched through they would drown it out but for instance she lifted her hand to grasp the narrow tip of a tree branch next to her a low note vibrating in her throat almost a growl more than a musical sound the elderly professor held his breath fighting the urge to silence her the prejudice against such song ingrained so young that to protest it seemed common sense and second nature her voice modulated a half step up and dumbledore was astonished to see the branch move forward ever so slightly growing a quarter inch at the gryffindor command cold smothered him twisting his previous curiosity in his gut it had been one thing to sit in his office with a cup of tea and learn the history that the keeper concilium had seen fit to tell maintaining the illusion that the subject remained confined to the world of theory and academics it was another thing to actually witness even so small a manifestation of her power a distinct mewl of protest came from the roots she had just discovered beneath her and with a feeling of guilt hermione stopped and turned her brown gaze on the tree with an apologetic smile sorry she told the plant i beg your pardon growing during the winter is unnatural she is sleeping for me to force the beech to awaken is unkind to say the least especially for something that is no more than a test of my own abilities so saying she ducked forward her goal the gnarled oak of her summoned spirit and the wizard behind her noted an unconscious grace that she had acquired between leaving the bright sun lit lawn where she had been stiffly aware of her status as his student and the shadows of these trees where she unknowingly felt herself a queen unease rumbled louder at the back of his mind here it was her power and not his that held sway for all his many years of learning and accomplishment this young witch had been endowed at birth with a magic he could never hope to comprehend here she announced with certainty pulling to a halt some thirty yards from the edge of the wood this is where i was the other night this oak tree neither the aging professor nor his enigmatic student knew what they were expecting as hermione tentatively took up her place in the center of the sunken snow overlapping footprints from two nights ago plainly visible in the large ring of white the four had trampled flat preserved by the clear weather the prickly tenor of her connection to the earth resounded slightly louder within her and she could feel the sluggish nature of the dryad slumbering as well but as the minutes wore on hermione facing her new mentor home and dumbledore maintaining a respectfully wary distance nothing else occurred the forest remained as still as any normal winter day when most of its inhabitants had either migrated or were hibernating i sorry sir she ventured hesitantly turning back to face the azure eyes i dontthink anything is going to happen the headmaster face betrayed neither surprise nor disappointment indeed observing the young woman fluidity a quality she lacked within the imposing walls of the school and the way the beech had grown at her command had been quite enough for the curious wizard for today it quite all right miss granger as i told you i am not sure that i expected anything to happen wandless magics rarely manifest at our convenience however it has become abundantly clear to me that this is what i sent you to learn and we must find a way for you to do so without disturbing the rest of us every time you practice the perils for everyone are far too great the number of owls i ve had to answer in the past forty eight hours confirms that the hysteria against your gifts is growing we have thirteen students who will be withdrawn following that display his tone was not accusatory but hermione hand flew to her mouth as her cheeks colored in mortification he smiled at her i do not blame you and if what you have to learn is so critical i would risk sending you two and a half decades through time to seek it i have no doubt that the trade is fair there is simply no reason to encourage a repeat panic since there are ways of containing it it was hermione turn to observe as the elderly man closed his sharp eyes and slowly drew his wand for a long moment silence dominated the wood his breathing so deep and even that she wondered if he had fallen asleep on his feet when the end of his wand erupted in a silver pegasus the young witch gasped stepping backwards involuntarily as the magnificent patronus so different than its cousins the skeletal thestrals beat its feathery wings and launched itself through the brittle ice crusted canopy and into the blue sky her anxiety over who dumbledore might be summoning was allayed as she watched it wheel in a tight circle just overhead tracing the same spherical pattern above the treetops over and over again she was only vaguely aware of her professor muttering a few spells behind her as she watched the glittering beast weave to and fro reaching for her new connection with the air to determine its purpose the answer rebounded so gently she strained to catch it holding her breath as if hearing something of critical importance over a crossed wire protection the pegasus was creating a private pocket in the school defenses uniquely keyed to her and her gift that ought to do it dumbledore announced behind her his more corporeal voice severing her link as the pegasus dissipated hermione turned to him to see his eyes sparkling with good humor i must ask you and your friends to limit your playing to this twelve by twelve foot area he told her briskly twisted fingers sweeping to take in an area that she was relieved to see included her oak the wards have been adjusted to allow for the enormous fluctuations you cause but only right here the castle shields will in effect absorb all the magical echo you create keeping us from hearing you and from feeling the effects of what you re playing hermione stared at him acutely aware of the enormous trust that he had placed in the hands of four children power that could irrevocably alter or destroy the world sir words failed her there was no way to express both her gratitude and the back bending weight of responsibility he had just set over them the understanding expression that stole across his grooved face the sadness that tinged his eyes told her he had read her features and the wizard of more than one hundred years sighed how had it come to this using children to fight screamed against every moral fibre of his being the young and the innocent where those who were supposed to be most protected but more than twenty years from now they were losing and fate had once more twisted itself to make the most likely candidate for victory a seventeen year old student but despite her prodigious abilities the young woman in front of him was still in many ways only a girl and he could see the heaviness bowing her frame the too old look she had worn when he had first met her peaking in her eyes we can only be what we are no more no less he recalled the quiet words of armando dippet from many years ago when the then transfiguration professor had expressed deep seated worries about tom riddle that the headmaster would gladly adopt the girl burden as his own was immaterial he could not and so had to leave her to carry the sword unable to do more than indicate the correct direction for her march his hand fell gently on her shoulder and squeezed the slender slightly crooked fingers belying his strength their firm grip a testament to his regret and support do not feel the need to say anything miss granger miss zabini disappearance is proof enough of the dangers you will encounter and the strength you will need to overcome them i would spare you if i had the ability the node and the chosen one what a pair we shall make hermione thought grimly of harry hammered over fire to forge a savior from his first year of age restraining her desire to lash out at the older wizard for the unfairness of the universe dumbledore was after all merely human regardless of his seeming omnipotence he neither constructed nor truly controlled the events that had shaped her life thank you sir she managed quietly now i think afternoon tea is being served and as you had an abridged lunch you should probably get some nourishment he said purposefully steering her out of her realm and back into his dominion never forget miss granger that if you need anything all you need to do is ask yes sir she answered dutifully headmaster and pupil made their way across the lawn in stillness too wrapped in their own thoughts to make an effort at anything resembling normal conversation disclaimer not mine all non profit work rights are fully owned by jkr wb and others a n again my apologies for the time in between updates thanks to my beta tinka notes for previous reviews are at the bottom of the chapter thank you to everyone who is reading severus major d you think hermione ll have finished with dumbledore by now james asked as they slowly tilted the dung beetle eyes now the consistency of coarse black sand into the deep emerald potion shhh sirius hushed him his dark eyes seeming to grow more opaque with his concentration as he tipped the bowl the rest of the way allowing the last of the powdered substance to float down to the watery surface as the last speck landed both of the boys brewing and the two sitting on stools nearby held their breaths if they d done it right the potion should hiss bubble for twenty seconds and turn a pale shade of the same color a pastel instead of jewel tone as it began to bubble a tentative grin spread over james face sirius remained absolutely still willing it to become the color of the tall wild grass on the moors in summer he whooped as the popping subsided and it shifted greens smiling broadly as both remus and peter jumped from their seats to study their success fantastic remus breathed see james hermione was right you can brew potions only if i care about the outcome james replied and though his tone was flippant the sentiment was genuine and remus found himself smiling shyly the werewolf had truly been lucky the day that james potter decided to befriend him as a first year saving him from sitting huddled and alone at gryffindor lunch table now what sirius asked watching peter skim over the recipe with a stubby finger the round teen sighed impatiently a displeased expression that sirius favored scrunching up his chubbier face now we wait some more this has to settle for the next six hours remus and james reflexively checked their watches as sirius groaned aloud we ll still have time to do the next step today sirius remus pointed out it only about half three almost tea time let go see if hermione is done with the headmaster james said reaching for his schoolbag and slinging it over his shoulder the rest of his friends followed suit and they quietly poked their heads around the door of the secret room checking the corridor for signs of others when none were found they swiftly filed out watching as the door was swallowed wood giving way to smooth stone wall this is an amazing room sirius remarked as they started down the corridor yeah one has to wonder how hermione knew it was there james responded in the tone of someone who was not going to answer his own question but behind him remus stopped walking a nagging feeling in his gut increasing the little details of too many incidents littering his mind pieces of a puzzle that he had yet to determine the size or shape of but knowing that at its center was their new best friend how had hermione known it was there she had been at hogwarts for a mere six months and though she read voraciously no amount of book learning could account for the automatic knowledge her body possessed of castle and grounds the ease with which she moved the seeming innate sense of timing she had when jumping staircases or avoiding the fortress quirky traps remus his friends had stopped at the far end of the hallway and were giving the werewolf identical looks of concern all right yes i was trying to remember whether i d forgotten something he fabricated vaguely moving his feet again he wished he could name the peculiar feeling that sometimes pervaded him but it was dim a ghost one caught out of the corner of an eye but disappeared when stared at full on but i dontthink i did he supplied as sirius raised his eyebrows waiting for a conclusion one moving staircase later they were in the corridor leading to the headmaster gargoyle as they strode up to the imposing stone guardian a solitary figure rounded the opposite corner intent on the same destination snivellus sirius muttered jabbing james in the ribs as the slytherin drew closer what are you doing here potter black severus snapped his family had requested his presence and after the events of the past two days he had no desire to bandy hexes with hermione gryffindor crowd the headmaster office was in a little used section of the castle if the four of them decided to do something unpleasant to him it could be some hours before their mischief came to light i fail to see what business that is of yours james rejoined quickly the memory of his pale faced rival ease with hermione butted to the front of his mind and a poisonous thought occurred to him was snape here for the same reason they were indignation and protective jealousy roared to life and james found his wand in his hand before he stopped to think about it leave off hermione snivelly or you will find yourself regretting that you were born the messy haired boy hissed dangerously severus smirked so that what all their dirty looks during the previous forty eight hours were about sorry potter but it seems that your his flickering gaze took in the rest of them lingering especially long on peter who had drawn his wand but was still tucked nervously behind remus irresistible charms have at last found someone unaffected by them my relationship his use of the word was deliberate and he was rewarded with four sharp hisses of displeasure with hermione is hardly relevant to you sirius wand point jerked upwards but severus cast a swift protego the jinx dissipated harmlessly on the shield showering the grey stone corridor with sparks as james fired another spell to rebound off severus defenses remus whispered urgently professor dumbledore five pairs of adolescent eyes snapped up to the end of the corridor where the headmaster was striding towards them in a blaze of white beard and turquoise robes wands vanished as quickly as they had appeared and by the time their professor had drawn level with them their exchange had been limited to mutinous looks not fighting i hope dumbledore said briskly an indistinct no sir came from all parties excellent it is such a waste to see some of hogwarts best minds bent on causing one another pain now mr snape your aunt and uncle are waiting i believe yes sir at the sour look on sirius face severus could not restrain his swift almost inaudible barb fancy that black i have a reason other than unadulterated nosiness for coming remus next words wiped out his surge of superiority even as they distracted dumbledore from giving severus more than a stern look sir hermione the same flood of envious possession that james had just grappled with jolted through the slytherin blood choking his veins as he glowered at the gentle boy consciously restraining twitching fingers that wanted to do no more than slam the gryffindor against a wall and order him to keep his paws to himself hadntshe turned lupin away apparently unperturbed and unaware of the seething undercurrents eddying around him the headmaster smiled down at the anxious remus miss granger should be in the great hall at tea i interrupted her lunch and felt she should get something to eat thank you sir they chanted in unison and as dumbledore turned to quietly murmur his password to the gargoyle sirius locked eyes with severus obsidian mirrored there hard light reflected in both pairs of eyes we ll finish this later snivelly severus lip curled how utterly unoriginal sirius black making threats i quaking where i stand he sketched a mocking half bow as the gargoyle moved aside taking refuge in the headmaster averted gaze i await your convenience be sure to bring your gang you ll need them the ugly look that maligned james face promised another fight right here but then severus was being ushered into the dark winding stairwell with the elderly wizard impeccable knack for keeping the peace and the four marauders were left to stare after him furiously before continuing downstairs in their quest for jam scones and the witch who had become indispensable to them 888 lucius his lord dragged the name the s at the end elongating into a hiss that seemed to delight in slithering down the young man spine one agonizing vertebra at a time chills spreading to tingle in all the nerves on his back peaking painfully at elbows and wrists flushing the proud blond with cold his school rivals and underlings would have laughed to see the boy who flagrantly flaunted his influence in their corridors and common room shivering with no more decorum than a ten year old caught with his father racing broom he swallowed his nervousness hoping his voice would be the correct pitch as he moved forward and dropped to his knees my lord over his bowed head voldemort laughed you fear and yet you grow better at concealing it your improvement indicates spine lucius could hear approval in his master voice and though he did not dare feel triumph he did allow himself a spurt of satisfaction the dark wizard favor was not something quickly granted or easily gained and though the son of abraxas knew he was a long way from such accolades at least he was no longer enduring his master severe displeasure the girl has proven as valuable as i had foreseen and she is talented as well your part in her capture has fortunately been kept quiet or at least out of the prophet though voldemort had not phrased a question the silence that fell indicated his expectation of an answer my lord there were no witnesses only the american witch and you were gracious enough to allow us to return to hogwarts in time for walden and i to rejoin our housemates in the great hall when professor slughorn counted us we were precisely where we were expected to be she cannot prove anything and she is a foreigner while my father standing at the ministry is such that no one will believe her if she talks the pale wizard still towering over him smiled thinly at the son veiled contempt for his father if only the younger malfoy knew but there were some things that had to remain secrets even within families so you believe yourself still fully capable of acting as my servant at hogwarts the lord pressed quietly it was a test for the boy one of his youngest and most inexperienced followers who nevertheless held a highly coveted position within the enemy camp cowardice would not serve but neither would false bravado or arrogance no matter what the evidence was teenagers lived in worlds of fluctuating fantasies what was real today would be false tomorrow best friends were made and discarded in a matter of months lucius daring kidnapping from under the nose of albus dumbledore was being kept quiet from the world at large something that anthony zabini himself had a large hand in but at school enough people might believe the truth sheerly because it was sensational enough to appeal to their dramatic view of life and it was the student body of europe finest school of witchcraft and wizardry that the dark lord was interested in plundering not her myriad treasures or knowledgeable professors it would not suit at all if lucius had been rendered impotent as a recruiter and subtle guide with this single act the caution in platinum blond voice betrayed his parallel thought process knowing the cost of lying desperate not to displease again i think so master maybe a few of the girl friends will believe her but not more than that and a hint that you taught me some magic to breach the wards around hogwarts will bring more of our esteemed house to your banner not less voldemort tilted his head red flecked eyes dimming to velvet black as he considered the suggestion rumor and the gossip mill both eagerly expounded upon by the daily prophet were allies more insidious than dementors and farther reaching than even the best placed spies objective truth was irrelevant it was what people believed to be true that affected decisions of fight flight and side that his few death eaters could be stamped out with relative ease was something a terrified population and ineffective ministry hadntrecognized and their campaign of terror aimed to keep it that way he was pleased that the student was already demonstrating a complete grasp of this principle he had despaired in the eight months since giving lucius the mark that he had indeed misjudged the boy potential but his instinct for always coming out on top made voldemort certain that with a few years hard experience under his belt lucius malfoy would make an excellent general that is agreeable be careful that you do not overdo it lucius nodded now in addition to dropping all the right hints in the correct ears for your few remaining months prior to graduation i need you to find another direct connection to the transfer girl 888 how much do we have to take sirius asked eagerly peter in his self appointed role of book reader found the requisite instructions at the bottom of the page just a tablespoon full he said that all james asked not really all that surprising is it remus asked peering into the small pewter cauldron the five of them were hunched around it wasntmuch larger than his mother medium sized mixing bowl and even so it was only half full if you had to take a lot we d have needed a bigger cauldron and more ingredients even so we used a lot of stuff i thought there would be more water evaporates when it boils james hermione reminded him with a smile leaving us with a potion that is almost more paste than liquid this could not be denied at its final stage the potion had cooled to a lighter brown the density giving it the appearance of chocolate fudge sirius tentatively started to reach in with his spoon only to have hermione hand stay his wrist where did that come from sirius blinked shrugged great hall i swiped it during breakfast hermione rolled her eyes and turned to peter does the recipe specify anything in regards to ingestion the boy read the final paragraph and shrugged it says the potion should remain effective as long as it doesntcome into contact with wood the witch released her friend waving at the silver implement clutched in his fingers go for it sirius completed his dip measuring out a careful mouthful and sniffed it cautiously the action reminded hermione so much of a dog circling a bone it was going to eat that she stifled a laugh no wonder the wizard in front of her had become padfoot it certainly doesnt smell like chocolate he said ruefully and taking a deep breath comprised of excitement and nervousness he popped the thick mess into his mouth his eyes widened in surprise and hermione found herself holding her breath praying that it was merely because of the flavor and not some ghastly mistake they d made in the brewing process the last five days had been so packed with frustrations that sometimes the time traveler felt that if she didntscream she would surely go mad with the sound rebounding under her skull james and sirius prickliness about severus the peculiar intensely uncomfortable moment she d shared with klytemnestra father and worst of all their enforced silence as lucius malfoy swaggered through the halls grated on nerves already raw with the enormity of the task she was facing and the fact that she had dragged three others unknowingly into its path if the potion had been botched she was sure she would break down right now gack that stuff tastes awful like like the quidditch locker room mixed with a touch of scorched butter and charred fish sirius gagged as he swallowed the last of it thanks siri for making it easier on the rest of us james muttered dryly but he didntlook revolted merely curious as they waited for the minutes to tick past the book said to allow five minutes for the effects to begin remus hazel eyes were fixed firmly on his watch as he counted seconds then minutes and how do you feel he asked head coming up as his clock ticked past the five minute marker the tallest boy eyes had dropped closed though he stayed quite steady on his feet as he opened them his lips parted but words were not forthcoming uhh a large black dog gamboled from sirius tongue following this incoherent noise growing larger as wisps of transparent smoke formed the fullness of legs coat and shaggy head the appropriate shape and color of the animal but insubstantial like a patronus following the dog came a panther which bounded around three walls of the room before stopping to wait crouched in one corner eyes luminous and predatory even though they were smoke the final creature to erupt from between the tall boy lips was a parrot with brilliant red green and blue plumage it flapped to settle on james shoulder perching proudly and fluffing its head crest showing off its magnificent beauty sirius stared waited until it seemed clear that these three were his choices and swallowed hard a bird a dog and a wildcat james voiced curiously when it became obvious that sirius wasntgoing to speak yet interesting choices i wonder why each animal says something different about the wizard or witch who conjures it hermione recited from memory so these are all different aspects of my personality sirius finally managed to find his tongue again probably she answered makes sense remus added and with an honesty hermione never would have used on sirius black he continued the dog because you are friendly loving and playful and indeed the great beast had run circles around all of them planting barely felt paws on shoulders and jumping excitedly when peter had fished out a marble from a pocket and rolled it across the room for him the panther because you are slick graceful and enjoy hunting sirius darted a glance at hermione looking significantly less pleased with his friend last comment hermione schooled her face to neutrality it was true both the way that sirius deliberately pursued girls and his harassment of severus bore the mark of one stalking seeking a prize and the parrot a bird probably because you have lofty ideals and this one because you are so concerned with how you look james hermione and peter burst into laughter with this final deft comment and sirius sour expression if we re all quite finished skewering my psyche why dontwe let james go next he snapped irritably oh leave off siri we love you because you can be a vain prat sometimes james said with a wide grin we wouldntchange you for the world i sure my options will tell everyone some rather unflattering things about me too with much less trepidation james measured the same careful spoonful for himself and shoved it in his mouth nose wrinkling in disgust as his tastebuds came in contact with the paste for the first time five minutes later the first animal to bounce into the room was another dog although this one was slightly smaller a golden retriever with ears and paws that were slightly too large making the dog probably only three quarters grown which brought hermione up short was it possible to undergo growth as an animagus if one became a caterpillar for instance would one wrap oneself in a cocoon and become a butterfly the long legged prancing stag that came second brought tears to hermione eyes and wiped out questions about insects as memories of harry desperately casting this image of his father forth to save her life streamed in front of her eyes and she swiftly rubbed her face to remove the tell tale water it lacked the silvery glow of her best friend patronus but the large liquid eye it turned on her nearly brought her to her knees with remembrances and she gripped the table beside her to keep herself upright grateful that the boys were all too keen on admiring the beautiful creature to notice her strange reaction james last incarnation was a lion which shook its large mane and gave the panther a disapproving look before padding to the wizard with glasses sitting on his haunches and remaining almost as tall as the young man blimey he whispered reaching out slowly to touch the coarse mane peter remus asked briskly apparently uninterested in analyzing james as he had done sirius the pudgy third year approached the cauldron with only a little trepidation having seen the potion work exactly as promised twice now like his friends he grimaced at the taste and hurried to clear his mouth going still as they had eyes half closed as remus remained glued to his watch peter first animal was a large badger white stripe running down its nose and back hufflepuff symbol james muttered and hermione frowned at him peter insecurities about being the smallest and undeniably least talented student included in the marauders were deep seated and growing his unlikely sorting into gryffindor house was something that his peers in slytherin had never ceased to use against him and it was unkind of james to bring forth the question that had become a taunt no matter that he had not meant it as such the creature ambling on the heels of the badger was a brown bear hermione amber eyes went round in surprise and she could see her shock reflected in james and sirius lifted eyebrows only remus looked unperturbed and as the slender gentle boy was the one amongst them who became a mindless monster once a month hermione could understand why looks and even character didntfool the werewolf he had learned the hard way that what was hidden in the hearts of men was always unknown to those outside she found herself strangling sudden regret and a sense of sorrow as to the path peter would carve in history he had traits of the fiercely loyal badger of the large but mostly peaceable omnivorous bear but it would be his final form that indicated his road the rat scurried out last curious and eager sniffing for food and running over the paws of the lion which shook it away easily peter shook his head in disappointment at the unimpressive creature well i definitely wontbe taking that form as a unit all four boys turned to her expectantly hermione hesitated she wasntentirely sure she wanted to be an animagus some of the effects were life altering for her physiology and history had written of only four marauders but it wouldnthurt to know her potential perhaps twenty years from now they had discovered a cure to the nastier downsides of using this magic maybe she could complete the process in her own time stepping forward she dipped the last spoon in scraping out the bottom and shoved the disappetizing mass into her mouth before she could convince herself otherwise from the amused crinkling on the faces staring at her she knew her features were telling them her dislike of the flavor but sirius had been correct there was something about the texture that was distinctly reminiscent of old gym socks down to the cottony dryness she felt as the last of the paste went down her throat in a glob even as the weight of the ball settled in her stomach a strange feeling of lightheadedness filled her as if her brain had detached from her body and was reaching upwards her eyelids had fallen as her mind ascended swamped in white fogged by mist hiding shadows that shifted and moved most of them fading even as she stretched forth mental fingers to find them pressure began to build in the physical body she had left behind like a kettle whistling as the water boiled it was uncomfortable pulling her back from this place she had yet to explore she had to let it out her mouth opened and out floated an otter the twin to the patronus she had learned to conjure in this very room last year with harry the sea animal flipped over on its brown smoky back in mid air and lazily began to swim curious intelligent face watching her closely as it inscribed circles around her person the pressure built faintly once more peaked and she felt it subside as she breathed more smoke feeling vaguely like a chimney as a horse formed before her eyes trotting silently around the room its hooves like the paws of sirius dog and the claws of james lion making no noise against the granite for a final time like a dam releasing its last flood of water her throat tightened in preparation to loose her last option an enormous bird of red and orange looking more like a streak of flame than a live creature winged from her lips to soar around the room curved beak open as it dipped around them weaving through the boys looking for all the world like it was singing a phoenix sirius voice brought her firmly back into her own body severing her connection with the realm the potion had delivered her to it cantbe she heard herself objecting mind automatically spitting out the information it had digested long ago humans cannot become animals that possess an innate amount of significant magic we read the book mione james replied his eyes never leaving the brilliant bird that was now soaring over them in circles but there nothing else that could possibly be there are no non magical birds of that size and color his eyes met hers dark brown shining with excitement hermione tipped her head back lifting her chin to observe the circling creature feeling a pull on her body a desire so tangible as to become a need the hunger to fly to stretch her wings and her voice together the otter and the horse were beautiful but they did not inspire such raw wanting as if she were being denied life by holding to this crude earth bound form her first thought went to the echo ordinarily witches and wizards could not take magical form but the bird flashing over them put the lie to that assertion but she was far from ordinary she was the key to the magic of life her true talent lying not in the wand she wielded with deft precision but in her harp and her voice and phoenixes alone of all land dwelling animals normal and magical were gifted with the power of song 888 hermione glanced surreptitiously at professor torrenwright who was currently circling timothy wilkes and michael avery patiently demonstrating the proper wand movement for the counter to petrificus totalus severus stood at the desk in front of them his mice properly petrified and revived several times he had carefully set his books in a wall around his desk and was watching them run to and fro expression distant feeling her gaze the boy turned black eyes shining with something that would have been a smile if it had graced his mouth as it was the look of wholly innocent secretive delight caused an ache to bloom somewhere in the young gryffindor heart she could not imagine the man he would become wearing such an expression banishing the melancholy before it could move to claim her she pointed her wand at a scrap of parchment on her desk and whispered a charm it twitched as if taking on a life of its own and then fluttered upwards madly beating little paper wings lifting from her desk it floated through her peers to his scarred wooden table where he unfolded it stay after he jerked around again eyebrows already prepared to rise in silent query their ability to communicate without words well developed by the presence of her four man guard her thick curls blocked her eyes as she swished her wand over remus lupin mice petrifying them for him he ignored the twist in his chest that now occurred several times daily when observing her with the gryffindor boys her friendship with them so open so easily established and maintained the strength of his longing for another night of practice was a double desire for both the music he craved and the ability to converse with her without fearing her classmates and his own as he turned away he caught sirius black suspicious hate filled gaze locked on him i must have been staring severus thought and as a blush tore up to his face for what he had likely betrayed he ruthlessly suppressed it swapping the revealing scarlet for a sardonic smile a quick glance at the clock told him to wait another five minutes he returned his attention to his white mice now wrestling with one another mr snape if you would be so kind as to show me your work the deep voice of their defense professor pulled him from his thoughts and severus murmured petrificus totalus freezing the hapless creatures together in their competition he performed the counter curse flawlessly as expected and received an approving nod from his teacher before the barrel chested wizard moved on to the next row severus sighed if only he could earn one such nod from professor mcgonagall class dismissed the words he had been waiting for fell on his ears and he began to slowly methodically pack up his bag grateful that the pen he had created for the rodents involved most of the books in his sack volumes that he could now replace very very slowly as his classmates rushed out around him eager to be finished with the day i ll stay with you sirius murmured in a low voice when hermione indicated that she intended to ask their professor a question you dontneed to she replied quietly it just a quick question then i ll be along sirius didntso much as look towards the door that james remus and peter were all headed for sniv he stopped as she glared at him swallowed bitterly and corrected himself snape is still here i ll wait the witch glared at him fury bubbling up in her why was it that all the boys she had decided to be friends with now and in the future felt as if they owned her the memory of ron weasley senseless jealousy over viktor krum jumped to mind and she gritted her teeth in remembered and present anger in case you ve forgotten sirius black i can handle myself and severus presence here doesntconcern you so what if i found a friend in slytherin sirius glanced over her head at the sallow boy who was deliberately keeping his back to the miniature intra house storm brewing in the back of the room he doesntjust want to be friends hermione sirius told her firmly the look in his nemesis eyes earlier had disturbed the handsome boy greatly it was one thing for hermione to be forgiving and kind to the young man who had always been an outsider it was a female weakness that he had observed in other girls he knew a compulsion to help the underdog but the look on the sallow face had been so similar to the one remus had worn a scant couple of months ago hope hunger and caring merging on the thin despised features he found himself stumbling backwards hermione having pushed him away from her in fury what he wants or doesntwant is no business of yours i ll see you in the common room hermione but she had turned her back on him firmly and marched right past where severus waited making up a spurious question to put to her professor until she was certain that sirius had reluctantly retired from the room unwilling to engage in open disagreement in front of the enemy a quick answer later and while torrenwright leisurely set his classroom back in order she returned to where severus waited his bag now completely ready what happened he asked her tensely all too cognizant of the fight she d been having with black knowing that it shouldntdelight him and unable to quench his pleasure hermione teeth found the bottom of her lip worrying the tender flesh as she suddenly wondered how to phrase her peculiar suspicions i think your uncle may try to kill or capture me was out of the question and there was no name to give to the distinctly unsettled feeling he had left her with she knew that one day she would stand with him on a battlefield both of them twisting their gift of music to attack and defend but there had been no outward evidence of that in hogwarts no hint of the future his glance had convinced her existed it took her no more than a few seconds to shake her head dispelling the hopes of telling him now and praying he had answers klytemnestra was grieving the loss of her twin gone only four days for all that it was kassandra own fault and hermione could not bring herself to add to the family burden it would likely be some time before she encountered the zabini family patriarch again she could resolve that problem later you know sirius she answered his question blithely switching grooves of thought thinks any girl that passes through his orbit belongs to him do you have time to practice tonight her brown eyes glittered like a child with new toy apprehensions banished for the excitement of the moment as she thought ahead to bringing her harp out into the snow and playing it for the first time like a mirror eagerness bounced back towards her from his black gaze and a boy grin creased his face shaving off the premature years and making him look fourteen for the first time since she d met him your wish is quite literally my command what time 7 30 888 the four figures that met together in the dark near the tall oak traded probing solemn looks as if testing the mettle and determination of one another hermione broke the stand still first the headmaster has adjusted the wards to allow us to play without being heard by the rest of the castle we can experiment without worrying that everyone is going to be hearing us three heads nodded briefly and hermione felt compelled to continue be that as it may as far as i know only i have to do this she forgave herself that small lie even as she uttered it she knew what path severus would choose if any of you would rather not you heard professor dumbledore klytemnestra said quietly but her black eyes glittered with a hot forbidding light he can do nothing no matter how much he believes us i dontknow how malfoy made it back in time to escape suspicion but this is the only way to help kassandra and she gave hermione a brief spare smile i have spent my life hearing of you you have the oath of my blood it is not a word given lightly and one that shall never be withdrawn i not letting you come down here with two untrustworthy slytherins on your own lily said before her friend eyes could lock on her but the cheeky smile she bestowed on the victims of her fun soothed ruffled feathers before they could truly rise what would sirius black say she added in mock horror three snorts followed this ludicrous question and when she turned her eyes to him severus obsidian depths spoke eloquently and firmly erasing a need for vocalization hermione bowed her head in acceptance she d had to give them the option one more time the dryad had told them that their road would not be an easy one but hermione alone had stood in front of the death eaters first hand and knew that it was not a theatrical or grandiose statement decision cemented furtive smiles turned four mouths as they settled down to unpack their instruments lily flute flashed in a line of silver in contrast to severus ebony black clarinet the warm wood of klytemnestra viola complimenting the lighter hue of hermione harp as the gryffindor witch enlarged and transfigured it from a pretty trinket to a curved and polished work of exquisite craftsmanship her spare cloak spread under it to protect it from the snow lily brought the flute up mouth pursed and ready to blow severus lips were already fastened on his mouthpiece tongue wetting the reed klytemnestra right hand drew her bow as the viola found its well worn place tucked under her chin hermione lifted her hands faintly touching the goat gut strings savoring their feeling even under fingers that were now largely without their protective calluses silence surged through them almost as loud and potent as anything they might play and all four shivered as they waited he said he would be waiting klytemnestra murmured as the quiet extended seeming loaded and unnatural the dryad markedly absent hermione reached for the connection that she had awakened less than a week ago had so much transpired in so little time seeking guidance fighting the sudden fear of abandonment on this treacherous road that they had chosen to walk he had not appeared for the headmaster but that had not surprised her the elderly wizard was an unknown factor and the unfamiliar always carried with it the potential to be threatening but last time he had revealed himself before all those assembled without a trace of hesitation so where was their teacher now almost immediately in answer though without consulting her brain her fingers began to slowly pluck the harp strings single droplets of sound rippling from her like a gentle fall of summer rain striking the surface of a lake as both hands engaged notes coming faster she was aware of the others picking up her tempo and following her lead hermione directed the efforts of her skillful hands towards the tree in front of them hearing severus clarinet almost instantly shift with her intent the woodwind calling entreatingly inviting the tree spirit to emerge and join the dance they were rewarded in their efforts when the vast expanse of tree bark began to part and the faun cloven goat hooves stepped forth the branches forming his hair arching like antlers as the tree disgorged him and sealed itself once more well done daughters and son he said warmly and all four relaxed at the sound of his deep rough voice as if passing a test they had only just realized they were taking i am delighted to see that you have all returned and summoned me by virtue of request not demand may i assume that you are honoring your heritage and your world by taking up the burden you have been asked to bear feeling as if her feet were roots themselves as the pulse of the earth quickened beneath her boots the world itself propelled hermione words and her reply contained such inexorable power that severus felt the hair on the back of his neck rise as the witch who had begun haunting his dreams dipped her head with the grace and command of a queen we have 888 heal her the dryad commanded gesturing to a young tree the four peered at the sapling twice severus height oozing thick sap like heavy tears where a slender branch dangled by a few splinters struck by the late march lightning storm the previous night hermione winced as she laid a hand on the tree her connection to earth had grown with six weeks of constant practice and touching the smooth bark of the aspen now brought pain reverberating up her arm feeling like her own limb was broken she heard the viola long notes begin behind her and lily gentle whistling flute sounding almost like the wind but severus was closest and he placed the bell of his clarinet against the tree trunk muffling his music as if he were blowing it into their unusual patient hermione did not return to her harp but brought her other hand up and brushed her fingers over the split singing in a low monotone urging the shards to re knit it was one of the first practical tests they had been given they had melted and re formed snow helped call forth the early spring flowers and coax seeds to push through the earth but that was all part of the natural order that occurred anyway year after year it had not proven taxing to speed the process slightly as they learned the necessary control for the music they were creating but the art of healing plants had long been forgotten and the quartet found themselves tiring even as they strengthened the aspen listless branch gradually lifting as wood sealed itself sap hungrily filling gaps eager to be the necessary adhesive the power expenditure was enormous and hermione heard first lily fall silent drained then klytemnestra and finally the clarinet next to her severus dropping to his knees sweat running down his long nose to drip into the soft spring ground she had to finish she was barely aware of her own voice faltering then failing the branch not quite sealed and she ducked her head embarrassed as she swayed and allowed herself to fold into sitting position it marked the first time that they were unable to do all that the dryad had asked of them contrary to their disappointment the tree spirit smiled and loosed a throbbing note that completed the job in the space of one breath as the four adolescents looked up in amazement to see the sapling waving at them and hermione glimpsed for an instant the lithe form of a young girl perhaps eight ish dancing in the healed tree her message of gratitude quite clear she has a faun the gryffindor witch asked rising no she has a nymph my shape belongs exclusively to oak he favored hermione with a rare look of surprise every one of us has a spirit it is how you as a human are capable of feeling us of connecting to us i am however pleased that you could see her spirits cannot emerge until their hosts are mature which means you were looking into the aspen that is an improvement he turned to the rest of them you did well it is no small thing to ask the reparation and removal of pain can you feel it yet the relationship between you and the earth both lily and klytemnestra shook their heads regretfully hermione had discovered that the welcoming she had received from this patch of ground had not been as automatic for the rest of them though their mentor seemed unconcerned he assured them that it was natural and that it would come with effort but tonight severus nodded just for a moment right before i stopped i felt he paused groping for the right language to describe something that could not be found in books i felt stronger just enough to play my last few notes like someone had pushed power through my feet the dryad bark beard twitched and hermione knew he approved excellent son of earth i believe you are her major as i suspected you might be 888 what is a major sir severus question tumbled from his lips before they had even finished sitting down the question eating at him for the past two days finally holding the promise of being answered as green grass rippled underneath them providing them with dry soft places to rest in response to hermione hummed request the dryad eyes twinkled at the boy eagerness and hermione was struck by some of the similarities between their tree spirit guide and their human headmaster for all their physical differences they exuded the same boundless energy genuine joy in teaching and the annoying certainty that they already knew far more than you ever would the old world of magic was governed by strict hierarchies those that were purely social faded with the civilization they structured but some of them are woven into the fabric of magic itself and thus can neither recede into time nor be ignored however irregular they might prove for modern convention hermione smothered a grin the faun would probably always carry that dubious note in his voice when he spoke of the world that his four charges had introduced him to a world without kings where all the magical races were strictly separated except for business transactions and where secrecy from muggles had become ironclad law hermione had to admit that while she approved of the first the last two were regrettable marks of the centuries yawning between the previous one and their current crisis learning how to use the echo of creation is no different i told you weeks ago that two three and four are stronger numbers than one and so it has always been the one of old surrounded him or herself with hundreds of extremely capable musicians but even so there was usually a group of a few a half dozen at the most who were the most talented of these gifted players and the best scholars of music and who played directly with the one the most powerful of these was the major the rest were termed minors and they were the musicians who tapped deep into the power of the echo surpassing the surface abilities and effects of their fellows his wooden face twisted bark rippling in displeased lines they were those who accomplished the greatest amount of good and eventually evil if severus is the major does that make lily and i the minors klytemnestra asked the dryad nodded it does like planets circling a star you orbit at close range but the major is more like a smaller binary sun he is her partner his power overshadowed by hers but nevertheless greater than yours and this makes him your secondary focal point daughter of men and daughter of heaven you complete their system you form their buttresses and shoring tied to the milder seasons of spring and autumn the softer elements of water and earth treading worlds between the extremes of absolute darkness and radiant light in practical application how does this take effect hermione queried poetry was all very well but thus far they had worked together any power rift between the individuals largely submerged the dryad face grew solemn all traces of humor gone wizards and witches may have forgotten or scorned such magic but not all of the magical and even the non magical world has think of how you healed the tree instinctively the music knows your places as the node you actually touched her an intimacy you knew you had your major used his instrument as a median for contact not as close as you but not nearly so far away as the minors who remained at a distance you will find as we practice that sometimes your minors and even your major do not play to effect the world at large but to give you the strength to do so right now you are learning the fundamentals of your power and the illusion of equality is easy to maintain but when you move to consolidate the alliances of the other races of earth you will understand the functions you perform none of you less vital than the others but all of you performing different tasks 888 it is good of you to care so deeply for your surroundings daughter of creation the dryad crackling voice interrupted hermione check of the aspen as she hummed her pitch perfect a listening to the tweaking of klytemnestra viola as the slytherin tuned her instrument the young woman had made it habit to ensure that the skinny limb now pushing out tiny leaves showed no sign of snapping it did not as it had not in the ten days since they had healed it a rare attribute in one so powerful she has taught us a valuable lesson sir hermione replied carefully and it takes no time to look be that as it may you will find that not many take that small amount of time hermione turned inspection complete as klytemnestra brought her bow across taut strings with an expression of satisfaction that brought a smile to hermione face in turn how often had she longed for this sound the low murmur of piping whistling and vibrating that signified an orchestra preparation to begin for years she had feared she might never find it in her adopted world and the illegality of it did not impinge on the one time rule quoting gryffindor happiness as it filled her ears you have mentioned twice that we must seek the help of the other species of magic holders she started slowly on a question that had been nibbling at the edges of her brain for the past two months who are they and how do we approach them before you can speak with any of them you must immerse yourselves fully in the music and understand its potentials and properties it is not so much their help that you require as their blessing and their promises of magical fealty oaths you can only expect if they trust both you and your grasp on the power they will grant you power i told you once that it is better to ask than to demand young one all created things are tied to the echo sentient beings who used music in ages past more so than most their willing consecration of your efforts is necessary for you to face the other for their unique relationships with the echo will be added to yours but they are wary of humanity your race has not treated the rest of the inhabitants of this world particularly well since you wrested control from the centaurs how long must we wait hermione asked hesitantly mastery in music took a lifetime to achieve and she was fairly certain that she did not have the decades required in less than twenty years she would run into herself on these very grounds and that had not happened the branched head cocked slightly casting long shadows from the sun last light in the early spring evening it is not a question of time but of learning towards these races you must display the utmost respect in how you approach them where and when when you are certain you know it will be time but like any teacher i can only show you so much lead you so far look to the world you were born in daughter of creation and you will find that not all of mankind has forgone the ancient traditions as wizards have wrapped though they are in superfluous ritual you can discover what you seek and you will better understand why you searched for it he had refused to say more directing them instead to practice and the mood that night was reflective as the four strode across the lawns in darkness dropping in through the entrance next to slytherin common room as had become their custom the gryffindor girls ducked a few yards to the right and into the moving fireplace that allowed them a passage back to their tower dormitory as the slytherins re joined their fellows hermione knew with surety that this narrow tunnel had never been included on the marauder map and she wondered if it was luck they would never find it or her own deliberate secrecy you think he means the muggle world lily ventured voice reverberating oddly off the low ceiling as she shuffled behind hermione single file in the narrow passage he must he said the world i was born in hermione frowned she had never heard of cross disciplining between the magical and non magical human worlds even muggle studies wasntfor such things but rather for pure or half blooded wizards intrigued by a society foreign to them a study of culture not of magic and considering hogwarts is miles from any muggles where are we going to start looking tomorrow in the early history part of the muggle studies section of the library 8888888888 a n thank you all for reading feedback is appreciated shogi yay thank you for commenting on zabini and hermione interaction i will confess that in the current plan of things he does not have a happy ending how can he i like having a pegasus patronus for dumbledore my beta remarked that she thinks it a phoenix in canon and i think she right but i using the phoenix for hermione so i didntwant to repeat hermione and harry are going to have an interesting time back in the future whenever she manages to return and remus and snape have a curious relationship over time right now it very antagonistic thanks once again for a superb review that i truly enjoyed elisandra1 daring2dream kittykat monnbeam linnorria gray eyed athena iloveseverussnape wind of freedom and the queen of confusion thank you all so very much for reading a new chapter is up sooner than the last and i pray that it doesntdisappoint hopefully i can have chapter twenty one coming out at some time in the near future eanne thank you that a huge compliment this story is rather complicated isntit i glad you re enjoying it sarah116 severus and hermione are getting there this chapter has the forging of their individual connection which will definitely be leading into some interesting territory later on missevilprincess ah the zabini family we ll have to see wontwe and yes hermione will both be learning by trial and error and with the dryad for some reason he doesntwant to show himself to dumbledore xaxstoryxaboutxlovex severus and hermione ll be doing a lot more than kissing eventually but keep in mind that she is still three years his senior and he has to get up the courage to make some kind of move gratified that you like dumbledore he an interesting piece of work no maddie50 magic my dear voldemort didntwant to endanger his servant at hogwarts and with all of the confusion there was enough time for the job to be completed and for lucius to make it back oh thank you dumbledore is a difficult character for me to get right especially after the publication of dh i think the man got what he deserved when snape killed him personally but taking into account that he has been at war or preparing for war for much of his life he has made some very difficult decisions and i glad you liked the meeting between mr zabini and hermione he wontbe back for a few chapters but they ll be seeing each other again dogmoon183 thank you thank you for coming back and reading this fic is working its way towards being quite long but i hope to be updating more regularly than i have in the past t hehe i liked lily rant in some ways it makes a lot of sense and sort of ties in to dumbledore wondering of whether they sort too young i am exceptionally glad you ve stuck with me thanks for reviewing princesstilly woot this fic is much nicer to dumbledore than paradise lost i ve given him a rough ride and little mercy in that piece but i like writing a kinder less pressured dumbledore as well hermione and snape parting will be interesting and needless to say difficult and as for whether hermione navigated path between the marauders and snape will be successful we ll see thank you so much for a wonderful detailed review estriel more severus hermione is definitely on the horizon and i hope you enjoyed their development in this chapter as well alkrodien this chapter had some action and the next should as well thanks for reading disclaimer the works of jkr are in no way mine nor do i have any illusions that they are i am exceedingly grateful that she allows us to play in her universe a n a big thanks goes to my beta trinka who is wonderfully supportive of this work in addition to correcting it occasionally creative grammar a million thank yous to everyone who has read and reviewed this story the support means the world to me research and inquiries severus and i drafted up a list klytemnestra said quietly as they grabbed chairs towards the back of the library hidden both from madam pince vulture like stare and the entrance by the large bookshelves lily gaze kept drifting to the window and across the lake to their practice spot hermione kicked her softly we re inside today and the slytherin half has done us the honor of a little research so we have to pay attention she teased you re as bad as james with his broomstick severus face darkened perceptibly at the mention of his rival but lily just rolled her eyes and politely returned her attention to the half italian witch seated across the table he said the world you were born in so we made a list of ancient magical sites castles and manors in britain i was also thinking about your talents so i have a compendium of halls where it played the locales of some of the societies that used to exist hermione and lily swapped startled guilty looks klytemnestra ever attuned to the undercurrents of a situation stopped talking at once what is it i i a muggle born hermione admitted quietly and was surprised by her wash of shame not for her heritage but for keeping it a secret that had led them to the wrong conclusion and hours of wasted effort we think he meant that world severus blinked and his eyes flashed to lily who tilted her chin in defiant acknowledgement but his cousin shook her head raven hair catching the evening light in a ripple of iridescence that not possible hermione brow creased i assure you it is my parents have no magical abilities whatsoever and neither do my grandparents or anyone else in my family klytemnestra was continuing to swing her head back and forth your parents might not and their parents might not but you are not a true muggle born you cannot be why the node is bound by blood the slytherin girl answered seriously the station has passed wandering throughout europe in the past fifteen hundred years by virtue of merlin bloodline she caught the gryffindor shocked brown eyes as all the dots connected to be who you are you must be related to merlin james potter growled a curse under his breath one of the four had anchored a silencing charm to the table in front of them making all sounds within a five foot radius impossible to make out washing through their ears like the murmur of far away voices it was an extremely deceptive spell most people would never bother to notice that with their proximity they should be able to hear actual words if they were listening hard enough all four marauders were stacked on the other side of the bookcase straining frantically and getting nothing why is she here with him to begin with sirius muttered angrily hermione relationship with the two slytherins had noticeably thawed over the past two months and it wasntonly her good friends who had seen it in the hogwarts gossip mill it didntrate top billing but remained a steady third and fourth place topic of curiosity the graceful beautiful and pure blooded zabini twins and their sallow faced knowledgeable cousin had always been an odd trio albeit one easily explained by the ties of family but the disappearance of one sister followed by the immediate closeness of this incredibly unlikely quad was hardly inconspicuous and speculation ran from the absurd to the disturbingly believable one of the girls in hermione dormitory had found herself at the business end of sirius wand just the night before for voicing what increasing numbers of students were wondering had the fourteen year old widely hated slytherin found himself a girlfriend trina had almost swallowed the slick piece of wood it had snapped into her face so fast but even threats couldntsolve sirius real problem for hermione best friends could not claim to know the answer for certain they siri evans never struck me as the type to be overly fond of snivelly before either could it be for class remus offered hopefully there was no denying that the four looked set to learn books haphazardly stacked on the table quills half filled parchment and partially empty ink bottles next to each elbow lily snape and hermione are all really good at potions but the other girl is an upper year slytherin fifth i think very rich family sirius said dismissively the one whose twin hasntbeen seen in weeks peter supplied quietly so no i would say studying is pretty much out of the question james snapped a fifth year with a bunch of third years and that doesntaccount for all the times we ve seen them whispering together either but they are shh four pairs of eyes peered between strategically placed books as they watched hermione go rigid with surprise recently tanned features whitening as lily stared at her like she d sprouted horns and snape dark eyes widened as he looked to his fellow house member the next word coming from the transfer in witch lips needed no sound to translate what unfortunately klytemnestra zabini back was to them and their entire view consisted of her slender back and the waterfall of pitch black hair tumbling over it damnable slytherins james and sirius hissed in unison and both drew their wands as they moved towards the end of bookcase clearly planning to reveal themselves when remus surprisingly strong fingers clamped around both sets of wrists james sirius he hissed stop he jerked his head at their thin faced enemy who was now only listening to his cousin animated explanation with half an ear black eyes scanning sharply remus muttered a spell to silence their space as well tying it to cheering charms an experiment in laughter on the shelf above them we still owe the bastard for a couple months back james snarled in the library remus allowed his voice to rise protected now by their cover in full view of hermione siri please if you attack him here not only will you both have detentions for fighting but we ll have to deal with the girls wrath he always with her sirius countered angrily wrenching himself away from his friend but remus was relieved to see the wand get thrust furiously back into the other gryffindor deep pocket when she not doing homework or arithmantic equations for our project even with charms none of them spoke freely of their efforts outside of their dormitory or the room of requirement they ve always got their heads together what is she doing with him remus took a deep breath and let it out again shaking his head to have hermione turn him away on valentine day and then almost instantly be seen all over the castle with the surly boy had struck a deep blow and though he had not witnessed anything in her demeanor that indicated anything closer than friendship between them he had seen the same thing that sirius and indeed half the school had noticed whatever the witch feelings severus snape had fallen hard and fast for their bright friend and the thought of him touching her made the werewolf skin crawl we follow him in a couple of days it spring so he bound to come creeping out of his dungeon lair for a walk on the grounds every once and a while james was muttering and their heads inclined together as their voices dropped again an ambush near the lake is much less remarkable than one inside we ll get some answers then and tell him to stop acting like a bitch puppy and quit stalking her remus knew that he should put in a word against it knew that he should prevent them from attacking the slytherin simply because snape had made a friend they didntapprove of knew that they didntown hermione and had no right to dictate how she spent her time but a last glance through the bookcase revealed an unheard comment from the slytherin mischief dancing in his eyes to be greeted with muted but obviously uproarious laughter from both gryffindor girls and hermione sun darkened fingers closed over snape pale ones in appreciation and remus couldntbring himself to speak sunlight fell in stripes through the tree trunks alternating shadow and brilliant green in rigidly held structures until they fractured into a pattern cut by the leaves overhead hermione gazed blindly at the fragile beauty of growth of the purple night flowers that would only live until dawn of their white day time cousins that were wilting even now she could feel the movement of the earth beneath her feet the sluggish tides of underground water the seeping drops that had been this morning dew now trickling from particle to particle under her shoes to feed the roots of grass trees and herbs a faint movement in the trees twenty yards west neither seen nor heard but felt halted her and she stood silently barely breathing as a brand new fawn tottered uncertainly over a deer trail and into view its mother guiding it proud and alert soft brown eyes ever watchful the young witch waited for them to pass before resuming her journey wondering briefly how she had ever stumbled through her existence without this knowledge lacking the constant reassurance of life in the ground and the connection of such life she stopped before her oak and hesitated it was strange somehow to stand here alone completely unaided the faint wish that she had brought severus rose in her like a question mark he belonged here with her hearing whatever answers their teacher could offer to her questions she shook away the peculiar feeling and instead focused her thoughts streamlining her questions hermione hoped the dryad would give her the answers she needed at the same time dreading the reasons that had prevented him from releasing this critical piece of information to begin with but before she could build up her nerve to call forth their guide with her voice the trunk opened and out he glided giving her a long stare i felt your coming the instant you set foot on the lawns but you come without the others without even your major you are troubled daughter hermione nodded tightly i am what has bothered you so merlin she saw his expression cloud very briefly but it was all the confirmation she needed it true then i am related to him yes i wish i would have had you wait to learn it is irrelevant for now hermione mouth twisted into a cynical smile i ll assume that why you didnttell me a tilt of the tree branched head he was the most powerful wizard ever to grace britain the man who originally bound the echo how is this irrelevant you are not he the dryad responded gently you who worship learning and intelligence above all else i knew what it would mean to you to know that your blood bears the same magic as the best of your species such knowledge is a powerful veil over your vision possibly making you too proud or conversely trapping you in his shadow and therefore never becoming proud enough but your accomplishments must be your own you spoke already of his supreme achievement but your aims are not what his were your desires precisely the opposite he sought only to restrain the echo and its power you are here to use it to tame it what use right now is knowing or not knowing blood is blood you must choose what to do with the amount that runs in your veins without depending on the legacy of a wizard who has been dead for fifteen hundred years but when you spoke of the world that i come from hermione started hesitantly it is true that you like all of your kind like all living creatures on earth stand at the end of a long tradition the result of the rise and fall of empires magic and customs what do you know of the world of merlin where would your journey begin if you start with him you said it at our first meeting the realm of your ancestor belongs to legend and to myth the world you grew up in hold the answers to these questions like the bloodline that brought you the echo the men who no longer practice magic have unwittingly kept some of its most powerful traditions and the many aspects of the world you know now are all at your disposal neither static nor lost but growing and evolving they are your gateway to the others those who have hidden from or separated from men after you have opened the gate after and not before then there is space for merlin and merlin blood then we are to look to the muggle world it was not a question but the wild bark eyebrow simply rose quietly that daughter is for you to determine as is the method of your search the craggy face softened an impression created by the eyes alone and he added i am sorry for not informing you directly but my reasoning was sound and i hope you see that it was hermione turn to dip her head i do part of me wishes you had but perhaps it does not matter now you are correct he can have little bearing on our current problems until i can learn more of the man and less of the myth she smiled this time with real pleasure and finished and i think he would probably be quite proud of a descendent who can figure this out for herself at least it not raining walden macnair muttered as wind whipped through the quidditch stands alternating with the harsh rays of the sun to coat them all in a layer of icy perspiration tell me again lucius why exactly do we care about the match between ravenclaw and gryffindor because i am running out of time the blond muttered shaking back the shining locks falling over his shoulders i need a way in i couldntcare less about the game watch evans and granger i need an ally walden debated mentioning that there were two possibilities much closer to home sitting just two rows ahead of them in fact but held his tongue the last time he had voiced the thought that surely a mere fourteen year old had to be open to a particularly persuasive argument lucius had spun on him furiously pointing at snape and hissing that boy cannot be bought you know how hard i have tried so he trained his omnioculars on the two girls ensconced on the gryffindor benches surrounded by three of the four boys who tagged granger in particular everywhere he frowned they were remarkably unremarkable sitting and giggling like a pair of normal girls on an early spring morning he would never believe his best friend stories of extraordinary power had he not witnessed it first hand his gut frosted and he shoved that line of thought out of his head that winter night remained in his nightmares only recently beginning to recede from his waking mind the presence of a deep magic that he could neither understand nor control haunted him the expectation that he would shortly join the death eaters was all that kept him from abandoning lucius schemes given his way he would never again risk touching the eerie power that had surged in the forest there walden look at evans what do you think i doing he groused what her center of focus lucius asked in a clipped tone completely ignoring his friend caustic displeasure walden tore his gaze from granger now deep in conversation with lupin and utterly ignoring the field over her head and instead trained his eyes on evans unlike her dorm mate the red head eyes were fixed unblinkingly upward her body taut and half risen from her seat lips drawn back in excitement walden swung his head to follow her line of sight her intensity compelling his movement his eyes settled on a beater just as the gryffindor player struck a spectacular blow thick club blurring as it cracked on a bludger sending their opposite number spinning when the ball connected with his broom the quaffle flying into james potter outstretched hands what his name came lucius breathless whisper walden shrugged and leaned over a row to address calvin nott captain of slytherin team who the gryffindor aiming to break bones he muttered casually nott face twisted same bloke that landed don parkinson in the hospital after our match walt winters walt winters walden reported sharply as he sat up lucius smirked his grey eyes reflecting the sneer on his face anxiety vanished as the nimble mind hastily constructed a plan if the rumors are correct evans is dating him i cantbelieve i never thought of him before omnioculars once more followed the swooping broomsticks as the slytherin tracked his prey and the aristocrat added almost as a side note find out his class schedule i think the next step is practicing mass transfiguration and displacement hermione told them kneeling on sirius bed with three books and a complex pattern of parchment laid out in front of her remus was peering over her shoulder this looks awfully complicated he said nervously james don t hair still dripping wet from his shower after gryffindor final hard fought victory james hastily sat back the water threatening hermione notes dripping instead on his best friend pillow remus is right i cantmake heads nor tails of this sirius admitted poring over a page of equations i can see that the mass here is equal and the mass at the end is equal but where does it go in this stage he asked tapping the center of the sheet that why we have to practice hermione answered there an emerging theory in arithmancy her hand flipped towards a thick but glossy professional journal that looked very much out of place amongst the heavy dust laden books about nil space that is to say space that doesntexist in any way we can measure it but must be present because it contains certain physical objects it rather like memory memory access is a function of the human brain but memories may not actually be stored there they might be kept somewhere else the room of requirement magic may work using nil space certainly all expansion charms and mass displacement must have some underlying principle that allows them to function where does the space come from or perhaps more accurately where do the things that we put into such space mass go the four boys were staring at her blankly riiiight pettigrew was the first to say glancing at the rest for help and this matters because if james is to become a stag that animal easily weighs two and a half times his human body weight where does that mass come from to become a stag it is not simply created and shed whenever one switches forms the amount of energy that would require is enormous it must come from and then go to somewhere else if i transfigure into a phoenix that a creature with no more than one eighth my normal mass again where does it go while i am the phoenix obviously not too far because an animagi does not have to perform a complex ritual to return to human form sorry mione i know you love science but as long as the magic works isntthat all that counts i mean does the actual method really matter hermione resisted the urge to roll her eyes and sigh aloud reminding herself that three of the four boys were not academicians at heart but willing to work hard as a means to their ultimate end for us james the method does matter wizards and witches who attempt this kind of magic are all well beyond us in terms of age and skill they have learned magics that we are not introduced to here and they can acquire items and tools that are not available to us we cannot simply mimic their steps and get the right answer like the recipe for a cake so what do we do sirius asked frowning we understand theory she grinned back at him we learn the old fashioned way practice makes perfect how by using our wands to displace the mass of other objects and return them to their original state we ll do objects before we do ourselves she flipped open the journal and pointed to a picture a muddy tangle of roots ended in a brilliant white lotus flower on the page and this is our next problem to solve before we start practicing on people when transfiguring ourselves we will not want to run the risk of sending the whole body and mind into nil space by accident the bottom feeding lotus is used to treat mental illness because it anchors some part of the psyche to the physical world if we want to practice safely we need one i cantimagine having your mind utterly erased and replaced by a dog or a lion s but james led her out but it is only available at the very bottom of deep fresh water bodies and it must be used within a two mile radius of where it grew so we have to find this thing remus said at hogwarts here or near someone house this summer hermione confirmed why cantanything about this process be easy sirius grumbled it magic so advanced that most wizards and witches are not capable of performing it at all and those who can have years of study behind them did you expect to do it overnight the momentary flash of irritation through the black eyes made her laugh aloud with the realization that he had proposed this fantastic feat with such an expectation sorry this isntyour standard curriculum siri i think i ve figured that out he muttered what do we want to practice on first you have noticed that professor mcgonagall gives us objects to transform into things of almost exactly the same mass matchsticks into needles medium sized turtles into teapots those kinds of thing yes that to save us the complications of dealing with nil space a few grams of weight can be created or shed without difficulty so what i think we should do first is try transforming gravel she was pulling shiny pebbles out of her bag into birds it a big enough difference to draw on mass from somewhere else but it not a huge one okay james seized a smooth black stone settling it on the duvet in front of him what the incantation this one is useless klytemnestra sighed as she tossed muggles magical superstitions onto the growing pile of books that had been skimmed and discarded you re sure the dryad agrees with you he was quite clear on the fact that merlin is not our starting point hermione repeated after the young gryffindor recounted her brief meeting with the dryad the dark haired cousins had conceded that the muggle world now seemed the more likely place to begin but since formulating their hypothesis they had found nothing that seemed to strike the cord they were looking for combing history books charting the persecution of magic back to the time of hogwarts and the resurgence of magic in popular fiction during the twentieth century had left them with a single discouraging conclusion that lily and hermione had discovered long ago muggles were very inventive when it came to their kind but not one of them had recorded anything that might assist them in their search i maintain that this would be more productive if we knew exactly what we re looking for lily muttered in plain exasperation shoving modern witchcraft for muggles to dangle perilously off the edge of the table the muggle world is enormous i dontlike cryptic i think it something we ll understand better if we find it ourselves hermione replied abstractly her quill moving slowly as she jotted down a title found in a stained yellow index the kind of knowledge that cantbe told severus suddenly straightened in his seat the sharp movement so different than their several days of lazy page turning brought all three pairs of eyes flashing to him hopefully but the slim book lying in front of him had been forgotten his head was half turned eyes unfocussed his concentration directed outward before she could ask hermione ears caught the murmurs that had become words on the other side of the bookcase but going out at night to hogsmeade came the nervous question when else it hardly a day time event was the bright reply the real stuff happens after sundown but we re not allowed in a school of a thousand who is going to know it not like flitwick tucks us into bed and gives us a goodnight kiss every evening but leaving hogwarts after dark the beltaine festival is held every year and none of us are ever allowed to go hogsmeade practically our back yard is thrown open just this one night to muggle tourists for this occasion only while we who can wield magic are denied claudia and i are definitely going are you coming hermione ceased to listen her sparkling eyes colliding with severus their thoughts reaching the same conclusions beltaine he started in an excited whisper a ritual some say is as old as britain herself still being practiced by muggles hermione finished quietly nonsense and superstition klytemnestra cut them off imperiously turning back to her text impatiently beltaine and may day are for muggles who wish to be mages everyone knows there nothing really special about the solstices equinoxes and all the other stuff muggles like to dabble in look to the world you were born in lily quoted gently he spoke of needing something endorsed by our muggle counterparts that we have discarded for whatever reason she laughed quietly as she connected the rest of the dots and in merlin time this was one of their widely acknowledged holy festivals maybe for wizards and witches as well as muggles a gateway hermione thought the one that opens the ancient world to the contemporary the older girl head snapped up again a frown creasing her eyebrows we outgrew this mumbo jumbo for a good reason there are shelves of books written by those who have tried to discover if there are calendar days when magical prowess waxes and wanes with the seasons the elements the tides the phases of the moon some of the modern titles were inspired by muggle philosophy and practices but the fact remains that there is nothing concrete to prove that any day is better or worse than others magic is magic regardless of when it occurs perhaps conventional magic is that way hermione countered a smile curving her lips but we are dealing with music and with other beings what if the power is not real but perceived if we need the help of other races and they honor such days we should as well severus completed the thought the import of such observance is all the power such days require in their eyes his cousin furrowed brow had deepened but the objection in her eyes had turned into thoughtfulness and a smirk of respect as she glanced at severus very astute thank you there is probably more than that lily mused the dryad said that muggles have wrapped them in meaningless ritual but i think that under that he hinted that there was something truly important what if wizards and witches refused to participate because it was getting too cluttered i think severus point was well made perhaps for us the importance is in the act of simply acknowledging such days a reminder however twisted by modern fashions of the world that once existed hermione said an unbroken tradition which is exactly what the dryad said i think it useless to continue speculating severus announced pushing back from the table and equally futile to continue sitting here reading about a subject that cannot be told so why would it be written about we should go to the beltaine festival in hogsmeade another excursion based on breaking the rules hermione sighed almost under her breath why am i not surprised what is the point of solving a puzzle that works within the rules severus asked almost uncharacteristically cheerful with this potential breakthrough we have two days to decide are we going the three girls swapped glances each daring the others to be the voice of reasonable caution that no one wanted to pronounce even klytemnestra seemed to have surrendered her doubts to curiosity and the best lead they d had in days none were surprised when the decision by default was to go maybe i should have joined the slug club sirius joked nervously as the two boys made their way to slughorn office he d probably give us pastries and pumpkin juice and a bedtime story about the best people he d taught now occupying the highest seats of the ministry james finished scornfully his glance towards his best friend grew solemn you ve always known why you dontwant to join in on that elitist claptrap hermione did evans did they re muggle born james answered with a shrug he wanted them for their brains he d never have even noticed yours the line of your ancestors is too long for you to matter to him at all hopefully he ll answer an unusual question anyway the taller boy replied they turned a corner and swapping looks of mutual trepidation strode up to the dark mahogany door sirius fist falling to thud against it politely come in the cheerful voice of their potions professor beckoned them onward the boys shuffled inside to see him wrapped comfortably in a velvet smoking jacket his over stuffed armchair matching the luxuriant roundness of his stomach sirius he hastily set aside the book he had been reading and rose smiling his entire focus on the elder son of aries black james fading into the wall like a well trained dog unworthy of notice what an unexpected pleasure are you reconsidering my recent invitation i can assure you that not all of our guests are ministry speakers why matthew wainwright of the chudley cannons is going to be coming for my last little dinner in may sorry professor sirius cut slughorn off firmly in the polite voice reserved for the drawing rooms of the upper crust a rare reminder of who the renegade boy had been raised to be but i actually here about a bit of research james almost burst into laughter at the look of concrete disappointment rearranging the portly face he could almost hear professor mcgonagall jaw drop as he imagined sirius saying the same thing to her their head of house had never been able to hide her pride and fondness for their ability in her subject nor her displeasure that they never undertook to stretch themselves academically only this man would be sorry that sirius had come to talk business instead of pleasure slughorn hastily erased his expression as sirius smiled faintly and pulled his facial muscles into an appropriate look of delight for a teacher counseling a precocious student you have that s that wonderful my boy potions for you is it i ve never thought you all that interested though you re certainly a dab hand at them it an ingredient sir sirius deftly interrupted directing the slytherin attention to the book he had just pulled open this flower professor its healing properties seem to have vast potential but of course they re quite difficult to find i was wondering if you would know perhaps where i might go looking so that i can run some tests the sharp interest in slughorn eyes was genuine as he studied the ink and paint illustration sirius had extended the bottom feeding lotus all traces of jovial paternalism disappeared leaving a scientist studying an unusual phenomenon with a good eye fascinating plant as your reading has doubtless told you his shrewd eyes travelled to sirius perfectly straight face a rare one as you have noted what drew your attention to it it unique capacity to bind some or all of the mind to this plane of existence while the body quests elsewhere sirius reeled off though james had to give him credit it didntsound like the rote memorized phrase they had painstakingly learned word for word from hermione very interesting slughorn was nodding appreciatively we can ask albus for permission i can hardly imagine that he ll say no and see what we can find of course you ll need an advisor for such a project might i hope to do the honors james hurriedly turned his snort into a cough there was no one else to do them as the slytherin knew quite well of course sir sirius lied graciously professor dumbledore he pressed oh yes their rotund teacher smiled indulgently these loti grow well in all kinds of water from freezing to tropical we ll need to ask him to speak to the mer people there a colony located on the bottom of our lake the lake remus did not share his friends enthusiasm for this discovery neither did pettigrew the narrow eyes had flown instantly to the iron grey water sluggishly lapping the grass not ten feet from them c mon remus james laughed sprawled out lazily in the sun his body molding to the ground as if boneless it spring the water is getting warmer every day it could be covered with ice you know james i hate to be the one crowding you with reality but water is not breathable it doesntmatter how hot or cold it is there no way even the strongest swimmer can make it to the bottom and back in the three or four minutes of air you have in your lungs much less grub around for a plant how do you propose to solve that problem there are charms the bubble head charm the sixth years are learning for one sirius said easily maybe i still think it foolish their worn friend said sharply and so do you otherwise hermione would be here but you dontwant her talking you out of it and how are you going to explain to professor slughorn that you have no real desire to embark on this kind of research at all james and sirius traded scowls that then by unspoken agreement turned on remus but before they could voice their objections pettigrew slouched form straightened a scavenger sighting potential prey snivellus he announced in a low voice half eager half frightened the two lean dark haired boys reacted like dogs to their master whistle both bounded upright as if the grass itself had thrown them to their feet and all the afternoon promised relaxation vanished tension filling the vacuum instantly their rival strode into full view not three yards away snivelly sirius called by way of greeting severus halted an invisible leash pulled tight his jaw tightening noticeably even at a distance yes black he answered scornfully not bothering to turn and face them at the beginning of the year you proposed thestral blood james hated voice filled his ears i have a different challenge oh potter now the slytherin did look to them swinging his body casually his posture telling them that they were merely an annoyance not a threat and meaning it sirius felt a shaft of unease as he realized that severus blustering attempt to shield his fear of them behind viciousness a large part of the fun in their continuing enmity had vanished the long hands were tucked inside his pocket robes but the muscles were loose not taut as if gripping a wand and the black eyes gazed at them contemptuously exasperation their only acknowledgement of the long standing feud sirius ground his teeth if the greasy haired boy thought that his friendship with hermione would save him it was time he learned that she only bought him breathing room the lake james was saying coldly and sirius knew that his best friend had spotted the unnerving signs he had seen as well and that his desire to return their sallow classmate to familiar ground was driving his words there a kind of flower at the bottom a lotus the first person to retrieve one is the winner a lotus from a lake severus sneered turning over a new ear in herbology potter or am i supposed to help you woo your lost lady love he flicked his hand dismissively forget it i not a matchmaker when you can come up with something a little less girlish i ll gladly accommodate your desire for humiliation coward sirius lip was curled disdainfully with a snarl and he was rewarded by watching his enemy face lock into rigid lines new found confidence or not the insult still landed a bulls eye on the target fine thing to say black when i will be facing all four of you underwater on my own surely those bully boys you sit with in class will join you james tossed back carelessly i would have better chances with my cousin and hermione granger recovery made this time it was severus mouth that curved into a cold smile as he watched everyone but pettigrew snap to attention remus normally gentle eyes hardening to granite words snivelly james spat she would never stand against us would she severus wondered he would not ask her of course as he would not ask klytemnestra there were some battles that one did not summon armies for and his private war with potter and black had to be kept out of hermione sight but i am her major he nearly smiled at the rapidly growing store of memories of music spun from their fingertips the weaving of a magic entirely their own the hours in the forest had crafted a world outside of hogwarts a country in which nothing mattered but the notes they sent piping into the air it bound them more thoroughly than any house affiliation could tie her to these four she wouldntrise to your defense either he finally answered his voice steady and it wontbe four of us james quickly added ignoring the other boy last words as if he could forget they were true just me fancy that snape a little one on one combat the winner gets fifty galleons only a spoiled child would bet so much of his father money i at least have the honor not to wager what i donthave i will take pleasure in beating you but the loser will do the winner homework for a week to the standard expected by our professors james squinted at him the price was not cheap their talents lay in diametrically opposing fields to complete severus potions and defense work properly would take hours in the library then dontlose his mind supplied he nodded shortly agreed tonight midnight the slytherin boy hesitated tonight that would mean missing the beltaine outing and it had been his idea to go but potter voice was enough to make his jaw tight and black ever condescending commentary desperately needed correction if this task took him forty five minutes they had planned on sneaking off to the festival at ten o clock surely he could catch up to them nine thirty he countered in a hurry to be nowhere sirius asked i dontsee what business it is of yours what i do with my time or who he was rewarded with another wince from the boys in front of him but even as the tallest gryffindor reached for his wand a slender eyebrow rose draw on me now and you forfeit the challenge i ll gladly drop my books on your table at dinner james reached over and seized his best friend wrist shooting the furious black eyes a quelling glance fine nine thirty a short sardonic bow of acceptance and severus started to move away as if they had completed a business transaction it a good thing quidditch is over isntit you ll have plenty of time to do my work this week i sure your lack of social life wontinterfere with you doing mine james returned with the ease of expertise just make sure you re not failing my classes by pining away over lily evans while she enjoys herself with her real boyfriend came snape final remark at this remus fastened both arms about james middle as the chaser leaped forward hands outstretched in claws ready to rake the other boy face as he strode away we have other problems than snape right now he panted struggling against the lean player greater agility and strength as severus dwindled from sight along the shore of the lake the first of which is how are we going to get you to breathe underwater for at least the half hour you ll need to get to the bottom find this flower and bring it back up snape i heard you re going for a swim rodolphus lestrange was seated too casually on his bed when the sallow boy entered his posture making it clear that he had been waiting for this moment exercise is generally thought to be beneficial yes severus returned blandly cautious there was no telling what rumors had been spit into the other boy ears and severus wasntkeen to clarify them unconditionally true but one might recommend it during daylight hours and not while struggling with a sworn enemy to get to the bottom of a very deep mountain lake long fingers flexed in irritation clearly the news had travelled intact severus did not bother to wonder how a castle with a thousand adolescents had more ears than any spy story he would have to pray that it did not reach hermione he doubted she would approve of or understand his mission tonight especially since this escapade meant that he would be late for beltaine he had to think of a good excuse to delay himself without telling the truth he knew that while his cousin might understand his need to deal with potter the two gryffindor girls never would what do you want les he snapped dropping the game he hated playing he had much to do before tonight including finding a way to breathe in the lake the bigger boy stood matching severus honesty you ve been distant lately sev and i have to say i dontapprove you ve got those gryffindor bitches and that high and mighty cousin of yours all tangled up around you now i know you re going to say that avery an idiot and between us you re right he caused a lot of problems with you him and tim wilkes too i know it but here question you should be thinking about when we leave hogwarts you re going to belong to a world where that granger girl and the evans mudblood dontfit do you really want to be alienating a whole future of potential allies for a pretty face or two silence fell in the wake of his bald statement and the training of a lifetime under his father brutal management was all preventing severus from raising a clenched fist and smashing it against the other wizard nose lestrange seemed to see through his robes to the battle raging within and when severus mastered his impulse to lay his roommate out flat amusement flashed in the dark eyes and a cocky smile spread on the broad features on a more immediate note lestrange tone was casual returning their interaction to that of fourteen year olds i can tell you how to survive underwater tonight if you ll write my essay on the properties of rose quartz for professor slughorn where is severus hermione asked quietly as klytemnestra slipped into the out of order girl bathroom moaning myrtle constantly gushing lavatory was proving as useful now as it had twenty years in the future klytemnestra grimaced inwardly at the lie her cousin had begged her to tell but heard the words coming easily from her tongue he started his potion today later than he should have and has to add things carefully for the next fifteen minutes he said he ll catch up lily frowned forest shaded eyes darkening as she twisted a curl around her finger maybe we should wait the road to hogsmeade is dark something could happen to him if we wait we might miss something of importance her friend countered sighing we re already starting later than we should to avoid the teachers and we re not exactly going to have fun i can stay behind and wait for him klytemnestra offered cursing severus as she said it realizing that this was one outing to the village that she truly wanted to go on hermione was shaking her head thoughtfully no we dontknow how many pairs of eyes and ears we ll need the road is dark but there nothing on it and the creatures of the forbidden forest keep to themselves severus is capable he ll be all right traveling alone they fell quiet the wild haired witch tapping her foot in thought wondering what had induced severus always so eager to put everything aside for a hint of music to make himself unavailable right now carelessness was utterly unlike the professor she trusted and the boy had proven very like the man in this regard still he was only fourteen pushing aside her irritation for this inconvenience she gestured to the tapestry concealing a corridor that would lead to a door that would spit them out on the road side of the castle if we re not going to wait for him shall we stars blurred against the sky the warm air of a spring night dulling the edges made by winter crispness severus slid out of the castle at ease in the darkness as he never was in broad daylight luxuriating in the cover of midnight blue this far north the sky had only truly darkened just a half hour before and by the time solstice arrived in june the dim rim of twilight would illumine the mountains until ten o clock their practice schedule had long accustomed the young wizard to sneaking in and out of the school in all kinds of weather and he ambled along easily hugging the tree line until he reached the shores of the lake the glass smooth water reflecting a swollen moon from its black surface true to his word only james potter stood there tucked against a large boulder that shielded him from hogwarts his eyes locked on the cold water severus melted forward from the forest and glided up beside him james jumped as he felt the presence materialize at his left shoulder he glowered at his rival of three years didntanyone ever teach you any manners terrified i was a creature come to grind your bones for my bread potter severus whispered dark eyes glittering you re such a git the other boy snapped nerves taut from the short wait and the still evening are we going to do this or do i have to stand around listening to you try to be clever for the rest of the night i am ready it you who seems to be shivering there no need to go if you dontfeel up to it james glanced down at the goose bumps that had erupted all over his bare arms and legs and brought his eyes back to severus it a bit chilly if you re not covered in robes he said acidly shaking coal black hair out of his eyes the slytherin shed his light cloak and pulled his robes off over his head revealing tar colored swimming trunks without waiting for any kind of signal the instant he released the wool of his day clothes his hands came together over his head left on top of right and bending his knees he jumped cutting into the water in a shallow dive cursing for the moment lost james hastily followed him wand flickering up to cast the bubble head charm he had practiced with ludo bagman that afternoon severus kicked hard shooting downwards and delighting in the cool easy sensation of water flowing around him lestrange method had been peculiar but it worked the spell he had found was a little known piece of blood magic discovered in a book nicked from evan rosier father library most of the essays and illustrations would have earned the owner an expulsion or a year worth of detentions at the very least but this charm was neither dark nor difficult just strange it had been easy enough to garner a live fish from the ever eager house elves slit it open and after pricking his own finger bathe his hands in the blood a short ritual incantation allowing the attributes of the water dweller into his blood stream he could feel oxygen in his lungs without needing to breathe it and the water which he knew to be freezing for his human body felt no more than faintly chilly swift sure strokes carried him to the mud and silt covered earth long before he expected to reach it maybe the lake wasntso deep as imagined he gazed around treading water lightly trying not to disturb the dirt and cause it to swirl up around him where would one find a bottom feeding lotus in the grey green black water it should be easy to find the white plant the purity of its color a beacon in the dark he could not see the object of his search so he chose a direction and began to swim again eyes scanning sharply over the lake floor he had been straining for five minutes when movement next to him caught his eye and brought him up short legs pedaling once more as he stared it was not potter as he had half expected nor was it one of the mer people who lived in the lake the young woman in front of him seemed to flow as if fashioned by the water itself the currents swirling to make the deep silver jade of her eyes the graceful extensions of slender arms and legs ending in thin spun webs between fingers and toes he felt heat rising to his face and dropped his eyes as his gaze traveled over her body to find her unabashedly naked small blue grey breasts bobbing with the faint movement of the water he studied the ground intensely guiltily wondering what hermione would think if she could see him and simultaneously feeling that the water woman lack of dress did not matter what brings you son of earth to these waters when those who need you are walking another road her voice was gentle and lilting carrying with it the quiet rush of the sea in a shell and offering no rebuke in its tone but shame scalded him abruptly son of earth the same title that the dryad had given him what was he doing here playing at being a schoolboy as if potter and black truly mattered anymore their rivalry was a game for children and he who had been granted the privilege of knowing another world was wasting his valuable time quibbling now breaking a promise he had made to the only people he had ever cared about to scrape the lake floor for an item he couldntcare less about just to prove what you are her major the faun words echoed loudly filling his ears underwater your place is with her young severus the woman whispered in her silvery voice his thoughts coming back to him from her mouth now and always you are her major yes this time he lifted his eyes to stare into her ancient gaze and it was no mystery that she knew who and what he was you are the spirit of the lake i am naiad is the name given to my kind by men a smile fluidly slid across her mouth hurry son of earth you do not belong here open yourself to what you seek a child of water has given you blood and earth has claimed you as one of her own find the lotus not with your eyes but with your gift so saying she vanished he blinked there had been no flashes of light or cracks of apparition she had simply disappeared back into the liquid that had created her a seamless re integration of elements that made him wonder very briefly if she had ever been there at all a child of water the fish it was easy to recall the way he could sometimes feel the earth under his feet now the sense of growth of life of millions of lives going on in around and under it he closed his eyes and stretched out his legs letting his feet squelch into the slick bottom seeking the connection that he had forgotten not twenty yards to his left he felt the spreading root system of the lotus waving gently in the sluggish undertow he struck out eyes still closed eager to take the flower and be done with it the idea of beating the gryffindor boy he hated had drifted to the back of his mind all that mattered was to finish as quickly as possible and catch up to his node to take his station at her side the bright white flower gleamed utterly out of place amongst the dark green ferns and tangle of brown roots seeking their purchase in the mud he pointed his wand at it and severed the stem neatly from the mother plant delicately pinching it in one hand as he kicked back towards the surface as his head popped back into air and starlight and saw james potter head emerging as well two bursts of white exploding onto the dark surface as they brought up their flowers and swam wearily to the shoreline you have one the disappointment in james voice was plain but severus ignored him as he spelled himself dry and hastily re dressed his classmate long dismissed as irrelevant as his mind walked the path to hogsmeade he checked his watch and noted that it had taken them a bare thirty minutes if he hurried he should be able to overtake the girls on the road now i guess this means no homework for either of us the gryffindor said agreed the lotus james hands were clearly itching to pick up the flower where severus had so carelessly discarded it on the boulder flicking his hand impatiently the pale boy nearly told him simply to take it but stopped himself in spite of the fact that it rose from the mud the plant grew clean unsullied and shining he caressed a soft white petal and smiled to himself a fitting gift for someone perhaps for the summer holiday loti had quite a lifespan as long as they were kept in water fruits of my labor and mine to keep severus answered scooping it up part of him was dimly pleased at the look of irritation on james face but mostly he simply wanted to escape without making excuses what are you going james started to ask and then stopped himself even as a long finger lifted in a gesture for silence voices were floating to them on the low breeze now ruffling the edges of the water the polished honey tones of the first were ones the slytherin instantly recognized with a chill far colder than the water had been lucius malfoy the second speaker was not so familiar but he saw the dawning horror on his adversary face that for once had nothing to do with him i require certain information regarding the girl i sure you can see what in it for you malfoy voice had the cool superiority of a man making a deal far beneath him i told you what i am prepared to pay the other was also male and sounded distinctly less sure and you you promise that lily wontget hurt and she wontfind out my word the aristocrat purred okay yeah i ll do it i ll keep track of hermione for you it wontbe too hard she and lily are pretty much inseparable james brown gaze filled with murderous rage and betrayal as he turned to severus the first and only time the boys would find themselves in complete accord in their lives that walt winters the chaser spat furiously the click of comprehension was an unwelcome one lily boyfriend please let me know what you think disclaimer not mine marching orders she stood at the edge of the dusty shelves gazing past the last rows of tomes stretching to the ceiling and the bookcases covered in layers of dust that might not have been disturbed for hundreds of years but what would have once captured her imagination and excitement now passed her by the music soared in her veins thrumming power and she felt she could hear the breathing of the wood and stone of the lazy autumn night itself as she stood in the dim book lined corridors of the library it was plaintive then joyful solemn followed by bouncy mellow turned into trills did no one else in the silent room hear it it was the most glorious sound she had encountered for many years since she stopped taking lessons sweet and full and rich though if professor slughorn were to be believed it was blessing that no one else seemed aware of the melody that suffused her being she crossed the few steps to the window willing her breathing to quiet trying to listen the strains of the sound floated to her cleanly as she stood by the lattice they were coming from the grounds whirling long curls flying behind her unruly as ever hermione exited the library at a pace barely slower than a run without her cloak without protection and without consideration that in fifteen minutes she would be both out of bounds and out of curfew hermione sprinted to the small side door just outside of the doors leading into the great hall unbolted it with hasty clumsy fingers and hurtled out onto the lawn compelled by professor snape command and drawn by a desire stronger than curiosity whoever played was someone who would understand her someone willing to take the risk starved of companionship for all of her life hermione body guided where her mind and even her ears could not when the wind whistled to drown the music her feet knew exactly where to lead her and she followed the force that tugged at her toes and pulled her unerringly forward unlike her last blundering attempt hermione moved stealthily the music clearer and purer as she approached for a moment she stood in the shadow of one of the great pines that lined the outer edges of the forest head thrown back eyes closed bathing in the sound she could feel the crackling stir of magic snapping at the ends of her hair whether student or adult these players were virtuosic and their skill evoked and stirred to life the magic that surrounded the school earth cool wind water damp leaves thick moss the wildflowers that carpeted the forest floor and a thousand other smells imprinted themselves in her nose magic thick oozing around her like a bee in a stream of honey breaking her self imposed spell hermione started forward again creeping ever closer entering the forest only with extreme care and drawing close enough she parted the dangling branches in front of her face to see two silhouetted forms under the trees neither speaking fingers flitting over their instruments in improvised time hermione hands curled and rippled over an imaginary harp its real twin sitting in a room under gryffindor tower twenty three years from now and her vocal cords ached with suppressing her desire to join the musicians in their practice squinting into the moonlight to keep her body tangible reaction from betraying her presence she narrowed her eyes to slits trying to determine who the players were long pale fingers flashed over the silver keys of the clarinet and as the player rocked forward a shadow slung down to mask his features no not a shadow hair hermione controlled her instinct to gasp by biting her tongue to clip the sound that black hair and those hands could only belong to one person with a clarity that staggered her she reached for the nearest tree trunk and leaned against it vividly recalling the searing intensity of professor snape gaze as he had given her this assignment find the clarinet she had found it and the player and somehow unsurprisingly it was him 888 remus james slid his arm around his friend slender shoulders giving him a rough hug at breakfast two mornings later how your mum sirius asked solicitously from the other side she s you know the same as always remus did not have to fake the fatigue and listlessness in his voice she not getting any better james sounded genuinely disappointed no you prat same as always usually means exactly that sirius swatted james gently on the back of his head when the other boy batted him back sirius ducked and james long arm instead clunked against the back of remus head knocking him forward into his plate james drink your coffee before engaging in fights remus muttered rubbing the back of his head your aim is off sorry boys lily sniffed disapprovingly hermione smiled at her shaking her head what lily demanded catching the end of the gesture they should be being nice to him not kicking him around boys are like puppies hermione told her spreading her toast with black raspberry jam when they beat each other up they re having fun remus wouldntwant them to make a big deal of his going home he worried enough about his mother as it is they would only make him more anxious if they crowded him with questions and treated him like glass hmmph it was clear lily thought little of this line of reasoning as she dug into her kippers from the other side of her trina narrowed her eyes at hermione shrugging hermione scooted down the bench to where ludo bagman sat across from the marauders now deep in conversation about quidditch she squashed her sigh and picked up the paper better to listen to convoluted plans to beat slytherin game strategy than endure the censure of her dorm mates behind the newspaper hermione eyes turned distant as she focused on her internal object for two days she had wrestled with what to do about discovering that snape was the player she sought it was clear from the adult snape reaction what she would do and that he would help her but teenage snape seemed if anything more surly and withdrawn than her professor as a gryffindor outside the slytherin hierarchy she was fairly certain that as far as he was concerned she did not exist and there was the matter of the other the slight frame and long plaited hair left hermione reasonably certain that the viola player was female but the high cheekbone thrown in relief by the moonlight indicated a girl well into puberty she was slight but not short clearly someone older someone close to her own actual age but it was certainly no one hermione knew and she had not made a plan for a third person snape had mentioned only himself and the echo if the echo is a person perhaps she is the echo the young woman mused she quickly shook her head to dispel that thought professor snape had said find it was unlikely then that it would be so easy as all that and she too had had an instrument in her hands but there was no reason to think that the echo could not be a human being harry was researching horcruxes and soul splitting with professor dumbledore after all so it was not an impossibility that a person might contain a magical anomaly erm hermione pettigrew was poking her shoulder she slapped his hand away automatically as if it blazed with an open flame the hurt in his eyes and pouting lip was all too evident as sirius raised his eyebrows at her from across the table but he merely said it time for class we cantlet you sit there all day james would fail without you take notes for him right sorry the smile she tried for failed as she looked at peter and she quickly dropped her eyes under the cover of picking up her bag she could feel lily evan eyes on her back the other girl having observed the awkward exchange and the puzzled frown on her face followed hermione out the great hall doors i can t i can t i must be mad not to be able to act better than this hermione knew her violent dislike of peter pettigrew and automatic irrepressible reaction to him hardly kept the secret of her odd mission if anything it was coming closer and closer to destroying her cover but in his voice every time it reached her ears she could only hear the frantic pleading mumblings of a desperate balding murderer who had betrayed harry parents two people she was coming to regard as friends of hers in her own right sighing as they filed into the defense against the dark arts classroom she settled her bag on the desk she shared with remus pulling out her book as usual as she sat severus snape brushed by her sitting with his partner timothy wilkes a pale slender boy who would have reminded her of draco malfoy had his hair not been dark and had he not had the spark of humor in his slate grey eyes that the malfoy heir most distinctly lacked snape did not bother to pull his book out of his bag shaking his black hair forward to hide his face he sat slumped at their shared desk his posture indicating a confident boredom he had every right to never having opened his book in class by all appearances he didnteven carry it he was capable of answering any question presented to him by professor torrenwright and could counter in practice any hex jinx or curse on the first attempt hermione tapped her quill on her desk contemplating the boy seated two desks up and one over from her she had to find a way to speak to him but she had instantly intimately associated herself with his dearest enemies hardly the best speaking terms still she had done it and the momentary intensity her professor eyes had held in dumbledore office buoyed her assurance that it would not be a miserable experience for them her resolve stiffened she put the spinning threads of what she could say to him in the back of her mind and bent her mind towards listening to her professor 888 after lunch hermione screwed up her courage diffindo had worked on several occasions for emergency warnings and conferences between classes so she would simply split his bag down the middle and pounce while he cleaned up where re you going james asked bewildered as hermione stood halfway through a bite just remembered something she lied to him around a mouth of hot pasty i need to check the library for my history of magic essay would it kill you to let that wait until this evening sirius asked but his black eyes glittered with warmth as hermione shook her head she had easily gained the affectionate know it all title in these first two and a half weeks and sirius had no qualms about letting her check his essays for class see you in a bit she stuffed a last bite in her mouth as she swung her bag over her shoulder snape was just leaving the hall in the company of the boy who seemed to both control and protect him rodolphus lestrange she watched their not quite easy interaction for a moment a cautious relationship growing more comfortable between allies whose loyalty and pecking order had been long since established she hurried out after him only to be stopped by a long arm that ended in pale flawlessly manicured fingers right outside the doors the hand tightened on her upper arm and spun her to look into one of the faces of her nightmares lucius malfoy and behind him leering slightly the would be executioner of buckbeak walden macnair her lip curled instinctively as her other hand crossed her body to seize the wand hidden in her robes none of that he released her arm with a warm smile throwing up his hands in the universal gesture of surrender her right hand wrapped around her wand anyway as she threw a quick glance over her shoulder snape was soon to be out of range of her hex i was headed somewhere she told malfoy icily is it your habit to stop people cold without so much as a by your leave macnair chuckled from his position of relative safety behind his friend feisty luci you might want to be careful with this one but lucius merely smiled at her it softened all of the angular planes of his face and the sparkling grey eyes that his son would inherit seemed to focus on her alone as she looked at him hermione felt her face reddening and twisted slightly to escape his gaze had she not known what he was what he would become she would have found him quite charming the delicate attention he was paying to her face and only her face was difficult to shut out as it was she could not keep her body from heating in response to the kind of appraisal that no boy in her own time had ever given her i apologize he made a courtly little bow to her you are always in a hurry and always in such company as would hex me rather than look at me that i simply had to seize my chance macnair guffawed behind him all puns intended hermione remarked trying to keep her voice chilled as her intellect clamored with her instincts of course you are of age to visit hogsmeade yes yes she replied hesitantly excellent would you care to come with me on our first weekend hermione stared at him under the shock ran a sudden desire to burst into laughter did this memory rankle in the older malfoy twenty years from now inviting his son muggle born rival on a date go with you to hogsmeade she snorted and tossed her hair back ready to deny him malfoy hermione felt three people at her back and relaxed a breath she didntknow she had been holding sirius james and remus stood solidly behind her and sirius wand was out and pointing past her shoulder at malfoy james was at macnair remus wasntout but his hand pressed gently against the small of her back offering her comfort what going on hermione he asked nothing malfoy just asked me to hogsmeade she knew there was a lingering tone of wonder in her voice borne not of flattery but of her sheer inability to believe what she had heard sirius wand shook with anger but there was nothing wavering about his voice as he said stiffly hands off malfoy she allergic to scum malfoy laughed easily a sound both like and unlike the sneering of his son and backed away without acknowledging either the boys or their wands he said when you decide to think for yourself come give me your answer macnair shot her a cocky grin and a wink as he followed his friend as they rounded the corner walden frowned at lucius you gave up easily the charm had left lucius features casting them back into their customary mold of cold patrician beauty she is four years younger than i am and friends with those gryffindors as well as being a gryffindor herself i hardly expected her to say yes but one should always at least attempt the easy route i will simply have to find another road to what my master wants are you sure she the one he is lucius told his friend in a clipped tone dropping his voice after flicking his wand to ensure no one was within listening distance he finds it entirely too convenient that the beginning of his investigation of the echo and this girl arrival at hogwarts coincided so neatly couple that with the recent surges of distortion in the magical field around the school and he sure a powerful student is causing the problems by playing music she is powerful avery says she completes all class assignments dead perfect in no time at all and she may well play music who else would who just arrived this year a first year it takes guts to flout wizarding law and she attempts and succeeds occasionally in keeping sirius black in check she got guts who else would it be mmmhmm good points walden drawled lazily and rolled his eyes at his friend but face it what you like about it is that she a looker lucius mouth twitched i wontlie to you about that it is pleasant to have such an interesting prize to pursue what your next strategy i ve given her a challenge she might decide to take me up on it but if she doesn t lucius smiled ferally his eyes diamond hard his teeth barely showing through taut lips as our master has taught us there more than one way to skin a mudblood 888 stay away from him james warned her savagely after he and sirius had finished roundly abusing malfoy for his forwardness hermione stopped in the middle of the corridor the boys continued two steps more like water flowing around an entrenched log then halted turning to face her you think james harry potter i can think a few things through on my own she snarled her throat constricted around the name anger confusion and the faint stab of missing harry and ron making her voice squeak at the end of course remus hushed her quickly as two students passing by threw them curious looks that not what he meant at all sirius rushed to his friend defense he just you dont know malfoy like we do bet me she thought dangerously and knew some of the thought flashed in her eyes because sirius silenced instantly flip and arrogant though they could be none of the marauders wanted to see their newest friend undeniably powerful fury unleashed on them hermione i wasn t i didntmean you cantsee for yourself what kind of person he is but malfoy is very used to getting his own way and he ll go to any length to secure it i know hermione finished the sentence softly like father like son she wondered no my malfoy never acted like that a prat yes spoiled yes oozing charm while lying through his teeth not his style effective but not his style you re sure you re all right remus light brown eyes were staring into hers concerned etched into the lines on his forehead he didnttouch you at all no hermione smiled to reassure him no he just invited me to hogsmeade but he didntmean it in the normal way a guy invites a girl to go with him i can promise you he did sirius spat listen hermione no matter what anyone says about me and callous heartbreak which i sure you ve heard at least a dozen times from trina i am nothing compared with lucius malfoy he thinks you re pretty and he ll bed you if you let him hermione stared at him her previous thoughts forgotten as far as this hogwarts knew she was not the seventeen years of her actual age but the thirteen that dumbledore had told them her stomach roiled as if she was going to be sick right there in the hallway but i only thirteen doesntmatter sirius continued harshly rumor has it that malfoy has slept with every girl in slytherin fourth year and up and most of the seventh year girls in every house dontever let him near you and if he does come try again tell us even a seventh year cantfight all of us remus said firmly hermione felt a sudden rush of affection followed by yet another bitter sweet reminder of harry and ron sirius and james were all fire and action even their wild hand motions and fidgeting stances reminded her of ron remus stood next to her hand on her arm offering her quiet support and a core of strength that had not quite settled in his more flamboyant friends much as harry had learned to do and even peter to her surprise he was giving her an honestly concerned look so like one of neville that she could forget his traitorous future for an instant and for the first time reached to touch his arm the stretching of her mouth genuine they had closed around her protectively and she had for the first time an inkling of the loss remus would endure with the deaths and betrayals of these friends thank you she whispered and found her lower eyelids flush with tears she bowed her head to hastily wipe them away harry and ron hadntquite figured out crying girls yet and she couldntimagine these boys would be any less uncomfortable with them we couldntlet that pig touch you hermione james was saying earnestly never speaking of never sirius turned the conversation deftly sensing it was time to move on we ll never win the house cup if we re all late to potions this afternoon they glanced at the clock hanging overhead in the hall hermione gasped at the time and the five of them pelted in the direction of the dungeons 888 derailed by lucius malfoy in her earlier attempt hermione aimed her wand carefully at snape bag quidditch practice was always right after potions for the gryffindor team and she knew she could count on the boys to take off without her if she showed any signs of dawdling to ask questions snape was headed down one passage while the end of peter robe disappeared around the other diffindo the bag split in their reliably slytherin fashion the boys snape was walking with continued on and avery even kicked an ink bottle so that it deliberately skittered far out of snape reach she could see the tight exasperation in the boy shoulders as she hurried up behind him excuse me but that was all the farther she got without facing her his wand flicked into his hand and directly at her heart kindly tell me what is so desperate that you had to ruin a school bag to say it he whispered sibilantly when his black eyes locked on hers hermione forgot she was breathing fear and loathing argued for dominance there radiating chilliness from fathomless darkness then again i suppose destruction of other property is an easy habit to acquire from black i sorry she stammered sorry the curl of his lip made it clear that the word was one he had heard too often and with little sincerity attached i can repair it her voice found more sure footing as professor snape orders echoed in her head driving her inexorably forward i will in a minute that you can fix it is immaterial why did you break it to begin with i need to talk to you i not interested potter and black can talk to me themselves this isntabout them she snapped an arched eyebrow she sighed i am sorry i will fix your bag with a wave of her wand and a swift reparo the bag sprang back together the eyebrow shifted from judgmental to unwillingly impressed proficient he murmured hermione stared at him it was not her professor only the child version of him but still some part of her squirmed pleasurably to hear his approval his eyes lifted to hers again after he had given his bag a good long stare the coldness in them had abated and while they werentwarm the loathing had also vanished and hermione knew she had been granted a reprieve i i play an instrument she started offering information on herself first but as the last work left her mouth she knew it was a mistake doors slammed shut behind those eyes and the thin mouth pinched together he swung his head breaking eye contact and bent to scoop his things into his bag why are you telling me this he asked softly all the danger returned in his hissing s because i know you do too hermione replied misstep number two he jerked upright and his wand was out again the point nestled in the hollow where her collarbone joined her neck say one word and i swear i ll curse you to silence for the rest of your life i only wanted to ask you he shoved the tip of his wand farther into the space stretching the skin making it harder to breathe when she was almost gagging from the force he leaned very close to her ear and whispered no questions dontcome near me again he pulled his wand from her throat backing away quickly to finish putting away his books hermione hand was at her throat her eyes prickled with tears mostly from the wand that made her breath rasp in her throat but also from disappointment and defeat she rubbed the rapidly reddening spot with a finger and remember his fathomless eyes glared at her over his shoulder if you tell anyone you ll end up in azkaban he strode down the hall even at thirteen he unbuttoned his over robe just the right amount to let it flare outwards from the waist downwards making him appear larger than he was as he vanished hermione rested against the stone of the walls and let her tears come in earnest every day she felt the pressure of her failure to succeed in her task for dumbledore mounting and now she had reached what appeared to be an insurmountable barrier severus snape harsh personality she knew it was he who she was looking for but she didntknow how to gain his trust or even persuade him to hear her out such a comfort to know that some things never change she thought sarcastically angrily wiping her tears on the back of her sleeve just like in the shrieking shack when he had refused to listen to their explanation of pettigrew livelihood now he fled before she could truly talk to him about it dontcome near me again what am i supposed to do she whispered in frustration to the corridor as her throat closed over once again how am i to get to him unsurprisingly the grey granite had no solutions 888 are you all right remus asked as she made her way into the common room she blinked at him and hastily ran her hand over her face i fine she lied just a little well my potion for slughorn wasntperfect she invented knowing that the wolf in him could smell her distress some of the admiring professor he would be shone in his eyes for a moment as he shook his head i sure yours was still better than everyone else s except snape s she muttered sharp exasperation coloring her tone dontlet james and sirius hear you say that he chuckled as he dipped his quill in his ink to start a fresh line on his arithmancy chart even in that tone of voice they dontthink he can do anything well it definitely goes both ways hermione remembered wryly her thoughts drifting to the vicious fights between sirius and snape even as adults why arentyou at quidditch with them she asked quidditch is fun to watch but not when it all training maneuvers he shrugged i got bored peter might squeal watching james catch the quaffle every time but since he always catches it that sort of takes the anticipation out doesntit that always how i feel watching harry play hermione agreed without thinking he always going to catch the snitch victory is essentially guaranteed it not as much fun knowing the outcome harry remus asked hermione mouth snapped shut to prevent herself groaning aloud secrecy indeed it didnttake three weeks to start blowing it a friend of mine at home the boys school near the institute always came to our dances and parties and i got to know him superb quidditch player remus nodded and turned his attention back to the parchment desperately trying to roll up as he insistently pushed it flat scowling as the black ink smudged and pooled on the dry sheet hermione sat twisting a lock of hair in he fingers as she contemplated the boy trying to save his homework in front of her she had been debating since his transformation to tell him she knew and offer him her help it was clear that james and sirius didntyet know but they would surely figure it out soon the better part of three years and they were animagi by the end of their fifth year it had to be soon maybe i tell them she thought suddenly i could he said they figured it out so maybe i don t but he also didnttell me so much about my being here about any of this the golden sunlight lit dust motes fluttering over an empty common room everyone else was out in the autumn air in their clubs or in practices there couldntbe a better time but a sense of awkwardness bound her tongue what could she possibly say to him er remus about that werewolf thing there was nothing to say she could wait for james and sirius to discover the truth instead of making him endure discovery twice and as long as snape refused to hear her out she didntneed trouble with one or all of the marauders ron had long since proven that boys could be just as sensitive as girls about and sometimes more so james and sirius were likely to chuck her out as soon as they learned she was actively seeking snape company anyway more withdrawn indeed not for the first time hermione wondered about harry occlumency lessons with snape and whether he had ever broken the legilimen defenses it was unlikely but any clue to as to how to break through the closed boy walls would be welcome see you later remus she said absently as she started up her staircase 888 in her room hermione slumped on her four poster dropping her bag absently by her feet dontcome near me again sorry snape i have my orders from you
