 liner notes hey y all yes i finally back and yes i kinda switched genres for awhile i apologise to all my readers for my long absence high school ugh i wanted to experiment with several new things so here the first chapter in my first harry potter story which also happens to be my first chapter story and the first story i chose to self beta a lot of my favorite authors do it so i said what the heck let see if i can do it too let me know please if my harry is a bit ooc i dontthink so but he may be oh yes and the phone conversation between remus and harry is based on many many many conversations between my best friend and myself back before she learned it ok to not apologise for existing the first 4 chapters will be plot laying for the entire story so stick with me please i promise it will get more interesting once i introduce all the characters i sticking in here a u warning this features a slightly different ending to order of the phoenix although it wontshow up until next chapter sirius is still dead presumably i haventquite decided if he ll show back up to gum up the works but instead of just saying keep in touch remus makes an offer to harry so he can get away from the dursleys it not a massive change and i ll show the full flashback in chapter 2 but you should be aware now disclaimer i wearing a bathrobe older than i am it comfortable yes but if i owned harry potter i d be able to afford a new comfortable bathrobe and hair extensions dontyou think archiving i going to be eternally optimistic and say that maybe somebody out there might want this if you decide you do please note that it going to be pretty long and i d ask you to post it all maybe 20 chapters or so it going to span more than two years in harry world and i laying actual plot before the kissing bits so if you decide you want it please make sure you re willing to post it all rating pg eventual pg 13 and possibly r depends on where i decide to go with this for an eventual slash relationship remus and but is not harry i wonttell who it is potential mild language and of course abuse of the dursleys i love that stuff i dontthink i need anything else except that this fic is dedicated to eleonora1 and immortalflick and that the title is a nod to my best friend favorite author i ll stick you in here somewhere if you can tell me what victor hugo work was originally supposed to be called what there is in a bottle of ink enjoy boy harry potter sighed and pushed unruly black hair out of his eyes before getting up off his bed vernon dursley in a bad mood wasntsomething to deal with if it could be avoided and so harry went out into the hall and down the stairs of number four privet drive with as much false eager to please attitude as he could yes uncle vernon uncle vernon lowered his voice to a venomous hiss how many times must i tell you boy i do not want you giving out our telephone number especially to to people like like you he shoved the telephone receiver into harry chest you have fifteen minutes and not a moment more do you understand me boy harry nodded before tentatively placing the receiver to his ear hello harry i sorry i didntknow calling would get you in trouble i didntmean to harry rolled his eyes at the warm and welcome but extremely panicked voice on the other end of the telephone remus i only have fifteen minutes do you think maybe you could either speed up the apology or get it over with please why are you calling remus blushed although harry of course couldntsee it sorry anyway harry i talked to dumbledore last week and harry harry i got the papers harry potter was not known for shrieking wildly into the telephone in euphoria and disbelief so when he did the dursleys all jumped in unison the lights downstairs all shook a little as did dudley floor and remus gasped in shock harry harry are you all righ am i all right remus are you joking you actually got it do you suppose your relatives would be terribly upset if i picked you up next week upset they d be thrilled count on me on saturday then oh that only two days i ll be ready tomorrow if you want me to be remus laughed hardly i still have things to pick up and a refrigerator to clean out and dumbledore d pull out right now if he saw the state the living room in there socks all over the place i was trying to match them all up but i couldntfind all the mates and so now the sofa looks like a clotheshorse you donteven want to begin thinking about the dishes i ve got i haventbeen home much except to eat so that all got to be done no monday would be even better if you thought you could stay until then boy harry groaned i ve got to go remus the inquisition after me he added wryly i ll see you monday then harry try to behave yourself or at least dontget caught when you dontbehave or i d have to punish you first off as soon as you got here and i wouldntappreciate that boy right bye remus goodbye harry i ll see you on monday in a small flat in london remus lupin grinned as though he d just lost fifteen years off his age it would be so good to have someone around again to laugh with you re going where to london uncle vernon i living with a member of the order remus lupin he one of sirius friends harry broke off he really didntwant to think about that right now and how are you getting to london boy err harry hadntthought about that well remus is picking me up but i dontknow actually if he blows up the fireplace boy you wontbe going anywhere do you understand me yes uncle vernon but inwardly harry cheered he was leaving privet drive for good this time liner notes i feeling quite inspired today so there will be two chapters put out today and i said this or that would happen at this or that time if i didntget another mega chapter well this was turning into a mega chapter so the reveal will be in the other chapter coming out today i wontmake you wait any longer than it takes me to type it up i promise not this one i will make it worth your wait though i really will it only that a friend of mine asked why remus and harry never discussed sirius and i realized you know what she right they should so the first part of this chapter spawned from that disclaimer someone actually emailed me after my i am jkr disclaimer to ask if i really was j k rowling i serious the disclaimer was sarcasm people i ll be glad to sign your book but it not going to up the value any archiving see chapter 1 please rating this is rated pg 13 t for direct homosexuality mild kissing mention of male male relationship a guy wearing makeup see the reference notes at the bottom before backing up because you think it squickable it probably notwhat you re thinking vague discussion of naked people or rather posters thereof and general maturity of the content matter in other words amigos it not all balloons and rainbows reviews yulara on the contrary severus would remember the marauders awful pranks and taunts without realizing on a conscious level that remus wasnta part of it so yes he would probably think of remus as being vicious though not necessarily in a blood and gore sense harry did exactly what i would do in that situation there are times when letting someone down gently just isntthe right approach if harry had said maybe you should then remus never would have and the chapter would cease to exist sometimes you just have to hit someone over the head with a two by four to make them listen to sense and as to lotr i ve tried four times to read the hobbit and every time i try i fall asleep at the same part when the hobbits are camping in the giants camp it took me three hours to get to that point to give you an idea why this is significant i read order of the phoenix all 800 some pages of it in less than six hours so i have very good reason to not like lotr it a sedative update i finally finished the hobbit by j r r tolkien and am now about 20 pages into the first book of the lord of the rings the hobbit wasnthorrible once i re read it and gollum rules but it never going to trump good ol remus enjoy remus and harry spent eight days in a nervous state remus more so than harry as he had more riding on nate answer than he was willing to admit so now he was sitting in the large living room window staring out at the starry night sky 1 and brooding he wasntsure how long he d been sitting there but he suddenly felt himself enveloped in a slightly childish and awkward hug and leaned backward instinctively still half engaged in the memories he d been sorting through harry almost fell over from the added weight so he sat down on the window ledge i was worried about you you ve been sitting here so long i wasnteven entirely sure you were still alive remus shook himself out of his trance sorry how long have i been here three and a half hours the werewolf sighed i was only thinking it almost exactly like the night sirius and your father found out about well i suppose i really found out too about you being a werewolf remus shook his head gay or resident queer which sirius insisted on teasing me with for the next month he seemed to find it the height of hilarity to pin a poster of a naked man next to my bed it took me almost four hours to get the stupid thing off it kept reattaching itself apparently jokes like that never quite go out of style in seventh year your father woke me up at three o clock in the morning to beg me to switch beds with him for the night because apparently sirius found an audio poster of some pinup girl and she kept laughing because james was sleeping in his underwear i didnthave it too much better but i was always the best at charms so it wasnttoo hard to shut her up oh harry laughed softly at the sudden digression in the path of remus thoughts andscooted further into the window his legs were falling asleep and suddenly a wide yet wistful grin broke over his face remus hadnttalked about sirius even once except that single mention atking cross since since the bad night harry pushed the thought away from himself and remus brooding only went to show him how little he really knew about his godfather maybe he could get some answers while remus was in this odd dreamy mood care to share remus grinned a little and shook his head terribly persistent arentyou he teased then leaned his head against harry shoulder while he tried to sort out the beginning of memory there was so much entangled with everything else the way that life does that he couldntbe entirely certain what harry would or wouldntknow finally he chose a thread well first you have to understand that although it not very often done people fromall houses are allowed in the common room of any other house it used to be much less rare a lot changed since i was in school i imagine the war had something to do with that and when we were in fifth year we all all the boys in the tower i mean there were seven of us got conned into a game of truth or dare with the girls and a bunch of kids from ravenclaw i think there were a few hufflepuffs in there too and i know lucius malfoy youngersiblings were there there were two of them fraternal twins boy and girl but that beside the point the point really is that i d only ever kissed your mother on the cheek before and never anybody else well except family but that different in any way and that where the whole thing started truth or dare moony er remus looked nervously around the loose grouping of friends sitting on chairs rugs the sofa and the floor before answering truth i guess okay and you re not allowed to ask anything overly personal lil s remember that i dontneed people asking if i have bunny rabbits on my underwear or something like that the sheep question 2 was bad enough oh i ll remember lily evans grinned at him mischievously from the floor and remus made a mental note to make her kiss james or at least to dare james to kiss her hand before the game was over who do you have a crush on erm remus thought about that one well nobody actually right now ah that a boring answer make him do a dare evans james all but howled indignantly from his bean bag by the fire unfortunately remus idea wasntas original a dare as he had thought kiss sirius are you out of your mind lily on the mouth james hooted as sirius and remus both adopted panic stricken looks i not kissing him i dontknow where his mouth been nowhere particularly dirty since i brushed my teeth this morning moony sirius replied sounding quite put out suddenly the reality of his friend predicament hit him full force and he almost doubled over in laughter what so funny remus demanded only only you ve never kissed anybody before have you moony remus turned a rather becoming shade of red there nothing wrong with that he answered defensively oh no there nothing wrong with it only that you haventbeen visited by the spark monster the what remus didntcare too much for conversation about monsters if you see sparks when you get your first kiss it means you re going to lose your virginity within a year remus sputtered indignantly you honestly i no i not kissing my best friend lily and i already answered a question which was vetoed as too boring an answer james injected you re stuck moony and i suppose you honestly believe in this spark demon thing spark monster and yes i do sirius face broke into a downright evil grin it works remus blushed even more heavily finally feeling extraordinarily trapped remus swung himself forward on his arms and kissed the corner of sirius mouth his eyes grew wide for several silent seconds then he scrambled to his feet stared around the circle and ran out of the room and i ran off like a scared rabbit that answer your question harry just about died laughing and and did you see sparks what do you suppose i took off for i was appalled bit homophobic not really just never really thought i could be one you know yeah i guess so so this spark monster thing i never figured out if it was true or not why not well because i fell just outside the one year time limit harry groaned trust remus to not be an amusing and typical victim of a secondary school maybe myth it was like the god of lake hogsmeade story nobody d ever actually been pulled into the lake by an angry mer god but the legend persisted remus grinned mischievously at harry more than you cared to know i was just thinking it was a bloody shame you didntfall under the so called curse remus laughed sirius and your dad both said that suddenly harry who had slouched into a lounging position sat bolt upright you never went out with sirius did you as in in a romantic way or at all harry nodded remus laughed at that well we went to the graduation ball together but that was only because i couldntfind a date my choices were pretty limited to begin with and sirius absolutely refused to let me stay in the tower or to go alone but we went as friends nothing more than that i think at one point he might have been somewhat interested but it would have been too much like oh i dontknow sleeping with my own brother or something probably something close to how you d feel if somebody tried to set you up with ron or hermione oh would it bother you if we had dated in a romantic way harry considered i guess not but it d be an awful lot to swallow all at one time you know oh believe me harry i know he grinned suddenly you know i would ve loved to see the look on his face when he came into the kitchen and saw your o w l scores harry smiled a bit automatically but remus put a quick stop to that the ones we love never really leave us harry and i know he was here that night even if we couldntsee him even if he normally exists on another plane now how do you know i put your o w l s back in the envelope and we went to bed remember harry nodded when i came out in the morning to start breakfast they were sitting in a row on the table and the envelope was missing and i can assure you there was nobody else in the flat that night the door was locked you re putting me on harry protested i would do no such thing harry potter and you ought to know better by now i rather fancy it would have been sirius idea of a right joke leaving me to go crazy over a disappearing envelope he enjoyed doing things like that i wanted to keep it so you d have it i still have mine because i didntwant to lose the score summary but it was gone summary sheet and all the only thing left was the part he would have wanted you to keep the certificates i sure of that i still have the book with sirius certificates in it somewhere he refused flat out to keep the rest he wanted you to remember the important things that was one of the last things he ever said to me that made any kind of real sense to the general populace instead of meaning something to only sirius himself somewhere inside harry began to heal it was just when remus had finally resigned himself to the fact that he would probably not be hearing from nate again that he awoke to the tap of claws against the bedroom window and when he peered out into the half lit dawn sky he saw black and a flash of white looking back remus would say that he had never moved so fast to open the window and get the answers he d been craving for more than a week dear r my you arentthe only one having writing troubles i did as you suggested and seriously thought about this answer before giving it or even setting a quill to paper but it was extremely difficult to do so the only answer i find myself able to come up with is that to be truly honest i dontknow what to say i have always had one picture of werewolves based off those that i have met and what i ve read in books and the newspapers you certainly do not fit that image but i not sure whether or not i would still want to pursue this you ve shown me that perhaps i not always in the absolute right but i really not sure what to think to be perfectly honest i feel i d rather make a more informed decision would you care to meet sometime name a place if you d like to meet we both live in london and i can get almost anywhere in the city provided i donthave to guard myself against overeager courtesans always nate remus stared in shock remus tipped his head back and forced his eyeball down so he could still see into the mirror as he lined the bottom of his eye with kohl and eye pencil one of these days i going to go get major cosmetic surgery and i wonthave to do this anymore wontthat be wonderful harry harry just shook his head from where he was sitting but your face still wouldntshow up on stage if you didntput on makeup 3 so you d be defeating the purpose remus gave a sort of half nod to the side i suppose you ve got a point he conceded as he covered his eyelids in some kind of lighter than flesh tone liquid that seemed to double the size of his eyes one nice thing all this gel and liquid makeup is a lot easier to use than what i was stuck with when i first started doing things like this back then powder makeup and stick makeup were the only kinds that existed other than pancake and greasepaint but those have been around for a few hundred years 4 and i wasntaiming to look like a clown harry heard the unvoiced and subtle question you look fine remus remus played nervously with his earring another acquisition he d added himself when he was fifteen or so do you think so really absolutely you ll tell me about him when you get home right of course remus paused and then burst out with another question you dontthink it was a bad idea do you harry to ask him to meet me between sets harry grinned approvingly absolutely not it the best thing you could do assuming he actuallysome crazy bloodthirsty maniac i dontbelieve that but pretend for a minute that maybe it true then you re in a public place surrounded by people and there are people you have to account to if you dontshow up they ll come looking for you you re meeting him casually instead of some formal thing right off so it wontbe as awkward and if he been around for any of the show you ll have something to start off a conversation with it a great idea remus grinned too but his grin was anxious and quickly faltered i hope you re right i know i right you need to get going you only have an hour to be there and you always say you like to be there as early as you can remus nodded not quite sure what to say and stood up dontwait up harry i won t and you know the rules when i not no open flames no using the phone for long distance or superlong calls you ll call at ten there money on the kitchen table if i want to go down around the corner to eat dontbe out after eight and if anybody comes around make sure i know who at the door for absolute certain before opening it right wish me luck all the luck in the world harry hugged his guardian briefly but tightly and handed him the car keys when are you going to be home i dontknow i ll be here in the morning okay remus shut the door reference notes 1 i inserted this to make my 10th grade english teacher mr jenkins happy even though i not in his class anymore he was my favorite english teacher and actually encouraged us to study harry potter for literary value which is how i started writing harry potter fanfiction stars in literature are a symbol of hope and a positive outlook or that things are looking up winter stars can mean death but summer stars like these are often a sign of good things to come just thought y all might like to know the origin of this phrase which did not exist in the notebook form draft of this chapter 2 this is a pun joke shared by alicia and i alicia is the proud owner of a bedroom set with sheep on it and a matching pair of pajamas i was teasing her little brother nicely considering he a little squirt we get along pretty well about wearing one of alicia old shirts or something like that when the idea of remus in alicia pajamas popped into my head for no real reason along with an amusing pun onan old cliche a wolf in sheep clothing the sheep question would probably be arather embarrassing question as to where he got them etc i envision them as hand me downs from his sister catherine 3 this is true heavy makeup is a must when performing onstage even if you re male because stage lights tend to wash out your complexion and make you look sickly and blurred think old polaroid photo here remus is not secretly a drag queen he just knows the true professional tricks of the trade 4 someone in my math class tried to argue this with me but it is very definitely true greasepaint has been around for a long long time blackface the form of makeup used by 19th century and earlier performers to play othello and other black characters onstage is a form of greasepaint liner notes here the second chapter of the day enjoy but dontskip ahead to the reveal let it come as it will 3 june 2005 update i didntwant to refer to nate as nate in this chapter when i revised it date given so there are some places where things like he nate thought that he remus didntknow just how good he remus really was and that kind of thing if you re not sure who who dontagonize over it it will be easiest to tell if you remember that the section in question is written entirely from mystery man pov so he thought actions will be nate and he did actions what nate is seeing will be remus there is one sentence i believe it the very last one in the section that could apply to either or both nate and or remus so interpret it as you like my personal favorite interpretation of it is that it is both of them but any of the interpretations will work fine disclaimer i back in the fuzzy blue bathrobe amigos no i dontownharry potter but i do own most of the band sinelle draconn is the creation of the wonderful eleonora1 who also provided me with the name jason tych for the drummer and raven knight is well she kinda me as i wish i were only she still has the long legs from hell i hate my legs or at least i like the way they look but i hate the inconvenience of them consider raven a sort of parody of me at my baddest bad girl self archiving see chapter 1 rating this is rated pg 13 t for language homosexuality mild drinking and general maturity of content matter dontlike dontread reviews tiffany i glad you like it enjoy the reveal buried somewhere in this chapter enjoy the band wasnttoo bad he thought he d been here since nine thirty about an hour and a half after they would have started it meant sitting through a good deal of music he didntparticularly like but he made a habit of trying to be early for everything for one and for another he was curious r my enjoyed his music that much was certain and he wanted to see where the appeal came from he d been told to look for the blonde guitar player 1 in the red shirt but as luck would have it both guitar players one was playing bass actually buthe didntknow enough about guitars to know which it was were blonde and both were wearing red shirts it didnttake him long to sort them out though because after they finished the number they were playing and the girl behind the keyboard let out the last quivering bit of vocals the members all started to banter it started with the bigger of the two guitar players a man about 5 10 or so but beefy walking over to the smaller one no taller than 5 4 and weighing probably all of about 140 pounds soaking wet and draping an arm around the smaller one shoulders in an extremely familiar manner the smaller one who incidentally looked somewhat familiar ifonly he could determine where he d seen him before carefully picked the larger one arm off his shoulders and lowered it with exaggerated care back to the bigger one side saying sonny i believe we have a rule dontwe about hands the patrons of the bar all laughed r my had said they played this place the night shift every other friday and a good deal of the people seemed to be regulars they probably saw something like this every time the group was in here it seemed to come naturally to the people onstage oh yes of course but that wasnta hand r my so r my was the smaller one then that was an arm more laughter really sonny i think you re a great person you beat hell on a guitar and you re a pleasant drunk but i really have something against having sex with someone who looks like a younger version of my dad i mean maybe that just me you know that could be a big craze these days i wouldntknow but r my trailed off allowing the crowd guffaws to cover whatever he wasntsaying i only eight months older than you r my closed his eyes took a deep breath let it out opened his eyes and very slowly breathed sonny he was good at getting these people going wasnthe sonny i know you re only eight months older than me but i really not interested go bother jason he added patting sonny on the arm and picking his guitar back up off its stand as he did so the lead female vocalist a girl with shiny black hair down to her waist and legs thatthe man in blacksecretly thought would look less out of place on ahairless acromantula half skipped over to r my making an exaggerated production out of it she was good at pulling in the laughs too it seemed and leaned her arms on his shoulder and her head on her arms r my turned his head toward her looking bemused as she asked him in a voice obviously hussied up for the purpose does this mean i get a chance then r my r my just raised his eyebrows and set his guitar back on the stand to his left still looking bemused pausing for a moment and folding his arms before answering have you had any serious operations lately raven again he paused for his laughs most of which were coming from the peoplehe had assumed to be regulars as the chuckles died off remy stepped back eyed the black haired girl very closely up and down walked all round her and then slapped the front of her thigh playfully the girl jumped and let out a startled and extraordinarily girlish squeak remy shook his head apparently i can still tell without looking definitely female remy announced more laughs and one man from a front table whistled at the stage remy raised a hand in a sort of casual half wave of acknowlegement so it was no secret around here that r my was gay that was a good thing he had been getting nervous about what people would think seeing two men sitting together alone at a table deep in some kind of obviously intimate conversation so far as he knew this was r my only paying job andit wouldntbe good for himto lose it as the laughter died down he turned away from his drink and peeredtoward the stage again so unfortunately for you no raven pouted the girl behind the keyboard called out so r my howzabout them bulls huh the regulars fairly roared with laughter apparently this was some kind of inside joke whose answerhe wouldntget tonight r my threw his hands up and raised his eyes skyward what is this hit on the lead guitarist day or something like that the laughter continued andhe reflected momentarily on how easy it was to amuse a crowd of drunks and how amusing it was to watch drunks being amused when you werentone of the drunks in question r my reshouldered his guitar and sidled up to a microphone so this next number this is one we actually did because when we came up with the idea to cover it have you ever had one of those you know crazy ideas that sounds really good when you re buzzed and it one o clock in the morning it was one of those ideas and if anybody had told me then how bloody difficult it would be to learn it i would ve said no i would ve said i just wouldnthave said anything i wouldnthave done it i just wouldnthave done it but i did like a complete idiot i said i d learn it and i did and we all did so this is really fantastic even if it a real dog to play so let just get on the bloody number why dontwe sonny where my beer most of the patrons laughed as he rather dramaticallytook a swig from the bottle he was passed and r my gave everyone a look of overexaggerated wide eyed innocence as he passed it back what it still my first bloody beer all night and we ve been here almost two bloody hours see and that my idea of going to a bar one or two drinks in six hours that why i can still do this he started a loop on the guitar 2 scattered applause accompanied this it seemed it wasnta number they played very often by the murmurs that floated for a few did something he very rarely allowed himself to do and lost himself completely in the skilful blend of music and voice when the song was over r my stepped back from the mike and raven voice took over from the other floor stand all right it ten o clock people applause and whistles we ll be back at eleven until then we ve got sinelle draconn on keyboards and backup jason tych on drums remus lupin on lead guitar and vocals sonny barton on bass guitar i raven knight and we re the irregulars the applause picked up and then died down as the five irregulars trooped off the stage and off in separate directions buthe saw none of it all he could think of werefive words over and over remus lupin it cantbe remus hurried back up toward the stage as he left the pay phones harry was watching a movie and planned on going to bed as soon as it was over now remus had someone to meet he moved hastily toward the table he d indicated to nate in his letter he saw a black haired head bent down far lower than if he d merely been drinking and remus was confused for a split second until he saw the edge of the book beneath the man arm he chuckled softly yes this must be nate he moved almost directly behind the man and studied him from behind for just a moment tall and thin with a black braid dangling down between his shoulder blades pale skin and remus grinned to himself long thin hands so he d been right excuse me are you nate the man didntlook up i am there was only a momentary pause before he continued tell me did you plan this whole thing out all this time or are some distant gods laughing at me remus moved behind the seat next to nate preparing to sit down what do you mean did i plan this out i only just got off just now i know that the voice was clipped strained but not entirely cold if anything nate sounded somewhat confused i was referring the whole thing the letters the whole personality in them was this all just a joke remus was stunned not at all never why would you think that the dark head lifted turned and remus lips parted in complete shock large dark eyes italian nose and cheekbones long neck not now covered by a collar two rogue locks of thick black hair falling over the left side of the face it couldntbe the odds were next to impossible but not entirely impossible it seemed suddenly remus understood why this man would have left laughing gods as an option it seemed the gods were laughing at him too how else could he explain the fact that he was currently looking directly into the eyes of none other than severus snape yes this was the original ending of the reveal or very close to it just a few style changes no characters have been changed or switched around laughs evilly see how hard i work to keep my plotlines secret even if i dontsucceed next chapter the pair talk and come to a conclusion but only i know if it ll be the last chapter with the two going their separate ways or if it might blossom into something wonderful and i not telling no matter how many times you email me begging for answers reference notes 1 just for the record this would be an electric guitar whether or not remus plays acoustic guitar is something i ve not yet decided 2 the song i have in mind here is wish you were here by pink floyd because it a bit slow in the beginning it harder to play and keep in tune i dontknow why exactly this song seemed to fit but it did in some ways it could be interpreted as harry and remus wishing sirius were around so maybe i drew off that i honestly dontknow liner notes no random notes for once at least i dontthink disclaimer at this moment every single thing i am wearing is secondhand i sincerely doubt it mine archiving see chapter 1 please rating this chapter is rated pg 13 for homosexuality and language reviews yulara remus will explain to some extent why severus would not have recognized him onstage but there is another reason that you can find in chapter 5 the crow it listed on here as chapter six because of the interlude which i do not number in addition it quite likely that the bar being a typical bar would be full of cigarette smoke which would also toy with severus vision tiffany severus did indeed know that harry potter had become the legal ward of remus lupin but remember that the person severus is writing to is called r my remus will answer your question both of them actually this chapter as well eleonora1 well as you know raven is my version of a self insert she me as i wish i really were i do have the long legs from hell believe me they are you dontknow torture until you re a long legged girl trying to squeeze into one of those car things at an amusement park i cantplay dodge em cars anymore because my legs are too long but my hair is very short and blonde the idea behind the spark monster is merely a name and a theory sirius explains the entire concept if i can fit in a mention of remus first lover i ll certainly do that for you but the next few chapters are very full an explanation of remus family school shopping revealing nate true identity to ron and hermione and the return to hogwarts and a few surprises waiting there you might have to wait a bit to find out who it was sorry to the siri remy fangirls it wontbe our lovable padfoot in fact i ll have to figure it out myself i never thought about it before you asked remus hair in my mind is a sandy light blonde much like my own before i dyed it i now a proud honey blonde he is certainly not a brunette i have never been able to picture him as one not since the very first time i read prisoner of azkaban i defer to jkr on most things but on this one sorry hon he shoulda been blonde and blonde is the unisex spelling here in the states so i not going to worry about genders and things like that the pen would actually be remus pen notice that what he usually uses he just had it in harry desk probably to keep it from getting lost in his own chaos and i think that answers all your questions character inserts it not often that i do self inserts or real life inserts but there are three of them in this chapter and the past one raven is loosely based off myself though i am not a gorgeous black haired thirty year old no i a sixteen year old version of luna lovegood minus the silver eyes sinelle draconn is the wonderful eleonora1 my most faithful reviewer yes she ll show up again though not in a major way i dontthink and alicia the chestnut haired waitress is my best friend alicia who correctly guessed the challenge posted in the first chapter and thus earned a write in enjoy remus mouthed soundlessly his vocal chords seemed to have disappeared taking his brain right along with them finally he managed to come out with do you mind if i sit down severus shook his head and remus pulled out the chair next to him a waitress with chestnut hair and a tiny frame moved up to the table hello there i alicia i ll be serving you tonight would you like anything remus considered just water thanks severus held up his glass and the slightly freckly barmaid took it as she slipped easily away through the smoke and the crowd severus raised his eyebrows i didntknow you could play guitar remus played nervously with his hands there probably a lot you dontknow about me i could say the same for you severus almost but not quite snorted the sound was more like a mmm than anything else so were they real remus had been staring broodingly at the table next to them without really seeing it at all he swiveled his head back around quickly hmm i said were they real lupin so we re back on a last name basis already are we remus paused and furrowed his brow were what real the letters or was that just some kind of twisted jest on your part they i still cantbelieve it you i should have spotted it as soon as you told me you were a teacher or by the things you said you were reading or cut the rant lupin and answer the question it wasnta joke at least i didntthink it was i knew there had to be another shoe dropping somewhere alicia the waitress returned and set down remus water and whatever was in severus glass do you want anything else for now i can go get it now both men shook their heads as she left again severus began speaking so you really do play piano and read the classics everything you said was true everything except the fact that almost everyone calls me r my it occurred to me after i sent that letter that it really only my muggle friends and the witches and wizards i met through that part of my social circle who call me that i suppose i stretched it a bit severus waved aside the semantics with a gesture remus had seen him use quite often as a student as though he were lazily clearing smoke from in front of his face and then took a drink of the mysterious substance in the glass i was referring to the things we talked about all true suddenly with the air of a man putting two and two and two and two together to get eight severus stared directly at remus so hard that remus began to squirm then harry is yes that harry severus shook his head in self disgust forget you recognizing me how did i not recognize you especially tonight i didnt have any idea who you were until that black haired girl said your name remus considered for a moment before answering it not too surprising really i never gave you any definites to go on i never told you i d been a teacher i gave you a rough date for harry birthday that could put it any time between july 26th and august 7th you never knew my last name tonight you d probably call me a drag queen if you had any idea how much makeup i have on so people can actually see in the back stage lights have a tendency to distort things i dontnormally dress like this and let be honest severus what do we really know about each other i almost guarantee it never occurred to you that i dontstill live with my parents and i d have been the last person to peg you as a classical music lover there was a long pause before severus answer i suppose we dontreally know that much remus remus grinned shyly and blushed although the heavy foundation he was wearing concealed it tipping his head down toward his water glass severus nodded at it i cantbelieve you dontwant anything stronger than that remus eyed the glass with a slight expression of distaste i d love something stronger but if i get drunk now i wontbe able to play when i have to go back on beside which i a terrible drunk as though it had been some sort of secret cue sinelle the keyboard player slipped up to the table remus phone message for you remus reached for the slip of paper she held out to him and read it we need milk and bread he shook his head milk and bread you d think he d go to the corner store for that it only a block away from the flat severus processed the statement before inquiring did he like that book remus smiled widely he hardly put it down since he got it for the first time since remus had known him severus looked truly gratified i glad he is enjoying it remus suddenly looked uncomfortable severus i dont i mean severus looked at remus sharply you re still concerned over this he pulled a slip of paper out of his book and pushed it across the table remus recognized it as the letter he d sent to nate suggesting they meet here tonight and informing him in response to the postscript at the end of nate s letter that dinner was broccoli chicken well yes severus let out a hefty sigh you say you wrote those letters honestly i say i am interested in knowing more about the person who wrote them you ask what we know about each other honestly i answer that we cantknow that much my main goal tonight was to meet you and determine what i truly thought of you therefore i see no problem except that you despise the air i breathe i came here with an open mind i intend to keep it that way your true identity does not affect that fact in the slightest remus looked down and caught sight of severus book what that you re reading severus flipped it over to show the front cover lord of the flies remus shuddered i never could finish that book i got to the point where simon ran into the beast and when they started talking about the flies all over that pi severus interrupted him donttell me i not that far into it yet which reminds me i believe this is yours he took another small volume out of his pocket and handed it to remus you lent it to me when i said i couldntfind a copy remus grinned slightly as he slid it into his own pocket what did you think of it it was fairly well written for a muggle vampire story 1 i simply couldntbelieve it when the older one died i honestly thought he d make it through whatever happened to the priest father callahan severus nodded i dontknow you never find out he needs to write another remus grinned stephen king has written many books but i believe that the only one about vampires severus looked intrigued what kind of books contemporary fiction horror mostly although almost all of his stories are quite good misery was positively fantastic it about an author who kidnapped by a crazy woman who claims to be his biggest fan and she makes him write a story for her does he write about that kind of thing often remus shook his head almost all of his books are very different take the talisman a boy has to travel between two worlds to save his mother i think and the running man is about a man who joins a reality television show it was actually written long before reality television was created where you have to run for thirty days because you re running from these people who are looking to kill you so it mostly science fiction not really horror fiction some is plausible but most at least to the muggles isn t i might have to look for more of his expected who would live and who would die in that one dontbother i ve got the whole collection you can borrow any of them anytime again severus looked quite pleased remus smiled to himself maybe he could just make this work remus slipped in the front door only to be confronted by apositively furiousharry potter where the hell have you been remus it almost seven o clock in the morning remus tossed his coat onto a chair not even bothering to consider hanging it up and pulled the spectacled boy into a tight hug i take it you had a good time tell me you didntstay over at his house already remus shook his head letting go of harry and drifting into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea no i met him between sets and then went back and played we ended up staying the band i mean until two and he was waiting when i got off again we had a drink and talked for awhile and when the bar closed around three we went for a walk down in the park and then he went home and i was too keyed up to sleep so i just went down by the thames and i ve been walking there ever since just thinking about everything harry stared you walked around for four hours remus just looked at him slightly confused what time is it i told you it almost seven o clock i couldntsleep either so i got up and started reading and i was waiting for you to come home you scared the hell out of me watch your language harry harry rolled his eyes but you had fun it was fantastic harry sat down at the table with a glass of milk as remus did the same adding sugar to his tea so tell me about him now here came the part remus had been dreading maybe he could skip it well there not much to tell really he wasnt exactly as i expected him to be but he was still quite nice come on remus spill what he look like what did you talk about where does he live stop beating around the bush remus took a deep breath you re not going to like this harry what is it he married or something right no harry it severus remus blurted out harry stared at him you mean snape how many other severuses do we know harry gaped in unadulterated horror you cantbe serious i am and you you enjoyed yourself remus sipped his tea somewhat more calmly than he had come in the door absolutely i think the fact that i was honest and upfront in my last letter to him as you suggested removed a lot of the animosity he felt toward me me as remus i mean he even said so when we were talking that it must have taken a good deal of nerve to stand up and admit to being a werewolf when i didnteven know the full name of the person i was telling harry was reeling i cantbelieve you really i mean he actually are you meeting him again he finally demanded remus nodded next wednesday we re going to lunch and then he wants to meet you if harry had been horrified before there were no words for what he felt now meet me yes you harry to paraphrase what severus said if he misestimated me then perhaps he done the same to you i cantbelieve this believe it harry we still have no idea where we re going with this but at the very least it ll be a good deal more pleasant for all three of us going back to hogwarts with a bit of an understanding if nothing else remus stood if you dontmind i d like to lie down for an hour or two it took long enough but i think all the walking finally got to me harry got up from his seat i ll join you i exhausted harry fell asleep almost instantly propelled not only by his all night vigil but by limp relief as well remus however took longer surreal things had a tendency to do that to him reference notes 1 salem lot by stephen king i ve tried not to give away any plot points in case you care to read it it quite a good book but as my copy is in rather battered condition poor book it was a first edition too i have only ever been able to find copies of it at secondhand bookstores and once for about a week in a grocery store i playing off the idea that it would be even harder to find overseas liner notes it 11 20 at night and i have school tomorrow so i ll do the fine editing like turning all the quotes marks so they face the right direction tomorrow when i get home for now here is the next chapter it is somewhat short and does not develop the remus severus relationship any but it explains some very important things like the ages of remus siblings and why he was so persistent in getting harry away from the dursleys i very proud of myself for this chapter know all of you that it been 3 months and 4 drafts in the writing update editing has been done and i ve got chapter 13 open typing it right now in word enjoy disclaimer well the bathrobe isntsecondhand nor are the slippers but i still donthave the hair extensions nope not mine the adoption charm is a device used by eleonora1 who is aware that i am using it and has given her permission for me to do so kudos sinelle giggles rating this chapter is rated pg 13 t for potentially interpreted emotional child abuse and discussion of violence reviews tiffany glad you liked it this chapter is quite low on giggles but does have a lot of plot yulara ditto to tiffany this one again really doesnthave any bubbly one liners but i think you ll like it i know eleonora1 will love it because well see the disclaimers eleonora1 oh boy it the marathon reviewer well severus should have put two and two together but it sort of a wishful thinking thing there no way in a million years it him no it just some coincidence i can sleep tonight i do that a lot to keep from going crazy ha like there anything to prevent remus wouldnthave had as easy a time especially with the natasha throwoff who in the name of merlin would expect severus natasha snape to pop up unless you read my work quite frequently then you know to expect anything the cemetary book is called pet sematary and yes it spelt that way on purpose yes harry reaction is one i honed for quite some time for maximum impact glad you enjoyed now have a nice angst fest here nightshade 013 nice new name glad you enjoyed wait till you see the twist in this chapter enjoy everyone and no this is not repeat not the end of the story this chapter just has a strong closing for once harry i leaving and if i have to come back up for you you re not going to be happy it was a very irate remus lupin who was berating harry potter in such a manner because harry was sitting in the bedroom and sulking the three days between the last time he d seen severus and now had passed slowly at least slowly to someone who was looking forward to something like this severus wanted to meet harry on a non scholastic basis and he was supposed to meet the two of them remus and harry in half an hour where theywere going from thereonly remus truly knew severus had some idea having been quite grudgingly talked into it by remus but was completely unfamiliar with the institution in question harry the bedroom door opened with a bang and harry stalked out in blue jeans and a scruffy slightly torn black button down shirt instead of the t shirt remus had lent him remus sighed exasperated harry go get dressed i am dressed you re not leaving the house like that we re going out then i ll stay home you will be coming with me and you will be dressed decently when you do it now go get changed before i make you remus didntoften let his temper get the best of him but he had been known to be a bit short on occasion and this was one of them harry heaved a hefty sigh and retreated returning a few moments later in the blue t shirt remus had left on his bed they were halfway to wherever they were going to meet snape harry didntknow and really didntcare before he decided he ought to apologize he couldntquite bring himself to do it though and so instead he phrased his repentance subtly in a question why did you want me remus hmm remus looked over from where he was sitting staring at a red light i said why did you want me i mean before you became my guardian you didnthave to really work you could bum around if you chose you didnthave to follow the rules you gave all that up for me why remus didntanswer but harry could sense somehow that he was not being ignored rather remus was trying to shape a difficult answer to a difficult question finally he spoke i suppose i should start by admitting that i lied to you harry harry snorted what else isntnew remus smiled slightly bitter no i dontmean like that you remember the picture i showed you of my family harry nodded remus swallowed hard before continuing the people in that picture harry arentactually related to me what remus and everjoice lupin are not really my parents harry just stared at him before sputtering but but you look just like them the blonde shook his head and persisted it was an adoption charm harry my birth name is jeremy christopher moore by genetics i really ought to look like a cross between your cousin dudley and the weasley twins an adoption charm changes the appearance and subtly the character of the person it cast on so they fit in their new family although it cand do so to many different degrees i consider the lupins my real family the moores were nothing more than relatives that the first half of your answer so what the other half remus took a deep breath when you were in third year harry i told you my parents did everything they could for me after i was bitten that was partially true the lupins did everything they could my siblings included my birth parents abandoned me at st mungo how could they do that remus smiled sadly there something called the dissolution of care clause harry when a child is infected by a dark creature the parents may choose to leave their child in a safe place for adoption if they are unable or unwilling to raise a child with special needs it been thirty two years harry but i ve never forgotten the day i was bitten and i ve never forgotten waking up in the hospital alone and scared and hearing my parents in the hall and not understanding why i could hear them when they were so far away and then they walked into the room i remember joan my birth mother was wearing this bright red lipstick and nail polish and i thought how much like blood it looked and she said she was leaving because she wasntgoing to raise some freak of nature harry gaped how could she just do that abandon her child and call you something like that you re not a freak remus shook his head i really dontknow harry but and this is the important part i didntunderstand her words for months it was the look on her face that told me everything i wasntwanted and even at four and a half i was old enough to understand freak that look just killed me inside i was eight years old i d been adopted for nearly two years before i was even able to really function again i was just convinced there wasntreally a point and when i saw your relatives look at you the same way joan moore looked at me like they d rather be anywhere else than meeting you after ten months and they thought we were all a bunch of complete ingrates that just infuriated me i vowed right then that i d kill them all if i had to but you werentspending another month there not another week if i could help it and i d have taken azkaban gladly to get you out of there of all the things that really get to me in this world harry and there arenttoo many the one that really gets me the most is when people are like that when they dontwant one of the most precious things in the world a child who really means the best and wants nothing more than to do right and know he did it that just angers me like nothing else harry stared down at his hands you d have done that for me in a heartbeat something you ought to know right now harry a wolf werewolves too create packs werewolves even do it in their human form it used to drive your father crazy because i never talked about being with a group or having a girlfriend boyfriend i always talked about packs and mates and that kind of thing it not a huge difference but he couldntstand it sirius just made a joke out of it but my main point you ve been part of my pack almost since i met you and you re asking for a very painful death if you ever mess with someone in a wolf pack it one reason werewolves have to register even though it a very serious thing to bite someone there something called a justified attack in addition to punishable attacks justified attacks include being threatened under the influence of a mind control spell or potion and having a close member of the pack severely injured or threatened we protect each other justifiable attacks are fairly rare but registered werewolves have a sort of ministry protection the ministry more fully protects those around werewolves because the consequences of anything happening to a pack member can be quite severe i could have turned the whole lot of your relatives and as long as i could prove justifiable cause i d walk but you still could have gotten in a lot of trouble remus and everjoice risked everything to adopt me even the others all the kids who came after me are adopted even the others all combined didntcause as much trouble and red tape as i did just because of a four inch scar on my neck you caused trouble and red tape because most of the world views you as just the boy who lived but i see you the same way my mum and dad saw me when they first saw me in the orphanage they didntcare about the scar or the transformations or the fact that they were essentially adopting a liability they saw me for just me just a kid looking for love and somebody to take him home and give him different clothes and a real name instead of a ministry issued one i chose to look at you as just harry instead of looking at all the fancy ribbon and packaging i can never return the favor to my mum and dad but i can pass it on the things i lost are small sacrifices compared to the reward i gained by just having you around and knowing you re happy harry which reminds me we have to go shopping for your clothes next week you re not going back to school in those rags harry blushed thanks remus remus ruffled his hair affectionately no problem kid we re here as they pulled into the parking lot of the massive apartment block snape seemingly lived in harry decided to make an effort he couldntreturn the favor but he could pass it on liner notes here is a nice long chapter to make up for the length of time that i wasntwriting i think i ll continue writing in wordpad i donthave to go back and fix all the quotes marks to aim the right way yay as you know this chapter was originally going to be much different but it refused to write so here is the version that i came up with and i would like you all to note my careful use of language from the seventies in the scene with the punk boy as you ll see a few moments after reading that scene there is a very good reason the boy is talking so oddly also i have tried and failed to find a reason why my text keeps running together i really honestly sorry i ve tried reposting different formatting etc and nothing works please forgive the oddnesses of things like remusreplied or butthenhe because i thoroughly check my work before i post it all i can figure is that perhaps it some kind of glitch between the site and my account because i also tried editing from alicia house and had the same results thanks to eleonora1 for drawing the problem to my attention i will continue to see if it can be fixed update 3 june 2005 this problem appears to be fixed crosses fingers in hope but i can make no promises please let me know if it continues to be a problem for you disclaimer clearance clothes secondhand sweater bad case of acne equalsa clear lack of money ergo i am not j k rowling and i dontown it is that my final answer yes that my final answer melody lupin is mine though rating this chapter is rated pg 13 t for language and homosexuality reviews eleonora1 in a word no remus is remus is remus he wontbe changing really the point he was getting across is that he would have been pudgy redheaded full of freckles and a bit of a whiner dudley not too attractive really he much better off as is trust me remus has never been able to really forgive the moores but he is an optimistic dreamer so he doesntreally dwell on it he long since given up the idea that he has to go seek bloody hellbent revenge for what they pulled and i agree with you joan a erm nice mate for padfoot of course lol dog lovers should know what i talking about see aunt marge canthold too much against her husband what was the name i sent you in that timeline mine got deleted dangit though he really doesntwear the pants in their family i actually stole the packs and mates thing from you lol i liked it and i could be wrong but in one of your newer chapters the one where severus is turned into a werewolf that story did you cop my justifiable attacks thing severus attack on that brat seemed quite familiar miss anonymous hp i glad you re liking it so far i feel very bad that i haventbeen able to get anything out my muse went on strike and my plot bunnies well suddenly goes into hermione mode did you know that if you store plot bunnies in an airtight container they die it true it in hogwarts a history yulara also wipes tear love you love remus love severus love your story love updates hint hint not that i any better princess nat i find your name amusing probably for obvious reasons lol anyway i glad you re liking it i found it hilarious that while i tried so hard to keep it a secret i simply couldn t eleonora outed me well then she stuffed severus back in the closet that was a bad bad analogy wasntit anyway she outed me and from that point on i was desperately trying to make it seem like it simply couldntbe him without making my own task justifying each and every single one of his idiosyncracies i e dislike of tolkien any harder all this at a pace of about 3 days between chapters no wonder my muse ran away from me and as always enjoy hurry harry we re going to miss it why didnti put an amplifying charm on the alarm today of all days here now i ll see you on the other side harry make sure you have everything ron bringing hedwig harry nodded at his guardian somewhat overwhelmed by the flow of words good that good remus murmured distractedly disappearing through the gateway to platform nine and three quarters remus had some sort of guard duty on the platform harry turned facing the solid brick partition 1 and began walking purposefully toward it with his trolley he was almost ready to go through when a sulky looking boy with an impossibly long black braid and general gothic style stepped in front of the barrier and then slouched against it hey man woss yer name harry almost groaned aloud he d heard of punks like this boy and he was going to miss the train because of him better to just tell him harry harry what man er potter who are you harry shot back the boy appeared completely unperturbed by harry question man that groovy great year cat he reached out all but forcing harry to give him a high five and as he did harry felt the boy finger the wand hidden in harry sleeve the boy stepped aside and harry hurried through the barrier quite unnerved by the entire exchange harry great to see you mate what new harry was relieved to be back among the familiarity of his friends and he d just begun to answer ron question when remus jumped up in alarm where severus ron who was blissfully oblivious to nate s true identity saw no reason for remus to be so cut up over the missing potions master hey remus raced to the door and threw it open grabbing onto the handle inside the compartment as he did so harry and hermione both peered out the windows while ron just looked confused suddenly harry gasped the punky boy was running down the platform with far more energy than harry would originally have credited him with he saw remus hanging out the door and reached for his guardian shand to keep him from falling right off the train remus grabbed the punkyboy wrist and heaved him up and the next moment hermione slammed the door shut and the pair on the floor rolled off of each other we do seem to be having that problem a good deal lately dontwe severus remus chided he and harry had attempted to teach severus to roller skate an amusing sight if harry had ever seen one and the attempt hadntgone too well harry was too busy gaping at his potions master to pay any mind to thoughts of what had transpired over the last two weeks the seventeen year old boy harry had seen on the other side of the barrier was now stripping off a black and silver nirvana hooded sweatshirt and a garish yellow walkman cd player damned muggle clothes smell likedog shit thebarrier wouldntlet me through did you have any problems with it remus shook his head and ron stared at severus with a look that surpassed hilarity bloody hell that bloke was you professor severus reached back behind his head and very slowly removed several hairpins the knee length braid fell to the floor and he shook loose the tumbled slightly curly locks that had been held fast behind it i always knew this bloody thing would come in useful someday he commented picking the braid up off the floor and beginning to roll it up around his hand and yes mr weasley that bloke was me the headmaster felt it prudent to add extra security this year does your mother know what kind of language comes out of your mouth he fastened the braid in a roll by way of the hairpins handed it to remus who promptly deposited it in the battered suitcase harry remembered from his third year pulled off the white t shirt he d been wearing underneath the sweatshirt and turned it inside out ron stared openly and hermione let out an oh as it turned itself into a black and white button down shirt similar to the ones remus wore as severus finished buttoning it he commented now i feel somewhat human bloody thing he pointed at the sweatshirt the person i borrowed it from doesntseem to believe in washing things the morning hours passed quickly with two new interesting people to talk to in addition to catch up on the summer activities severus seemed much more approachable sans the black robes and wearing blue jeans ron had been stunned at the news that nate had turned out to be severus but he was equally stunned that severus had not recognized remus the redhead felt certain that harry should have been a dead giveaway i never considered the possibility that i was writing to someone i already knew the odds must be simply astronomical mr weasley can you tell me in all honesty that you would have conjectured such a thing ron stared at severus his brows slightly furrowed finally he spoke er conjectured severus snorted impatiently as remus with the dedication of a saint set about trying to explain conjectured without sounding like he was talking to a three year old if you conjecture something ron you re guessing about it only a conjecture is more sophisticated than a guess it more like a deduction dontfeel bad almost every time i try to talk to him i have to go find a dictionary ron just stared openmouthed before trying to answer the original question well i mean a lot of stuff would seem way too weird like harry being his ward right mate harry nodded and stuff like that that you d already know abo bloody hell remus and severus jumped to their feet as the train shivered to a halt hermione whimpered what going on professor remus looked around warily stay in your seat hermione ron harry the door to the compartment slid open all of the compartment occupants half expected a tall shuddering black creature to float into the compartment to terrorize them the five were slightly surprised then to observe the fully human being striding formally through the door harry leapt up tonks what are you doing here he tried to hurry forward to pull the currently black haired auror into a hug but she stepped back her eyes showing no sign of recognition of any of them and she raised her wand sit down harry stared at her mouth agape remus echoed her sit down harry just listen to her everyone he took a step back and followed tonks order severus doing the same harry finally turned around and shuffled back to his seat as a tall thin wizard with severely combed brown hair and cold blue eyes stepped into the compartment he too was wearing the light blue robes of an auror tonks and the man stared around at the five occupants of the carriage before tonks addressed herself to harry full name harry mouth fell open again come on tonks what going on her eyes blazed coldly your full name if you please harry continued to mouth silently for two or three seconds before remus prodded him gently just answer her questions harry erm okay harry james potter then he expected tonks to be satisfied perhaps to start laughing and tell them all that this was some kind of elaborate joke but instead she glanced down at a clipboard that had mysteriously appeared in her hand age school year and family i just turned sixteen i going into sixth year and er family he glanced at remus helplessly they need to know who your parents are and who you re living with harry remus informed him all the time keeping one eye on the wands in the aurors hands er right my parents are were lily and james potter harry paused slightly stunned at the fact that he could answer the question in such a calm and unemotional manner he normally avoided questions and answers involving his parents and remus he gestured to the blonde sitting next to him is my legal guardian i stayed with him this summer tonks nodded then she took four steps forward grabbed harry left wrist and extended his arm she pressed on his forearm through the cloth harry gasped and jerked his other hand toward his forehead tonks brushed his bangs back out of his eyes and stared critically at the scar on his forehead then pulled his sleeve back and carefully examined his arm apparently satisfied with what she saw or didntsee she moved on to question remus in the same manner though instead of asking about his family she inquired as to his address it was only when the metamorphmagus reached the other side of the compartment and examined severus that anything out of the ordinary happened she pressed on his arm and he gasped just as harry had done and pulled his arm away from her in an almost involuntary action jerking his arm back out full length tonks shoved his sleeve up to his elbow and her eyes darkened as she saw the skull and snake just below the crook of his elbow she turned half toward her companion but covered severus with her wand you have anything on severus snape ferrum 2 the brownhaired auror rustled through a large stack of parchment extricated a sheet and slid it on top of the pile he read silently for several moments before looking up harshly at severus it says here that he currently employed by dumbledore he clean tonks stared at severus suspiciously for several moments before releasing his arm and allowing him to roll his sleeve back down then she stepped back and addressed all five of them in accordance with a search ordered for security reasons by the ministry of magic we are required to go through your belongings do any of you have anything on your personthat may be considered a dark object or a potential tool for he who must not be named such as time turners restricted potions or a second wand severus raised his hand slightly and then pulled something out of his shirt front tonks moved back toward him and examined the object which seemed to be on some sort of chain or string around severus neck she cast a dark detection spell on the object and then apparently satisfied nodded at severus who tucked it back beneath his shirt remus leaned toward harry clearly ready to say something but a sharp glare from the auror named ferrum put remus right back in his seat not moving except to raise his own hand tonks looked in his direction and remus offered i have two advanced books on curses for my n e w t classes but i think there may be an illegal spell in one of them that i haventhad the chance to remove tonks nodded at him and then ordered ron harry and hermione to open their trunks remus pulled his suitcase down from the rack and opened it before tonks had a chance to ask him about it she stared hard at severus you have no luggage severus shook his head i moved back up to the school last week so i could prepare the potions classroom for use my presence in london today was only as a member of dumbledore faculty guard a precaution to make sure that only students boarded the train i arrived at six o clock this morning and left on the train obviously tonks stared at him for just a moment more clearly waiting for him to make some kind of guilty movement before she turned back to harry trunk which she was searching after a moment she pulled out his invisibility cloak you didntmention this remus spoke before harry had the chance to i tried to tell him he should say something about it but your partner here remus indicated the auror named ferrum didntwant me speaking to him harry mouthed for only a moment before coming up with an explanation i i sorry i didntknow that i should i mean mention it i didntthink it was important he paused only a moment before adding it belonged to to my dad i got it from dumbledore when i was in first year mydad left it with him or something like that i ve never used it except in school tonks performed the same spell she d performed on severus mysterious object then handed the cloak back to harry the auror named ferrum questioned hermione thoroughly on the spellbooks in her trunk apparently a good deal of them were not required for school and she was carrying them around as extra reading material before nodding ticking something on his paper and closing the lid of her trunk in less than ten minutes he and tonks had finished with the boys trunks and remus suitcase apparently there wasnttoo much of interest in a few pairs of socks and underwear closed them all and glided out the door silently as they had come tonks instructing them to stay in the compartment until the train was again in motion what the bloody hell was that all about ron asked perplexed severus answered him apparently the ministry is searching the train for death eaters it doesntsurprise me it would be quite easy for someone to polyjuice into the form of a student for example and gain entry to the school i was checking wands outside the barrier today but it possible that someone could have got through as a parent i couldntprevent them from going through especially if they had a first or second year student with them and then polyjuiced on the other side of the barrier it not possible remus interjected minerva filius and i were all checking for possible dark activity severus nobody could have worked a switch without one of us noticing well icertainly dohope you re correct remus what the hell severus stared as the compartment door slid open again this time the man framed by the door looked much friendlier but still quite formal and strict everyone fell silent again as he stepped in my name is pascal anion i am a representative of the bureau of dark creature control in the ministry of magic as i am sure you are aware a ministry team is searching this train to ensure the safety and security of the students he paused and glanced at each of them in turn do any of you fall under the classification of a dark creature remus raised his hand and upon receiving a questioning glance he pulled out an id card from his wallet and handed it to the slim darkhaired representative pascal anion raised his eyes from the card to remus and you have a scar or werewolf identification number remus hesitated both but the number not accurate it was changed when i was six at the man nod remus bared his neck showcasing the long crescent shaped scar on the right side for about ten seconds before pulling his robes back up to their proper place and your number remus pulled his robes down slightly revealing a rather intricate bird harry thought it might be a phoenix tattooed just below his collarbone the number is in the feathering i got tired of people asking me why i had a number on my chest so i got permission to cover it pascal anion examined the tattoo minutely before nodding i will of course have to check the number as you state it is no longer current but it appears to be in order remus nodded in understanding as the representative voiced his next question have any of you been marked by a dark creature remus nudged harry elbow that you harry harry stared at him me why me i ve never pascal anion stared at him and harry insides squirmed fortunately remus stepped up for the defense harry is my legal ward i gave him a pack sign before the july full moon as he chose to stay with me instead of with a friend harry jaw dropped you never told me that remus shrugged i didntsee a reason to and if i may inquire why not harry didntsee how remus could stay so calm under a stare like that the man obviously didntmean them any harm but he had the kind of gaze that simply forced you to be unsettled no matter how friendly he seemed i didntthink he d take too kindly to the idea of how a pack mark is formed but i wasntgoing to let him stay the night without one i thought it was an unnecessary risk to take even with the wolfsbane potion pascal anion nodded seeming to understand remus predicament before scribbling something on a sheet of parchment thanking them and leaving about five minutes later the train started up again and they were on their way kline rose marie ravenclaw lancer jordan gryffindor harry stared up at the head table as the sorting continued long and monotonous there had been nineteen people under the letter d alone suddenly remus face lit up and harry turned back to the sorting just in time to hear professor mcgonagall call lupin melody a long pause it stretched on and on and on finally hermione whispered she been sitting there for more than a minute and a half i wonder if something wro gryffindor harry clapped loudly and continued all the way up to the time that melody lupin hurried up and collapsed onto the bench on the side of the table opposite him harry grinned at her congratulations melody smiled at him in the same breathless way he recognized from remus it still stunned him that the two werentactually related thanks the sorting went on and on and on and finally dumbledore stood from his place to make his announcements as zircon melanie was sorted into hufflepuff i have several announcements this year first years should be aware as should all older students by this time that the forest on the grounds is strictly off limits unless you are entering with a teacher and during daylight hours ron harry and hermione all shared startled glances before the forest had been held in strict taboo what had changed secondly we are welcoming back professor lupin as the defense against the dark arts professor almost everyone who had known remus during his last term at the school applauded loudly as did many of the younger students who assumed that if he received such praise from the older students he must be a pretty decent teacher dumbledore motioned for the applause to die down and as it did he continued older students will already know this and so it is to the younger students that i address myself you should all be aware that professor lupin is a werewolf whispering broke out and even dumbledore efforts to quell it did not succeed finally remus stuck his fingers in his mouth and whistled shrilly silence reigned instantly though several students threw their hands over their ears remus whistle wasntparticularly pleasant when he was aiming for volume dumbledore smiled and went on your parents and guardians have all been informed of the fact and i should tell you all that all possible precautions have been taken to prevent any accidents from occurring professor lupin has also requested that i inform you all that he is perfectly willing to answer any questions you may have and to assure you all that his condition will not negatively interfere with your educations remus smiled shyly and harry took his eyes off his guardian to stare at severus who was sitting on remus left severus harry determined was a fantastic actor there was no sign that he d ever known remus in more than a casual professional way he applauded disinterestedly with the rest of the teachers but harry who was watching for such things saw him slip a piece of parchment into remus hand as the headmaster proceeded with his announcements remus unfolded it and began to read blushing scarlet almost immediately harry turned his attention back to dumbledore thirdly as you are probably all aware after the search of the hogwarts express the ministry of magic has requested our cooperation in the war against lord voldemort whispers and shudders again washed over the hall but quickly receded as the headmaster raised his hand aurors have been stationed within the school and i must ask that you show them the utmost respect and that should they request your aid you would be so good as to give it to them i have been assured that their presence will be much more discriminatory than that of the dementors three years ago and that they will not attack or unnecessarily follow any student if you have any questions on the state of affairs within the wizarding community they will also be happy to give you as much information as they can it is only together that we can overcome our problems and win this war another wave of murmurs another request for silence now as i quite sure you re all extraordinarily famished by now tuck in and with that dumbledore sat down food appeared on the plates and the new year at hogwarts had begun reference notes 1 i using the movie version of the train station for this dontkill me i know the book says it metal but somehow i just cantsee it kinda like my feelings on remus with brown hair 2 i raided my chemistry text during a particularly boring class period yesterday our substitute didntknow anything ferrum is the latin old word for iron as in the metal gotta love the periodic table you ll be seeing a lot of chemistry related names popping up in my work from now on i wrote out a whole long list of cool names i can use or adapt for my evil purposes muahahaha liner notes hrm uh um i haventbeen getting any email from my normal penpals and none of my favorite stories have been updated so i hoping maybe with this chapter people will forgive me for the hiatus and start reviewing and such again since i know you re all nice people i still trying to fix the run together text by the way and it seems i not the only one having this problem i ve since seen it in several other stories on here the help email seems to be down too so all we can really do is be patient disclaimer if it was mine remus severus and harry would all live happily ever after and sirius would choose not to interfere but he would be very much alive and happy dumbledore would stop employing tactics he blasts voldemort for using and voldemort would run around in evil pink bunny ears you cantbe a true villian unless you have some of that ultimate epitome of evilness pink runs away from screaming barbie fans rating this chapter is rated pg 13 t for language mild violence verbal abuse and moderate homosexuality rating note i ve determined this probably wontgo past pg 13 i prefer implied scenes to directly stated ones as you ll see at the end of this chapter i hope i wasnt too nonspecific there let me know if you dontget it i was considering rewriting it but i wanted to get this out today and i definitely no good at writing sex scenes so we re probably as high as we re going to go i ll continue to post a rating however as some warnings i e violence language and so on will vary from chapter to chapter reviews summer oh no now i have to start putting that any resemblance to real persons locales or events is unintended and entirely coincidental warning in my disclaimers i made up the name joan moore from one of my favorite sources the combining of two or three as in the case of remus birth name people who are completely unrelated in this case the two people in question were joanie a woman my aunt knows and a girl named c moore who goes to my school name removed for privacy it saves me the trouble of trying to come up with names all on my own i glad you re liking it so far and i hope you continue to enjoy it as always this story is dedicated to eleonora1 and immortalflick would you update unwanted or improper already and my best friend alicia enjoy haruka lune bloody hell mate i pity you you ve got snape almost all bloody day harry swallowed his biteful of toast and marmalade to ask ron just exactly what he meant by that then he saw his schedule and almost died there was a reason he supposed that tuesdays 1 were rapidly becoming his least favorite day nine o clock n e w t potions doubled professor snape eleven fifteen potions theory professor snape twelve fifteen to one lunch one o clock n e w t defense against the dark arts doubled professor lupin and at three fifteen dark arts doubled with professor snape that didntlook quite right but he had ten minutes to get down to the dungeons for an entire morning with his least favorite teacher who would have no qualms about taking every point gryffindor currently had harry decided he d better get moving harry arrived to class almost 20 minutes late but this could hardly be counted as his fault peeves had stolen his bag hung it from a rather tall statue and when harry after much undignified jumping and reaching had finally got it down it had caught on the statue hands and ripped he d spent the next fifteen minutes scrambling after quills and ink bottles and books and parchment and his wand which he d put in his bag he wouldntneed it after all since he was going to potions then he d discovered his copy of accelerated brews serums and potions the required text for n e w t potions was missing and he d been forced to hunt down peeves who wasnthiding particularly successfully luckily to retrieve the book of course peeves wasntabout to just give it up in another lucky stroke however they happened to be in the upper levels of the dungeons and with the aid of the bloody baron harry was quickly on his way to class unfortunately he d made the decision to run in the vain hope that he d get to class on time and he d been caught by filch who promptly escorted harry to the caretaker office harry d finally begged filch to just give him detention because he was late for class and had reiterated the entire story at which point filch in a rare moment of goodwill let harry go with no consequences he far preferred to take the case to the headmaster in the hope of removing peeves that carried harry up to the moment that he pushed open the heavy wood and iron door to the potions room still carrying his torn and inky bag from all corners so as to prevent everything falling out it beat carrying everything in his arms severus snape now he guessed since they were back at school looked up from where he was lecturing and allowed a slightly unpleasant smile to creep across his face harry hated it he d maybe learned to put up with the man over the summer and there were even a few things he liked about snape but potions and its professor were still among his least favorite things at hogwarts harry sent up a silent prayer to whoever was listening that maybe he d escape from this alive not that professor snape would kill him but the other gryffindors might if he lost them merlin knew how many points so mr potter you ve decided to grace us with your company at last harry knew from years of experience that it wasntmy fault would only get him more soundly punished and so after taking one or two seconds to catch his breath he started with i sorry sir then he held up his bag in the hopes that he d be asked for an explanation he was perhaps luck was running his way at last harry took a deep breath in spite of his intention to condense everything as tightly as possible it was still going to be a fairly lengthy story peeves stole my bag sir i had to get it off the statue of queen maeve on the first floor of the dungeons and when i finally got it down it ripped and i had to pick everything up only peeves stole my potions text so i had to chase him down to get it back the bloody baron helped me with that then i realized it was almost nine o clock so he could stretch the truth just a little and i started running because i didntwant to be late he paused for a breath and fi i mean mr filch took me to his office for running in the corridors he only let me go about five minutes ago and i came straight here as fast as i could sir snape had moved behind his desk as harry told his tale and now he was looking down at its surface as though trying to glean some kind of divine intervention from the polished mahogany wood finally he lifted his gaze and stared directly into harry eyes give me one good reason why i should not take fifty points from gryffindor and assign you a detention potter harry was exceedingly thankful that he d had the chance to study the man psychology before the school year started experience was on his side now because it would have been far easier to skip class than to come down here after all that but i chose to come to class anyway even though i knew the whole walk down that you d probably be waiting to kill me as soon as i walked through the door professor and i didntthink it was a very good idea to start the year by skipping a class i going to need every brain cell i possess to pass in the first place snape actually almost smiled harry almost had a heart attack the potions master shook his head sit down potter you may take the notes from your deskmate as luck would have it his day just didntseem to be destined as trelawney would say to be a good one there was one seat open next to draco malfoy harry groaned inwardly as he sat down and then almost had a heart attack again at least the day would be interesting some imp in his brain decided to say as snape motioned toward malfoy if you would mr malfoy i believe mr potter has notes to copy harry scribbled frantically trying to listen to snape lecture while copying down an outline of the syllabus he was stunned at some of the things they d be learning to recognize and brew undetectable poisons restricted potions a large section on illegal potions though they wouldntactually be brewing any of course sometime after midterms they d be required to stock the hospital wing and potter harry jerked his head up sharply only to be staring directly into the eyes of arather irritated potions master er yes professor did you hear a single word i just said to you potter harry was exceedingly glad he d taken up occlumency again on his own if nothing else it had taught him to calm his temper at a moment notice i sorry sir i was just finishing copying the syllabus did you ask me something i did damn snape for not letting him off easy on this one then could you repeat the question please professor i didnthear it he wasntgoing to let snape ruin his chance at being an auror especially not over some stupid childish provocation the five effects created by using human blood in certain subgroups of potions potter er yes what about them snape had been talking about them he d heard that much and he d read about them in his n e w t text but since the entire last part of the lecture had been on human blood snape comment could mean anything snape closed his eyes in frustration the five effects potter name them if you are capable of doing so or perhaps i have to explain to you what that means as well harry bit his lip and tried to think erm it really important in mind control potions not truth potions though because it um if you re trying to control a human it has something to do with some kind of mind link or something one down he knew he d got that one right even if he d explained it terribly because he d been reading about it just that morning at the breakfast table he didntwant to become hermione but he knew this class would be bad enough without throroughly reading the material and er if it used in poisons that are absorbed through the bloodstream it makes the veins collapse because it upsets the salt balance 2 if it used in erm damn snape had to pick that question didnthe if human blood is added to an aphrodisiac it concentrates it giggles from most of the girls in the room and a sneer along with a whispered and how do you know that potter from malfoy only two more two more but he couldntremember them and then er if it added to erm to if it added to er why did he have to choose now to blank out right after the aphodisiac comment sleeping potions harry yelled suddenly even snape almost jumped if you add it to a sleeping potion depending on the amount you ll either turn the potion into a concentrate or a poison and it used in certain complex healing serums to help close wounds by compounding the taker own blood the last two had been easy maybe he could get through this after all very good mr potter now if you would kindly pay attention instead of drawing miniature snape turned harry notes upside down so he could better see the aimless doodles harry hadnteven been aware he was creating miniature wolves and random lumped up scribbles all over your notes i will not be compelled to ask you any more questions do we have an understanding harry nodded harry relished the fifteen minute break after potions even though he couldntgo to the courtyard it was too far away to make it back to the dungeons in time he could walk around and begenerally nonproductive for awhile then he remembered the question he had to ask the potions master harry approached the massive desk with a good deal of trepidation erm excuse me professor snape snape raised his head from where it was bent correcting summer essays yes potter dark eyes scanned the classroom and seemingly even the corridor beyond harry harry almost jumped from the familiar use of his name er well it about my schedule he forgot to add the qualifier at the end but snape either didntnotice not particularly likely or was choosing to let harry off easy for once well twice seeing as harry d not been penalized for being late that day what about it er harry wasntsure how to address the problem let me see it harry handed his schedule over and then in a burst of semi confidence semi frustration pointed to the class labelled dark arts there isntreally a dark arts class at hogwarts is there professor snape employed a tactic harry had rarely seen except from remus blinking once slowly and then glancing in several directions as though his thoughts had run away like sheep and he had to gather them up into a bunch herd whatever it was called before he did anything else finally he closed his eyes again and spoke the class does not teach the actual dark arts harry snape opened his eyes it is an elective class though one that is highly recommended for people aiming to become aurors or mediwitches or wizards among several other professions it may only be taken during your n e w t years and it is open only to people who have received an o or higher on their defense against the dark arts o w l s you must also have at least five letters of recommendation from your professors and permission from a parent or guardian and then you must be approved by the headmaster the dark arts class walks a very fine line between what is accepted by the ministry as teachable and what you need to know as part of a very unkind real world snape stood you d better find a seat class is starting in he eyed an hourglass set into the wall just under a minute most of the rest of harry day was fairly uneventful potions theory as the name suggested was mostly notes notes notes and for a little bit of variety notes it had the potential to be worse than history of magic yet somehow snape managed to make it interesting the man was a born storyteller sprinkling even the orientation the first day in other words with small yarns related to previous classes his own time as a student at hogwarts and even once remus although the actual reference was somewhat grainy referring only to a sleepyhead like lupin with a bed head to match when trying to describe a rather eccentric potions master from the 1700s even harry had to laugh at that one remus did have a tendency to go around looking like the other half of his brain hadntquite woken up yet lunch consisted of the usual gossip an argument between ron and hermione quidditch discussion and vegetable stew defense against the dark arts was far more exciting than most classes had the right to be on the first day though harry felt quite badly about the form the excitement had come in remus had set up the basic guidelines and syllabus and was in the middle of a preliminary theory lecture on mind control curses when malfoy had stood up and raised his hand excuse me professor i have a question remus turned around from where he was drawing a rough diagram of the human brain on the blackboard yes mr malfoy malfoy sneered at him i was only wondering sir how you can possibly lecture us on the workings of the human brain when you ve never experienced its full effects even the slytherins looked stunned several gryffindors were clearly restraining themselves from jumping up and tearing malfoy to pieces remus merely smiled at him pleasantly but harry saw the steel knife glint in the golden amber spheres that said malfoy was going to regret that mr malfoy at least i have a fully effective brain unlike some people i know now do you mind allowing me to finish i d be most happy to extend your class period at nine o clock tonight by as many minutes as you have wasted but i see no reason to penalize your classmates for your poor choice in words and actions sit down please malfoy gaped at him dean thomas whistled appreciatively and remus began explaining the diagram malfoy used an even louder tone than previously though he was now addressing the room at large this school gone so downhill since my father was here now they re practically asking the animals to teach dontyou know we ve got three of them now 3 remus turned around much more sharply harry was all but terrified by his guardian eyes it occurred to him that he d never seen remus really and truly angry and he knew he was about to like both snape and umbridge remus did not raise his voice when he was angry instead it became dangerously low yet every word was clear and concise mr malfoy i believe i told you to sit down i donthave to listen to an animal remus eyes snapped shut and he gripped the edge of the desk so hard his fingers turned white harry was expecting him to really let loose now cut malfoy so deeply the words themselves would become razorblades but then neville of all people stood up facing the arrogant blonde across the room his voice wavered slightly but he wasntbacking down why dontyou just shut up malfoy professor lupin taught me more in six months than all the other defense teachers we ve had combined and if you think he not worth listening to just because he different then maybe you shouldntbe at hogwarts either after all werentyou bragging about taking the dark mark as soon as you can apparate there a set of animals for you they even crawl on all fours and slobber harry was stunned he wasntsure when neville had learned to twist daggers like that but it was scary it seemed to have the opposite effect on remus though who opened his eyes relaxing slightly here was a situation he could control one he knew how to deal with neville sit down mr malfoy i not asking again malfoy remained standing very well then remus scribbled a note on a piece of parchment in spite of the seriousness of the situation harry was slightly amused to see him still using a gel ink ballpoint instead of a quill strode briskly toward malfoy desk and forced the slytherin to take it i quite certain professor snape will be very happy to explain to you just exactly why you should be listening to an animal out and dontthink i wontknow if you dontgo to his office now malfoy had one foot out the door when remus called to him and mr malfoy just so you know if your head of house is unable to make it perfectly clear to you mr filch will be more than willing to remedy the situation malfoy paled he d only ever had detention involving filch once and he d been led into the middle of the forbidden forest to serve it at night remus had continued teaching but there was no doubt the encounter had unnerved him he even half jumped when lavender brown who was nursing a bad case of hay fever sneezed loudly and then he looked furious with himself harry stayed after class to find out if remus was going to be all right he knew just how badly comments like that could hurt his favorite professor but remus had brushed him off stating that he really didntfeel like talking about it harry dark arts class was as were the rest of his classes that day full of notes although snape assured the class twelve people in size that there would be practical work as well the two hours sped by in fact in spite of the fact that by the end harry arm was aching from a marathon day of notes it was in that state that he trudged to dinner filled himself and then left not really caring to hear remus battle of wits with malfoy reiterated again and again and exaggerated in as many ways as possible several second years from hufflepuff swore that malfoy was in the hospital wing recovering from a nasty lockjaw hex but one of the more irritated and foolish slytherin fourth years revealed that malfoy was in fact in the slytherin dormitories sulking determined to finish his homework sirius death had lit an even brighter more dangerous fire in harry heart and harry was by now completely determined to become an auror and rid the world of bellatrix lestrange once and for all harry marched up to the room of requirement knowing that nobody would find him there remus slammed the door to severus office so loudly that even the perpetrator of the noise was startled sorry severus raised an eyebrow bad day i assume terrible remus flopped down on a couch sitting along the wall and hugged a pillow to his stomach i dontremember having this much trouble in my entire first year here much less a single day do i even want to ask what happened probably not severus fought a quick battle between the wish to know what was going on he d seen remus lose just about everything he had and merely shrug it off embracing it as a chance to start over and the wish to appear unconcerned remus after all wasntthe only one capable of having a bad day on the other hand the blonde was normally calm and unflappable then again severus had indulged in the occasional temper tantrum when he d had oh to hell with it i dontsuppose you d be terribly insulted if i asked anyway he moved to sit next to remus on the couch remus closed his eyes clearly worn out well to start with i had five slytherins show up late for my first class a bunch of third years and every time i said something they could relate to lycanthropy in some way even the stupidest things like telling everyone to pack up at the end of class pack being the operative word there they d howl not loudly mind you but loudly enough for the entire class to hear and the worst of it was i couldnteven catch them doing it so i couldnttell them off for it it a childish way to get kicks out of someone else problems that wouldnthappen to be the group with the boy who looks like he swallowed a quaffle would it those are the ones donteven waste your time on them remus they ve been making ridiculous bat noises behind my back ever since they got here they re a member of that small and elite clique that still subscribes to the belief that i a vampire disciplining them only makes them worse ignore them or better still use a scare tactic give them detention on a full moon night ignore them all class period and then collar them at the end i sure you could come up with something creative i told them they could clean the blood off the floor of the potions classroom once and they haventbothered me since that wasntvery nice severus it not like i lied to them i just didnttell them a vial got spilt when the sixth years were working on the imperius potion let them fill in the gaps however they like it the most effective punishment you ll ever be able to give them remus shrugged at least you dontget called an animal four times in a day by a ravenclaw even the chang girl who else she got it in for me i swear when she was in fourth year she used to do her other homework when i was giving lectures and when i tried to call her on it she d say she was taking notes and then i dontknow how on earth she did it i d go pick up the parchment and it would be exactly that notes even though i could see the second textbook sitting open on her lap and she back at it again today i was trying to explain derivatives of the unforgivable curses and she asked me if someone could get a life sentence in azkaban for using an unforgivable on me since i not classified as human severus said something unrepeatable about cho chang and remus shook his head i guess that could be considered an honest question although she certainly could have worded it much more politely malfoy really took the cake though he has detention tomorrow remus smiled weakly i d have preferred to well i guess i couldnthave anyway but i ve heard he makes a wonderful ferret severus actually laughed at that one loud and long and then stopped abruptly as remus brushed his hair back absentmindedly revealing a large bruise on his forehead so deep it appeared almost red and purple instead of black and blue what the hell is this severus reached out and touched it gingerly remus winced it nothing it doesntlook like nothing remus dontworry about it you look like you took a bludger to the head and i supposed to not worry about it it ll heal remus remus sighed heavily peeves pushed me down the grand staircase when i was going down to dinner tonight severus swore again somebody has to do something about that damned poltergeist he been getting unbelievably violent lately i was thinking about talking to the bloody baron severus raised his eyebrows again when they d been in school remus fear of the bloody baron had been almost as great as his fear of failing any of his classes and seeing as remus had been practically hermione incarnate that was saying something remus leaned forward and rested against severus chest i just glad i had somewhere to go after all that i cantimagine having to just go back up to my rooms and try to forget about it i dontthink i d have slept at all it does sound like one hell of a day severus slipped his arms hesitantly around remus waist and the smaller man sighed closing his eyes again but this time in contentment instead of frustration i suppose i really shouldnthave dumped everything on you like a load of dead lacewings everyone needs someone to talk to once in awhile what do you suppose would happen if malfoy walked in here right now the question sounded innocent enough but if severus tilted his head down just a little he could see the mischievous grin playing around the corners of remus mouth i d threaten to tell his girlfriend about well i sure he d know what i talking about he d never breathe a word remus tilted his head backward in puzzlement come on you cantkeep a secret like that from me yes i can no you can t remus did you hear a single word of what i said earlier about filling in the gaps remus eyes widened in sudden comprehension severus that terrible do you know how many students in this school think i know every single thing that goes on in their heads because of statements like that 4 that not very nice severus that survival if you want to survive students who are out only to see what they can get over on you you d better learn how to do it quickly or you ll soon find yourself turned into a doormat by the students who didntknow you last time you were here and who are only too happy to prove they can break you that a comforting thought i can think of a more comforting one he turned remus face gently and leaned forward remus closed his eyes severus shifted his weight to his other leg and slipped an arm around remus waist neither spoke again for a long time reference notes 1 it an error in the books that the school year always begins on sunday september 1 and classes always begin on monday september 2 so giving jkr the benefit of the doubt and saying that last year fifth year for harry did indeed begin on a sunday this year sixth year would begin on a monday and classes would begin on a tuesday i could have gone back through and done the math to find out what day it should actually be but i too lazy for that 2 this issomething i based directly on truth we must have salt in our blood to live but the balance is a delicate one if you dontbelieve me prick your finger and taste a drop of blood you ll taste the salt in it 3 malfoy would be referring to remus werewolf dada firenze centaur divination and hagrid half giant giants being classified as beasts in the wizarding world care of magical creatures 4 for example in the first movie when he asks what harry and his friends are doing inside concluding with people will think you re up to something or roughly translated to spanish according to the dvd people will think you ve put your hands in it harry and co automatically assume that snape knows they re going after the stone when in fact he probably knows nothing of the kind in all likelihood he was merely breaking up a group standing in the hallway reread the books looking specifically for fill in statements like that you ll find he makes them all the time liner notes i apologize right now for the cliffhanger at the end of this one it midnight here as of the time i posting this but i already working on the next chapterwith the hopes i can finish it and get it posted before either a 2 am or b the time i fall asleep i feel terrible for leaving you all right here but at the same time i think it a wonderful cliffhanger and my chapters have been getting longer since i started writing in wordpad so i dontfeel too guilty disclaimer fright night is mine do you understand mine i created it it is miiinnee but you notice i not laying claim to anything else rating this chapter is rated pg 13 for heavy language reviews thepurpleemperor i quite flattered sho honestly i am i try to emulate rowling writing style right down to the habit of throwing in clues and puzzles ranging from the blatant to the unbelievably obscure note people who care might want to go back a couple of chapters and think very very carefully about tonks work partner ferrum and perhaps look his name up on google or msn i guarantee you ll see him again and i too take notes my copies of goblet of fire and order of the phoenix were the first i started taking notes in when i started writing fanfiction and they re positively shameful today i even bought the ultimate clue guide to harry potter in the hopes of laying bare some mysteries that have puzzled me and perhaps even being able to create some more of my own taking notes might be a good idea on your part not just for this story but for the next book july 16th is much closer than it seems i keep telling myself that so i wontgo crazy eleonora1 yes malfoy a right little beast isnthe he going to find himself in far more trouble before too long but unfortunately his abuse of remus has only begun come on i ve gotta torture the poor guy somehow or it d just seem too much like a fuzzy faerie tale at least i didntturn remus into a panda and then seemingly drop the storyright when it started to get good get the hint i revised the last chapter it does in fact end with a kiss but apparently i shadowed it too much i was trying to focus on what surrounds it comfortable silence a gentle touch peacefulness romanticism loss of frustration instead of on the kiss itself but in the process i lost it it my own personal philosophy that love and a hot cup of tea are the best remedies for almost anything although unfortunately that wontdo too much for remus in the next chapter er forget i said that would you please and i was drawing on that belief when i crafted the last bit if it still too fuzzy emailme or cuss me out in your next review i guess that works too and i ll see what i can do comprende you re gonna love what harry finds out about the letters of recommendation and why he ll warm up to severus at last in the next chapter or two i not sure exactly where it gonna fit i guarantee it dedicated of course to eleonora1 immortalflick and my best friend alicia as always enjoy haruka dinnertime at last the last friday in september had also been harry first quidditch practice in addition to being the first practice under the new captain alicia spinnet 1 harry looked up as remus tapped a knife against his waterglass excuse me everyone i have an announcement to make the hall fell silent remus seemed to have somehow picked up on dumbledore amazing ability to quiet everyone just by standing up and leaning his weight against the table dumbledore smiled and popped a lemon drop into his mouth as remus continued i going to apologize to the other teachers for boring them to death momentarily since they re all perfectly aware of the background information i about to give you but it is quite important for all of you to hear remus took a deep breath and continued when i was here as a student there was a yearly tradition known as fright night roughly speaking fright night was a dance and party sort of thing held on halloween in the great hall it was sort of a nice one night break between the start of school andchristmas everybody dressed up everybody had fun unfortunately about two years after i graduated a nasty and potentially life threatening prank was pulled at fright night and it was discontinued remus paused and looked around at everyone i proud to announce that this year with help from several of your other teachers and a few discreet students fright night will be returning several people cheered and whistled and scattered applause sounded throughout the hall remus held his hand up for silence i must impress upon all of you the fact that we can only continue this tradition with respect a small amount of maturity and consideration from you the student body however costumes may not be particularly revealing nobody is allowed to bring alcohol and general school rules must be followed otherwise its fate is sealed everyone is required to dress up though your costume does not have to be at all elaborate satirizing teachers or other authority figures is acceptable if it is done tastefully and in keeping with the tradition of the original fright night there is a costume theme this year we have determined that everyone must wear a mask that in some way completes or compliments your costume and it must be worn on the face and cover at least both of your eyes it must also be removable as you will be taking your mask off at midnight i would advise that you keep your costume fairly simple as the dinner will begin promptly at six o clock and i do believe that everything remus glanced for a moment at the headmaster and professor mcgonagall before nodding and sitting down and chatter began again at all four student tables though this time it was chatter of a very different vogue harry had one of the nastiest shocks of his life the next day as he entered defense against the dark arts remus was sitting stiffly behind his desk his jaw clenched hands clasped together so tightly that his fingers were white eyes blazing angrily harry looked around for the cause of remus anger and saw it sitting in a corner wearing an ugly black hair bow and a disgusting pink cardigan and carrying a clipboard harry couldntbelieve it dolores umbridge harry put his homework on remus desk and greeted his guardian with a sunny hello remus prompting remus to look up grin back and reprimand harry gently harry i ve told you you cantcall me remus in a classroom setting it not appropriate harry grinned sheepishly sorry re er professor remus shook his head goodnaturedly and told harry to go find a seat slowly the rest of the class trickled in and then remus stood moving in front of his desk still seeming like their friendly slightly fatherly professor in spite of the tension still clearly outlined on his face good morning everyone everyone responded with a chorus of greetings ranging from a good morning in return to what up professor to a simple hmmphho from neville who was trying to dig his homework out of his bag finally he extracted it hurried up and placed it on remus desk returning promptly and smartly to his seat remus picked up the stack of parchments now sitting on the corner of his desk so everyone as you know we re continuing our werewolf unit 2 today hem hem remus turned as though he d just realized umbridge was there oh i sorry that was rude of me i forgot to mention we have a guest with us today miss dolores umbridge will be observing the class so i d ask you all to refrain from blowing anything up today the entire class laughed this was an in joke involving an anecdote remus had shared about trying to blow up moaning myrtle toilet when he was in fourth year just to see what she myrtle woulddo umbridge raised her eyebrow slightly but didntcomment nor did she write anything on her clipboard remus flicked through the parchments in his hands checking quickly to make sure everyone had turned in the questions he would be answering in class today remus closed his eyes and harry knew what the problem was before remus even opened his mouth mr malfoy i donthave your homework assignment i didntput it up there professor do you have it no would you please run back to your dormitory for it i donthave it remus paused for a moment you donthave it i didntdo it you didntdo it he took a deep breath looking very much as though he were counting to ten before responding why did you choose not to do your homework mr malfoy malfoy sneered i think i answered that question on the first day of class professor remus fingers turned white where he was clenching them mr malfoy this is the fourth time since the class started that you have chosen to not complete the work assigned to you you may rest assured that the consequences will be a good deal more than lost points or a detention this time you may also return to your dormitory for the rest of the period it is your own choice if you wish not to learn on your own account but displays like this also detract from your peers right and ability to learn i will collect you at the end of the period and we will be having a small chat with your head of house malfoy sneered again swung his bag over his shoulder and sauntered out umbridge raised an eyebrow again and wrote something on her clipboard but harry doubted that even she could turn such a masterful move into something negative remus took a deep breath to compose himself before continuing so now you were all asked to turn in at least one question to which you could not find the answer and which related to the lesson after we hem hem remus turned around and addressed umbridge stiffly yes miss umbridge excuse me professor but do these disturbances happen often remus smiled ruefully but still quite tensely i am afraid that some of the students have come to the conclusion that they know more than their professor miss umbridge i try to keep problems at a minimum of course but there are always one or two who insist upon creating discord he turned back to the class as i was saying after we get through these i have something to hand out and then i have an assigned reading for you we ll have the quiz next class so remus shuffled the parchments so nobody would know who had asked what i dontthink i need to remind you all of my policy on so called stupid questions but just to make sure neville could you please remind everyone neville stood up and addressed remus respectfully the only stupid question is a question asked for the purpose of humiliating or demeaning a person place or experience every honest question asked out of a desire to learn is a good question thank you neville now remus extracted a piece of parchment and read the question written on it are werewolves and vampires related remus set the parchment down on the desk as he answered nobody is really sure whether or not vampires and werewolves are related there are definitely several similarities that bear looking into for example after a werewolf eyes will turn gold or amber after they have been bitten and a vampire eyes will turn silver or black with silver for the same reason but as of last year there was no fully conclusive evidence several students wrote down notes on his comments as he pulled another sheet at random from the pile do werewolves transform on a blue moon remus smiled i ve actually never had that question before yes we do and quite often the second transformation is of a greater magnitude than a normal transformation on a similar note werewolves also transform temporarily during a total eclipse of the sun but if a total lunar eclipse occurs on a full moon night there is no transformation until the eclipse has passed hem hem remus turned again clearly fighting for patience yes miss umbridge forgive me for interrupting but do you often refer to your own experience in your teaching professor lupin i find that experience is the best teacher miss umbridge and as the students were informed at the welcome feast i have no qualms about answering personal questions as they relate to lycanthropy or other subjects from which they might glean important real world information he turned back to the class and pulled another parchment from the larger stack that he d placed back on his desk is it possible for male werewolves to carry a child as it is possible for male vampires to do quite a few werewolf vampire questions in here it is possible but it also quite rare i believe there have been only 200 cases of male lycanthropic pregnancy out of a 3 5 million lycanthropicpopulation worldwide in the past ten years usually spells or potions must be used if a male werewolf wishes to conceive and of course that practice is closely monitored by the ministry to make sure it not abused hem hem remus clenched his eyes shut and opened them abruptly before spinning his composure clearly spent miss umbridge i would be glad to answer your questions at the end of the period as i do for my students but i do ask that people not interrupt unnecessarily during the period or we d never get through a lesson umbridge scribbled madly on her clipboard as remus again addressed the class it took most of the rest of the hour even without umbridge constant interruptions which remus had thankfully silenced with his comment to get through all the questions and then remus pulled another stack of parchment out of his desk drawer i believe it was lavender who asked me last class what a werewolf registry form looks like so i went up to london this weekend and got a copy of mine i thought it would be rather more beneficial if you could see one that actually filled out most of the categories are self explanatory but some of them i mean indications what that supposed to mean if you re not familiar with the subject coughing sore throat runny nose fever almost everyone laughed even a few of the slytherins as remus passed out small piles of the sheets and instructed the people in the front rows to take one and pass the rest back lavender raised her hand almost immediately professor the dates on here dontmatch it says the bite was in october of 1964 but the registration was in july of 1966 remus closed his eyes i was registered for the first time two days after i was bitten lavender but i had to be reregistered when i was six for reasons i d rather not go into he opened his eyes again and addressed the class at large i think everything on there is mostly self explanitory but that could just be because i familiar with it by now so if anything isnt it was alkyne macnair 3 who destroyed remus anonymity there two registration numbers on here professor my registry number was changed when i was reregistered but the first number starts with a seven you werenta seven number were you professor remus tensed as neville asked the slytherin what was wrong with being a seven number numbers starting with seven belong to wards of the ministry were you adopted professor remus sighed shortly i was yes alkyne but this is the same sheet all new registering werewolves have to fill out so i didnt bother asking for a copy of the old one i think it was destroyed anyway several students asked other questions about the sheet and then remus passed out copies of a daily prophet article relating to the werewolf code of conduct now all of you homework for the next class read the article and write between six and eighteen inches about your feelings on what you ve read no hermione you cantwrite more than eighteen inches there a reason i put a maximum on it whether or not you feel the regulations are fair if and how they could be improved and how they affect the rest of the world both wizarding and muggle you may use outside resources if you choose so you can gain a better understanding of the code dontforget to study for the quiz harry hermione gregory remus indicated goyle a word after class if you wouldntmind the three nodded three or four students came up to remus desk to ask questions and then hermione went to confer with the professor she nodded a few times over the parchment remus was showing her smiled blushed slightly and left goyle approached the desk remus spoke with him briefly received a sullen nod in reply and as remus gave the stout boy a stern look a book was pressed into his hand the book he d mentioned that day on the train with the illegal spells in it harry had very few doubts as to why goyle had wanted it for malfoy most likely harry moved up to the desk remus smiled at him here harry i finally finished looking this over for you remus handed harry the master thesis he was already working on in an attempt to gain a master in defense against the dark arts and a leg up as an auror incidentally it quite good for a first draft but you might want to consider revising your style some it a bit rough and i made a comment or two on it for you and harry if you re still looking for research materials you might want to try the tower library i used several of the books there for my own master thesis harry nodded and grinned get along to lunch now sure thanks professor remus smiled at him that what i here for isntit it was only after he d left the classroom that harry realized he had no idea where the tower library was well that went as well as could possibly be expected remus informed severus ruefullyas they both sat down for lunch in the great hall there are very few people in this world that i really and truly hate severus and even fewer women i d ever say a word against but i feel no qualms about telling you i absolutely despise that bitch point taken severus countered as he spooned some shepherd pie onto his plate the woman dared to question a syllabus that been honed by more than two hundred years worth of potions masters forget myself because she was afraid students might learn something potentially useful in the real world where does she get off trying to foist her own ridiculous ideas on a school that been run quite well without her for the past thousand years remus shook his head moodily and stirred some sugar into his tea i dontknow but i dontthink i ll be here much longer she spent a good twenty minutes going on about werewolves and the lycanthropy public protection act apparently she not too happy that the wizengamot overturned it after what she pulled here last year i guess a lot of the laws she wrote up are under review right now but i have this awful feeling she going to find a way to get me pulled out of here over my dead carcass no severus i serious the way she stared at me all class period i already told the minister he can start trying to find a new potions master for dumbledore if you get sacked with hidden accusations used to utilize a clause that was overturned almost four months ago i made that mistake once remus stared at him in shock you cantbe serious i am you told him you d quit if i was sacked on some overinflated incompency charges that were really being used to mask their true intentions essentially but why you i told you i made that mistake once i allowed my own prejudices to get in the way of my common sense you re a damned good teacher remus and it would be a hell of a shame to lose you remus grinned wryly shouldntuse that kind of language in front of the students severus this coming from a man who calls dolores umbridge a bitch not that i dontagree with you mind but that really the cauldron calling the cooking pot black severus mmm merlin now you re starting to sound like me remus hmm shut up and eat your chicken ten days later remus got a letter by owl he read it and stood up so quickly he knocked over his hot chocolate oh that bitch he hadntrealized until he said it that his voice had carried to even the students farthest away in the corners as evidenced by the students staring at him from every table then again he didntreally care by order of the minister of magic he had fourteen days to resign reference notes 1 angelina the captain in ootp was in the same year as fred and george weasley therefore she would have graduated at the end of ootp after some careful research i haventfound any indication that alicia was in seventh year in ootp however if she was please email me and i will change the captaincy errors annoy me 2 for those who will argue that severus covered werewolves with this class in their third year he only taught one class on werewolves so obviously they didntgo into great detail plus remus told them all they didnthave to do the essay severus assigned therefore it makes perfect sense to me that remus would choose to do them again in addition it would also make sense that they would cover the basics when they were younger and do a more involved unit in later years much as many 4th and 5th graders learn about the civil war in the us but then in 9th or 10th grade do a huge unit that covers much more in much more detail 3 although this macnair is indeed an oc sorry i couldntbuy the theory that there are only 4 boys in slytherin in harry year who is the son of macnair the death eater ministry executioner he not at all like his father unlike most slytherins this one is usually cruel without meaning to be as he shows so well here he really a pretty good kid who just got sorted into slytherin because the hat didntknow where else to put him so it followed his family history liner notes nooooooooooooo i was done done you hear editing finished reviews answered and the computer deleted it gaahhhhh breathes heavily to regain composure okay okay i not answering eleonora review again it took me half an hour to answer it and little girls need to be going to bed cos they re sick and it late disclaimer jkr would be eating this bowl of ice cream without worrying about getting fat because she can take care of it contrariwise my life savings amounts to eighteen dollars and change rating this chapter is rated pg 13 for language reviews miss anonymous hp all i can say is well replaced nott in the third final draft of this chapter after i realized that we have no idea what nott sr does for a living macnairsr of course is an executioner for the ministry which ishow his son knew about the seven numbers beingministry wards thepurpleemperor sorry i sorry i no i not you re enjoying it that much is clear and i assure you your notes are not worse than mine example when harry says why do i have to study occlu thing in ootp there a note in the margins that says terribly articulate isnthe why canthe ever talk straight when snape is around yes when i done with bottle of ink or when i get more time on my hands i ll be starting a harry severus how did you guess when you start writing in jokes to yourself in your margins we ll get together and set up a support group nightshade 013 i do enjoy original fiction sometimes but it one thing i wontbeta i tend to be far too harsh no wonder i like snape so much it might be a few days before the next chapter gets out as i ll have work to catch up on eleonora1 i ll fully answer your review later in an email i promise but i do have a couple things i want to answer here 1 remus clearly states that the life threatening prank occurred after he graduated therefore it was definitely not the shrieking shack 2 severus will be giving remus the mysterious object at some point very soon though you wontfind out why until after the de er after january in the boi universe remus note from severus irrelevant and highly inappropriate suffice it to say there a reason we never find out i know there are a lot of young people reading this story the forest is no longer completely forbidden for several reasons but yes one of them is because of remus the centaurs will be shifting slowly to join the humans in the fight against voldemort as well as always this story is dedicated to eleonora1 my best friend alicia and immortalflick though i not currently too happy with her because unwanted or improper has yet to be updated enjoy disbelief met harry statement when the gryffindors all gathered after dinner what no way harry you ve got to be joking it was hermione next comment that prompted the gryffindors from stunned disbelief into action mode we have to do something about this bloody damn right we do we cantlose professor lupin to the bloody minstry like they know anything to begin with we donthave to put up with this professor lupin shouldnthave to put up with this but what can we do here michael do you want to sign this michael corner read the petition that was circulating the breakfast tables sure want me to pass it down our table so you can go back to breakfast parvati sure thanks michael michael corner signature was number four hundred and seventy nine on the petition to remove remus lupin ministry order of resignation excuse me professor minerva mcgonagall looked up from the stew she was eating for lunch not that she had much appetite yes miss granger um do you want to sign the petition professor mcgonagall furrowed her brows what petition is this miss granger hermione handed her the quill and clipboard professor mcgonagall read the statement across the first page of the parchment and flicked through the several pages of signatures before adding her own in space six hundred and thirty two and passing the clipboard to pomona sprout who was sitting right next to her it stunned everyone that remus was still almost completely oblivious to the rebel movement going on all around him though he was aware of a petition being circulated to prevent his sacking he had no idea how many people had signed it until severus signed it commenting more to himself than anyone i d never have believed they d have more than seven hundred signatures in two and a half days remus scrambled to pull the clipboard around and stared at the pages with signatures ranging from little more than scrawls all the way up to elegant calligraphy he was even more stunned to see several slytherin names on the pages without even looking for them then severus passed the clipboard on to flitwick remus didnteat anything more he wasntentirely sure he could remember how to close his mouth twelve days after remus letter percy weasley entered the office of cornelius fudge with a thick envelope sir i think perhaps you should have a look at this in the time since remus received his letter a group of five students had collected sixteen hundred and eighty one signatures from students staff and parents the ministry couldntdiscount the validity of the petition even though about half the people who d signed it were underage fudge sighed angrily weasley take a letter remus was pretending to eat his last breakfast at hogwarts he wasntreally hungry but he didntwant to distress anyone by appearing to not eat when a tawny owl dropped an official looking letter in front of him he sighed and closed his eyes before reaching for the envelope he had a very good idea what was in it or so he thought everyone in the great hall looked up at the head table abruptly when there was a loud shriek and the crashing of a heavy wooden chair remus had stood up so quickly he d knocked his seat right over and now he was staring wild eyed at a letter clenched between trembling hands dumbledore stood up righted remus chair and then gently pulled the parchment from the slightly hysterical man hands he coaxed remus back into his chair returned to his own seat read the letter through twice and then stood again silence reigned throughout the hall i am pleased to inform you all dumbledore announced that your efforts as a unified group have paid off the ministry has withdrawn professor lupin order of resignation the creevey brothers were the first to respond breaking into applause remus sister melody followed them and then a dark haired dark skinned girl from the ravenclaw table stood up with a shout of you go remus remus blushed as most of the hall followed the four upstarts into applause and appreciative whistles the common goal they d succeeded in had done something dumbledore had been trying to do for many years remus had united them all tonight the halloween dance harry felt a bit stupid he hadntbeen able to think of a costume so he was going as a light shadow his mask was full face and painted black and white in four quarters the rest of his outfit was split similarly one half of his shirt white one half black and the trousers done the same way in reverse he added a black glove and a white one and shoes both black beneath a black robe and a white necktie well it could have been worse hermione had made the mask so the two halves of the face looked like half of one of the comedy tragedy theater masks one half was laughing the other crying he supposed maybe he could survive this unscathed harry wanted to get down to the great hall early for two reasons one nobody had been able to find out the name of the band playing that evening but it was rumored that dumbledore flitwick and mcgonagall had been changing the wards on the castle secondly he wanted to see what severus was wearing he knew the potions professor would be there he d said so though he was really only going because he had to harry wondered if he d spend his night sulking in the cornstalk maze 1 outside the front doors like what he d done at the yule ball in harry fourth year this question was quickly answered when harry walked directly into a man wearing a costume he recognized instantly as the phantom of the opera complete with a mask that covered the left half of his face and his right eye might i request that you watch where you re going potter the voice was unmistakeable er sorry professor harry responded but he grinned as he turned away to go sit at one of the many tables scattered throughout the great hall he was quickly joined by remus severus and three people harry didntrecognize their masks covered too much the rest of the table was soon filled by ron hermione neville dean and seamus i sitting in the middle of a crowd of bloody gryffindors severus informed remus superfluously clearly trying only to appear disgusted he wasntreally harry was hard pressed to determine just who exactly remus was supposed to be he d charmed his hair to his shoulders and then to a shade of dark brown he had a black silk eye mask on his face black gloves on his hands a rich red cape black pants a white shirt under a black vest and black button up boots he was also attempting to speak with a thick spanish accent ahh but my friend you are also sitting next to the great don juan well that answered one question harry had been leaning more toward zorro surely you will admit that it is a great honor to be in the presence of such a man a man who slept with more than a thousand women si my friend severus shook his head i far prefer music to women they re really not my type everyone at the table laughed harry could have sworn severus gave him a very small wryly placed wink dinner passed quickly tables were moved to the walls a stage appeared and dumbledore moved on to it good evening everyone he was greeted by a general murmur of good evening from the students and staff tonight it is my great honor to announce that for the first time since 1642 2 hogwarts is welcoming several nonmagical members of the community i would ask you all to give a great welcome to our guests this evening and to enjoy the entertainment i have been assured they will provide everyone started clapping as the mystery people from harry table trooped up onto the stage pulling off masks and parts of costumes harry was stunned impossible completely impossible but there they were and then remus came racing up on to the stage with his usual trademark entry line to almost anywhere sorry sorry sorry raven sorry several people laughed but most appeared shocked as remus came to a halt in front of his guitar couldntget the stupid bloody cloak off that the last time i let somebody else tie it raven didntappear to be paying attention instead she had her head tipped back so far harry feared her neck might break bloody hell remy where the ceiling remus managed to catch his breath before answering you re looking at it raven and could i ask you to keep it toned down just a little i do believe i mentioned i have to face most of these kids on monday raven turned her head and grinned at him evilly the people up front all laughed and the dance began ahhuurrrooooo raven tipped her head back and let out a very mangled imitation of a werewolf cry remus moved up next to her motioning with his hands no no i keep telling you from the back more raven back of the throat very gutteral arrouuhhhooooo laughter remus shook his head and rolled his eyes and gave her a friendly pat on the shoulder we ll keep working on that arrooooouuuuuuu raven froze remy did you hear that she scanned the crowd nervously remus stared at her obliviously hear what arroooouuuuuuuuuuu raven turned to him as the eerie sound echoed through the hall again that remus grinned but it was a slightly nervous grin oh that that a werewolf actually raven forest full of them raven continued to scan the room nervously arrouuuuuuuuuu remy hmm that that wasntoutside remus stared at her openmouthed are you saying i did that arrrrouuuuuuuuu no but remy that not outside another howl remy that behind us oh bloody hell i ll go look for it a slightly prickly severus pushed past them a door creaked on splintery hinges and everyone heard footsteps and more howls then the door slammed and the lights went out several people screamed then hermione grabbed harry arm and pointed behind the stage as music started look a screen had magically appeared behind the stage and everyone could see raven moving through an old abandoned wooden house that looked suspiciously like a larger more elaborate version of the shrieking shack minus most of the furniture the screen shed an unearthly glow down on the stage as remus started to sing but he really didntsound like himself this voice was younger less trained more spectral on the screen something grabbed raven arm she turned looked into golden red eyes and let out a silent scream muted red lights shone down dimly lighting the stage and the front of the hall after several minutes of aliens and werewolves and a few zombies remus started reciting something in a voice that was slightly comforting and yet frightening at the same time he sounded almost like he did in the classroom he moved up behind raven and pulled her around to face him turning her face as he came to the end of what seemed an eerie poem the screen went black and showed only an evilly glowing pair of red eyes remus started laughing an evil unearthly laugh raven screamed and the room was pitched into complete blackness 3 a door creaked someone near harry moaned oh not again but then the lights flickered on and severus appeared in front of the stage it wasntanything but a plastic 4 you ought to be more careful with your things lupin remus and raven looked at each other and started laughing weakly until a creepy organ loop played it stopped suddenly and from behind the keyboard the evil sinelle draconn laughed at her counterparts instantly the room was filled with laughter and then remus held up his hand it ten to midnight he struck a chord announced find your partners and then introduced the song this one this is another old one but it a favorite of mine because it s when it first came out it really described my mindset the middle part really really described it but then i grew up a little and fell into the trap of living the other half of the song laughter from everyone so this song this song called scenes from an italian restaurant 5 and oh i just gonna shut it now or you ll all repay me by falling asleep in class tomorrow everyone laughed and then laughed again as he pretended to snooze on top of the microphone stand before the song started lyrics bouncing back and forth between everyone on the stage remus got the part about leather jackets and tight blue jeans and harry heard lavender and parvati start giggling behind him he wasntentirely sure why sure that was essentially what remus was wearing at that exact moment but he didntsee why that made it funny girls harry muttered to ron the pair had nixed dancing in favor of sitting near the stage and watching and ron nodded fervently in agreement the song finally came to an end and a slow song started ron got up to look for hermione harry didnthave a date but was spared the trouble when she came up and took his hand harry would you care to dance with me harry looked up into a pair of silvery eyes from where he was even the first years were taller than he was er sure if anybody had told harry two hours ago that he d be dancing with luna lovegood at midnight he d have never believed them it the midnight hour remus intoned into a microphone and sinelle played her spooky organ music again harry suspected one of those fancy synthesizer keyboards all around the room masks came off and harry looked down at his dance partner to see if he d been correct he had been luna absentmindedly brushed harry bangs out of his eyes and he blinked in surprise you look er different harry finally managed and luna smiled as though it were the best compliment she d ever heard thank you harry i have to be getting back to my table now luna drifted off amongst the dancers there was another fast number going it was several moments before harry remembered to sit down harry mate you feeling all right ron sounded worried as he handed harry a butterbeer er fine say ron if i told you i danced with luna lovegood would you say i was crazy ron didnteven consider absolutely mate lovegood been sitting at that table ron pointed across the room to where harry could barely see a mass of blonde hair with cat ears sticking out of it all night er right harry managed that wasntpossible was it well everyone hey raven pulled the microphone from remus hand all right everyone you know what they say in mexico we re not here for a long time we re here for a good time 6 and like we say it time for the last dance last dance remy did you remy remus re mus raven waved a hand in front of remus face he was pretending to snooze on the microphone stand again remy one more and you can go up to your room remus shook his head down to your room remus shook his head again and made some kind of motion with his hand down to somebody else room remus nodded eliciting mostly giggles from the female element of the crowd at least the female element old enough to understand the reference remus tell me you re not staying down there absolutely not at least let these kids believe i have morals raven again the wave of laughter came mostly from the older members of the group but now it came from both genders actually i am going to my own room all by myself several friendly mocking aww s came from various people of course i never said there wasntsomebody already in there waiting for me snorts and shrieks of laughter the boys and mature girls and giggles the immature girls remy yes raven arentyou the one who asked me to tone it down raven for all you know the someone waiting for me is a big fluffy brown puppy dog with a bow around its neck because waking up next to something happy to see you and slobber all over youis better than waking up all alone now would you care to tell me why you woke me up more laughs though these again were mostly from the lavender and parvati element last dance remy oh good that means i can go home there no guitar in last dance 7 raven rolled her eyes in a manner that could have been meant as affectionate right remy so all of you it last dance thanks so much for having us tonight it been a blast and we ve got sinelle draconn on keyboards and backup jason tych on drums remus lupin on lead guitar and vocals remus waved from where he was carefully disassembling his guitar and the various things attached to it sonny barton on bass guitar i raven knight on lead vocals and we re the irregulars applause scattered throughout the hall and the last dance began harry filtered out into the entrance hall remus had waited with the rest of the band to help them pack up apparently wards that allowed electronics to work had been placed and harry wanted to talk with him remus looked up saw him and smiled did you have a good time harry harry nodded and then saw snape coming out of the hall er i guess i should get going you guys were great remus saw severus at the same time harry did and smiled again thank you have a good night harry harry embraced his guardian briefly before all but floating up the grand staircase and down the hall toward gryffindor tower the very very long reference notes sorry 1 for those who dontlive in places where there are cornstalk mazes i pity you they re quite fun they re exactly what they sound like mazes made out of cornstalks usually still unharvested or harvested by hand so the stalks themselves are still in the ground the insides often decorated with elaborate displays of draculas frankensteins demented jack o lanterns and so on the challenge in a truly good cornstalk maze is getting out you cantsee where you re going because the stalks usually range between 8 and 14 feet tall and many of the pathways go in circles 2 unless my history of magic is wrong in which case i need to go reread a few things this was the year that heralded the permanent split between the magical and non magical communities 3 can you guess what song this is hint the album was released in 1982 and the song itself is quite remus appropriate incidentally this was the song remus was singing in the original draft of the reveal chapter but because it deals with werewolves i felt it to be too obvious and ditched it 4 severus actually means a vinyl and is referring to a vinyl record 5 scenes is by billy joel and came out sometime between 1973 and 1985 i pretty sure it came out in the 70s which would put remus between 13 and 25 years old listen to the song and you ll understand very well why it describes my interpretation of remus if not himself literally then people he may have known or his own general mindset i transcribed below the small chunk that got this song its place in this chapter just in case you re interested do you remember those days hangin out at the village green engineer boots leather jackets and tight blue jeans oh you drop a dime in the box an play a song about new orleans cold beer hot lights my sweet romantic teenage nights sound like anybody we know yes a little more like sirius than remus yeah i d have thought so too but then you guys dontyet know his whole history as written by me and i do that triangle isntthe only tattoo he got you ll know all you need by the end of the story though i promise 6 this is true and is part of the theory behind el dia de los muertos the day of the dead ones a day when mexicans honor their deceasedfriends and relatives and is vaguelysimilar to our hallowe en just thought i d also share where i first heard this phrase bringing the circle to its close from alocal band 7 by donna summer album the dance collection 1987 this is as implied the last dance of the night but the name of the song is also last dance one of those puns i love making liner notes i am so so so so so sorry there really is a good reason it taken me two weeks to write this several actually 1 i got majorly sick 2 while trying to write a particularly stubborn section i got grounded 3 and coming off grounding i got royally sick again we re talking a fever of 104 8 here 4 finally have you seen the length of this thing no i recommend you look at the move bar on the right side of your screen yes that one see on an incidental note if you add me to your favorites list or author alert list i would appreciate it if you would send me an email so i can read your work i have found some of my favorite stories by checking out the accounts of the people who have added me to their own favorites or author alert lists but the number of people on my stats list is getting too great for me to simply check everyone name every now and again to see who new of course this doesntmean you have to send me an email to add me to your list but you never know if you do you might one day just end up with an email in your inbox asking if i can borrow a small implement you ve used and then your name goes in my work as someone i ve borrowed from and believe you me it possible to get a lot of readers that way i ve gotten a lot more emails from people on this site since eleonora1 added me to her favorites list so if you d be so kind as to take the time freesongspirit yahoo com without the spaces of course other announcements technically nobody would expect me to put this i dontthink but i will because i set a goal in the early days of bottle of ink that is no longer feasible my original goal was three chapters per week every week until it was done however i ve encountered forces beyond my control chemistry class occasional writer block limited computer time chores etc that have made this impossible therefore i now aiming for a target of one chapter per ten days this benefits not just me but you all as well when i have longer to write i am better able to indulge in the wordplay that i love so much and that so many people have emailed telling me they love plus my chapters are longer and better written overall so dontpanic if i dontupdate for a week or two i will not be abandoning this story in fact last night the perfect ending came to me at one o clock in the morning and i had to get up to write it down because i was sure i d forget it otherwise gotta love those sugar induced dreams however i did feel i should let you all know that the lag time between updates will be longer to the benefit of everyone plus it gives me more time to get more reviews have i mentioned reviews are an essential part of a healthy author diet disclaimer well i have the insanely long wait down pat and my hair is blonde only mine is natural not out of a box but i didntcreate these characters or the universe they live in rating this chapter is rated pg 13 for language homosexuality and general maturity of content reviews yikes seven reviews that a record for a chapter maybe i should aim for an update a week to let my readership build chappies would get better too general thanks tosummer nightshade 013 ayune you guys are the reason i ve struggled for the past two weeks to get this out past a massive writer block thank merlin the next five chapters or so are almost completely done this just wormed its way in here eleonora1 i hear that a lot no really i do i one of the six impossible things the white queen believed in before breakfast through the looking glass and what alice saw there yes the band is sticking around they may be more important than you re aware coughcough i shouldn t ve told you that glad you liked it here here a new chappie will you stop threatening me now charming though your devotion is i really dontcare to be tied to this chair and forced to write it a rather uncomfortable chair on account of being broken thepurpleemperor no no i saying in jokes as in lots of the bloody things plot lines that unfold right in the lines of your copy of the canon i have an outline for four separate one shots written down on a paper i taped to the back of prisoner of azkaban that i put there so i wouldntlose it i glad you love this so much i actually take very little time with the comedy scenes and the irregulars have come to be based more off my lunch table than being complete oc with the exceptions of raven and sinelle of course so i ll pass the compliment on to the gang tomorrow yulara blush funny things like that i dontwrite them they write themselves in my head at night when i cantsleep odd solution to insomnia but it works eventually i giggle so hard i pass out just set up a basic scenario and they ll write themselves for example i knew that remus was going to be constantly reminding them that he a teacher here in an attempt to keep the r rated humor to a minimum and most of the scene came out of that in twenty minutes immortalflick yay she read it and liked it my remus actually most of the main characters personalities are based off different facets of me severus is my ironical brit side remus is the most like me right down to the way he gets mad but the patented remus blush is courtesy of my best friend hermione is well hermione is also like my best friend but ron poor clueless ron is based off me teasing abovementioned friend poor alicia she puts up with so much so if you like my remus you like me yay is happy as always dedicated to eleonora1 immortalflick and my best friend alicia enjoy three weeks after hallowe en came the second hogsmeade weekend of the school year the first being of course the saturday before hallowe en harry had planned to go to the wizarding village with ron and hermione but as always lately his plans were upset this time by ron who apologetically told harry he wanted to go alone with hermione and would harry mind harry was thrilled that his best friends were finally learning to stop being so bloody shy around each other and were starting to go out but it did mean he d be going into hogsmeade alone if he went at all he briefly considered the idea of asking luna lovegood to go with him and then decided it would seem too much like a date one dance at hallowe en indicated nothing except that she d wanted to dance if he knew who some of her friends were it might have been different but harry only knew ginny he thought of going with her and came to the same conclusion he had with luna privately he wished fred and george and lee jordan and angelina and alicia were still around even if they were all older than him it would be practically pointless to go to hogsmeade alone suddenly it occurred to him to see if perhaps remus wanted to go everyone was perfectly aware that remus had become harry guardian over the summer and they d also more than appreciated the fact that remus was in his own words a sixteen year old who woke up one morning looked in the mirror and said what the bloody hell happened to me i have laugh lines therefore nobody would think it odd or inappropriate for harry to be spending a day in hogsmeade with his favorite adult remus would be perfectly good for a joke or two and a trip to zonko s and harry rather fancied that remus odd sense of humor would enjoy gathering the naive third years around a table in the three broomsticks and telling them all about the vicious spirits in the shrieking shack harry turned away from the lake he d been brooding having finished his breakfast long before the actual end of the meal preparing to go talk to remus when he saw the blonde in question sitting beneath the weeping willows next to another part of the lake his head resting on a black clad shoulder his arms around a similarly clothed waist harry felt betrayed he turned again resolutely showing his back to the oblivious couple on the opposite bank and stalked back into the castle harry walked around aimlessly for almost two hours before he ran into lisa turpin 1 a ravenclaw from his dark arts class they walked through the open corridor between the trophy room and the room that had held fluffy the three headed dog in harry first year discussing the last class that wednesday snape had passed around a real dragon s tooth necklace an awesome artifact in ron words and a very rare and potentially dangerous item in the words of harry most hated professor lisa whose sister was a dragon keeper like ron brother charlie had been particularly impressed the tooth was close to four inches long and was secured as an ornament by way of a leather thong wrapped in a criss cross around the base the tooth hung with the sharp point facing down tied in a knot at the top and then continued around as the necklace itself snape had given them a good deal of background on it the displaced fang came from a peruvian vipertooth the smallest dragon known to the wizarding world it was one of the purest specimens ever created while most dragon teeth prepared for sale were filed to remove the extremely sharp tip and the root of the tooth sanded bleached polished and varnished all of which lowered the magical potency of the tooth according to snape this particular one only had the root and the razor sharp tip removed lisa had been impressed and she told harry had asked snape if it would be a good idea to write to her sister to find out more in a rare show of i may not be the biggest expert on this subject and therefore we should get outside information snape had invited her to do so and had even offered house points in exchange he really changed this year lisa told harry he even asked me if i was considering becoming a healer when we did mandrake draughts a couple of weeks ago in potions he never said anything like that to any of us before harry assumed she was referring to her ravenclaw hufflepuff classmates though the statement applied to gryffindors as well i dontthink he so wonderful harry informed his classmate i mean all right so he acting a bit different he still terrorized me for five years a lot of the time for things i didnteven do or he d misplace blame on purpose the best thing he ever did for me was when he cut down umbridge last year this statement led to several moments of abusing umbridge and harry had a particularly juicy morsel to add her display over remus teaching had caused a bit of an uproar in the ministry and there was a possibility she d have to stand before the wizengamot for throwing her weight around one too many times in one too many wrong ways for one too many bad reasons i hope she gets azkaban lisa said she thinks just because she got the minister stamp of approval she owns us all i wanted so many times so badly to tell her my mother is assistant head of the department of international magical cooperation i d love to see how she d react to that finding out she couldntjust toss us around because she an assistant in the ministry oh and umbridge my father is a muggle does that make me a half breed i should have asked her that in class i really really should have harry laughed bitterly and showed her his scar from his detentions with the evil toad not unless you want one of these lisa looked sick she made you write lines with a sectumius quill 2 why didntyou report her do you honestly think anybody could have done anything lisa shrugged i suppose not still she appeared lost in thought for a moment well i have to go i promised professor snape i d let him see my sister answer and she wrote back to me today you should hear some of the things they ve done to dragons over the years just to get teeth it unbelievable i wouldnthave believed it myself if it wasnt listed in the tower library too see you later harry after lisa departure harry stared brooding at the shield listing the members of the 1977 1978 house quidditch teams his father had played seeker for two years fourth year and fifth year and then stepped down because he wanted to play chaser instead 3 harry paused suddenly his eyes riveted gryffindor house seeker remus lupin y 7 remus played quidditch harry never knew that sirius was a beater from third year until sixth year but for some reason harry didntknow he d left the team before the first game of his seventh year wormtail never played he wasnta good enough flyer harry felt a hot worm of hate burn into his stomach and nestle at the bottom twisting around his intestines like a malicious strangler fig then he saw something else that shocked him even more than remus as seeker embedded in the shield were photographs of the teams and he recognized someone in the slytherin photograph tall thin long black braid two silver bracelets on his right wrist 4 silver buttoned black boots large dark eyes harry eyes darted to the name plaque for confirmation slytherin house seeker severus snape y 7 unbelievable harry sank down next to the tall cabinet and leaned his weight against the stone base thoughts whirling randomly in his brain and then you really ought to ask him you know harry jumped up eyes darting warily all around the trophy room who said that i did the voice was on the wall behind him now harry whirled and started he recognised the man in the portrait remus lupin 1379 1452 r r remus the man in the portrait smiled and harry all but died from shock if it hadntbeen for the shakespearean clothing blue eyes and the odd haircut harry would have sworn he was looking right at his guardian even the way this man held himself was the same i do not recall seeing you before young master it behooves you to explain your behavior you you harry mouthed soundlessly finally after a stern glance from the portrait he finished lamely you look i mean my someone i know he looks exactly like you your current defense teacher i expect harry stared how did you the portrait waved his hand through the air impatiently quite simple young master remus comes here quite often but i sense something is troubling you in regard to my many times great grandson 5 i would suggest you talk to the headmaster professor dumbledore is capable of solving many a problem both academic and personal yours revolves in both spheres of your life does it not harry wasntexactly sure how to answer he d never heard a portrait that talked so formally even the older portraits in the main part of the castle could converse just like the students for the most part er i guess so erm why are you here anyway in the trophy room i mean portrait remus smiled again eerily eerily if only because it was like looking at a remus clone many many years ago mr potter oh i would think you should not be so shocked my descendant speaks quite frequently of you i should be quite remiss if i did not recognise you by now no lupin has ever been so foolish or unobservant but i digress do i not many many years ago several hundred years by now i am sure 6 if my heir commentaries are any sort of reliable indication i was highly rewarded for removing the threat of a budding but still highly malevolent dark wizard from this school upon discovering his attempt to drown a half blooded student he admitted under the influence of a highly potent veritas venenum cordial that he planned to remove from the school those not of pureblood descent sadly he was the heir of one of the founders it caused quite a scandal though i understand that even his heir is quite alive and well and still causing mayhem in your world today voldemort it was strange to see someone who actually looked puzzled at the name instead of fearful most people angry snape there he was again popping into harry thoughts like an unwanted canker sore damn him and the death eaters or determined people like dumbledore and remus finally the portrait slightly thrown look faded and he mused yes that may have been the name you are familiar then with the history you could say that footsteps sounded outside the door honored grandfather 8 are you awake the voice sounded thin and tired harry knew instantly who it was he also knew he didntwant to face his guardian right now so he turned and headed for the other exit but not quickly enough to miss the portraits final words ask him harry had to go through twenty three separate sweets before he found the correct password to the headmaster office canary creams but he finally gained entrance the headmaster was waiting for him at the top with the usual harry my boy how good to see you harry cringed internally at the my boy he really was getting too old for that dumbledore offered him a sherbet lemon which he of course refused and then trying for once to shock his elder harry continued no milk please sir dumbledore merely gave his patented twinkle have i become that predictable in my age harry how had he known to drop my boy so quickly if harry had been a girl he might have pouted as he was he merely looked slightly put out even when i deliberately try to leave you speechless i cantdo it dumbledore twinkled again it takes a good deal more than that to shock me harry there was the switch again and harry d been expecting a my boy that time he paused to take a sip of his own tea i take it you wish to see your school documents harry gaped as the headmaster pushed a file across the desk they were sitting at i must request that your portfolio does not leave my office harry students have been known in the past to lose important pieces of information some of which were never found i believe your guardian once took his file to the tower library only to somehow misplace the documents that allowed him to attend we took nearly three weeks searching for them before he recalled using his ministry acceptance letter as a placemarker in a wizarding copy of the lion the witch and the wardrobe 9 an excellent book to be sure but not an excellent place to leave an important document you are welcome to the space in front of my fire however if you are careful with the records harry and he hadnteven had to use harry name there it was like he d put it in on purpose harry sat down in front of the fire after nodding his thanks taking a second cup of tea and the surprisingly mugglesque manilla folder with him he flipped it open and surveyed the documents within carefully one at a time moving them so that they never got out of order first was a copy of his birth certificate then a copy of his acceptance letter to hogwarts followed by his first year exam results and recommendations from all his teachers that he be allowed to continue his studies 10 with an added referendum by snape saying that harry may wish to consider having extended instruction in potions to make up for an unusual amount of inexperience in the subject harry could only assume this was a nice way of saying he needed remedial potions because he was terrible in regular lessons remus hadntbeen joking when he said carrying on a normal conversation with the git practically required a dictionary after the letters came examples of his best written work from the year and then a similar pattern for his second year though here the teachers merely commented on his progress neither year contained a letter from a defense teacher understandably the pattern deviated slightly then with a list showing harry new classes and then at the end remus letter the first from a defense teacher to the headmaster and the board of governors it has come to my attention that harry potter y 3 shows exemplary understanding and ability in the subject of defense against the dark arts i would strongly suggest that harry be permitted to test out of the class and continue with private tutoring which would better fit his current needs and serve to develop his natural talents the letter went on to discuss harry outstanding abilities and to mention the so called private tutoring he had sought on the dementor issue and then outlined the subjects the class had covered highlighting how harry abilities had risen above the expected ministry standard harry d read about half of it it was close to six inches long a good deal when remus almost microscopic writing was taken into consideration when he lowered the parchment deep in thought remus had thought that much of him as a student as a person when he was only thirteen years old when nobody else thought him capable of carrying even his own burdens much less those he was destined to bear fourth year ran the same as third with the exception that there was again no defense letter fifth year brought many changes first a short and scathing note from dolores umbridge sadistic bitch harry thought demeaning his every ability next snape letter had changed he noted marked improvement in practical work and that mr potter has become far more cooperative in lessons of course he had his anger had all been spilled on umbridge to the point that there was little but table scraps left for snape following the best work section came a short note harry did not expect and he grinned slightly when he read it it was the only thing in his file that seemed written in multiple hands and he did a double take upon seeing it i albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry have been notified that an extensive practical defense group was begun organized and maintained by mr harry potter y 5 and two of his friends with the approval of the board i have requested that his second in command miss hermione granger give here an account of their group dumbledore army and the subjects taught within as well as any other pertinent information hermione had dealt in spades giving a full list of the ages of the members ranging from 12 to 18 the skills they d mastered two members of the board of governors had made note in the margin of the fact that several second years had been positively tested for patronus skills as well as many other above o w l abilities upon the receipt of hermione account and the plans harry had been putting into practice when the d a was interrupted by umbridge there were more notes on the parchment by other governors plus a short referendum by the minister of education written at the bottom harry was more than slightly stunned directly behind this startling find was a copy of his career consultation with mcgonagall as well as several comments from his head as to how he could continue to improve his studies and shape them to his desired vocation he found a copy of his custody documents from that summer paper clipped to a photograph of remus presumably for identification harry couldntthink of another reason there might be such a photograph in his file past that came his o w l scores and a list of the subjects he was still taking followed by the thing he d been looking for his recommendation letters for the dark arts class harry frowned as he tried to remember why this was important he couldntfor the life of him think of why this had been bothering him then it hit him like a brick wall he was taking enough subjects for all five letters yet he was certain that with umbridge in power last year he should only have been able to get four referrals he flicked through them mcgonagall flitwick sprout apparently working with dark plants like devil snare or venomous tentaculae was enough for a herbology referral hagrid and it seemed the same went for dark creatures like thestrals and then he stopped so short he almost dropped the last letter in dumbledore fireplace by accident to whom it may concern after working extensively in both potions and occlumency with mr potter during his fifth year i have concluded that he is of a determined and resourceful mindset eager to share his extensive knowledge with those around him and willing to learn insofar as he can insure that the subjects he has set his time to will be of use in his chosen career he is fully capable of identifying and brewing antidotes for all forty six poisons in the eight subsections studied before n e w t level and has shown unusual understanding of the written work in potions his practical work being above average when paired with a competent partner during mr potter third year i on several occasions instructed him in defense against the dark arts and found him to be well versed and exemplary in his understanding of the subject he has been a proven source of knowledge and assistance to those around him and it is with these strengths in mind that i fully recommend him for a seat in the n e w t dark arts class at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry professor severus n snape potions harry stared his hands trembling ever so slightly he d never have made it into the class if he hadntgotten a reference from potions it was on the requirements list hermione had dug up from where else the library potions charms transfiguration and defense against the dark arts letters were all required the last requirement had been lifted for last year class because umbridge wasntlikely to write a letter for anybody in fact the only people she d written letters for were malfoy and his posse it was one reason the class was nearly impossible to get into he wondered why he hadntremembered that or had some small part of his brain that part that had thought for sure he would be a prefect the part that had raged all last year about all he d done had that part managed to convince him albeit subconsciously that dumbledore would just worm him in i presume you ve found what you re looking for harry dumbledore peered over the tops of his glasses twinkling at his favorite student er yeah i think most of it erm professor dumbledore yes harry there it was again sir i know this is probably going to sound like a really stupid question but there are no stupid questions harry except those meant to belittle another or another experience any question asked honestly is perfectly intelligent now where had he heard that before er right er if i hadntgot all the letters i needed for the dark arts class you are referring to your letter for potions how did he know that er yeah i mean would i still have er well there is a clause harry which your friend miss granger may have missed it being little more than an incidental added at some point within the last two hundred years the board eventually realized that there is a small degree of human error that in spite of our best efforts must surely give some degree of inaccuracy to everything we say and do it was with this in mind that the then members of the board of governors created the competency clause a corollary to the original rules of the class if you were proven more than competent in all other subjects one of the required letters could be dropped this would have resulted in you having only four letters but due to the er restrictions we were placed under last year you would not have been the only student with that dilemma indeed i believe no less than four of your classmates fell into that category you would still have been permitted into the class based upon your excellent recommendations and o w l s from your other classes it is a rule that applies to all i fear you have become too conscious of yourself harry it is never a good idea to spend so much time in retrospect that you cease to grow for fear of becoming that which you do not wish to be harry gathered the documents after determining that it was indeed remus and not the dursleys who d signed him into the class he had a feeling it wouldnthave been but the slightly twisted sense of humor he seemed to be picking up from remus demanded that he check carefully tapped the folder on the floor to shuffle them all back down to the bottom and handed it to dumbledore with a thanks he had his hand on the doorknob when something occurred to him harry turned around slowly sir dumbledore looked up yes harry at least now he d know you were using legilimency on me earlier werentyou dumbledore smiled when i am in the company of a troubled individual better at stating his or her thoughts through actions instead of words i do confess to finding it a useful tool for aiding someone in need is that why you you may be interested to know that even remus still falls under the category of a boy to me harry and he doesntlike it any more than you do the headmaster sighed one of the disadvantages i fear of old age but get along harry get along you have someone to see do you not remus rolled his back over the top edge of the sofa listening to the popping sounds and groaning in agony before allowing himself to relax back onto the seat i hate having to crack my own back he complained good naturedly as harry walked in you wouldnthave to if you hadntspent all last night out howling at the moon severus responded quirking his eyebrow remus floundered for a mere half a second i completely resent that severus i was not out all of last night and and it certainly wasntthe moon i was howling at severus closed his eyes looking like he was trying to keep his patience harry recognised the motion from class then what may i ask were you howling at er remus looked like he was trying to remember something then his face turned red as he spoke slowly prying each word out of an unwilling mouth i dontthink i should have to insult your intelligence by telling you that he pled sheepishly with his eyes as severus finally opened his own and looked at the repentant blonde that really didntwork did it it wasntreally a question severus fixed him with a slightly bemused look ah no remus buried his face i dontunderstand how you do it the information you re supposedly withholding from me is information that would injure you not me with the amount of knowledge currently held by our colleagues and the students you re trying to intimidate me it would help if you didntblush so bloody damn much which statement of course only served to make remus blush more sorry severus watched as remus rolled his head on his neck and made a revolted face as several loud popping noises emitted from the same source you do realize you completely disgust everyone around you when you do that but it feels good when the vertebrae pop back into place so i not walking around like a hunchback sit up straight and you wouldnthave to pop them back in remus just smiled and slipped his arms around severus waist you know i suppose if i really wanted to shut malfoy up i could threaten to kiss him in front of the entire great hall at dinner it d be easier than this this fill in statements right er harry tired of feeling awkward finally decided to make his presence known instantly he was pierced by gold and black arrows hello harry i thought you were going to hogsmeade remus stretched his legs out along the magically lengthened sofa no standard sofa in the world was long enough for remus legs in spite of his short stature all but laying down right in severus lap the protest was immediate and very vocal who gave you the right to turn my legs into a bed my rooms my rules severus and your legs simply happen to be in the way of my head remus patted the floor in front of him come have a seat where ron and hermione in hogsmeade ron asked if i d mind not going with them i mean er not like that it just harry gestured helplessly with his hands from the spot he was still standing on he trying to woo the granger girl severus informed remus in a bored tone remus made a sound that might have been roughly interpreted as how cute severus snorted and then froze like stone as harry took three hurried steps across the carpet hugged him and said thanks harry almost wished he d had colin camera he d never seen severus completely and utterly speechless before finally the dark eyed man came out with a startled what the hell was that for remus eyes flicked upward amused deciding i good at something harry turned and walked out turning toward the owlery severus just sat mouth slightly open for several moments it was perhaps as long as thirty seconds before he spoke then what the hell a single lazy finger came to rest on his lips drop it drop it he leaves something like that hanging out there and you re telling me apparently he knows and he not trying to kill us both with eye daggers anymore so drop it well then again it wasntlike he d ever use the knowledge the very very very long reference notes sorry 1 not an oc i checked my ultimate unofficial guide to the mysteries of harry potter which contains a list of all the people sorted by name in harry year if you want to check you ll want to read chapter seven the sorting hat in the english edition of philosopher s sorcerer stone some of the names are different in foreign language copies conversely you can also buy a copy of the ultimate unofficial guide which is a pretty darn cool book i use it as one of my tools to set up the complex and not so complex puzzles and riddles in my stories 2 sectumius i have no idea if this is potentially correct latin grammar or not i just used a jkr trick here the word is derived from the latin sectum for to cut hurt wound amputate divide part 3 according to an online interview with jkr james potter was a chaser for the gryffindor house quidditch team only in the movie is he listed as a seeker however due to some conflicts in the books i e playing with the snitch in the ootp chapter snape worst memory many people have come up with the theory that he played both ginny confirms that this is possible in ootp when she tells harry she going to try out for chaser after harry is allowed back on the team as seeker the quidditch history of the teams when the marauders were at school as set down here in part was created by me with no regard to any history set up by any other person in any way except the basic information provided by jkr it is entirely my own you re welcome to borrow it if you wish though just put in one of those common courtesy notes in that says it a borrowed bit legally pushable no nice thing to do absolutely and i do it all the time 4 these are getting way too long so if you want to know the logic behind severus wearing bracelets on his right wrist email me or say so in a non anonymous as in i need your email review and i ll give you the full story 5 i imagine even an elizabethan version of remus would get sick of listing about twenty or so greats before grandson and i know i sure would hate having to read them all anyway i d say the dates speak for themselves wouldntyou 6 i dontremember where i read it but there is a rather interesting theory that says that the portraits live in a state of suspended animated wakefulness that to say they re perfectly capable of walking and talking and interacting with those around them animated wakefulness but they neither truly experience anything nor age a day and do not require any kind of sustenance to continue existing suspended animation therefore they re completely unaware of how much time has passed since they were painted unless they are told therefore this remus would have no idea that far from being in the 1300 1400 s when he would have been painted he is now in fact in the late 1990 going by the official timeline available on the lexicon 7 veritas venenum an exact translation of truth potion as taken from the original online latin to english dictionary this would have been a more elementary and less potent but no less effective version of veritaserum interesting but useless sidenote venenum may also be used to mean drug or poison 8 so it cuts out about 300 years worth of relationships do you honestly care enough to do the hours of research to find an appropriate name most likely in another old and very obscure language i don t 9 since i ve received emails from a couple of people wanting to know how to spot the more subtle clues and puzzles in bottle of ink and since these reference notes are going to be insanely long anyway i going to be kind and give you a hint here this is in fact a threefold clue something i famous for among my friends 1 this is the second time the chronicles of narnia have been referenced see chapter 7 the birthday if you dontremember the first time plus if you honestly care enough to read this thing twice like i do with all my harry potter canon or good fanfiction once for enjoyment then in canon only one chapter at a time looking for clues then as a whole looking for clues you ll notice obscure references to narnia in many places i not being that kind now with all the time i put into these things yes i do about 20 hrs a chapter at least before it ever hits the computer screen then another 3 or so typing and editing before it ever seen by another human being do you really mean to tell me you honestly believe that all by accident jkr should have taught you better shakes head 2 i said wizarding version does this mean there are moving pictures or is there more to it what are we going to learn about c s lewis as regards the wizarding world i ll give you a hint in a chapter coming up remus is going to recite something the most rabid narnia fans will never have heard it ll sound vaguely familiar but i know you wontrecognise it all and why was remus so interested in that particular book 3 part of my own quirky humor but it also part of a jkr reference straight from poa the boggart in the wardrobe chapter title vs the lion the witch and the wardrobe it might help if you say it really really fast like i did and soon you ll hear it take on new sounds the lion and witch in the wardrobe lion something to be afraid of unless you know how to deal with it and witch well duh this is the harry potter universe right so for those who emailed here your hint to help train your minds and scale some of the more difficult train scale plants it should be something to really sink your teeth into 10 geez into the double digits hermione says in the first book that the outcomes of their exams will affect whether or not they are permitted to continue studying presumably so that if they are incompetent at magic they can return to the muggle world with little or no disruption to their lives train scale author notes oh merlin people i am so sorry i took so long getting this out i tried to make this nice and long to make up for it although i think being grounded beyond belief explains itpretty well sorry ratings disclaimers etc are not being posted this chapter i grounded yet again so i doing all my computer work from school i ll be answering reviews though i wontget to it today side note i ve got some pretty odd spellings going on here in the names of remus family and yes i know it short of everyone trying to teach harry their names which gets old if it not done right i ll give you the pronounciations right here everjoice is a name i took from a book and as near as i can tell is pronounced ev reh joyss margarette is pronounced just like margaret with the accent on the first syllable not the last one mary anne name was changed from the marianne you see early on in the story i still need to go change it and angelle is pronounced like angel only the a arm apple instead of long angel state take note in a review i got for this chapter yeah yeah i know i said i wouldntrevise again until the whole thing was done i was informed that my formatting is screwed up because i am using hard line breaks never heard of them but you guys are my bosses i began putting a space between every line because when i didntthe text all ran together the site has since changed several things though so i going to try going back to regular type i ll do this chapter today i got about half done the formatting should change halfway through the conversation with remus twin sisters and i going to ask that you tell me when you reviewif the new format works for you on your computer the school monitors and my monitor at home are the same size and use the same browser so i ll have no way of knowing if it screws up for someone else if it works for the majority of people the person with a ten inch screen running windows 95 doesntcount most of us are far more advanced than that i ll start reformatting everything else tomorrow i must really love you people thanks p s my yahoo email is not working so if you wish to email me just now please do so at sailorsharon7727 at sailormoon dot com enjoy haruka lune i dontunderstand what you think is so terrible about the idea remus argued he was fully aware that he was fighting a losing battle but that didntmean he was giving up typical gryffindor aims for the impossible and most of the time even achieves it getting severus snape out of the dungeons for christmas however seemed to be more than that it was a possibility that remus had finally met his match then i will spell it out for you one more time one i do not celebrate christmas two if anyone found out i spent christmas with your parents your parents and relatives i would have a good deal of delicate explaining to do to the dark lord and three the idea of meeting the family has never appealed to me more often than not it is an awkward and unpleasant process in which i am dissected and stared at as though i were a dead beetle on a card i wontdo it nobody could ever accuse severus of incoherency at least fine then i ll point a few things out to you one not everyone in my family celebrates christmas we all respect each others beliefs christmas is just a time that it convenient for all of us to get together work holidays and all you know two you could always tell him that either dumbledore made you come or i invited you and you took it as a golden opportunity to find out more about the order only to discover that people were too busy entertaining five year olds to discuss any real information and three my parents remus paused clearly struggling not to laugh trust me severus my parents are well they re well let just say they re not typical parents give it five minutes and everybody going to be acting like they ve known you forever that just the way my family is and i suppose i going to be expected to help entertain the aforementioned five year olds hardly they ll be outside most of the time anyway severus snape sighed it wasntoften he lost an argument and it always annoyed him but on the bright side he wouldnthave to deal with the teenaged brats it was his joy to teach for three whole weeks harry smash him smash him you idiot it only a rook huh remus smiled i see you re improving i wanted to ask you if you were planning on staying for christmas er well oh damn it sorry remus get off crookshanks they re only chess pieces i dontreally know harry managed between losing a bishop to ron queen and two pawns to crookshanks remus smiled again and shook his head i wouldntask except i going home for christmas and i know mum thought it would be wonderful if you came so remus caught a falling castle and returned it to its place on the chessboard then quickly swooped crookshanks off harry lap harry paused realizing only when he was kicked by a miniature horse leg that he was still holding his knight in midair are you serious i mean actually spend the hols with your family why not remus conveniently forgot to mention that severus was coming though harry had become rapidly more accepting of him their relationship was tenuous at best wow that d be i d love that no crookshanks for being so intelligent the ginger haired menace certainly didntunderstand the difference between living and charmed very well harry shook snow off his cloak and pulled off his boots staring in disbelief at the several rows by the door wow are all of those the black ones in the back are work boots one thing harry hadntknown was that remus family lived on a real one hundred percent authentic farm so they d come in past a huge barn that housed crops horses cows and a pig or to be more correct it had housed a pig until about a month ago when the pig was killed happens every year remus had informed harry conversationally apparently his parents raised their own pork off to the side of that was a massive chicken coop and beyond that harry could see farming equipment and a duck pond yes this was definitely good old devonshire countryside the house itself was well built and fairly normal looking but unbelievably small harry wasntsure how on earth remus family expected to fit so many people in especially with houseguests staying remus had said thirty nine people and he didntappear to be exaggerating remus honey it so good to see y again n which one this harry blushed as remus mother a plump little silver haired woman in a white blouse with a royal blue skirt and a white apron turned him all around to look at him and then drew him in for a hug mum do you always have to do that remus was blushing remus lupin you re bringin new family into this house i ve got every raght to find out who they are n all now ah do believe i asked you a q estchun which was exactly how she pronounced it harry had to bite the insides of his mouth to keep from laughing as remus all but shrank from his mother she was shorter than both of them harry guessed she couldntbe much more than four ten or so and had the strangest most drawn out accent harry had ever heard but it was already clear who wore the robes in this family er this is harry mum next to remus gentle tones his mother intonations sounded even more out of place well isn that wond aful she pulled harry away from her holding his shoulders and looking at him all over like he was a son she hadntseen in years coming home from war it so good to be meetin you after all remus tol me in the letters he almost nevah sends harry couldnthelp it anymore he laughed right out loud in part at the accent partly at the funny wording and most of all at the clear hint directed at remus he smiled at remus mother i glad to meet you too mrs lupin harry immediately recognized the eye rolling gesture that involved a moving of the head it was a remus trait through and through mrs lupin honestly what ve you been teachin this boy remus er harry looked at remus in a panic was lupin only his last name and not his parents or had the lupins from remus story been divorced and remarried or f r goodness sake child call me gram ev rybawd else does mrs lupin she shook her head wond aful way to give a body the shiv rin hits gram that was unusual that right you wanta take your things upstairs remus c n show you where ya goin honey put im in your old room remus cause we nevah took the bunk beds outa theya all right grab your bag harry we ve got a bit of a climb i in the attic as they wended their way up the stairs harry gave in to curiosity remus wouldntthink he was being rude remus hmm why does your mum you know talk like that remus made a face that clearly indicated he didntknow what harry was talking about like what all funny her accent acc oh oh remus started laughing harry my mum from mississippi she lived here in britain since she was twenty i guess pop met her when he was doing an internship in the states or something but she grew up in the deep south and that makes a lot of difference really you ll get used to it i might need a translator until i do harry quipped and both of them laughed the entire rest of the way up the stairs so what re you findin so important tch ve gotta stop writin t ya mother remus here is ere nough butter in this gram offered remus a spoonful of some kind of dough remus stuck the spoon in his mouth and then announced from around a mouthful of dough mmph phher bffit neemph shmmggphh gram gave him a dirty look remus remus swallowed with difficulty sorry mum now you wanta tell me what it was you were tryin to say remus blushed i only said it got enough butter but not enough sugar because they get rolled in sugah when they done remus y say that ev ry year n ev ry year i gotta tell you they get rolled in sugah when they done bakin n when t othah one goin t get here anyway darlin thought he was comin with ya harry turned and glared at remus his eyes emeralds of suspicion what other one remus if remus had been blushing before it was nothing to what he did now dontget mad harry but oh no no way remus you didnt mum said to invite him remus moved to the kitchen window to stare out at the road broodingly and you need to learn to get along with him anyway harry and here there are plenty of other people to talk to if you i think that him mum remus announced indicating a lone figure in a long black travelling cloak with a black hood pulled up far enough to conceal the face well now aintthat wond aful he does know t come in by the sayd door donthe gram peered around remus shoulder to stare out the window just in time for the black clad figure to traipse up the snowy beat out path to the side door off the kitchen mmm hmm remus turned around just in time to see harry disappear into the shadows of the kitchen corner harry stop that you act like he going to murder you for being here when eep the strange extremely un remus like squeak at the end was instigated by a now cloakless severus snape seizing remus around the waist and picking him right up off the stone tiled floor to announce his presence i ought to drop you for giving me the wrong directions you overgrown puppy sna severus growled though he in fact merely set remus back in the same place he d been standing harry decided he d better get used to that if they were going to be here for almost two weeks i what remus looked confused you told me to turn right at the bridge i wandered around like a fool for almost two bloody hours before i found someone willing to give directions well then that your own fault for not knocking on a door people dontbite around here severus gram clucked disapprovingly wanderin round in a storm layk this it a wunda you dintfreeze to death out theya for the first time severus seemed to realize there was someone else in the room er remus quickly picked up the slack with his usual grace mum this is severus severus this is my mother everjoice who is going to make sure you leave fifteen pounds heavier than you were when you showed up harry suppressed his laughter as severus formally extended his hand it a pleasure to meet you mrs lupin gram squawked there wasntmuch of any other word for it mrs again remus what have you been tellin these ones remus only blushed so harry supplied aid from his own recent experiences she told me to call her gram severus raised his eyebrows gram er well it was harry turn to blush well he fam ly aint e mum fine remus slipped back into the conversation mum he still calls minerva and filius professor i guarantee you there no way he ll come in here and start calling you mum he turned to severus she lets people call her everjoice if they ve got a stick so far up their behinds they cantcall her anything else harry privately held the opinion that one of these days severus face was going to freeze that way and he d have to walk around forever looking like he had no eyebrows i beg your pardon denied remus replied cheerfully where your he showed rather than spoke luggage by glancing significantly at severus hands and then around the general area gesturing with his own hands in the breezeway right then i ll get it and mum where severus staying remus moved easily from statement to question in one fluid verbal movement in your room a course gram supplied remus instantly took on the visage of a man ready to have an apoplectic fit but mu um that completely inappropriate i ve got harry upstairs with me and there only two beds gram stared at him as though either this hadntoccurred to her or she hadntconsidered it a difficulty and is there anythin wrong with two responsible people sleepin in the same bed when we re already short on space no yes i dontknow mum we re that doesnt that doesntwork it just no look i ll sleep on the sofa and you ll do no such thang remus lupin and you oughta know better by now if n it bothers you so much you c n take the rug right in your own room n do it your own self we need that dav nport f r cath rine husband if n e ever gets in she got the lit l ones sleepin with her this time stead a puttin em in sleepin bags up with remus gram informed harry in a sort of aside but i oh fine but i warning you mum if i wake up dead tomorrow because i was interrupting his precious beauty sleep it your fault do you understand me i ll resk it now git along upstairs with you all so you c n git back daywn here t go see ev rybawdy else they ve been a waitin for you severus paused in the doorway to the living room the sound of voices was quite loud er what exactly are these people like remus they wonteat you remus answered nonsympathetically pulling on severus arm until they were inside the doorway then remus whistled on two fingers conversations stopped and several people glared at him the redhead harry d seen in the picture waved at them with a cheerful call of hello there angel boy remus beamed right everyone i here and he pulled harry out from behind him while several people took advantage of the pause to murmur or in the case of the little kids shout their greetings this is harry and he turned to extract severus from the woodwork only to discover he was missing he looked up and saw the black haired man moving behind the twins mary anne and margarette severus was trying to read something that one of the girls was holding up to check the recitation of the other who chanted along obliviously as conversations slowly picked up again all around them he appeared to be becoming more and more amused as mary anne continued her educated babble at a regular rate 1 order of ravenclaw upon his graduation in 1978 being only the two hundredth peson to ever receive it he quickly crowned this achievement with his post hogwarts studies becoming the youngest master in his field since regulations were imposed four i mean five hundred years ago and published a paper on his discovery in 1981 that aconite and silverwort would neutralize each other when mixed in appropriate quantities although he left his work in the british department of mysteries after the death of the dark lord also in 1981 he joined a ministry team in october no november sorry of 1986 that created a prototype of the potion commonly today known as the wolfsbane or lunar denial potion and in 1987 recieved an award for exemplary field work upon completing a project that proved the possibility of someday creating a potion that would enable a drinker to remove selected memories for the purpose of study in a manner akin to that of a pensieve in may of 1989 he refined the basic healing potion halving the number of ingredients to make it more effective and less costly what are you doing mary anne remus inquired as the freckled waif completely lost her self control and snatched the book from margarette to check the last date which she was certain she d messed up terribly reciting passages for a presentation we have to give when we go back after the hols mary anne responded still scanning the page for the date of the healing potion what kind of presentation on an influential witch or wizard from the 20th century march she wailed march of 1989 it no use maggie i never going to get this whole thing done right why cantyou do it who are you doing for your presentation remus prodded severus snape he the youngest potions master ever he was the only decent choice on the list really imagine doing marten gatlinson ugh i stutter when i get nervous rags and what was so bad about gatlinson margarette demanded tugging her book angrily out of her mirror hands as remus tried to stifle his laughter he invented the hermaphroditic hex 2 maggie have you ever seen that thing performed it disgusting wait a minute was the freckle removal potion in 1975 or 1976 i wrote it down here as 1976 but i think it was in 1975 i guess it doesnt matter much but we ll lose points for it if it wrong and a lot of people know about it it not like i dontknow veritaserum or something where it restricted and a year difference wouldntmatter because nobody would know it anyway i wish we could get an interview joely travers is doing nickolas merchand and she got an interview i wonder if he takes owl post mary anne chewed absentmindedly on her little finger as she reviewed the notebook sitting open on her lap in which it appeared she d been trying to create their presentation seemingly the problem of potions masters and owl post had passed from her mind until a black clad arm crossed over her shoulder and tapped the page the original test was in 1974 and it was approved for general use in 1979 actually severus informed the unsuspecting twin who let out a strangely high yipes and jumped about a foot twisting on her stool for the first time in his life severus wished that he owned a camera and had been holding it at that moment the look on the girl face was priceless first she stared quite openly for all of about five very long seconds then she twisted around again quite quickly and yanked the book from margarette yet again ripping two pages in the process margarette let out a small cry of dismay and flipped back about five pages to study the picture next to the biography name at which point she looked up again at severus and then held the book up so as to see both faces at once her mouth fell open and her eyes bulged and then she fainted nobody around them missed a beat except for harry who had been playing with the little kids and now jumped up in alarm remus and margarette had caught mary anne easily and rachael simply passed remus her handkerchief which she d somehow wetted to wipe mary anne face the girl recovered promptly and blinked twice before informing her brother that she d just seen the curiousest thing i swear remy he was standing right behind you remus ducked his head not sure whether to blush laugh or just point upward his dilemma was solved when severus crouched down next to where remus had forced mary anne to sit on the floor until he was sure she wasntgoing to faint again it had a tendency to run in the family are you all right concern was evident in severus voice certainly he d made people faint before but a wand and a stunning spell were usually involved mary anne blinked again and then stuttered are you i mean you re you re you cantbe did you urck remy remus did start laughing then this is severus mary anne his fiestiest sibling immediately attempted to scramble into a more dignified position and started to babble again oh gosh wow i mean i really sorry it just we ve been doing a lot in my brewing class with your work and i only well i mean how did you do all that before you were even eighteen i mean that got to take a lot of talent but nothing was even published for ages i wasnteven aware i was in any textbooks severus commented picking the abused volume from the floor and flipping through it to find the much more worn section the twins had been using then he furrowed his brow brewing class you go to an american school remus cut in the girls took a placement exam albus thought they might take higher qualifications than the n e w t standard and both of them got scholarships to gemini taurus gemini taurus what that and what a brewing class harry reminded them of his presence a brewing class is the american version of potions harry remus informed his ward and gemini taurus is the gemini taurus new england magical academic institute for girls very small very select i surprised hermione didnttry to transfer there to be honest they only take an entry level class of ninety students a year but she could probably have passed the exams to get in i took one out of curiosity and passed it but of course i couldntexactly go to a girls school mary anne meanwhile had been chattering away with severus informing him of some kind of experimentation she d been doing with a painkiller potion he d invented the one drawback to the potion in question was the fact that it was highly hallucenogenic apparently mary anne had discovered a way to lessen the delusional effects without impairing the potion effectiveness severus turned to remus at the pause in the conversation with harry he pointed at mary anne raised his eyebrows slightly and informed his partner already i like this girl remus started laughing so loudly that several of his siblings and in laws paused to give him some kind of lupinish glare that told him he d better either shut up or get on with it so he shared the joke the laughter spread the ice was broken all right you lot get over here remus was hoarse from talking and laughing all through dinner but that couldntstop a lupin family tradition what in the name of merlin are you doing remus severus was less enthusiastic to say the least reading a christmas carol we do it every year or i should say i do it every year it means i donthave to do the dishes come on everyone or are we all going to bed early remus bed threat did the trick his nieces and nephews plus mary anne and margarette and the three younger lupin siblings crowded around the christmas tree remus was sitting under and little remus tried to crawl into his uncle lap he was displaced by his youngest cousin a chubby eighteen month old named angelle but wasntgoing down without a fight and so finally remus made one sit with mary anne and the other sit with margarette on opposite sides of the group at that point harry came racing in yanking on an old gray t shirt as he did so apparently he d been helping with dishes a pretty lively task even with all adults doing it when the kids were involved soap fights were inevitable and plonked down next to severus so hard the windows rattled in his favor they were pretty old windows remus looked up at him and smiled and then opened his old battered leatherbound copy of the book and began to read for a group of kids everyone was pretty quiet until ebenezer scrooge spoke his first words sounding like a cranky version of ollivander and then uproar broke out that not scrooge remy ty hollered and the twins frowned identical disapproval yes that true you ve always given scrooge a very nice voice margarette commented it sexy melody chimed in uber sexy mary anne emphasized margarette looked scandalized prompting remus to ask her where on earth she d ever learned a word like uber sexy apparently one of her roommates at school used it scrooge isntsupposed to have a nice voice you guys i just always used that voice because the beginning tints of a blush were slowly creeping up remus cheeks well i liked it but it doesntreally fit scrooge is supposed to be an old man but you cant just change scrooge remy mary anne lamented it not the same severus raised an eyebrow i think you ve been outnumbered remus that it raena scrambled up onto her knees and pointed at severus staring at her brother accusingly remy you promised you wouldntread it to anyone else unless they were here for christmas at this point remus could have hidden himself very well in a basket of strawberries but he stood his ground anyway i didnt read it to anyone else raena he protested and the thirteen year old pouted then why did he know the scrooge voice raena demanded remus blushed even more heavily and severus raised his eyebrow again you ve been using my voice for years haventyou he commented and remusnodded still blushing furiously it just seemed to fit remus left the bathroom soaking wet and breathless and shepherded the last of the little kids into kelli room it had taken him nearly twenty minutes to remember that the only way to bathe a two year old without waking everyone in the house was to get in the tub right along with them and when he d finally done so he d immediately gotten a foot to the stomach for his efforts in his nephew favor remus had the feeling it was an attempt to splash not kick he plodded up the twenty one unlit old wooden steps that led to the attic feeling his way along the walls like an unsteady toddler and pushed open the ancient oak door two minutes hard work wet jeans and tiny buttons on a similarly soaked flannel shirt were nothing to laugh at saw him crouching in front of his suitcase in nothing but his own skin he wondered vaguely if he d even brought anything but his old cutoff shorts and t shirts and then wondered why he cared when the door opened again and an embarrassingly familiar voice inquired do we just leave everything up here or do the packages go downstairs remus let out a sort of startled squeal and harry mmnnnnpphh ed from the top bunk he d gone to bed right after the story was over remus dragged an overlarge t shirt quickly over his head let me make myself decent and we ll take everything down mmm severus sat wand straight on the edge of the bed and waited he had no idea where remus had hidden the parcels to keep prying young eyes and fingers at bay so he didnthave much choice of activities remus finally located an old pair of flannel pajama bottoms and tugged them on his progress hampered by his still damp feet they insisted on continuously getting caught in the legs finally he put a finger to his lips and motioned severus toward the closet pulling out his wand and whispering lumos as he opened the old door and beckoned the taller man right into the wardrobe severus opened his mouth to ask what on earth they were doing but remus shushed him and opened another door in the back of the closet apparently it was some kind of hidden room or priest hole though severus doubted the house was anywhere near old enough to have a priest hole because remus ducked inside and immediately began to pass out boxes of presents severus stacked three on top of each other and then another two next to them remus finally slipped out of the cubbyhole in the back of the closet and picked up a stack of boxes severus followed suit and the pair carefully maneuvered down the stairs it took half an hour to put everything under the enormous christmas tree and by the time the two men were done they were both exhausted it was hard to blame them staying up until two o clock in the morning could do that remus sat down under the tree again with a slight uhnnn sound severus sat down next to him and as soon as he d done so remus laid right back underneath the massive branches what the bloody hell do you think you re doing severus demanded remus only grinned grabbed the back of severus shirt collar and pulled him down look up wha remus slipped his hand over severus mouth and pushed his head gently down to the floor just look up straight up severus finally complied and what he saw was enough to make his breath hitch he had assumed that sixteen years of hogwarts gaudy decorations would leave him prepared for anything but he hadntever seen anything like this remus family apparently preferred the tiny little muggle lights which were pretty enough to someone completely unused to seeing them but even more than that were the ornaments 3 most of them made of hand blown glass and heavy yet fragile the tiny amount of space he could see contained part of a glass village an intricately painted teddy bear riding on a rocking horse two porcelain angels a large gold ball and several long glistening icicles he reached up to touch one certain that these were everlasting icicles like the ones he d seen in the school and was shocked beyond belief to discover that they were just glass ornaments painted carefully on the inside with crystal colored paint in such a way that they looked completely real as he shifted to lay back under the tree again he caught sight of another ornament this one home made with the red headed woman picture in it he turned to remus to ask about it but remus headed him off mum makes them every year and then saves them in shoe boxes she calls them her memory keepers or something like that that one there is catherine severus nodded and looked up again slightly befuddled by the red white and green thing hanging down in front of his nose what is this it a candy cane the little kids love them remus explained pulling several strands of silvery threadlike flotsam from a branch and trailingthem over severus face with that funny not quite giggle you look ridiculous you re the one who put it there severus responded crossly brushing it irritably off his face i never asked to have cobwebs strewn over my person it tinsel severus remus rejoined impatiently as though this were the most obvious thing in the world not cobwebs he paused for a moment you ve never seen a hand decorated tree before have you severus closed his eyes my mother was the one in our family who loved christmas after she died when i was six my father wanted nothing to do with it i didntsee another christmas tree up close until i went to hogwarts and by then i really didnt care he opened his eyes again and turned his face toward remus who was staring at him incredulously you mean you ve never celebrated christmas properly since you were six severus nodded that ridiculous remus declared pushed himself up on one elbow and kissed severus just above his eye both of them immediately flushed and looked in opposite directions remus cast his eyes around the room once and then back to severus who looked back to remus at almost exactly the same moment i going to make sure this is the best christmas you ve ever had it already is severus responded and remus instantly felt terrible to think that so little had been required to make it the best but then severus continued and the guilt left him i have never been with a group of people who made me feel so completely like i belonged with them i wouldnthave that if you hadntdragged me here to begin with remus smiled so you admit you were wrong severus heaved himself up and pulled remus up against his side relishing for just a moment the childish magic worked by a lit christmas tree in a darkened room i was not wrong i merely expressed an alternative point of view remus shook his head he d won one argument in the past week he wasntgoing to push it of course he looked at his watch and all but jumped merlin i supposed to be up at five thirty i ve got to get to bed then let go shall we severus inquired and remus nodded the blonde took two steps and then turned to look at his partner curiously i will join you shortly severus informed him trying to shoo him out of the room without making undignified hand motions remus took the hint and left the room slowly turning once to look back at the tree and the man crouching in front of it when severus was completely certain remus was gone he pulled a small plainly wrapped package from his pocket and nestled it between a box covered in snowman giftwrap and one of the little kids forgotten sweaters he stood up and looked down on it then he turned and made his way to the attic not looking back the surprisingly short reference notes 1 i perfectly aware that mary anne recitation isntthe most grammatically correct nor is it the clearest but for one she is trying to remember these things from memory and out of a wizarding book said books not being particularly understandable at the best of times for another if you re really interested to know all the events basically set out here and you cantfollow the carefully crafted as unintelligible babble which wouldntsurprise me since i kept deliberatelyrewriting it until icouldntunderstand it upon proofreading email me at freesongspirit at yahoo dot com and i ll be glad to set out a quick list for you 2 as you probably suspect this hex changes someone gender but gatlinson wasntvery good with his work and so there are often strange side effects like women who have no common sense and refuse to stop for directions sorry guys 3 i feel i must give credit where it due for this tree the ornaments on this tree all belong ed some are gone now to my family and the family of my best friend or were at the very least inspired by ornaments we own ed some also come from a tree in a house my mother and i stayed in for three days when we were on vacation the christmas every day house ever since my dad had a heart attack a week before christmas that was four years ago and mom ended up in the hospital at all hours of the day and night to be with him it been my job to decorate the tree the year that daddy was hospitalized he came home with mom on christmas eve and they got to see the tree just as i plugged it in in the dark for the first time i ve never seen such a pretty tree and i sneaked out of bed that night to go lay under the tree and just feel happy i must have stayed there for an hour looking right up through the branches and i realized that you ve never seen the prettiest part of a christmas tree until you ve lain underneath one hence remus love of doing this honestly try it sometime it beautiful liner notes as you will notice until i update the old chapter i changed my format the text was too close together for me at least to read it looks pretty weird as a document but maybe it will space normally on here this time a u warning as i stated in the last chapter this features a slightly a u ending to order of the phoenix which you will see in flashback form in this chapter i admit to stealing some of the text from the book directly preceding this incident so as to not take credit for anything not mine i will state that all of the flashback minus harry and remus conversation can be found on the last page of the american hardback of phoenix and was used by me only to give some context to the conversation i created disclaimer still in that fluffy blue bathrobe still got short strawberry blonde hair and still no professional manicure job nope they re not mine if they were harry and remus would live happily ever after in a world like this every single day oh yes and the face on the milk carton a movie from which i took an idea for this doesntbelong to me either well technically i guess it does since i recorded it off tv but oh i going to shut up now archiving see ch 1 please rating pg k for this chapter but this will be going up to pg 13 t very quickly reviewers a huge thank you to evilredshyguy and sharivari i love reviews they are my bread and wine as to karen i love ya girl see you in algebra dedication the fic is dedicated to eleonora1 and immortalflic k but this chapter also has a kudos and a te quiero to my best friend alicia who unknowingly helped me write the part about harry box monday brought several new changes for harry first of all aunt petunia had handed him a new shirt and pants new and told him to get dressed he didnthave to cook and for the first time he could ever remember the dursleys were being something close to civil it was unnerving harry hoped they wouldnttreat remus too badly he knew all too well what remus clothes and car if he even had one were likely to make the dursleys think if they would only focus on the person instead of the picture harry thought they d be so much happier he sat up straight riveted on his bed he d retired to his room tired of watching aunt petunia grinding her teeth and uncle vernon pacing from the living room through the dining room and kitchen and back again waiting for the sign boy harry sighed and stood up from the sound of his own hailing remus had most likely received a less than warm welcome he was stunned when he finally made it down the stairs and into the living room remus was sitting on the sofa with percy weasley and a cup of tea remus wearing clothes that looked almost as new as the jeans and polo shirt harry was wearing harry wasntsure what to do with himself and so finally after gaping for what he was sure was a rude amount of time he shambled over to the sofa and hugged remus awkwardly erm he neednthave worried remus hugged him back warmly managing somehow to set his tea on a coaster before he did so it good to see you again harry i remus stood up i thought so you grew he suddenly pouted mischievously you do realize in another year you re going to be taller than me harry shook his head and grinned it was good to know that he could at least be taller than remus and the creevey brothers if nobody else erm oh aunt petunia uncle vernon this is remus lupin he s well he harry trailed off he wasntentirely sure what he should be calling remus now so potter give us a shout if you need us if we donthear from you for three days in a row we ll send someone along aunt petunia whimpered piteously it could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path bye then potter said moody grasping harry shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand keep in touch harry could i for just a moment lupin requested of the dursleys and then steered harry around the edge of a column harry listen i know now might not be the best time to bring this up but i thought maybe lupin suddenly looked awkward harry after sirius got out of azkaban after wemet up again that is he told me he wanted me to take you if anything ever happened to him i thought if you wanted me to try and get dumbledore to agree i could get the papers these things work differently in the wizarding world and it wouldntbe that hard i could become your legal guardian if we could talk dumbledore into it what would you think harry eyes grew wide are you serious when can i come can we go now where do you live how long lupin cut him off with a raised hand i d have to talk to dumbledore first harry and you know how stubborn he is but your family doesntlook like it made of the kind of people i d care to spend my holiday with that sounds about right so all we have to do is convince dumbledore that you d be better off with me i ll do my best harry if you want me to try and talk him into it definitely keep in touch then harry and i ll see what i can do harry had indeed kept in touch with the soft spoken man who was soon to be his legal guardian according to percy so that right now he was rewarded with percy explaining to the dursleys the basics of a transfer of guardianship and their rights and responsibilities in the matter he was thrilled when aunt petunia signed her name and then told him to wait here since harry had nothing else to do until percy and remus had finished their tea he waited and soon aunt petunia returned from a sojourn into the attic with a box about twice the size of a shoe box perhaps a bit bigger this is yours boy harry lifted off the lid hesitantly and felt tears prickle in his eyes the box contained a handful of photographs from his childhood a baby book two small spoons a pair of shoes two small photograph albums which upon opening he discovered had belonged to his parents a pair of wedding rings and his acceptance letter from hogwarts she lily she would have turned in her grave if she d thought for an instant i didntkeep something for you boy i d no desire to have her haunting me for the rest of my life harry looked up eyes still burning and nodded in thanks trying to find his voice i thank you aunt petunia aunt petunia nodded and seeing that percy and remus were finished nodded once in a prompt well go along then harry followed remus out to the car his trunk was in the back and hedwig plus cage were in the back seat and slipped in next to hedwig buckling his seat belt in excited anticipation he still held the old box on his lap liner notes i only have a couple of minutes so i only answering reviews real quick and then off to posted story land yulara whassup i grounded again what else isntnew yes the idea of severus with hateful father and no mother is somewhat overused and yes i gave you that idea but just think i just started planning a story aided by a million magazine articles about star wars in which his parents turn out to have been siblings and didntknow it until after he was born along with three siblings of his own snicker i evil thepurpleemperor severus mushy never gasps in horror i just wanted to show a bit of why he hates his past so much camille yours is my favorite review so this chapter is dedicated to you and your friend guess why it my fave lol i hope you like this chapter too dewnymph hello there i glad you like it yes trees are fun one thing though harry master thesis is a reference not to the degree as we think of it but to exemplary knowledge for example severus is a potions master and it quite likely he wontget it for some time he just trying right now enjoy harry harry batted once lazily at the air go away hermione harry sugah it gram i dontwant to go to the library it aintthe lahbraray sweetheart it remus ah aftuh harry rolled over and almost fell out of the bunk bed hunh gram smiled ah sawrry to wake ya at en hour layk this n child but ah lookin fur remus n since this is hees room ah wuz wunderin if you d seen im harry pulled himself up on his elbows and grabbed at his watch it a qwatah to six sugah what d you want him so early for mmmnnnn severus rolled over on the bottom bed and blinked once it was something he took pride in that he was awake as soon as he stopped sleeping that was to say truly awake and not just walking around looking it gram jumped way ull nayw if n ah d a known you was awake ah d not ve woken this un ve you seen remus it was at this particular moment that remus reentered the room shirtless wet and with his pajama pants pulled on in such a careless manner that they revealed more than they hid upon seeing his mother standing next to his bed remus gasped and tried to yank the pants up to his waist whether or not he succeeded was a matter of opinion he pulled them up properly but then unknowingly caught his hand in the drawstring causing them to fall right back down when he lowered his hand back to his side oh of all the remus lupin ah ve been lookin fur you fur the payst haylf an hour d you wanter explaiyn where you ve been remus pulled a blue and black plaid flannel shirt out of his suitcase it seemed like everything the man had packed was made of flannel denim or wool and tugged it on struggling to button it in the semidark i got a shower mum in case you didntnotice you were not the one bathing the babies last night i was and there was no hot water left by the time i got peter to bed way ull go dray your hayr you aintgoin out to the barn with your hayr all soppin layk thayat gram turned and left and instantly harry was suspiciously full of energy why are you going to the barn remus what going on that you ve got to be up so early is something wrong remus laughed and tugged his side of the covers straight just chores harry animals donttake holidays you know harry sat straight up so quickly that remus said a quick thank you for sleeping in the attic any normal bedroom in the house and the teen would have given himself a concussion can i help remus shook his head goodnaturedly harry farm chores arenteasy it takes years of practice to do some of them right and they re really not all that fun come on remus i want to help you said you had horses harry had discovered a great love of the equestrian animals after a hay ride he d taken with his guardian the horses pulling the cart had been gorgeous remus rolled his eyes meet me in the breezeway where we came in yesterday in five minutes any more and you stay inside got it harry jumped over the side railing and landed on the floor in nothing but his underwear got it harry yeah where are your pajamas harry shrugged what good are summer pajamas in the middle of december remus sighed i knew i should have gotten you a pair when i went up to london to get those extra textbooks harry hurried down the rickety old stairs two at a time followed at a more dignified pace by severus who had insisted that almost all country families did a lot of cooking and he d rather be making coffee or biscuits than laying in bed trying to fall back asleep harry left the black haired man standing in the kitchen and raced down into the breezeway just in time to see remus pulling on a pair of knee high black rubber boots pick a pair kiddo remus greeted nodding toward the boots on his feet harry pulled a pair out of the pile and tried them on too big three pairs later he finally found some that fit passably remus handed him a positively ancient brown coat with enormous pockets and nodded toward the door harry had just enough time to wonder if he should ask about gloves before remus tugged at his arm and pulled him in the direction of the barn apparently gloves werentsomething he d need harry discovered as they entered the gigantic wooden structure to the sound of lowing remus hurried to pull a three legged stool from the wall and opened a stall motioning harry inside stay slow and on the left harry remus instructed sitting the stool down have you ever seen anyone milk a cow harry shook his head well now you re going to and you re going to learn how to do it it not as easy as you d think remus pushed a bucket under the pink udder the cow lowed again now that enough sadie i ve got you now a warm stream of milk streaked into the pail harry watched somewhat amazed certainly he knew that milk came from cows and that someone had to milk that cow it was simply that he rarely considered the fact when pouring white cold sterilized milk out of a cardboard container as compared to the cream colored foamy stuff slowly filling the pail harry huh harry looked up quickly and remus quickly turned the teat he was milking squirting a long stream right into harry mouth remus harry protested milk dribbling down his chin watch it remus scolded that perfectly good milk you re wasting harry obediently closed his mouth and tried to swallow although his laughing was causing a bit of difficulty he finally got down the mouthful and then immediately licked his face to see if there was any more that really good where did you learn that remus just smiled and shook his head harry i ve been doing farm chores since i was six and a half i d be more worried if i couldntdo it and just imagine this when you go back to school you can tell hermione you ve had milk straight from the cow harry laughed so hard he had to lean against the rough wooden side of the stall and sadie the cow mooed in alarm remus calmed her again before finishing his work explaining it to harry as he did and then taking the milk pail out of the stall and setting it with seven others lined up next to the door we ll take it in when we go inside you re not afraid of heights are you now there a stupid question i keep forgetting i not talking to sirius or davey 1 i talking to a quidditch player i ll go first remus motioned to a ladder that would take them about forty feet up right into the hay loft harry was near the top when remus stopped and sat at the top of the ladder blocking harry from getting into the loft harry harry just stared at him remus had suddenly gone quite serious and harry wasntsure why harry remus seemed about to pose a difficult statement so harry tried to help him along with it although he didntdo too good a job remus my hands are starting to hurt er sorry remus scooted back so harry could get in a little closer harry i didntwant you out here yet because i ve got something out here for you and i didntwant you to see it before breakfast but i guess it really doesntmatter i talked to a few people before i got it and all of them agreed you d like it but if you donti can remus the biggest christmas gift i ever got from the dursleys was a coat hanger can i just come up now remus pulled him hesitantly into the loft keeping hold of his ward shoulders with good reason harry had barely started pulling himself forward into the dusty smelling hay before a loud shrill bark echoed through the dimly lit loft and harry was hit with ten pounds of ears tail paws and fur the puppy immediately launched itself into harry lap barked again stuck its nose in harry ear and sniffed deeply hey that tickles harry laughed at the puppy and pushed it off his lap and then his breath caught in his throat the puppy sitting in front of him was all black except for a single patch of white fur with its eye right in the very center and it almost looked like harry hey are you still in there remus waved his hand in front of harry face harry twisted around the puppy didntseem very happy with being on the floor of the loft so it had climbed right back into harry lap effectively taking away his ability to use his legs and stared wide eyed at remus who reached forward to pull a piece of straw out of the teen hair is it it he male harry about twelve weeks old pop called me a few weeks ago and said he d seen the strangest thing harry yelped as the puppy stuck its cold wet nose between the buttons on his shirt then blushed sorry remus grinned no problem it better than what he pulled yesterday when i came up to play with him so he wouldntbe alone normally he in the house but i didntwant you to see him what did he do remus pulled the wandering fuzz ball away from the ladder he peed on me harry laughed loudly and the puppy started to bark but you were saying oh right so pop told me about this little fellow and i asked if he could put down a deposit and i d pay him back and then he told me he d already brought the dog home harry stared openmouthed your dad bought me a dog no no not really remus answered and harry stared at him perplexed remus hurried to explain around here we still do a lot of trading for things it easier for everyone to get what they need that way with no hard feelings so anyway pop fixed widow harper fence she the one whose dog had the pups really sweet woman got her fence knocked down in a storm in exchange for the puppy people do that kind of thing around here harry pulled the puppy back in his lap not quite sure what to say he looks like he has a star over his eye remus smiled i know i ve actually been looking since september but i didntwant one that was all black because he stopped the train of words as though he d cut it off with a knife anyway i took one look at him pop said if he wasntwhat i was looking for then he and mum would keep him and train him as a farm dog and thought he was perfect i figure he can stay in my quarters during the school year and we can take him out after classes and on the weekends and then in the summer we ll find a nice place with a big yard and you can teach him to play fetch without running away if he not as dumb as my first dog was that hound couldntfind a steak on a clean tile floor he paused i know you just met him harry but we need to start trying to get him to answer to a name so if you could try to think of one today the puppy interrupted by sniffing remus pant cuff and lifting his leg oh no you don t not again remus hurried out of the path of attack scooting backward on all fours and harry started laughing again can we call him snuffles severus pushed aside a pile of carefully chopped onions he d opted to help everjoice in the kitchen as opposed to going out to the barn with remus and harry seeing as he already knew what was out there and thought remus might want some time alone with his ward and started in on a red pepper 2 with sure hands before giving voice to the question that had been vaguely bothering him all night mrs everjoice everjoice looked up from the bread dough she was kneading for dinner that afternoon of course and smiled you gawt somethin on you mind hun severus overlooked the hated pet name in favor of asking his question that girl the redheaded woman i think remus called her catherine thayat catherine sure nough hun whuddabout er why in the name of merlin does she keep calling remus angel boy everjoice slowed and stopped her kneading thinking a bit wayull hun nobawdy really knows fur sure anymawah but it seems ter metit started when you

should hope so dontwawnt im ter feel alone he had bout nough a thayat at that point harry and remus staggered into the kitchen carrying two milk pails apiece and laughing remus had a backpack on and as soon as he d set the milk pails down he pulled it off carefully and set it on the kitchen table opening it and starting to pull out eggs here harry you ve got the pencil date them for me we always use the older ones first and what we cantuse we ll take to town ah kin assure you we ll be usin em all fer today at least everjoice commented and held her hand out jist you pass em on ovah we ve been a waitin on you all pour yesself a glass a milk sugah b fore th cream rises breakfast was excellent barring the fact that harry discovered he didntreally care for grits nor yet for spiced apples and felt quite embarrassed about it until gram hugged him and told him she didntmind and it surely would be a boring world if a body was always takin a likin ter the same thangs another body did all er the time it was a cliched phrase mississippi accent or no but harry still felt much better after she gave him some toast and told him to see if the preserves were more to his liking they were only once did he look up after biting into his toast and omelette and that was to laugh secretly at remus who was sitting across from him acting like he hadnteaten in years when everyone was finished it took a good forty five minutes gram set the dishes to wash themselves explaining that there were very few times she ever did it because things were more likely to get broken but for today she thought they d manage it didnttake too long to settle everyone into the living room and get the little kids occupied with stockings full of apples oranges chocolate coins and tiny presents like mittens and jacob ladders quickly following that remus began to pull packages out from under the tree and pass them around to the people old enough to truly appreciate them these being the people who cared for what was in the packages not for whatever new trend those packages might conceal barbie dolls were a nauseating and recurrent favorite among the rugrats harry noticed that most of them were roughly the same size and shape and that only tags and paper colors seemed to vary suddenly remus stopped holding in his lap a package covered in moving harry assumed they were supposed to be falling snowflakes and groaned mum gram gently pulled a toddler forgotten sweater from under the tree as she answered remus lupin you may be thirty six years old but you re still my child now you c n open it er else ah c n open it for you n leave it up on your bed remus blushed heavily and began to pull the paper carefully off the package when at last he d pulled the final swathes of wrapping from around the contents harry leaned over to see what was inside that remus found so embarrassing he didntsee anything to be upset over a cardigan sweater 3 well that would explain remus seemingly never ending supply of them was wrapped around two dime novels 4 and a large bar of hazelnut creme chocolate from honeydukes next to the books and chocolate bar sat a coffee mug with words on it remus picked it up and turned it around to read it grinning wryly mum whut is it remus remus turned the cup one more time as though to make sure he d read it correctly what exactly does the phrase love me love my socks have to do with a coffee mug several people started laughing as gram just pointed peacefully to the toe socks remus was wearing a gift from some smart aleck at the school they were covered in foot related words and definitions taken right out of the dictionary remus wiggled his toes defensively before passing a package to harry harry had received many wonderful gifts since he d started at hogwarts and made friends a firebolt an invisibility cloak exciting books and for his sixteenth birthday a small photo album with pictures of himself and his friends courtesy of remus who apparently had a camera stashed away somewhere never before had a gift led him to cry crying might even have been too harsh a term for the action certainly he blinked away tears but he was by no means bawling like a toddler this package was from gram a relative who had never even met him before yesterday and the time and thought she d put into it was clear and present harry hadntgotten a sweater for which he was secretly thankful he already had far more than he knew what to do with but instead a crocheted throw blanket that was absolutely the perfect size for curling up under in the common room with his homework a small pouch on the front of the blanket revealed that it could be folded up and used as a pillow harry looked up to say thank you but as he did remus waved him back toward the parcel harry you re missing the best part open it up she never puts only one thing in a package harry carefully unfolded the remainder of the blanket and discovered his own mug sort of an hourglass shape that fit his hand comfortably with four flavored tea bags orange lemon cinnamon and chamomile stuck inside it next to the mug was a mason jar that according to the label on the lid contained enough homemade hot chocolate mix for two cups add one good friend and stir serve hot intrigued now harry began turning out various folds of the blanket and looking inside the pouch he found a book of puzzles and riddles a rubik cube and a wooden pull string top 5 he was slightly stunned he d never had toys of his own before not even a stuffed animal as a baby and it had never occurred to him that there were still toys for which he wasnt too old he stacked the items carefully near the arm of the sofa and reached under the tree to find out what else was under there and for whom fully enjoying christmas for the first time it took nearly two hours to open everything if only because there were so many people and presents and of course thank yous had to be said and pictures taken harry wasntsure how on earth he was going to fit everything into his trunk in addition to gram package he was now the proud and grateful owner of several books on various subjects a gift certificate to quality quidditch supplies he hadnteven been aware gift certificates existed in the wizarding world a set of drawing pencils and a sketch book a journal a portable cassette player charmed to work even under high magic conditions several cassettes a framed and rather goofy truth be told picture of his friends at fright night and some kind of pen with ink that changed colors and never ran out and it worked on parchment on top of all that in addition to the gifts from his new family he d gotten his annual weasley sweater green with a snitch on the front a chudley cannons poster from ron a rather heavy book that seemed to be some kind of dark arts dictionary from hermione a tin of treacle fudge from hagrid he hid it carefully in the fear that some unsuspecting child might cement their jaws together with it and several small and varied packages of candy from a few of his less close friends harry was slightly surprised to find a blue wrapped package from luna containing two seashells and an interesting piece of driftwood along with a note telling him she was on holiday in wales and while it was much too cold to swim she d found these while walking along the beach and thought he might like them it was while he examined one of the shells that remus the little one picked up a small box shaped object from the floor and handed it to remus the older one apparently it had been lost in the sea of wrapping paper and ribbons and it was only when the rugrats went searching to see if anything had been missed that it was found remus turned it curiously looking at it from all angles and directions before slipping off the brown paper and finding a simple wooden box with gold colored hinges lock and catch he swung the catch and raised the lid before gasping loudly enough for several people to draw completely erroneous conclusions as to what was in the box and for harry mary anne and melody to all scramble around to see it sitting in a small square of white tissue paper was the dragon s tooth necklace harry had seen in his dark arts class the braided leather cord carefully coiled beneath and around it remus pulled it out of the box in disbelief before turning to severus who was sitting in the corner with a bemused half smirk and a single raised eyebrow severus i canttake this these are these are really really i wouldnthave given it to you if i didntwant you to have it but it not remus relaxed his grip on the cord and it slipped from his fingers mary anne caught it before it was lost in the multicolored paper tides frozen around remus feet and began examining it minutely while severus stood and moved to crouch on the floor next to his partner i suggest you put it on before you lose it unless you have someplace you care to keep it mary anne looked up from her scrutiny of the titanic fang ooh remy you should wear it not just put it away dragon teeth are supposed to protect you and bring you good luck remus plucked it hesitantly from his sister fingers and turned it over and over in his hands before severus drew the ends of the cord out of remus palms and pulled them around behind his neck the cord is charmed so you donthave to tie it the ends seal themselves together when they touch so how do you get it off melody stared at the now seamless cord pull on it but if it catches on something it wontfall off because the charm is activated by heat ooh that really clever mary anne stared in awe at the black haired man moving back to his seat in the corner i wish i could do things like that dontlook at me that way severus admonished his teenage admirer i failed my charms n e w t because i could never remember which spells were for charms and which ones were for transfiguration my cousin sent it to me that way harry snickered slightly at the idea that severus had failed an n e w t only to be greeted with a glare if you can tell me what kind of useful purpose is served by giving a tea saucer a pair of wings i will gladly allow you to laugh at me all you wish harry sat in silence severus smirked i didntthink so remus knocked on the door of the bedroom and walked in without pause the knock was really nothing more than habit harry wouldnthave had time to blink much less cover himself up if he was indecent remus winced slightly at the memory of severus unannounced arrival in the room last night who wanted to be caught staring contemplatively at a pair of lavender pajamas covered in sheep but it did give him warning that he was about to lose whatever minimal amount of privacy the lupin farmhouse afforded remus discovered harry laying on the lower bunk with his newly aquired copy of the arabian nights harry rolled over and continued reading absolutely oblivious to the fact that his guardian had just entered the room unable to think of an appropriate way to rouse his ward remus simply trotted over and plunked right down on the old feather mattress well it was his bed harry looked up from the red leather volume laying on the pillow harry i wanted to ask you something harry sat up snuffles jumped from the rug into his lap and harry spent several minutes laughing and trying to avoid the puppy now slobbering happily all over his face when at last he d calmed the black and white canine with a good scratch behind the ears he looked up at remus in consternation what did i do remus raised his eyebrows nothing that i aware of but should i be asking you what you did well i kinda knocked one of the five year olds in the snow when we were having a snowball fight and he started crying but i dontthink i hurt him and i mean i helped him up and all it was just an accident but remus started laughing if by chance you re referring to michael mum fixed him up with a cup of chocolate and a jelly biscuit harry sighed in relief and then instantly became wary again so what going on that so important you had to tear yourself away from a huge plate of biscuits here he pointed at his own little tray of frosted sugar biscuits and a few pastries sitting on the nightstand to come up here and ask me well severus is fairly occupied apparently he enjoys a good game of gin rummy and catherine and mary anne and bugsy are some of the best players in england at least that what mum always says and i wanted to talk to you privately i suppose eventually it might involve him but it really doesntright now harry stared i haventheard that in months dear diary guess what remus bopped him playfully with one of the numerous throw pillows he kept on his childhood bed for some reason unknown to anyone else i spend plenty of time with you you you insolent little gryffindor brat harry bopped him back that argument would be a great one if you hadntbeen in gryffindor snuffles barked in agreement and licked remus face remus laughed and then slowly got serious again what do you think of my folks harry put his book on the nightstand excitedly they re awesome i mean i wish there were a few closer to my age 6 but they re still really cool i cantbelieve your mom got me all that stuff when she d never even met me i feel like i really with family well ron family treats me like family but they still feel like they re just the family of my best friend you know remus smiled a little mum loves pulling people into the family i imagine you guessed that already though seeing as there so many of us harry nodded i still cantbelieve you re adopted they all treat you just like they treat each other remus frowned most people dontact like the dursleys harry i dontknow why they treated you that way to be honest i really dontwant to know but i did want to ask you if if i d like to be adopted harry scratched snuffles behind the ears and the giant footed canine stuck his nose in harry sleeve with a whuff how did you know that heard you talking to your mum after dinner remus reached over to scratch the puppy back i dontwant you to think you have to make an immediate decision harry and i definitely dontwant you to think i saying you have to forget your past if you say yes but i saw how you grew up and i thought maybe you d remus stopped in frustration i not sure how to put this you know we re your family harry even if the ministry says we re not legally right harry nodded it only i thought perhaps you d like it to be legal in addition to whatever your heart tells you harry grinned then the grin vanished and he looked worried remus yes harry i wouldnthave to you know change my name and all that would i i mean i know my last name would become lupin but i dont you d want to keep your birth name and appearance is that it harry nodded well there nothing wrong with that harry and it perfectly possible there are adoptions of all kinds i chose to leave my past behind because i didntparticularly care for my birth parents but i can understand perfectly why you d want to keep your heritage can i think about it remus gave him a look that was some kind of bizarre cross of you re kidding me right and haventyou been listening to a word i said of course you can think about it harry things like that are all the better for thinking over harry leaned over to hug his guardian and snuffles leapt out of his lap in alarm settling on the pillows with a look so reminiscent of a disdainful sirius that both harry and remus laughed remus hmm no matter what happens thanks remus hugged his ward even tighter feeling his family was complete at last pleasure all mine reference notes 1 davey gudgeon i love using him simply because i figure either remus has an incredible memory or else he and davey were somewhat friends since remus remembered that davey gudgeon was the one who almost lost an eye to the whomping willow poa most of the adults i know would have said a boy almost lost not a boy named davey gudgeon almost lost because it wouldntbe any kind of consequence to them unless they d known the boy in question 2 these are actually only the ripest form of green peppers for anyone who thinks i about to give them all fire breathing abilities the food they are making is what my mom calls a southwest omelette which has onions green or red when we can get them peppers a bit of hot sauce though not much some pepper and several other kinds of vegetables like green onions all of that is mixed together with eggs and scrambled and you serve it hot i hate eggs with a passion but even i will eat a southwest omelette without too much argument on the rare occasions that my mom makes it 3 i well aware that in the books remus is constantly described as wearing shabby robes and i feel that his character was horribly misrepresented in the movie so i usually stick to canon description like remus hair however blonde not brown i think the movie did do him a good deal more justice with the wardrobe he was shown in therefore i sticking with the old and often endearingly dorky cardigans and worn out trousers of the movie random note did anyone else notice that while remus trousers were supposed to be way too big to emphasize the idea that he lost weight he poor etc he never wears a belt or suspenders it true the sides legs and pockets all look like he should be too thin for them but the waist fits perfectly anyway i just had to point that out for those who dontpay attention to these things because they re not obsessed with movie inconsistencies they make me laugh 4 i think most people know what these are but for those who have been living in a monastery since 1930 or who were born after 1980 i guess many of us fall into that category too these are your basic paperback books dime novels are usually mysteries or romance novels and were originally printed for people who either wanted to carry a book with them to read those big leather bound editions are heavy or who couldntafford real books did i mention they re also super expensive if it real leather the original v c andrews books here there be thorns flowers in the attic etc are examples of dime novels so called because when they first came out they were advertised as costing only a dime 5 again this is an antiquated item but good things never die i have one of these the string is attached to another piece of wood you wind it around the dowel part of the top pull the string and watch that baby go i once timed one to see how long it would spin it went for a minute and twenty two seconds before it hit the sugar bowl and fell on the floor and let me tell you the things they re coming out with nowadays will never beat these old tops ask your grandparents if they perhaps still have one lying around they re unbelievably fun 6 the age structure of remus family is based loosely on my own experiences at our family reunion you have a lot of older people a handful of people in their 20 to early 30 s a few more in their 40 s an unbelievable group of babies and little kids but only 7 teenagers representing about 160 people that because the teens are usually the change of life kids of the moms in their forties early fifties while the usual kids of those parents are now the 20 and 30 group and they have all the little ones so yes this structure is possible in response to several people who said no way and yes it does happen most of the babies you re hearing about are change of life toddlers but there are some adults i simply haventbothered mentioning liner notes other than the rating of t pg 13 for homosexuality violence injuries and adult language there are none i only going to answer reviews then post because this is really long tonight dewnymph i appreciate your britpicking i honestly do i slowly revising all 20 chapters for formatting and text but it slow going i hope you ll be able to help me in future too and incidentally a friend of mine told me that what we call dime novels you all call penny dreadfuls so that ll be changed when i get there too cows do milk in winter just not as much and i was sorta going for the old sherlock holmesy feeling with the helping each other because cash is a commodity out here feeling remus mother is the only southern one but she sorta blends right in with everyone else because they start unconsciously being like her i considering the idea that maybe in a future chapter harry will try to make grits yulara ahh the joys of a school computer donttell ma i said that lol as i told dewnymph i working on the britishness and as i telling you some of gram basic pronounciations will be listed in the next chapter eleonora1 you know harry he has no logic actually this comes from me i would rather sleep in my underwear than wear summer pajamas to bed in winter why no idea but it true and the jacob ladder is a toy that can be moved in many different ways because it is nothing but a bunch of wooden blocks held together by ribbon they re quite fun try looking them up online as i told yulara i donthave time tonight to translate gram speech but i will do so soon vodevil i pleased to meet you lol i didnt borrow severus scrooge from anyone but i guess that goes to show that it a pretty popular idea i think the rest of your questions are answered above have a great read haruka lune severus awoke momentarily startled by the sheer intensity in difference between waking up in a stone dungeon and a wooden attic it was a moment after this that he had to wonder why he had wakened though not a sound sleeper by any means he was certainly not in the habit of just waking up for no reason he rolled over and quickly made an unpleasant discovery the other side of the small bed was empty and remus was most of the way across the attic bedroom walking lazily wearing no dressing gown a very bad sign indeed and without a light in his hand bloody sonambulist severus growled as he slipped quietly from the bed the old wooden floorboards would creak and squeak loudly enough to wake a deaf man if he moved quickly and he had forty feet of ancient planking to cover in a very few seconds before oh shit merlin no no no no no no no no no this is not happening severus increased his pace as much as he felt he could safely do remus already on the edge of the stairs and the door had been left open and the staircase was old and steep and remus took four steps before the disaster came the amateurly repaired fifth stair he d warned severus and harry about gave way under his weight remus hurtled forward a sickening gunshot snap echoed in the old wooden stairwell and remus flew awake with a despairing cry falling the entire length of the staircase before he stopped at the bottom severus hurried down it skipping the broken stair and with only a half uttered warning cry to harry before he knelt at his partner side remus whimpered and reached for his ankle severus looked down at it and tried not to gag it certainly sent his stomach into an odd twist the bone had broken in remus ankle his foot was already black blue and rapidly swelling blood leaking out where the bone had pierced right though his skin he d collected several splinters slivers cuts and bruises on his way down and the t shirt he d worn to bed was ripped in six separate places by broken wood severus still sleep dazed brain was in the process of wondering what the hell he should do now when everjoice bent down near her son head severus hadnteven registered the banging open of several doors nor yet the crying of recently wakened toddlers and kindergarten kids and wiped his face with a cool cloth now thayar remus you just keep still n all n ah ll go get everjoice lupin never needed to finish her sentence catherine husband stephen was already at hand and examining the ankle by a sheer miracle nothing else was broken severus gripped his partner hand not comprehending why he of all people should need comfort from someone injured because of his own negligence when it was clear he should be the one doing the comforting he heard several disconnected words hospital in the morning no way to tell keep it wrapped until he ll be all right if we only anyone have a pair of tweezers and some peroxide no no that not we should in the living room maybe and then he fainted severus was not a man contrary to popular belief who enjoyed blood and gore and violence in fact he had chosen not to become a healer for the single reason that he didntthink he could stomach it mass killing on a battlefield was one thing you could turn off your emotions like a faucet and then later safe and alone shatter like a piece of fine china dropped on a stone floor but blood injuries terminal sickness were all too much for him he had killed his own father entirely by accident though he regretted only the fact that he didntregret the death when he was only seventeen and thereby earned himself a place among the death eaters hiding in the back of the circle when people were being tortured and often throwing up afterward he still had nightmares about those things even though voldemort placed such a high value on his resident potions master that severus was no longer required to attend those grisly meetings he still had even worse nightmares about the feeling of his father hands around his throat trying to crush his airpipe because his only still surviving child was defective because snape senior had no tolerance for imperfections even as small as a birthmark forget an alternative sexual orientation and then of his own finally finding the strength to push the older man off him and right into a marble mantelpiece the problem was that in these dreams snape senior didntdie instantly of a crushed skull no he would pull himself back up and the doors would disappear and severus was left with nowhere to run covered in his own father blood and brains and the dread of a certain death at this point he would wake himself up violently and in a cold sweat often to spend the rest of the night trying to fall back asleep the sound of that breaking skull had stayed with him for the next twenty years and remus accident had opened the whole stinking hellpit back up again the blackhaired man was now sitting in a chair next to a hospital bed wishing that werewolf powers could heal broken bones as well as superficial cuts and bruises except for the cast to the knee and the extraordinarily pale skin remus looked completely normal the healer at st mungo had insisted on running a secondary set of tests just in case there were bone fragments stuck into important other parts like veins or worse the achilles tendon which they d already had to do surgery on if it were permanently damaged remus would never walk again fortunately it seemed to be healing already there was no fast and easy magical way to repair this problem remus werewolf blood would just reject any potion fed into it for the purpose of healing him because he didntnormally need it for one and he was allergic to witch hazel for another and so remus was going to have to haul himself around hogwarts on crutches for merlin knew how long until he recovered luckily the castle seemed to like remus and so he would probably have a fairly easy time of it severus was the one at a loss he d never thought of remus the survivor the tough one the perservering as being vulnerable the idea that the man could be injured was completely foreign to him he came to terms with it over the next week between new year and the return to hogwarts when remus injury was made known to the student body so people could adjust accordingly his chats with severus were moved from the dungeon office and quarters to the defense classroom where he d started doing his office work it saved him a climb up another set of stairs 1 luckily his quarters were also on the second floor as was the infirmary 2 and of course the great hall was only a staircase and a corridor away so he wasnttoo badly off students moved out of his way in the halls often offering him a hand with whatever he might be carrying and someone was always ready to help him down the grand staircase to the first floor and into the great hall after two weeks madame pomfrey allowed remus a joint brace instead of the almost full leg cast giving him even more mobility on his crutches he started going outside again occasionally sitting by the forbidden forest and watching for birds it was in this way that severus left him some time after noon on a rather warm saturday for january in england anyway returning to remus office a small table in the corner of the defense classroom to pick up a double lesson plan he d left there it was while searching for the parchments that he found the second copy of the marauders map unwiped which remus had been using to track the movements of various people nobody could hide from the marauders map so it could be used to follow the patterns of people the order wished to keep an eye on this copy the master copy extended the map all the way into hogsmeade and through the forbidden forest and the lake it showed every single person within those parameters even the merpeople and centaurs it never lied according to remus you d always show up even if you were under an invisibility cloak or some kind of invisibility potion which was why severus dropped his books and went running for the headmaster office when he realized that remus was no longer on it i just dontknow you know harry fiddled with his quill he ron hermione ginny and luna were sitting in the library pretending to work they actually had been working until harry brought up his christmas night conversation with remus at which point everyone stopped working and started discussing it not like you re being disloyal to your parents by wanting a family mate ron pointed out and it not so uncommon percy adopted too you know harry swiveled his head so fast it was a wonder it didntfall off percy is adopted ron nodded nonchalantly his parents were too young to keep him or something like that harry processed this new piece of information and fiddled with the blue and bronze prefect badge luna had taken off her robes and put on the table 3 it just i dontknow if i want to do that i feel like i d be losing some kind of link to my parents or something i mean remus is great and i really like him but he my friend it would just be so weird having him as a parent too and harry broke off abruptly with a shrug hermione put a hand on his shoulder and luna spoke up even if you choose to make him your family now harry you re not losing anyone they ll still be waiting for you harry nodded and then hermione chimed in do you love him harry stared at her huh i said do you love him hermione waited patiently what that supposed to mean harry willed away the anger boiling in his stomach how was he supposed to know if he loved remus or not it wasntlike he had anything to judge against what do you think hermione was starting to lose her patience you know mr and mrs weasley love you and dumbledore does too in his own way and i think of you like the brother i never had harry and we all know remus loves you to death what do you think it means harry considered that he was trying to come up with a frame of reference something he could judge by when his mind flashed back to about a week before his birthday at which point remus had taken him ice skating for the first time skating is easy harry remus teased it the falling down that the hard part harry stood on the edge of the ice unsure he d had to retie his skates four times before he was able to stand up without either falling out of them or getting the blades caught on the laces why should he have any better success on the ice itself come on harry it fun remus insisted holding his hands out in front of himself palms up i ll pull you until you get the feel of the ice all you have to do is find your center of balance it no different than when we went roller skating really harry shook his head and tried to let go of the barrier between the floor and the ice so he could move backward away from the edge of the ice and back to the bench but his ankles wobbled this is a lot different i ll just wait for you okay now remus shook his head come on i wontlet anything happen to you he gestured with his hands indicating that harry should step forward finally the teen reached for his guardian hand hesitantly and stepped cautiously onto the ice remus grinned and started skating slowly backward a feat harry was certain he d never master they d gone about a quarter of the way around the rink before harry tried to move on his own and sent both of them toppling to the ice landing squarely in remus lap remus started laughing do you think i santa claus you silly little boy he teased sliding easily out from beneath harry weight and standing again offering harry his hand harry tried twice to scramble to his feet before grabbing at remus arm and hauling himself up i never doing this again it all right to fall harry everyone does it once in awhile even the professionals here just push your foot like this remus demonstrated the short stroke that would propel him forward dontpush too hard or you ll fall down come on now small steps go ahead harry i behind you harry let his hand linger on the wall between floor and ice wishing he could just launch himself over it and be out then he felt remus push gently on the small of his back and threw his arms out startled he lunged forward with his foot to catch his balance and realized with a start that he was moving i guess i guess loving someone is trusting that they re going to be there for you and knowing you wouldntbe the same if they weren t harry finally tried hesitantly and the girls all nodded that part of it hermione encouraged but there more to it than that what harry started to feel irritated again it quite simple harry just think about it harry did for no apparent reason the picture of severus placing a worn leather cord around remus neck flashed into his mind and he was fairly certain he d gotten the last bit and wanting the best for that person right hermione nodded so do you love him harry considered he d certainly felt a good deal more than just gratitude when remus had rescued him from privet drive he d been excited at the prospect of not being a slave anymore the idea that he had someone to talk to and laugh with and then there was some sort of comfortable feeling he couldntexplain but he knew it was what had made him sit across from remus in the mcdonald where they stopped to eat so he could see his new guardian face he wanted to be able to talk and listen and learn it was the reason he d hoarded muggle spare change for months so he could buy a copy of the phantom of the opera in the original french because remus wanted one that wordless feeling was what had propelled him out of bed in the middle of the night to find out why everyone was gathering at the bottom of the staircase at the house in devonshire and what had prompted him to inch his way down the staircase to help his guardian it was the reason the two of them had spent a day in august sitting on the balcony apartment elbows deep in paper mache making a volcano and laughing over the stupidest things in the world i i think so harry offered in response to hermione question i pretty sure hermione smiled as ginny added her two cents so you re really family already it just a matter of names and things you know she reasoned but then hermione frowned and cut her off actually it much more complicated than that ginny you know how the ministry is if harry was adopted it would provide him with an extra safety net so to speak against being taken away from remus on some trumped up charge of incompetent parenting ginny nodded harry frowned it still so ron cut him off mate you cantkeep on thinking about what everyone else is going to think about it or you re never going to get anywhere see there always going to be people who re going to say you took the easy way out or that you re being stupid or something remus doesntcare what people think of him because he gay or a werewolf or because he doesntreally do what people think he should all the time right dontyou think he d ve given up long ago if it mattered to him what people were thinking harry grinned at his friends you know what you guys you re right i going to tell remus tonight that i want to all students are to report directly to their dormitories immediately staff is to meet in the headmaster office the five friends looked between each other and paled only ginny and hermione had never heard that announcement before ginny because she d been in the chamber of secrets and hermione because she was petrified at the time harry grabbed his books suddenly terrified come on you heard mcgonagall whatever going on here isntgood we d better get out of here severus you are quite certain that headmaster he showed me how this map works if remus isntshowing up on it it because he not on hogwarts grounds or in hogsmeade severus repeated feeling perfectly irritated why would nobody believe him and you re certain he couldntsimply have gone somewhere without telling with crutches and a broken ankle albus severus shot the old man a withering glare i suppose next you re going to suggest he apparated to london to buy chocolate we re wasting time the facts are quite simple remus is missing and there is no way he went to wherever he is under his own power so what are we going to do about it minerva frowned at the map severus we did tell the students to go to their dormitories didntwe severus made an exasperated noise of course we did minerva why you have a student missing she informed him and pointed at the part of the map labeled slytherin common room and dormitories there was indeed a dot missing malfoy severus paled as pieces snapped together in his brain forming a macabre puzzle he shoved his left sleeve up his arm and ran his fingers over the glowing dark mark there a torture meeting going on are you quite sure severus more aggravated than ever severus yanked his sleeve up even higher and showed the glowing pulsing snake and skull to the entire room my so called services to the dark lord are far too valuable as is the knowledge i possess for him to take my loyalty for granted to him it is nothing but a small sacrifice to allow me to remain absent from such meetings but to me it is far more and he is well aware of the fact therefore he grants me the favor of staying away but there is no way to stop the mark from reacting at least partially there a meeting going on damn it albus and we have a prime target for the dark lord who just happens to be missing along with a certain student who has been repeatedly giving him trouble all year do you have any doubt what this means dumbledore sighed and looked around the room professors we have a serious problem serious problem my arse albus we have to get him out of there damn severus swore as the mark throbbed painfully sod this there no time to waste listening to you lot talk at each other severus announced jumping up from his seat and hurrying away heedless of both dumbledore and mcgonagall as they tried to keep him from leaving fetch wolf the death eaters werentknown for subtlety remus winced as someone wearing a silver ring slapped him on the back of the head then pulled off the ring and tossed it in front of him he wasntentirely sure when his ankle had given out at last and he d been forced to the ground it had been somewhere between the kick to the back of the knee and the tussle ending in a death eater lying on the ground holding his stomach and whimpering but he knew he wouldntbe standing again for a long while if ever voldemort wanted information right after malfoy the little bastard was inducted with honors into the ranks and he was determined to get it remus was aware suddenly of a change in the air a new piece of information to process but his brain was about as useful as a sponge in the desert and he couldntunderstand what was different then there was a hand held open in front of his face you must see there is no other option remus lupin hissed a voice from above him and he had to repress a shudder how he hated that voice if you will only join me you will never go hungry again remus looked up in disbelief the man was he a man it was so hard to tell with people who d mangled their bodies beyond recognition in efforts at immortality was crazy he had to be you see lupin my followers have discovered the secret the ministry refuses to discover for itself the cure the cure you have waited for all these years join me and know the life you have desired since your childhood you will never want again remus bared his teeth in a snarl how stupid do you think i am to believe i d listen to your lies voldemort laughed the death eaters followed suit on the contrary lupin i believe you to be extraordinarily intelligent which i why i cannot understand why you are still working for albus dumbledore a meddling old fool who clearly does not understand or appreciate your many talents remus cast his eyes around the circle and i suppose you re going to tell me all i have to do is give you every last bit of information i have about the order and then you ll give me this wonderful cure of yours correct prove it remus was stalling for time it wasntpossible that they werentcoming i do not abandon my followers when they are faithful remus lupin where is dumbledore for you now you have done much so much for his cause and in return you get nothing i reward those who are loyal to me turn for turn lupin you will reap neither more nor less than you sow in my ranks i do not give my word lightly i dontneed a reward for knowing i did the right thing he struggled again to get to his feet and yet would you not give your life to wear a silver band on your finger to eat with the same utensils as everyone around you to run beneath a moon that bore you neither pain nor malice nor fear voldemort bent hooked a finger beneath a set chin to look remus more fully in the face admit the truth lupin you would gladly die to be able to live an ordinary life that did not involve being considered an animal by those too narrow minded to understand the talents that are uniquely of your kind you would give everything you own to be able to find employment without a struggle to meet the parents of your students and shake their hands without that fear of taint the life you are throwing away with your refusal lupin is a life in which you could be one of the most trusted men in our world your abilities fully appreciated for the first time in your memory how can you sit in this circle lupin and know you are discarding something you have wished for with every breath since you were four years old severus pushed his way to the front of the throng seeking desperately to find out who was in that clearing the sight of remus face sent his stomach into flip flops on one hand remus was alive and mostly well on the other hand it wasntlikely he d stay that way for long severus stood behind the shoulder of macnair peering around the man beefy arm to see what was happening remus was being propositioned by the dark lord well that was bad very bad catastrophic stronger men than remus had fallen prey to sweet words and empty promises and severus could see from remus eyes that he was tempted sorely tempted and a single word at this point could be enough to drive him to the dark side with no hope of return these people are all purebloods remus looked round the circle as though trying to confirm his belief in spite of the masks covering faces left and right how can you expect me to believe they would welcome me with open arms after everything you ve said fear of taint and all that i am fully aware that there are men among these lupin the dark lord swept the circle with his arm who have betrayed you left you in the gutter turned you away rest assured that they will be punished if you so choose but know that they now are aware of your intelligence your tenacity your strength both mental and physical and these are not foolish men you were thrust from society by one among these severus lucky bastard lucius malfoy whispered to the death eater standing next to him and something in remus golden amber eyes changed they took on a steely glint but he will receive his own for that all i ask in return for all this is a small favor lupin you see i offer you my hand as an equal two men meeting in agreement the dark lord extended his hand once again severus took one desperate step to the side not entirely sure what he would accomplish and remus threw his weight forward grabbing not the long white hand extended to him but the wrist above it hauled himself upward and as the dark lord stumbled with remus weight remus spit on his outstretched hand i dontgrant favors to fork tongued liars remus was breathing heavily with the effort of staying on his feet voldemort stared at his hand for all of about two very long seconds and then wiped it on his robes advancing on remus with a snarl you dare to spit on me you filthy beast you halfblooded how can you dare when i have offered you i dare remus announced shoulders heaving with the effort of speaking in spite of his pain i dare because with one breath you tell me how wonderful i am how you re going to i dontknow raise me up and practically make me a king and in the next you call me a filthy beast and your pretty little facade drops to the floor and shows the snakefaced monster hiding underneath it voldemort a shiver ran around the circle at the name the dark lord pulled his wand and waved it remus shrieked severus panicked what the hell had been so bloody painful as to pull a scream from a man standing on a broken ankle and nursing extraordinarily agonizing silver wounds well there was his answer to that remus fell to his knees scrabbling with his fingers at his right wrist where an intricate band made of silver curlicues was digging into his skin growing tighter and deeper the more he struggled the dark lord looked up from his handiwork cast his eyes around the circle and rested on severus severus how kind of you to join us at last i see you have abandoned your high ideals about the extraction of information shit he d forgotten to put on a mask and now he d just stepped right into the circle without one well he hadntput much store in them when he was seventeen and unbelievably stupid either things hadntchanged too much only the numbers it seemed the muggle loving fool was concerned how am i to convince him of my intentions if i were to stay away my lord how he hated saying that so you join us out of service to your superior is it look what our trap has caught this time severus a most curious dog isntit severus allowed his eyes to rake over remus to assess his injuries though he tried not to betray his intentions serious damage to the broken ankle two silver burns on the back of his head and his lip blood from numerous scratches and scrapes a hideous dark bruise on his cheekbone surrounding a gash that was still bleeding a good deal his bottom lip looked chewed split as though he d bitten it to keep from screaming he was shaking far more than would be expected from someone with so high a pain tolerance the cruciatus then severus forced his mind back to what his master was saying young draco malfoy brought him to us severus along with a rather strange tale severus inclined his head and raised his eyebrows hoping he looked surprised instead of dread filled an icy lining of fear formed around his stomach and twisted sadly he wasntdisappointed young malfoy claims that you have been seen working rather intimately with this the dark lord stated executing a short kick to remus thigh remus clenched his teeth yet in spite of the close relations you have been sharing you have been unable to bring him to me and the same goes for the boy explain yourself severus locked his knees beneath his robe thanking every deity he could think of the name of and a few he couldntand so just called and you you know who you are that he wasntwearing the dragon tooth necklace or he would have been dead by now protection from dragon magic aside such a valuable artifact could not be trusted in the hands of someone who had made so serious a blunder as allowing this prime target to escape time and time and time again never mind that he d bought it himself it would have been taken from him and he executed in the meantime he began placating those same deities all but begging for help he d noticed that if he just trusted to fate he usually came out if not on top then high enough to avoid being crushed while his brain ran along those lines he opened his mouth and prayed something passable would come out it did the boy is still far too protected to be removed my lord not to mention i have no way of becoming close to him what am i to do give him a detention and tell him he will be serving it with me in the dark forest he would go straight to the headmaster and offer himself up as nothing more than a slave for every night remaining of his schooling rather than walk into those trees next to me the wards on the castle cannot be changed by only one person i can assure you i have tried dumbledore does not place so much trust in me that i could take the boy to hogsmeade as an assistant i have examined every path and found nothing clear and the werewolf my lord would even you dare to pit yourself against an unweakened werewolf you see what he can do even when he is injured i think i have done my part by leaving him in the open unprotected and allowing someone unsuspected to remove him from the school the members of the order of the phoenix are not so unintelligent that a double disappearance that of two hogwarts teachers especially and two members of the order itself would go unnoticed as i assume you can tell by my presence we would be found within mere hours i executed the werewolf removed to a place of so called safety and far too many people removed from our cause i felt it more prudent to make one small sacrifice of information instead of dozens among our numbers a far larger sacrifice that could have been prevented most of the death eaters murmured in varying stages of agreement the dark lord however did not appear moved and yet you chose not to commune with my faithful within the school to arrange to plan you squander your greatest strengths on hapless idiots who straggle through your classroom rather than use those talents to aid us i begin to wonder severus for whom you are truly fighting my loyalty has never wavered from you my lord there has never been so much as a shred of evidence that i ever did anything against our cause beyond squirming into the order of the phoenix and using that as a pardon when i was forced to flee working for fifteen years under the thumb of the great fool himself choosing so many times to leave me to my own devices instead of aiding me and hindering or harming my servants when you discovered them no severus of course i should not have doubted you my apologies severus stood his ground as the snakefaced bastard approached him you disappoint me severus i pulled you from certain death at the hands of the ministry 4 i secured you a job in the department of mysteries i offered you a way to conduct your work unhindered by idiotic restrictions and laws that have no purpose save to hamper the efforts of those ambitious enough to attempt true progress and yet your efforts for our cause grow less and less i have no use for a traitor in my ranks as the last horrible word left cracked and bloodless lips the dark lord no voldemort he didntneed to be afraid of the name when he was going to die anyway right placed both thin hands on severus chest and shoved severus stumbled heavily backward and landed in the arms of lucius and draco malfoy one held his wrists behind his back and slid an iron strong arm around his waist the other clamped a soaking wet pad of cotton over his nose and mouth and a sickly sweet odor like rotten mushrooms like charnel pits 5 like overfermented wine chloroform filled his brain not ceasing as he tried to throw off the hands of his assailants before severus slid limply to the ground he wondered vaguely if it were possible to kill someone by forcing them to breathe chloroform that was one thing i didntstudy when i did my work on poisons damn it he thought muzzily as darkness claimed his mind the first thing severus did when he awoke was to register the fact that he was laying mostly naked on a stone floor his robes had been taken leaving him in a thin shirt and trousers the next thing he did was to make the stones considerably warmer vomit would do that god he hated chloroform if he d ever become minister of magic he would have outlawed it instead he just groaned loudly then a warm hand came to rest at the small of his back encouraging him to pull himself off the floor severus looked up to see golden eyes gazing concernedly back at him remus shh here remus handed him a small flask that seemed to contain water cold pure and completely untainted i dontknow what they re playing at i really don t they ve been in four times since we ended up in here last night but they haventdone anything really remus pointed across the cell at a wooden table with a tray on it they gave me a few pieces of bread and a cup of tea when we came in i was still conscious they left more food about an hour ago and they even look at this remus held up his hands the torn up fingers on his left hand had been carefully bandaged as had the burns on his right wrist it so odd you d expect them to milk this for all it worth remus stood and walked back to the table where he crossed his arms over his chest and looked broodingly down on an object sitting near the tray voldemort himself was in here twice the second time look here remus returned to severus side carrying severus blinked incredulously their wands he even performed finite incantatem on them to prove they hadntbeen tampered with there something i dontlike about all this it too easy severus shook his head remus how many unforgivables do you know remus considered i all right with imperius dumbledore insisted i learn it in case i was attacked i could force the attacker to leave but that it the same and almost everyone we re likely to be up against the malfoys for example can throw off imperius and there not too much else they ll be vulnerable to remus looked at his partner in surprise you dontknow all the unforgivables instantly he redoubled you know what i sorry forget i said that i mean i know what you meant i used to be able to cast the killing curse although i never used it on a human being but after the triwizard tournament severus shook his head to clear it of the memory of blank gray eyes and a boneless body slipping through his arms as he helped carry cedric diggory back to the castle i couldntdo it and cruciatus just always hit too close to home for me remus nodded in silent understanding snape senior was not well known for his mercies clever on their part then really leaving us our wands we re tonight dinner show so to speak severus nodded it a rather clever piece of psychology in a twisted sort of way they give us all the tools for our own defense and leave us to torture ourselves to insanity when we realize we simply donthave the skill they ll wait until sundown before wait a minute what day is it we were brought in here sometime last night damn i donthave remus jumped up and began tearing at the lock on the door we have to remus remus stopped his fruitless mauling of the door handle so he could turn to look at his partner still sitting forlornly on the floor yes i i sorry remus looked puzzled for what dragging you into all this severus waved a hand around in a manner that seemed to suggest he was the one who d pulled remus into the cell in the first place it not your fault severus i would have ended up here sooner or later anyway apparently a werewolf who a member of the order of the phoenix is considered a highly sought prize in these parts remus shook his head it lucky you showed up really severus asked with his eyes for an explanation remus hurried to elaborate moving to sit next to his partner last night i ve been thinking about it a lot today i almost accepted his offer do you know that i really felt like i was just going right off my head and then he pushed it just a bit too far when he mentioned you and i realized you were there i could feel it and it sort of brought me back to my senses i couldntbelieve i was honestly going to remus shook his head again far stronger men than you have succumbed to the dark l to voldemort remus eyed him suspiciously and what exactly is that supposed to mean severus scooted backward on the floor holding his hands up in supplication i suppose i should have worded it better if i had said there are many men with far less reason to turn to him than what you have and yet they ve done so all the same i thought for a moment that we had lost you for good would have been a damned shame really people like you are hard to come by and since when have you called him voldemort severus half grinned wryly i can stand up and die like a man or i can die being afraid of voldemort name like i some kind of spineless little worm remus looked dismayed severus shrugged i always knew i d die at voldemort hand one way or the other and yet it may not come to your death severus a new voice interjected and the two men in the cell scrambled to their feet remus had been supplied with a new brace at some point during the night indeed severus didntbother adding a qualifier to the end it seemed quite pointless voldemort stood in the doorway looking rather anticlimatic somehow indeed severus it occurs to me that i hold your life or death here the bastard dangled a small crystal bottle hanging from a chain quite literally in my hands your pretty little wolf canthurt you with this can he and after all everyone may fall astray once in awhile i am ready to forgive if you are ready to forget as the saying goes the high laugh that followed was highly mocking i didnthave the wolfsbane yesterday drinking it now is pointless remus pointed out trying to remain both calm and neutral and also wondering in some small and absurd part of his brain how he could be so abysmal in potions and yet clearly know more about them than the man in front of him he could harm someone under the influence of the potion it was only just that drinking the potion allowed him to have a choice in the matter you fool it was in your food you wonder why we allowed you no sugar in your tea remus was stunned to state the case mildly such a thing would never have occurred to him especially after voldemort last statement it struck him as somewhat hilarious that he knew more than one of the most powerful wizards this century voldemort turned to him i require answers little wolf he stated dangling the bottle again remus overlooked the insult in favor of trying to get everyone involved except perhaps voldemort out of this alive remus set his jaw he would give answers whether or not they were the answers voldemort wanted was another matter what do you want to know behind him he could sense severus dismay but he had no way of informing his partner of his true intentions damned if he didntwant to strangle voldemort immediately for putting them through this voldemort smile widened triumphantly where are the headquarters of the order of the phoenix remus shrugged no idea you lie i not the secret keeper i dontknow where the headquarters are strike one for voldemort and who is the secret keeper i was informed by no less than four of your so kind death eaters that i not to name the person in question on pain of a most torturous death remus chuckled inwardly there were at least four people he d been told not to name strike two name him now with no consequence then well there had to be a way around tha oh right i can t voldemort eyes narrowed well you said name him with no consequence how can i name him when the person in question isntnecessarily male brilliant stroke of dumbledore s splitting the secret keeping among three different people he kept the location tonks kept the secret of getting in and mad eye moody well remus wasntquite sure what exactly moody was doing but it kept the order safe so far be it from him to ask questions name her then i never said the secret keeper was female voldemort drew his wand i also never said there was only one did i a pause strike three and a half if remus did say so himself the wand was slipped back inside a deep pocket and voldemort chuckled of all things voldemort chuckled i seem to have underestimated you little wolf he mocked and yet you learn quickly the ways of the death eaters do you not you give what is asked voldemort unwound the chain from his fingers and i give what is offered you see i hold to my word he offered the small crystal bottle to remus who eyed it cautiously how do i know it not poison voldemort raised his eyebrows it was removed from the stocks of the traitor himself little wolf unless he has been poisoning you for the past week i should suggest it is genuine he shook his head in mock sorrow again you prove your worth your answer is the same it not changing remus replied taking the bottle slowly as though afraid it too was some kind of trap he pulled the glass stopper and then offered it to severus all right by you severus examined the liquid in the bottle critically even smelling it before offering a verdict it seems all right it the concentrate i ve been making the potion itself out of he passed the bottle back to remus who hesitated a few moments more before drinking it a sort of relief flooded his veins as the wolf retreated back into its mental den cheated of blood harmless now severus you see i offer you one last chance you know what i ask severus stood firm i see no reason to give you any favors voldemort drew his wand and pointed it steadily at the black haired man i think we could agree on a reason or two could we not severus not likely voldemort eyes narrowed even now you walk the edge of a very narrow precipice seconds from death and you say nothing what to stop you from killing me after i tell you what you want to know years afterward severus would be hard pressed to try to explain the curse that answered his statement he knew only in some mechanical part of his brain that perhaps cruciatus should be replaced on the unforgivables list he thought perhaps this curse was slitting his veins with a knife that had been first soaked in some kind of semi frozen fluid that was causing a terrific stinging and throbbing he remembered vaguely touching a hot iron poker as a child and decided that there was one cauterizing the wounds left by the knife abruptly the torture ended and he found himself on his knees unable to recall how he had gotten there he stared defiantly up into amused red eyes ah i see voldemort chuckled in a movement so fluid as to make water green with envy voldemort jerked remus toward him and spun the blonde round to face outward one arm round remus waist and arms to keep him from getting away the other resting lightly at his throat you would rather die and hope your lover gets out alive than you would to betray him would you not but you underestimate me once again severus voldemort shook his head i had hoped you might be persuaded to join our cause little wolf but it seems too late voldemort slid his hand up over remus nose and mouth immediate panic set in and remus began tossing his head wildly trying to breathe stop severus scrambled to his feet and took two steps forward before voldemort wand was aimed at remus neck two little words severus two little words and i remove what you are trying so shoddily to protect you would do better to confess your guilt and give what i ask would you not remus stared at him desperate pleading for a single moment severus stood firm i won t the hand pressed tighter remus struggled again severus stared in disbelief he d always thought it to be naught but a legend remus hair grew longer his hands turned upward and gained claws and he wrenched his mouth free sinking long white fangs deep into a wasted chalk colored hand voldemort screamed a high keening sound that would haunt the nightmares of both other men present for many days remus pulled away looking horrified his entire body now returned to its normal human state blood dripping from his front lip he backed away slowly breathing heavily severus reached to pull him away and the door to the cell opened in walked an oblivious wormtail clearly sent most likely by some other higher ranking death eater to remove the food tray voldemort shrieked at him you fool kill him a hand dripping blood pointed directly at remus lupin wormtail turned and lunged severus drew his wand imperio wormtail stopped silver hand about two inches short of his goal remus throat his eyes clouded he swiveled slowly slowly and began walking away remus sighed in relief voldemort screeched at his miserable minion who seemed completely heedless of the noise wormtail was now nothing more than a small stout tin soldier set into animation by the only unforgivable curse severus snape had ever cast and certainly the one of the longest duration severus struggled to keep his wand steady he knew what he was doing and it wasntan accident this time voldemort eyes widened in sudden comprehension and fear severus mouth twisted into a sardonic smile i too repay my debts my lord he murmured he raised the wand voldemort screamed as a silver hand wound round his throat severus collapsed somewhere deep in the bowels of the ministry of magic the distant gods laughed and smiled at remus lupin he had proven his own worth once again they rewarded him with a darkhaired figure that stood in the exact centre of a colluseum type room the figure looked all round himself bewildered and then made the kind of profound statement one rarely heard except from men of that sort what the bloody hell am i doing back here the first thing he realised upon awakening was that he was in a room that smelled rather musty unused old then he realized that there was a thin hand resting in his own and he scrambled to sit up before another identical hand pushed down on his chest and forced him to lie back in the bed glad to see you ve decided to rejoin the land of the living then a disembodied voice said well it seemed disembodied severus wasntseeing too well but it sounded like harry what the hell happened to me we re not entirely sure but sirius found traces of arsenic in your bloodstream we think there might have been poison in that water you drank i would have tasted it severus protested thinking muzzily that something harry had just said didntsound quite right he said white arsenic doesnthave a taste he sirius there it was black how many other siriuses do we know but black even with his eyes closed he could feel the grin on the boy face we dontknow how he got back or where he came from but dumbledore questioned him under veritaserum and it definitely him he doesntremember anything since june though then you think he was really dead or something like it anyway harry answered and severus opened his eyes to look at the boy unbelievable what he saw next was worse he was sure now that he was hallucinating sirius black stood in the doorway and then walked right through it shaking his head it no good we had to tie his hands down he kept tearing at his arms black spied severus half sitting in the bed it about time you re awake he announced checking severus pulse vision breath and so on what the hell is going on with remus black took a deep breath he has lunatic fever those bastards put silver dust in the brace on his ankle it was eating away the skin just barely enough to be noticed the idea we think was that if he joined voldemort they could change the brace remove the dust and nobody would be the wiser but otherwise he d end up with a hefty dose of silver to the brain brilliant really in a twisted sort of way lunatic fever a lycanthropic disease caused by excessive contact with pure sterling silver highly dreaded by the werewolf community a bad enough case could cause its victim to become blind deaf or even in many cases hopelessly insane hence the name severus shivered at one time he would have laughed over the dastardly ingenuity of the idea and the realization made him hang his head in shame black put a hand on his shoulder snape severus looked up remus told me before he became delusional what you did for him in there severus waited i just wanted you to know i ll make sure you re the first to know when he really awake severus considered is that likely at this point black shrugged we flushed his bloodstream if all goes well he should be fully aware again within twenty four hours severus nodded he could wait the not so long this time reference notes 1 if the information in chamber of secrets the book is carefully followed the dada office would appear to be on the third floor with the classroom on the second floor although it also common to see these inverted i use the one that seems to be correct according to the book the movie shows the office as being inside the classroom but based on the first chat remus has with harry in poa this is not possible as harry is walking in the corridor and remus stuck his head out of his office to ask harry in if the office could only be accessed from the classroom as shown in the movie remus would not have seen harry this was rectified in the movie by that nauseating chat on the bridge and again later by a walk in the woods they were mysteriously taking for no apparent reason 2 information taken from the harry potter lexicon 3 i think this is self explanitory but just in case in the books we only ever see the prefect badges of percy ron and hermione all gryffindors malfoy badge is mentioned but not described as is ernie macmillan s however since the badges we see are described as being red and gold gryffindor colors we can assume that the badges will also identify the house said prefect belongs to yellow and black for hufflepuff silver and green for slytherin bronze and blue for ravenclaw and red and gold for gryffindor luna is in ginny year one year behind harry and in gryffindor therefore she is in this story a first year prefect with a ravenclaw prefect badge 4 a friend of mine didntunderstand the certain death bit but i loved this rant so i kept it and simply inserted this note although severus killing of his father was accidental he was a scrawny seventeen year old with a bad track record already remember when sirius said severus started school knowing more dark curses than most of the seventh years and so there would have been no reason for the wizengamot to acquit him accident or not voldemort is saying that he in some way i didntbother going into assume he sent an agent who acted as some kind of witness that ll do well enough for our purposes was responsible for severus not being imprisoned or punished for his father death the idea that he saved severus from certain death refers to the fact that severus would probably have been sentenced to death if the wizarding world has the death penalty or to a lifetime in azkaban which would essentially lead to death via mental torture and madness and probably suicide also his reference to severus first job implies that he probably used an inside source to land severus a position in the ministry 5 the term charnel pit comes from stephen king salem lot and this scene in general is adapted from why didntthey ask evans by agatha christie excellent books both of them but charnel pit as a term is not defined on dictionary dot com which i use for all my definitions charnel however brought up the following n a repository for the bones or bodies of the dead a charnel house adj resembling suggesting or suitable for receiving the dead although the two do not appear in the thesaurus entries as synonyms for each other i believe that many people refer to a charnel house as defined as a noun with the term mausoleum this would be one of those huge above ground graves you see in some cemetaries thanks to the previously listed authors and to dictionary com for this awesome in my opinion scene liner notes usual disclaimers and so on apply rating this chapter is rated t pg 13 for language and getting up there homosexuality we ve finally moved past holding hands amigos oh yes and there a het warning too for harry some girl i wontmention yet die ginny dieeee okay not really but stay the hell away from my damn fics reviews thanks to everyone who reviewed eleonora1 i sent you an email and i promise there is very little remus torture in this one anyway i think the kissing funny rumors glowing ministry reports make up for it he a happy guy just now oh and i finally moved back into the basement so the love nest is open once again that means severus sirius and harry are all happy too yeah harry and me we get around snort wait i never told you about the love nest i told yulara about the love nest gahhh okay for those of you who now think i nuts the love nest is a joke that started between me and alicia and it moved online eventually and the most important part what there is in a bottleof ink will not be affected in any way by the events persons or locales introduced in harry potter and the half blood prince the story should be read exactly as though it occurs immediately after the events in harry potter and the order of the phoenix and why are you still reading these notes on to the story is snape in here sirius poked his head through the hole where the heavy oak kitchen door had once been molly weasley had taken it upon herself to renovate the house one room at a time once it was fully cleaned and watched as eight people shook their heads i think he said he was going to be in the library hermione mused sirius nodded in thanks and disappeared a short holiday had been granted to the hogwarts students in consideration of the mayhem that the final and complete fall of he who could for some reason now be named without people wincing and saying to not say his name everyone was expected to put their family affairs in order and be back by the twenty third additional time had to be approved by the headmaster snape was indeed in the library with harry both poring over separate books on potion brewing and lycanthropy trying to find a way to help remus so far they d found nothing sirius traipsed in and waited until both of them looked up at him being suddenly aware of a change in their concentrated little environment if the circumstances had been different sirius would have found their twin expressions to be extraordinarily humorous broken concentration saturated liberally with concern and just a pinch of annoyance or maybe determination who could tell with so many shadows in the room sirius grinned happily at them both he awake mmmmmm remus thought he must be having a very nice dream someone was holding his hand and gently combing his hair with their fingers in a slow regular pattern he was neither hot nor shivering on the contrary he felt the pleasant coolness of a recently changed bed and he felt clean as opposed to the sticky gravelly feeling he d been covered in when he d transformed not long after being rescued from voldemort strongholds and much to his chagrin in spite of his gratefulness had discovered that the snakefaced cur had been telling the truth about the wolfsbane someone called his name softly and he allowed his head to turn in the direction of the voice but he didntopen his eyes he d tried that once already and discovered it was simply too painful even in the dim light of this windowless room remus that voice again familiar but unfamiliar in that he couldntplace it anymore the tones werentright couldntthe person speak normally so he could understand i awake he murmured thinking that perhaps the man sitting next to him the hand was far too large to belong to any of the women remus knew thought he was still sleeping my eyes just hurt that normal said the voice and things started to click in remus brain now that most of the worry had dissipated from the deep baritone do you know what happened to you remus shifted and risked opening his eyes again just a bit this time it wasntso bad silver poisoning severus shook his head more than that lunatic fever we thought you were dead for certain poppy couldnteven diagnose it we had some woman from st mungo in to deal with the worst of it two full grams of sterling sliver dust straight to the brain via the bloodstream you were only about a quarter gram away from making lycanthropic medical history no survivors have ever been listed past two grams and an eighth remus shuddered but how did it through your ankle the brace they gave you was impregnated with it from what i ve been able to gather since i woke up and what got to you nothing so elaborate i afraid plain old fashioned arsenic in the drinking water remus eyes grew wide as he took in the implications of this it doesnthave a taste when used in the right form and we ve already determined that you re immune to it for some reason we ve yet to discover dontbeat yourself up over it it wasntyour fault remus nodded do you want to see harry remus considered for a little bit maybe severus nodded and stood up where are you going i have no plans to wear you out fifteen minutes after you wake up remus tried to pout but the effect was lessened by the fact that he could barely sit up severus severus turned back severus when i was still you know i thought i saw sirius several times i know it was a real person because things would change you know my clothes would be changed or i d have water with me or something i just wondered if you knew who nobody seems to know where black came back from but it is most certainly a fact confirmed by both the ministry and dumbledore that sirius black is very much so alive and living in this house for pity sake remus dontyou dare try getting up until you re told it safe for you severus left the room in search of harry leaving remus alone to grumble about being treated like a baby the students of hogwartsarrived back to the school exactly on schedule thrilled to see remus with a mostly healed ankle and no other apparent injuries or illnesses some were perhaps less enthusiastic about finding out that the old bat of the dungeons had also made a full recovery but if it was so they didntshow it life went on quite as it had before remus kidnapping in fact except that the aurors had left the school and remus had become something of a celebrity at the height of the excitement he managed to turn himself into an older looking version of a very hairy harry complete with overexaggerated lightning bolt scar on his forehead and a pair of wax fangs and came to class in a gryffindor uniform with a sign reading the werewolf who lived hanging from his neck it garnered plenty of laughs especially from harry and his friends they being the ones who d helped him set the prank up in the first place and some embarrassment for people like lavender brown who d been caught taking a quill out of his desk without a good reason for it the mania died down a bit after that but remus still had cause to complain of a positive epidemic of missing handkerchiefs self memos index cards ballpoint pens bookmarkers and on one memorable day someone had taken a honeydukes chocolate wrapper out of his desk and left the chocolate half eaten by remus in a fit of craving while marking first year essays sitting exactly where it had been before the paper covering had been removed it was after his pocket watch actually a wristwatch with a broken strap came up missing that he was called to the headmaster office and his surprise was great upon finding harry and severus there as well dumbledore opened their conversation by offering tea and sherbet lemons all around and then informing remus that his watch had been found and left on the head table at lunch and he dumbledore was inclined to believe that remus had lost it in the halls seeing as it had certainly happened before twice in fact and both times returned by some first year or other clearly the hufflepuff house pariah remus had never been entirely convinced that it had just fallen out of his pocket then he grew serious i think gentlemen that you all have a right to be asking me a rather pressing question and yet only harry has ventured so far to ask it i must confess myself completely surprised remus and severus exchanged a glance while harry squirmed uncomfortably in his seat and blushed before remus spoke about the prophesy dumbledore nodded and twinkled correct harry finally sat up straight so why wasntthe prophesy fulfilled sir was it because voldemort didntknow all ofit or on the contrary harry it has very much so been fulfilled all three stared at him quizzically dumbledore smiled you remember harry in your third year when you saved the life of peter pettigrew harry nodded uncertainly i told you then that when one wizard saves the life of another a very strong bond is formed and that a day might come when you would be glad you had saved him you understand now harry shook his head dumbledore tried again if you had chosen not to save him harry there are many things that would doubtlessly have been different but for simplicity sake we will assume that everything would have been the same in some way up to this point as i understand it voldemort was destroyed after being infected with lycanthropy having tried a most unwise method of restraining remus and using him as some form of torture instrument pettigrew who has the most interesting possession of a silver hand was forced under imperius to strangle his own master you see now all of you if harry had allowed pettigrew to die there would have been no ceremony in which he lost his hand therefore no silver hand to replace it therefore no danger to remus that had to be redirected and therefore no silver strangulation of lord voldemort you fulfilled the prophesy harry by creating the tools to fulfil it you remember all of you either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives sooner or later harry pettigrew would have killed one or the other of you in some way it had occurred to me years ago that the other referred to in the prophesy might not have meant you or voldemort at all but could instead have referred to another third person not bound by any of the other constraints of the prophesy date of birth heritage the mark of voldemort it seems i was right an interesting little study to be sure dontyou think gentlemen harry stared broodingly at his reflection in the mirror dumbledore had announced a valentine dance though everyone down to the suits of armour knew this was nothing more than a glorified victory ball harry of course couldntfind a way to squirm out of going and so here he was in his green dress robes hogging the mirror even though he knew there were other people who needed it ron finally elbowed him out of the way really mate i dontcare if you re carrying on an affair with your own reflection but i ve never had these on and i dontknow ron turned from side to side and scowled at the brown sugar colored robes hanging from his lanky frame i look like one of those bloody monks you read about in those old books hermione so fond of he lamented turning suddenly as harry seized a hair brush from his bedside table and tried desperately to make his hair lie flat for once mate what re you so on about tonight harry didntanswer he was busy thinking about a quiet voice and large glittering eyes three hours into the dance harry gave up on trying to have a good time ron and hermione were off somewhere doing couple y things seamus and dean were either dancing or trying to find a partner neville had stayed upstairs to do his homework and though draco malfoy and his human gorillas had been expelled after remus kidnapping and being of age all three would be standing trial as well there were plenty of others like marietta edgecombe for example who were conspiring to make harry feel generally watched and miserable he was so distracted that he reached for his bottle of butterbeer and didntrealize until after he d taken a healthy swig that it shouldnthave had enough left in it for him to take a swallow that size he started the memory of severus poisoning still fresh in his mind and looked up luna was sitting across from him she smiled dreamily do you always sit alone when the school holds dances er harry stuttered his brain jamming as he tried to think of something interesting to say and for a moment he almost wished he were remus or severus both of them always ready with an answer er no i just i mean it well er harry gave up luna just smiled you looked thirsty harry looked down at the new bottle in his hand er i mean thanks i mean you didnthave to do that or i mean er gryffindor is favorite for the quidditch cup this year arentthey luna queried and harry let out a mental sigh of relief here was something he knew i guess it not so hard to beat a team when four of its members 1 are missing and the remaining captain is too thick to realize they re not coming back in time for the game and need replaced you know luna laughed a bit i suppose that true a pause you ll have a harder time beating ravenclaw next week harry grinned maybe then will you still love me even if we win in an attempt to tease luna stared at him bad move harry an inner voice that sounded remarkably like remus informed him you shouldnt ever try to flirt like that then luna started to laugh i only go to quidditch games because everyone else does actually she informed harry it a nice game but there are too many people who forget that it only a game she stirred her drink cherry soda and vanilla ice cream lazily with her straw while harry tried to think up a good response luna gazed off into a corner of the great hall you know i dontunderstand why nobody else saw it before she said still looking off into the corner it always been clear as day to me they re perfect for each other dontyou think harry followed her line of sight trying to figure out what on earth she was talking about he squinted and the corner two occupants came into focus severus his hair braided wearing wine red dress robes several people were staring openly over a black button down shirt and trousers standing very close to remus who d forgone his normal comfortable but very worn out blue jeans and cardigan in favor of robes much the same color as ron s they were extremely old fashioned though still in almost perfect condition and harry remembered with a twinge of amusement that he d seen those robes in remus graduation pictures the odd couple turned in a slow circle apparently unaware of or ignoring the many eyes watching them and their queerly placed progress remus had placed one hand behind severus neck turned backward and severus had rested one hand on his partner waist their other hands were clasped together held down near their sides they continued to turn foreheads together dancing to a drummer all their own mmmm remus smiled against severus neck you do enjoy saying that dontyou mmm severus shook his head and smiled almost invisibly at the tiny man in his arms do you realize people are staring at us remus remus opened his eyes lazily and gazed up at the dark man above him do you care severus considered not particularly remus closed his eyes and rested his head against severus chest again good some mischievous part of severus brain the part that would have made him an excellent marauder if he hadntbeen so keen on rules gave him a rather amusing idea which he wasted no time in sharing with his partner what do you suppose would happen if i kissed you right now here with everyone watching yes remus considered for several moments i think the breakdown in authority we d both experience makes it prudent for us to wait until we re upstairs remus lupin are you actually considering being discreet for once mmmm do you want to go severus almost whispered as remus shifted his weight uncomfortably to rest more fully on his left ankle the right one not being entirely healed yet after this song maybe or we could sit down i dontthink we ought to do any unannounced disappearing any time soon severus nodded in music faded and then picked up again going into a faster number severus released the blonde in his arms and held out his hand shall we remus smiled and took his arm for support as the crowd fractured in front of them harry stood outside the portrait to the common room the fat lady seemed quite annoyed that he hadntyet given the password and even moreso that he didntseem about to instead he was staring off into space his face looking completely and utterly shell shocked until dean came up the staircase and ushered harry into the common room harry floated off to bed finally giving up on his pajama top after he d buttoned it wrong four times one of those times inside out it occurred to him just as he fell asleep that maybe he ought to have kissed back remus darted into the great hall fifteen minutes before breakfast ended his hair still damp from the showers and his sleeve cuffs unbuttoned several people mostly remus friends in the older years stared at him and laughed in a friendly way as he plunked into a seat at the gryffindor table clearly not wanting to waste the time to get to the teachers table and began adding sugar to a bowl of apple cinnamon oatmeal he poured a cup of tea and drained most of it at one go before crunching into a piece of toast harry leaned back hastily to give remus free access to the bacon and muffins what were you doing last night to be so hungry harry stared in disbelief he d never seen anyone eat so much so fast not even ron at the welcoming feast remus mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like necking into his orange juice before standing up and hurrying out to brush his teeth so if we assume that all undetectable poisons are indeed illegal how are the laws banning them enforced severus looked desperately in the direction of the slytherins before calling on hermione all undetectable poisons show certain signs after the death of the person or persons who ingested them professor hermione answered promptly and severus nodded absently before starting in on the laws about undetectable poisons and when they were created and so on harry took advantage of his unusual distractedness to scribble a note to his two best friends terribly out of it today isnthe he expected ron to crack a joke and hermione to be generally disapproving over writing notes in class so their reactions shocked him immensely ron just stared at severus for several seconds before shrugging hermione inked an answer beneath harry original line lavender was in the hospital wing last night because she tripped on her robes and twisted her ankle and she said when she was leaving she saw him kissing remus good night right in the middle of the corridor hermione rarely indulged in gossip and even more rarely spread it around so harry knew there was more to be had what else did she say miss granger hermione gasped and hastily shoved the parchment under her book eighteen ninety four sir she answered promptly harry was impressed he had no idea what the question was much less the answer hermione pulled the parchment back out well she did say they looked rather involved in each other hermione admitted grudgingly i think remus said this morning at breakfast that they were hermione poked him in the side harry looked up er sorry sir the class laughed harry turned a becoming shade of pink severus rolled his eyes mr potter do i need to buy you a hearing trumpet so i may save my vocal cords er sorry harry responded professor severus sighed heavily before moving back toward his own desk since mr potter does not wish to contribute to the class the potion known as veneficus abolesco 2 or vanishing poison is the most recently discovered potion classified as undetectable having been discovered in 1976 can anyone tell me why its classification is inaccurate a long pause and then a resigned miss granger the poison works by causing the drinker to fade hermione responded unhesitatingly death doesntactually occur until the person is merely a shadow almost invisible and completely permeable at this point the blood is forced to drain from the body and the lungs can no longer sustain thank you miss granger severus cut across hermione explanation of the unsavory things that happened once the skin membrane became completely pervious dean raised his hand who discovered it sir the name not listed in the text i did severus responded entirely by accident in my first n e w t potions class i was quite lucky in that my partner decided a bezoar was in order when she tried to seize my wrist and her hand passed through it entirely and from that point forward i restricted my experimentation to gnomes several people tittered nervously at the face severus made when he said gnomes it was something like a cross between a grimace and a snarl that not true hermione wrote indignantly remus was one of his test subjects for an early version of the wolfsbane he told me so himself harry was stunned that was something he hadntknown really he also told me he had to wear robes for a month until he transformed again because the first time he took it he inexplicably retained his tail and they couldntget rid of it harry couldnthelp it the mental image of remus trying to calm a tail he was unconsciously wagging at the dinner table was simply too much hermione warning came in the form of several badly suppressed rapid breaths and then harry started laughing uncontrollably even severus snape raised eyebrow of evil death wasntenough to stop him what did bring him back to earth with an extremely painful bump was severus query you find undetectable poisons amusing mr potter harry gaped foolishly for several seconds before finally stuttering i just er well i mean i just wondered which parts vanish first or is it a uniform fade severus gifted him with a long suffering look seeing as i was fully clothed at the time of ingestion and the veneficus abolesco potion has only since been brewed by qualified masters in the employ of the ministry of magic mr potter i am afraid i am completely unable to answer your question although i would assume that the extremities are first to go seeing as i wasntforced to run from the classroom naked and screaming as class ended fifteen minutes later harry could have sworn that severus smiled at him very slightly good afternoon class remus chanted in the friendly mocking way he used to greet his classes and the usual mosaic of hey and what up professor and good afternoon professor lupin from hermione and hmmmpphho prphhhsrrrr from neville floated back to him remus gestured to the tiny colorful woman sitting in the corner today we re playing host to a ministry employee remus faltered i sorry i still cantfigure out how to pronounce your name the woman smiled at him neh fur tee tee she enunciated clearly nefertiti jones dontworry about it she added as remus did his usual shrug blush apologetic smile i get it all the time right then everyone this is nefertiti jones you know what i think i going to go change my name to jones and have a kid just so i can name her that that got to be one of the positively coolest names i ve heard since i was eleven years old and this big chunky kid walked up to me called me four eyes and told me his name was sirius and what was i laughing at remus reminisced and everyone started laughing it was common knowledge that remus who absolutely hated being called four eyes a common occurrence when he was eleven years old and still in coke bottle spectacles had promptly got in a fistfight with sirius who gave up after remus broke his nose it wouldntbe the last time either anyway she here to check out the class and make sure i not teaching you all how to feed dynamite to iguanas several people laughed or things like that although that would be rather amusing i wonder if we could get peeves to swallow some dynamite in the name of a practical demonstration remus pretended to ponder the idea as everyone started laughing again this class had no trouble remembering gred and forge and give her hell from us peeves and several people linked the two in their minds coming up with the general picture of the weasley twins they were immortalized as such forever within hogwarts now feeding peeves their fireworks open up to page four hundred and sixty nine everyone honestly what got into you all today harry didnthave the heart to tell his guardian he d started it all by repeating remus necking comment to ron who in tones of loud disbelief accidentally reported it to half the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables who d wasted no time in spreading it further until now the story went that remus and severus had been practically having sex right in the corridor harry wondered what kind of a time severus was having down in the dungeons right now and grinned as he opened his book to the section on acromantulas now i should warn you all right now that next lesson we re going to be going into the forest with professors hagrid and snape ron let out a small gasp of terror it didnttake trelawney crystal ball to see what was coming because there a colony of acromantulai 3 in there and he managed to get a male and female who ve agreed to let us study them without attacking us now several people whispered to each other so you ll have the opportunity to see them up close remus attitude suddenly changed and he became more serious than harry had ever seen him acromantulai are very intelligent creatures and are of course capable of holding conversations and understanding what is said around them if you feel you cannot be mature enough to join us in the forest i will arrange for you to stay behind and write a report instead the forest is a dangerous place even with teachers around you and in the daylight and if you ve done your reading i sure you ll be aware that acromantulai are also quite dangerous and absolutely must be treated with complete respect anyone who makes light in an inappropriate manner will be punished severely yes ron ron had raised his hand trying not to shake when he did er professor could i i mean would it be too much trouble if i d prefer if you came with the class ron remus answered before pulling a small angular ball type thing about the size of an orange out of his desk and tossing it casually in the air 4 so can anyone tell me the origin of the acromantula hermione threw her hand in the air just as neville raised his own hesitantly remus tossed the ball to neville erm well nobody knows really do they i mean we re pretty sure acromantulai were wizard created and not natural creatures but nobody can say for sure where they came from neville answered the ball broke open in his hands and a chocolate frog card slipped out before the ball re sealed itself neville looked round cautiously and then threw the ball back to or rather in the general direction of remus who ducked and cast his hands quickly into the air above his head to palm the ball and pull it out of the air excellent answer neville so why do we think acromantulai were created he lobbed the ball to lavender who squealed and dropped it er um well professor um she wants you lavender stuttered pointing toward nefertiti jones who was ducked down in her chair with an apologetic smile remus turned to her clearly braced for an umbridge like attack i sorry professor lupin but i forgot to ask you before the beginning of class could i have maybe five minutes at the end to speak with your students individually remus flicked to the end of the day lesson in his binder never again would severus be able to make a comment about his disorganization regarding his lesson plans anyway and traced halfway down the page with a finger before pausing to do some mental calculations then he smiled warmly at the black haired woman in the corner i think we can manage at least that if lavender puts away her divination homework and pays attention to the lesson remus stated laying a good deal of stress and volume on the last part of the sentence lavender squeaked and dropped unfogging the future on her bag now lavender didntyou have a question to answer lavender stuttered and stammered until it came out that she didntknow the answer harry caught the ball as she lobbed it toward him feeling quite glad he had well honed seeker skills lavender aim was even worse than neville s acromantulai were first sighted in the 1790 right after the war of thade and because so much gold was at stake during the war it believed that they were originally bred to guard treasure and contraband the ball fell open and harry extracted a square of chocolate with a grin go ahead and pack up everyone and please show miss jones the same respect you would any of your teachers remus announced closing his binder with a snap 5 and turning the class over to nefertiti jones actually professor i think i ve got all i need if i could just speak with you remus made some kind of affirmative gesture as the students packed up harry deliberately knocked his bag off his desk and began putting things back in it very very slowly so he could hear what was going on nefertiti jones was asking about the wisdom of taking the students to see potentially dangerous creatures the creatures in question were bred by rubeus hagrid the care of magical creatures professor and we re talking a maximum of eight students per teacher remus answered promptly and harry felt proud we ve also got two other people coming with us although the students dontknow it yet and they re both qualified to work with dangerous creatures we ve been planning this since oh i going to say mid october maybe several months at least i think hands on experience when it possible is always preferable to simple book learning because there only so much you can learn off a page nefertiti jones finished scribbling her comments smiled at remus briefly and shook his hand firmly before informing him that his report would be available within five days remus smiled her out of the classroom and then he just looked tired he yawned and considered getting a potion from poppy for the headache that was settling in behind his eyes before going down to lunch she been arrested she been arrested dean thomas raced down the aisle between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables screeching like a fire siren rousing people left and right before skidding to a stop at his seat opposite harry ron and hermione throwing his daily prophet down on the table and plonking down on the bench harry and hermione both grabbed for the paper at the same time and succeeded only in ripping the entire bottom section in half at that moment hermione morning paper fluttered down in front of her along with harry copy of the quibbler he d started taking it in november both paper and magazine showed a picture of a toadlike woman in a pink cardigan and a black hair bow her face slightly more pleasant for the lack of a smile uproar at ministry senior undersecretary to the minister arrested read the prophet headline coverup in the minister office the story the ministry doesntwant you to know screamed the front cover of the quibbler both told essentially the same story dolores umbridge had been arrested for using the cruciatus curse on two werewolves one of them a child and the inquiry into her work at the ministry was being intenisfied in addition to the unforgivable curse she was being held on counts of perjury abuse of power harry and remus were both mentioned breach of magical conduct and high treason it seemed she d been caught talking to a group of known death eaters and maybe even passing them information trial by the full wizengamot was set for april 19 up at the head table remus sneezed miserably into his handkerchief before opening his post he had two letters from the ministry one informed him that he d performed excellently in his examination by miss nefertiti jones etc the other was a request for him to testify in front of the wizengamot on april 19 in regard to charges set forth and so on remus eyes wandered and teared up yet again and he dabbed at them wearily with the corner of the handkerchief severus tapped him on the shoulder and passed him the front page of the prophet remus read as much of the article as he could before turning to grin at his partner think i ll be over this in time to give the bitch what she deserves he queried before coughing heavily into his tea severus smiled at him almost invisibly and patted his back in a reassuring manner as he shook his head you ll be over it for sure but i damned if i can tell how the bloody hell you caught a head cold he murmured before rubbing his temples and sniffing slightly think i ll go see poppy about this headache he murmured scrubbing a hand over his eyes before standing and exiting the hall remus thought back to the dance four nights ago and the kiss goodbye that followed it oh dear he chuckled quietly into his corn flakes as he folded the prophet and set it aside in favor of a large breakfast 1 malfoy seeker crabbe and goyle beaters and one

gods of fanfiction fate were kind to me thanks muses 3 no plural is given for this in books 1 5 or either of harry schoolbooks the comic relief books and since i not using half blood prince as a

fantastic beasts and where to find them a colony of acromantula is mentioned the plural being acromantulai think along the lines of octopus octopi for this one 4 a huge thank you to my social studies teacher kevin wible who played a similar review game with us every day to make sure we were doing our homework 5 i just wanted to share a laugh with you all upon rereading this for draft i realized i d typed snape instead of snap i think i ve been reading too much liner notes important note to all bottle of ink readers as of 31 august 2005 i will be in the 12th grade that the highest grade in the united states school system for those of you who have different school systems this will involve a lot of homework time and effort i am aware that boi updates are already few and far between and i apologise for that however with all that is going on in my life plus my recent branch out to livejournal and the upkeep of the memory room i simply donthave the time to update constantly therefore bottle of ink is not being abandoned but it will be a less frequently updated story expect updates to pick back up around christmas a particularly inspirational time for me as well as being vacation time and easter ditto and then again in june when i get out of school assuming the story isntdone by then rating there is nothing particularly offensive in this chapter except for one usage of mild language but as earlier chapters are rated t pg 13 this chapter will be as well thank you to my readers for taking bottle of ink past 2 000 hits on this website i canttell you how positively uplifting it was to see that number also at 86 reviews it the most feedback oriented story i ve ever written reviews i got something in my email that appears to be spam but just in case we re supposedly no longer allowed to answer reviews in our author notes i think this is sheer bollocks and i ve written to the site to find out if it is true in the meantime i just going to answer general questions not reviews because i dontwant to lose my account so here you go remus immunity to arsenic think very very very hard boys and girls it is not lycanthropy that makes remus immune to arsenic go reread the scene in voldemort dungeon a hint to his immunity is mentioned make sure to read very carefully conflicting information in emails to several people way back in the early days of boi mostly before severus even entered the picture in person i said that remus would be very different onstage than offstage and that onstage he wouldntmind being a boy toy if it made people laugh apparently this was misinterpreted as him being extremely affection shy this isntthe case at all and it never has been the most you see of that is in the christmas eve chapter when he kisses severus and they both blush and look away he a very affectionate person and is willing to show it it just that he more of an actions not words person in my opinion sorry for the confusion she wants you this was in the original concept got cut got put in a different place was cut again was changed and put back was cut again and then when i typed the final draft it sort of worked its way in without my thinking about the pun was intentional but the fact that it there was accidental wible review game i had to laugh so hard when my friends all picked up on this as soon as they read it without ever reading the reference notes wible used a miniature football american kind the one shaped sort of like a pair of brackets and it did not give chocolate although sometimes he did for a correct answer that was my own magical twist on the game i glad it was so enjoyed though kissing remus and severus have kissed several times so why do you people keep saying they never do the first incident was in chapter 13 as i number them on reunions and dark things when severus passes remus a note that we never find out the contents of but remus unfolded it and began to read blushing scarlet almost immediately so you can bet it was probably pretty inappropriate or overly sentimental for severus at least the next incident first kiss is at the end of the next chapter on new beginnings it doesntsay outright that they kissed each other but i ve not met anyone yet who hasntfigured out that that what happened there another kiss in chapter 18 on christmas and then the one in the last chapter so why do you people keep saying i donthave enough in here honestly if you want r rated go to livejournal there some good stuff there aaanywayy enough of me on to umbridge eleonora1 this plot bunny for you and this chapter is dedicated to atalantapendrag of livejournal who made me a beautiful new severus icon you can visit my livejournal at the username masterofone i dontunderstand why you wanted me to come here with you i thought you wanted to do this remus huddled closer to severus and harry trying to keep his head down i do want to but harry squeezed remus hand as much for his own reassurance as for remus it going to be okay remus really i mean we re bound to tell the truth arentwe remus and severus both shook their heads veritaserum can be fought in many cases 1 severus answered especially when you know you ve taken it that why aurors try to sneak it into the people they re questioning to ensure they re not fighting as diligently against it the courtroom stood as the wizengamot entered remus whimpered into severus shoulder he hadnteaten anything that morning harry d never seen him so nervous the minister was not presiding at this trial unlike he had at harry s because of a possible conflict of interest instead amelia bones took his place bring in the prisoner she declared and dolores umbridge flanked by aurors on either side and wearing only a plain grey robe strode in and stood sulkily in front of the stone chair harry recognised both from the pensieve and his own experience amelia bones voice carried throughout the room dolores jane umbridge age 53 2 currently residing at the oaks manor in the sussex downs amelia bones eyed the toadlike woman standing and sulking on the floor until she nodded grudgingly at which point she was ordered to sit the chains on the chair arms clinked and clanked and snaked over her wrists dolores umbridge you are here today to answer to claims that you have used an unforgivable curse on two humans that you have abused the powers of your office to an excessive and destructive degree that you have lied under oath to the wizengamot in order to meet your own ends or the ends of others instead of the ends of justice that you have intended or committed acts of harm against a minor that you have intended and attempted to use an unforgivable curse on a minor that you have set dementors on a minor that you have set dementors against an innocent person and that you have affiliated with known members of that group calling and styling themselves the death eaters also the servants of that former wizard known as lord voldemort in an attempt to infiltrate and destroy our manner of government anything you say in this court may be used against you or cross examined witnesses can and will be called to testify against you or if you so choose in your favor if you have arranged for this matter you are considered innocent until proven guilty and if charges of guilt are passed you will be sentenced by your peers those members of the court currently standing before you at that time amelia bones cleared her throat presiding amelia bones recording percival ignatius weasley are we ready to begin several nerve wracking hours passed and then harry was called to testify about his own trial almost two years ago and the reign of terror umbridge had inspired at hogwarts apparently lisa turpin had told her mother about harry detentions remus looked only slightly more relaxed and harry suspected he wouldntrelax entirely until after he d had his turn amelia bones motioned harry forward not unkindly to the small wooden box at the end of the table where he and the other witnesses were sitting harry put his hands on the ledge and tried not to cringe under the scrutiny harry d started apparition lessons in october as a precaution in case he had to get away from voldemort the horrible feeling of disappearing into nothing as though he were no more substantial than a sugar cube was nothing compared to this he gave his name and address none the apartment building where he and remus had lived last summer had been destroyed by marauding disorganized post voldemort death eaters and took an oath before amelia bones fixed her monocle more tightly over her eye and peered at him the matter of the dementors was over in several minutes the sectumius quill took a bit longer finally growing tired of the intense scrutiny harry held up his right hand turned the back toward the wizengamot and made a fist here i ve still got scars if you d care to see them he stated amelia bones sent a representative of the wizengamot to examine harry hand the short stout wizard examined the pearly scars for several moments before turning to the people seated along the back wall it says i must not tell lies your honor the man announced amelia bones nodded for him to retake his seat the questioning went through hagrid and remus examinations the removal of hagrid from hogwarts and the inquisitorial squad who had it transpired been authorized to use violence to end the rebellion of the students against umbridge if harry d thought that was bad the questioning over her use of the cruciatus was even worse you are positive this is the spell she intended to use yes severus had already told him not to get impatient and start in with i already told you because in the interest of ensuring everything was correct things did tend to get repeated and you are certain of this in what manner seeing that it was not cast on you she said she was going to use it for one and for another she was halfway through saying the spell before she was stopped and how was she stopped one of my friends pretended to tell her what she wanted to know load of rubbish actually harry added thinking of the secret weapon hiding in the trees of the dark forest and what exactly do you mean mr potter by a load of rubbish i mean hermione a friend of mine made up a story to distract her so she wouldntcurse me ah a short pause and this as i understand is how the accused found herself in the dark forest that stands on the hogwarts grounds right and was then attacked by a herd of centaurs after she made a right good job of insulting them yes a pause thank you mr potter another pause does the accused wish to object to any of the statements made by mr harry potter dolores umbridge nodded furiously i certainly do the accused will please proceed mr potter refused to act appropriately in class dolores umbridge began furiously i reprimanded him several times before giving him detention later he would take part in an illegal group that was learning the dark arts in order to overthrow the ministry and finally mr potter and his aforementioned friend led me into the dark forest leading me to believe that there was some kind of weapon hidden within it and then set the centaurs on me in addition i caught him breaking into my office to converse with a person or persons unknown although i had reason to believe he was contacting sirius black harry made a sound of disbelieving anger in his throat amelia bones turned her attention to him does mr potter wish to object to any of the statements made by miss dolores umbridge yeah i do harry answered his rage rising i didntlisten in class because what she was teaching us was rubbish we didnteven get to practice the spells that are supposed to protect us in the real world i mean even if voldemort hadnt been out there that not to say that nobody else could try to take his place at some point within our lifetimes right someone we d have to defend ourselves against i taught the defense against the dark arts group she talked about and when i taught it i only knew three dark spells the unforgiveables and that because we learned about them in class the year before i couldntcast them then and i cantcast them now we never even discussed them except in the context of how to protect yourself against them i taught things like disarming and stunning and how to conjure a patronus not dark magic and we wouldnthave had to lead her into the forest so we could get away from her if she hadnttried to curse me for one and if she hadntlet the slytherins hurt and almost kill several of our other friends for another amelia bones looked impressed apparently harry latent talent for instant comebacks was growing thanks to his contact with remus and severus harry took a deep breath and finally i was in her office because all our mail was being searched for no apparent good reason and the floo network was being monitored also for no apparent good reason and i had to talk to sirius she was right about that bit but i couldntbecause of all the stuff going on you know umbridge sat gaping like a fish amelia bones nodded at harry thank you mr potter you may stand down a pause remus lupin will take the stand remus stood up looking ready to faint severus forced him to take a small baggie of vegetable crisps 3 with him remus nibbled halfheartedly on the corner of one of the crisps until he was asked to take the oath at which point he set the baggie down on the ledge of the box so he could put his right hand on his heart and his left in the air he seemed to relax visibly once the oath was taken and he finished his first crisp before starting on another while the wizengamot rearranged papers and so on he d finished a grand total of four crisps before the questioning began harry was stunned to learn that the adult werewolf umbridge had cursed was in fact remus this occurred when in oh i going to say maybe march in 1992 it was cold but most of the snow was melted except for those big piles that take forever to disappear i remember that and you gave the accused no just cause to attack you no remus took a deep breath the same way he did in classes i was in this sort of dead end alley place in london one of those with three or four tiny little shops in it because i was looking for this place someone in the soup kitchen told me about i was coming out of the alley when i ran into her i didntknow who she was at the time and i figured since she was there i d ask for directions she gave me this sort of disgusted look and said she guessed next i d want money i told her i d be happy to take any spare change she was willing to give up because i was tired of eating cold bag lunches from the food van 4 but i wasntgoing to make her give me anything if she didntwant to and that was when she cursed me you didntapproach her in a threatening manner or declare violent or harmful intentions no i just sort of bumped into her by accident when i was coming out of the alley it just happened that she was a witch it could have been anybody on the street that sort of thing happens all the time in london and what were you doing in that alley i was looking for a homeless shelter someone at the soup kitchen told me about i didnthave a place to live at that point and i d been sleeping in a garage for most of the winter but then the owners came back from holiday and i didntthink they d appreciate having a strange man staying there even though i never took or damaged anything so i needed a place to sleep other than down a dead end hoping it wouldntsnow and freeze me to death so it would have made no difference to you if she had been a muggle no i ve got a lot of muggle friends it doesntbother me i just wanted directions do you think she could have misconstrued your actions as aggressive remus paused i dontsee how he finally answered i mean i told her straight out that i didntwant anything she wasntwilling to give and all i was carrying at the time was a peanut butter sandwich in a baggie and a paper with really really bad directions and an address on it my pockets were mostly empty and what was in them wasntanything big so she couldnthave thought i was carrying a weapon even unless she knew somehow that i was a wizard and carrying a wand and i dontsee how she could have assuming that the accused had given you money what would you have done with it that would depend on the amount why because i was basically saving coins out of the gutter at that point remus reminisced i think the biggest thing i ever found was a watch that i returned to the owner and got a five pound reward for and the largest amount of money was no more than half a pound if i d had enough i would have gone and got something hot to eat or a new pair of shoes mine were mostly held together with glue i d got at a discount store if not i d just have kept saving how long were you subjected to the cruciatus curse mr lupin remus looked perplexed i have no idea i didntown a watch then and there werentany of those clocks you see sometimes outside market buildings i dontthink i was actually under it for very long but it felt like a good deal of time amelia bones nodded understandingly and when it was lifted what happened she told me that no decent citizen ought to be subjected to my kind of filth do you have any idea what she was referring to i think maybe well i think one of two things i hadnthad a chance to wash my clothes in two or three days and like i said it was some time around march you walk the streets all day and sleep in doorways at night you re bound to get unbelievably muddy in a startlingly short period of time at that time of year so i didntexactly look like a rose in june that one and i think the other might have been the idea however erroneous that homeless people are all lazy or drug addicts or alcoholics or things like that therefore they re scum and did you reply to the comment made by the accused i was still trying to catch my breath she walked away before i could say anything i see could i ask you about your examination by the accused when she held the position formerly known as high inquisitor of course i would like you to recount it if you would mr lupin remus detailed the day umbridge had watched the class citing her constant interruptions and attempts to undermine his authority as well as her disapproval of his disciplining a student for inappropriate behavior he continued the narrative up to the point that he received the letter demanding his resignation and then at amelia bones request narrated the day that nefertiti jones had spent in his classroom as opposed to his first examination umbridge seemed too much in shock to protest but when it came her turn to do so she did so quite soundly unfortunately for her remus clear and careful recitation of the facts had rattled her to the point that she left several gaping holes in her version of the story including the part where she made no attempt to hide the fact that she agreed quite thoroughly with draco malfoy about his comments in class the wizengamot was asked to deliberate a two hour recess was ordered harry supported his guardian as they left the dungeon courtroom to go get a breath of air and a bite to eat remus was muttering worriedly about the possibility of umbridge getting off and what would happen to his job if she did remus calm down she been stripped of her credibility now even if she gets off she canttouch you harry reasoned and anyway if dumbledore and severus arentenough to protect you a grin spread slowly across his face you ve got sixteen hundred people who stood up for you before and they d do it again i sure severus carefully removed remus scarf from his partner hands in his anxiety remus had twisted it almost to the point of shredding it harry has a point remus the darkhaired man pointed out trying to be careful of remus hands sans the scarf he was now wringing his hands desperately and severus was slightly worried about the possibility that remus would have bad bruises on his hands lycanthropic blood or no they cantdo a thing remus nodded absentmindedly sympathetic to remus nerve twisted stomach severus ordered him a bowl of chicken soup and some crackers with tea when they sat down at a small streetside cafe a more ravenous harry chose a chicken salad and a dish of shepherd pie severus didntorder anything but a cup of iced coffee harry was highly amused when severus promptly emptied half the coffee into a second cup finished filling the first with milk and added three teaspoons of sugar apparently severus nerves werentfaring any better than his partner s harry however didnthave any worries umbridge had had this coming to her for years he was sure the wizengamot finds dolores umbrige guilty of using an unforgiveable curse and recognises the claimants remus lupin and the mother of emily greenhorn however because of a corollary to the original sentencing laws in regard to the use of the cruciatus curse dolores umbridge has been sentenced to two years in azkaban on each count of use of an unforgiveable curse to be served consecutively 5 the courtroom filled with hogwarts students so many of the older students had begged to go to the trial in order to show support for remus that all students in fifth year and above had been excused for the day began to buzz angrily four years for her crimes outrage the spokeswitch for the sentencing continued placidly the wizengamot finds dolores umbridge guilty of abusing the powers of her office to an undue and destructive degree and has voted in favor of dolores umbridge being suspended from ministry work in addition to a two year sentence in azkaban consecutive to the sentence of the former charge more buzzing though it was slightly more satisfied the witch plowed on the wizengamot finds dolores umbridge guilty of four counts of perjury and sentences her to three years in azkaban per count to be served consecutively to the sentences of the former charges that a total of eighteen years hermione whispered to lavender brown who was sitting next to her and glaring with all her puppy eyed might at the grey clad toad lavender smiled and passed this news on to ginny and luna behind her parvati to her immediate left and dean thomas and ernie macmillan in front of her hermione repeated the news to ron sitting on her right who lost no time in conveying it to his seatmate some fifth year hufflepuff girl he didntactually know the buzzing began again the wizengamot finds dolores umbridge guilty of twenty two out of forty six counts of violence or harm intended or committed against a minor or minors unnamed and sentences her to three months in azkaban per count to be served consecutively to the sentences of the former charges more angry buzzing further for each of the remaining twenty four counts dolores umbridge will complete ten hours of unpaid service in the werewolf liasion office upon her release from azkaban several people snickered as umbridge paled the wizengamot finds dolores umbridge guilty of two counts of violation of the dark creature laws as regard dementors one of these counts against a muggle minor 6 for this crime the wizengamot sentences dolores umbridge to one year in deleohominum 7 institute remus gasped this time sirius had got off lucky on one count for not having a trial he would surely have ended up in deleohominum if he had and if he had he d have never survived for twelve years deleohominum institute was the wizarding version of death row once you got in you really didntget out nobody had even attempted a true breakout from deleohominum in its 400 year history much less succeeded at one not even an animagus from the 1700s who d tried to worm out as a snake remus almost but not quite pitied her and finally the wizengamot strikes its sentence of unpaid service the buzzing became so loud that the spokeswitch actually held up her hand to abridge it in light of the fact that it will never be served the wizengamot finds dolores umbridge guilty of consorting and conspiring with known members of that group calling itself the death eaters comforting and abetting members of aforesaid group and passing on confidential intelligence from within the ministry with the full and coherent knowledge that said information would be used by the dark wizard formerly styling himself lord voldemort for these crimes the wizengamot sentences dolores umbridge to life in azkaban grimmauld place was a great scene of jubilation that evening most of harry classmates had crowded in along with several of the teachers sirius remus sisters bugsy and catherine they d even dragged ty along with them and catherine had brought her husband stephen and once classes ended on the other side of the atlantic mary anne floo ed through to party hard with her older brother it was close to eleven o clock when everyone finally got back to wherever they were supposed to be going mary anne only left because it was time for supper back in maine at which point severus and sirius sat at the kitchen table staring at each other and remus finished wiping up a few last dishes harry was sitting at the far end of the kitchen table staring at his hands and acting oddly morose finally remus sat down and poured himself a cup of tea harry stood up and made to leave the kitchen hey there where are you going remus called and harry wheeled abruptly sitting back down at the table mechanically what going on with you the past few days harry remus prompted harry shrugged severus cut in this is about he gestured between remus and sirius isntit harry looked up without quite raising his head creating the overall effect of a kicked puppy sirius rolled his eyes and reached out to ruffle his former godson hair we already talked about this harry i not such a bastard i d take you away from a place you re happy in he paused and then gave his trademark mischievous grin anyway remus probably makes a far better father figure than i do he d be the one grounding you for going out and getting drunk and i d be the one passing a six pack in through your window harry couldnthelp but laugh slightly at that then remus said his bit i really think you d be better off staying with sirius though harry he interjected trying to be gentle about it i mean i ve been looking for another apartment but i haventbeen able to find one and i know we ve got about two months until the end of school but the way things are going i probably going to end up staying there over the summer at least here you d have a real roof over your head instead of being out on the street complete bollocks severus cut in and remus turned to stare at him donttalk rubbish you re coming to kent what in kent my house harry looked puzzled i thought you had an apartment i did when voldemort was still alive i haventbeen there in four years but i daresay if we took a week or two to clean it up we could make it pass remus looked shell shocked you mean we could it a decent sized house severus paused well compared to a normal house it fairly large dontever hold it up next to malfoy manor though because you ll make it look like a fish shack harry stared at remus remus stared at severus severus pretended to be nonchalantly examining his fingernails finally sirius stood walked to the carving table and removed the butcher knife from the rack he returned and set the knife down in the middle of the table everyone stared at it then at him sirius smiled demurely just figured somebody might want to cut the tension doesntthat seem awfully fast to you harry hermione prompted her quill hovering nervously quivering over her essay on polyjuice potion i mean they haventeven been together for a year it not like remus is throwing away his whole life for it hermione give harry a break arentyou the one who keeps telling him to finish his potions essay ron cut in hermione huffed and refused to look at him he got a point though hermione if we d still had the apartment i dontthink remus would do it but we really donthave anywhere else to go luna sat down next to him and sighed o w l s were creeping ever closer and even she was feeling the strain harry took her hand encouragingly hermione tried not to grin knowingly she didntsucceed luna closed her eyes and leaned on harry shoulder i ve spent all day writing essays harry do you know that she murmured tipping a bagful of parchment rolls on to the table oh my eyes hurt hermione waved her wand and handed luna a small cool pack of something to put over her eyes you ve probably got eyestrain luna hermione admonished you really ought to write your essays as they re assigned i have been luna replied a feistier tone would have suggested an argument but she sounded pale and worn out professor flitwick assigned one yesterday and so did professors mcgonagall and snape and binns and i had almost two hundred pages to read for muggle studies n e arentthis bad are they she sounded like she wanted an optimistic answer not a true one well we haventtaken the real n e w t s yet but i know remus has two sisters who are taking them this year and they re both doing pretty well well mary anne is doing well margarette kind of freaks out about everything luna nodded picked up her bag wearily and moved toward a carrel in the back of the library she still had hours of cross referencing ahead of her thank you for the ice hermione she shot over her shoulder as she walked away and hermione smiled at her as she glanced back over her shoulder luna was no more than just barely out of earshot when ron poked harry in the side what was that all about mate er nothing ron do you know what causes imperio potion to curdle harry bent his head toward his parchment to hide the blushing grin growing on his face the fairly long reference notes 1 jkr confirmed this in an online interview when someone asked why fudge didntsimply apply veritaserum to sirius when he was caught in poa or even before that when he was first captured to ensure that they had the right man barty crouch jr would have had a hard time fighting it because he was a caught unawares and b just waking up from being stunned when he was questioned however if you know it coming it sort of like pain you re better steeled against it you can also be allergic resistant or immune to it so it not as reliable as snape makes it sound in gof 2 i couldntremember her age being listed in the books so i checked the harry potter lexicon a source jkr also uses so you better believe it pretty accurate where lo and behold no age is listed i therefore gave her an age place of residence and so on if this information is listed in any foreign non us copies of the book most likely ootp please pass it on to me also an additional sidenote although harry is tried by the full wizengamot his is not a criminal trial to this extent nor are the trials of barty crouch jr the lestranges unknown man or karkaroff that we see in the pensieve therefore this trial setup is basically created by me 3 for those who dontremember from earlier in the story crisps are what we americans call chips i am thinking here of a kind of cracker actually that is called vegetable thins i think it made by nabisco but i wouldntswear to that i know giving someone potato chips crisps on an empty stomach especially when said person is quite nervous is about the stupidest thing you can do hence the final draft changed this from crisps to vegetable crisps which are actually quite sustaining and delicious 4 dontknow if anybody knows the real name for these but i do hope so they re sort of mobile soup kitchens that move around day to day so they can help as many homeless people as possible some of them also offer free medical care to homeless people and hand out new donated usually gently used salvation army type clothing 5 this means she d be serving the sentences one after the other as opposed to simultaneous serving serving both sentences at the same time also this corollary does sadly deal with the fact that remus and little emily were both werewolves keep it in mind because i might end up using it again and as hermione would say if you d done your homework and paid attention to remus lessons you d have known this was coming ages ago because cho asked about it lol okay that one was a bit obscure 6 when the dementors attacked harry and dudley in ootp umbridge later confirmed that she d sent them in order to destroy harry credibility 7 same latin site as before deleo to destroy wipe out erase blot out erase annihilate destroy to obliterate efface hominum human genus hominum means human race author notes wow there were lots of reviews but no actual questions so thanks to everyone who reviewed but most of all to a dawn rae who gave me squee my 100th review she gets a write in in a few chapters lucky girl but there are still chances for others because i am removing my anon reviews and going all brand name if you will anon tend to attract flamers so the number 100 spot will most likely soon be open again and if not there always 200 rating this chapter is rated t pg 13 for language moderate het relationship kissing hugging etc and moderate homosexuality dontlike skip it but i warning you the next chapter has a mild sex scene in it what that in your hair loony harry froze as he heard the familiar voices in the next corridor one was marietta edgecombe one was it couldntbe she wouldnt would she she looks like draco and the longbottom boy toad had an affair doesntshe harry peeked around the corner luna was standing trying not to cry on the open air terrace by the trophy room being terrorized by marietta and he knew he d heard that voice before cho chang she had an enormous ornamental butterfly fluttering in her hair just above her ear contrary to looking like a cross between malfoy and a toad harry thought she looked rather nice certainly the butterfly was much better than the orange radish earrings although he wouldntever have told her that look at that cho she crying what the matter loony her name is luna harry said loudly turning the corner full on and causing the two older ravenclaws to jump guiltily and if you re going to stoop so low as to pick on someone two years younger than you you shouldntbe wearing that badge marietta he pointed to the head girl badge on her robes ooh has potty got a gurrrrrlfriend marietta taunted harry froze how was he supposed to answer that especially in front of cho should he answer at all walk away threaten to tell a teacher why do you care what cho thinks yeah i have got harry answered grabbing luna hand and her name is luna why on earth would you want to go out with luna lovegood harry cho looked genuinely confused because she smart and she funny and she doesntrun round crying all the time harry announced growing angrier by the minute couldntthey just leave her alone couldntthey but she crazy cho continued sounding more and more like a petulant five year old and she come on cho marietta urged we need to get up to divination for the n e w t exam harry grabbed at cho arm as she turned away she gave a sharp gasp and pulled away it was her left arm harry yanked her forward and shoved her sleeve up her arm the skull and snake glinted a dull red he raised his head to meet her eyes predictably they were swimming with tears when did you get this cho sobbed h h he t told me he c c c could bring back diggory right cho nodded he said the same thing about my parents cho you you re going to turn me in arentyou harry considered no not now both girls visibly relaxed but i think you need to get your priorities straight cho diggory wouldntbe dead if voldemort hadntkilled him in the first place because he was the spare voldemort didntgive a damn about him he just wanted another puppet he paused the girls stared at him get out of here they were only too happy to comply luna grabbed his other wrist as soon as cho and marietta had disappeared harry did you mean that about me being your girlfriend oh that right er well i mean harry grew redder with every word i mean i know i never asked you but well that if you dontwant to be i d love to be luna hugged him tightly and kissed him on the cheek that made the third or fourth time since october didntit harry thought to himself luna suddenly caught sight of his watch and gasped i have to go harry i supposed to be downstairs for the potions practical this morning that wasntpossible harry thought snape couldntoversee two years at one time oh right luna had her o w l s good luck he offered and luna beamed before hugging him again and speeding away toward the dungeons this has to have been one of the longest days of my life remus sighed sinking deeply into severus couch severus raised his eyebrow i do hate to break the news to you remus but today is june fourth not june twenty first what does that have to do with anything remus slipped out of his shoes and dug his toes into the black and white carpet june 21 is the summer solstice the longest day of the year and consequently one of the longest days of your life june fourth is not severus sat down next to his partner remus promptly leaned against him i do not like grading exams neither do i but we have to set them i know a pause i had harry this morning oh how did he do i have no idea where his head was this morning but it most certainly wasntin the potions lab he ll be lucky if he gets an a conditioned between the practical and the written exam i haventread the paper yet but i have the feeling it just as bad as his potion i heard he was standing up for luna today mmm they look so sweet together dontyou think severus turned to look at the tiny man on the sofa remus the word sweet is not in my vocabulary unless it happens to be in reference to sugar buttercream icing or those little round chocolate things you get from the muggle sweets shelf in honeydukes they re called m m s severus yes those well dontyou think they look good together the only thing that looks good to me right now is the prospect of dinner but that would mean getting up severus remus pouted severus leaned over again and pressed his lips to remus cheek you silly gryffindor fool you cantkeep missing meals or people are going to think we never feed you come on up up up and away we go remus finished trying not to laugh as severus grimaced do you have to do that remus remus gave him a boyish grin and pushed himself off the hideous plaid sofa well it sure beats hell out of may the force be with you doesntit severus groaned freely remus could say all he wished about them severus did not like science fiction movies so she actually but what s her name didnt and you really and she said yes no yes and yes harry snapped out he was really getting tired of this ron and hermione had asked him the same questions in every possible form ever since he d rushed into class this morning and explained rather badly if the truth be told that he d had a run in with cho chang and her friend that had been almost nine hours ago and they still hadnttired of hearing the answers mate you ve really lost it this time ron opined through a mouthful of vegetable soup i mean cho chang was bad enough but why d you want to go declaring your undying love for someone who just well she loony harry and you a small sudden sob from behind him caused harry to turn around just in time to see waist length blonde hair disappearing out the doors of the great hall 1 he turned furiously back to the oblivious redhead who was still spouting about luna seeing things and believing everything she heard thanks a lot ron she heard you she huh why it matter she always got her head in the clouds anyway ron older brothers could have told him that it didntmatter how close you were to someone badmouthing their girlfriend was a good way to get hit he didnteven see the hand coming until it knocked him right out of his chair he scrambled to his feet confused a foot shorter or no harry seemed to tower over him the indignant boy sputtered a few furious words at ron before turning on his heel and striding out of the hall ron stared at hermione hoping for a hint about what he d done wrong hermione just sighed and shook her head before pushing back her chair looking regretfully at her half eaten soup and chicken and led ron out of the hall to take care of his rapidly swelling eye luna remus stuck his head cautiously around the door of the girls bathroom his status was no secret anymore not that it ever was really at least to anyone shrewd enough to read the signs but that didntmean that some of the more immature girls didntstill shriek at him if he tried to go into a girls bathroom with a shower in it lavender brown among that elite group of females she seemed to think it positively romantic to be followed into the bathroom by a male teacher something remus still thought he wouldntever understand nobody was in this one however except for the ravenclaw prefect sitting on the wooden bench at the end of the room sobbing and therein lay the rub remus thought luna took all kinds of criticism and bullying with nary a word of complaint it was as though the words didntaffect her at all but what else could have sent her fleeing from the great hall especially as harry and ron had been sitting right across from her albeit at different tables and as soon as she d left a fistfight had broken out between them severus had accosted ron on his way out of the hall with hermione now he was looking for harry remus had been spurred on to hunt for luna he knew her better maybe than any other teacher in the school smiling at her strange fancies and whims instead of allowing them to annoy him and perhaps for that reason he d become her confidante she didntseem to have any friends but that didntreally seem to bother her beyond the occasional bout of loneliness more sensible students than luna lovegood had been known to be rash in a fit of despair though and remus had pointed this out to the headmaster before hurrying out of the hall himself the memory of hermione and the troll on hallowe en still lived vividly in the minds of the staff none of them wanted to find out that the mani a lei 2 approach as severus called it had caused harm to a student now remus focused himself on trying to calm the distraught blonde who was hastily wiping her eyes on the sleeve of her school robes everything all right you left pretty quickly tonight he sat down beside her on the bench luna shrugged remus frowned the idea of luna lovegood doing something so mundane as shrugging her shoulders was something akin to the thought of petunia dursley disemboweling a flobberworm and stared down at the worn square of white cotton he offered her finally she took it and wiped her still wet eyes on it and then laughed a short watery note you must think i being so silly she murmured remus shook his head at her i donteven know why you ran out luna remus reminded her gently luna sobbed into the handkerchief and spilled out the entire story ending with a distraught and what if he believes it professor he ll never speak to me again and he the only friend i ve got she sniffled again i dontthink he d do that luna the blonde looked up at him in a display of hopefulness that was almost pathetic in its desperation you mean that remus paused as though considering well he did slap ron across the face so i d have to say that no he not planning on abandoning you any time soon luna gave the watery laugh again he did that remus nodded trying not to smile he was torn between wanting to reprimand harry for hitting his friends and wanting to praise him for standing up for a girl which according to the way remus had been raised was a very honorable thing to do as a teacher however he was required to disapprove the door banged open severus dragged harry in with little fanfare and forced him to stand directly in front of remus harry wouldntlook up from his left shoe which he seemed to find strangely fascinating he staying in your quarters tonight remus severus announced without preamble remus stared for several undignified seconds before getting his voice back harry what did you do when we got the two of them together weasley started letting his mouth run ahead of his brain again severus informed him that bad eh remus eyed harry who seemed to be surreptiously nursing his shoulder it took minerva and i just to keep weasley alive severus drawled albus and poppy both joined us before we could get them apart remus raised his eyebrows harry burst out in a furious and incoherent tirade about people with no brains severus slid a hand over his mouth enough harry looked furious remus stood up and took his arm severus would you mind taking luna up to ravenclaw tower if she doesntwant to go back to the great hall severus nodded remus led harry away to his own quarters where he asked harry to sit on the couch and wait for him he left and returned with two cups of some kind of frothy chocolatey coffee drink 3 handing one to harry and drinking out of the other finally he set his mug down on the coffee table and gave harry a look harry responded with an oh boy here it comes expression harry i very disappointed in you the look on harry face was akin to someone who d been slapped hard remus pretended not to notice and continued i know you were trying to defend someone you care about but harry what you did is far from appropriate harry bowed his head remus was amazed in six years severus had never been able to shame him and the slytherin head of house was far better at disciplining students than remus was you could have really hurt him and that would have caused far more problems than just going to the hospital wing harry you re sixteen years old if you d done any kind of severe damages you d have been in trouble with the ministry is making ron respect luna really worth ending up with a criminal record harry harry shook his head still not looking up remus stood up from the couch apparently severus already spoke with the headmaster he added you re not going to be allowed to go to hogsmeade next weekend and you earned yourself a three day suspension madam pomfrey is working on ron right now you broke his nose and his cheekbone as i understand good harry well he deserved it remus remus sighed and shook his head i can see i not going to get anywhere with this well good night harry he turned regrettring what he had to say next but he didnthave much of a choice i shall have to speak with the headmaster tomorrow regarding your actions harry he concluded i dontunderstand why you consider this something you should be proud of because i certainly dontsee it that way harry bowed his head again remus went to his bedroom to retrieve a pair of pajamas for harry he stopped short in the living room door as he reentered it harry was still sitting now with his face in his hands not crying exactly but by no means dry eyed either realization hit remus like a pail of ice water he harry only parent had disapproved of harry actions and all harry had wanted to do ever since the day remus had gotten custody was to make his guardian proud never not once in his life had he lived up to anyone expectations and that was something he wanted desperately and now remus had proven to him that once again he fell short of what was required of him remus crossed the room put the pajamas on the coffee table and sat back down you know harry sometimes well oh i dontknow how to put it but we all make mistakes this was a pretty big one harry and one that i hope you wontrepeat harry nodded mutely somewhat heartened remus continued but even though i disappointed in the actions you took today harry i still love you harry looked up at his guardian and sniffled did i ever tell you about the time i was in the haymow when i wasntsupposed to be and i fell out into a great big haystack luckily and made a great big mess of myself right after mum washed my good shirt and trousers no less harry shook his head i broke my wrist mum took care of it and then she whaled me harry laughed uncertainly at remus picturesque way of describing a beating with what he and all his sibings had called with reverence and dread the strap a typical punishment with the strap really nothing but an old four foot long strip of loosely braided cowhide consisted of five hits right across the backside with occasionally more or less depending on the offence remus record was fourteen for trying to climb the roof after two or three run ins with the strap four or five if you were really dense you learned remus though smart was the troublemaker in the family and though he learned he could never quite help himself he d lost count of his own trips to the woodshed years ago now he waited for harry to quiet himself before continuing you know in the twelve weeks it took for my wrist to heal harry mum helped me get my shirt on in the morning and cut my meat for me and made sure i wasntgoing to break it again by doing something stupid she was furious when she pulled me out of that haystack but she didntstop loving me just because i did something i wasntsupposed to remus stood up and patted the pajamas on the coffee table you get changed and tomorrow we ll go talk to dumbledore and see if we cantat least get your work while you re out harry nodded remus stood and made for the bedroom pausing at the door to watch harry padding toward the washroom the temper of one and the mischief of the other he thought no doubt who his parents are although remus murmured to himself sometimes i really do wonder where he got a nose like that 4 reference notes 1 all through the books and even in the movies the position of the house tables change at times gryffindor is third from the left sometimes it last in the row it seems to me that at another point it right next to slytherin which would make it second in line since slytherin is the only one that never seems to move but is always on the left hand end in this story the tables will always run as viewed from left to right from the main doors of the hall facing toward the high table slytherin hufflepuff gryffindor ravenclaw 2 hands to yourself in italian i have several italian friends and have noticed that many of them or pictures of their older more italian blooded ancestors have many of the features we associate with canon severus larger noses dark coarse hair and two of them have to wash their hair twice a day or it looks oily even though it not dirty and dark eyes in addition sallow skin would be skin of darker coloring like the olive coloring of many older italian families that didntsee much sun the darkish coloring is enhanced by a perpetual suntan so losing that tan even if it not a very pronounced one creates an unhealthy looking pallor ever since brandi one of the friends in question pointed this out to me i have been unable to view severus as anything but part italian and in fact i write him with a rather diverse heritage so this is definitely not the last time that one of his quaint little bits of ancestral wisdom or foreign language phrases will pop up 3 i invented this drink actually and it quite good and also something that i think remus would love take the largest coffee cup you own travel mugs work very well and fill it half full of coffee make a cup of hot cocoa as chocolatey as you like using milk not water water makes the whole thing taste funny froth the milk if you can but it not necessary put two scoops of coffee flavored ice cream you can also use vanilla or french vanilla ice cream but chocolate doesntwork trust me into the coffee and pour the hot cocoa over it if you d like drizzle a little bit of chocolate syrup over the top enjoy note that this is going to be kind of chilly because of the ice cream even though it makes use of things like hot milk and coffee the ice cream turns it into an iced drink 4 remus is just amusing himself when he says this there no secret lily james someone else triangle going on here actually you could almost say that he referring to his own nose sort of in a sort of convoluted remus being silly sort of way liner notes i apologise right now for leading you lot on the fact is although boi does have four drafts before it ever gets to your computer screen sometimes there are simply problems i cantaccount for in paper first draft and which dontmaterialise until i do third draft formatting and proofing ooh proofing that sounds so sophisticated amazingly it nothing but a search for dropped commas and typos like snape instead of snap one i make rather often snort therefore i promised you guys that scene in this chapter and until i had it in third draft in wordpad i didnthave any idea just how far the rice gag you ll understand when you read was going to take me in the original it was great it stretched for about two and a half weeks that scene would have been near the end of the middle of the chapter and the chapter would have ended with sirius remus severus and harry sitting down to eat dinner unfortunately it occurred to me that sooner or later the rice would start to cause ahem problems so i had to pare down the time which gave me a two week period that i still had to fill in order to do so i had to cut this originally very long chapter in half and then reverse the two main parts of the second half which will now be chapter 25 that means that that scene is not in this chapter dontbe too mad please though because the scene is already completely written i not copping out and it will be in the next chapter guaranteed it just didntwork where i wanted it to rating still at pg 13 t mainly for language in this chapter reviews it been confirmed that we are still allowed to answer reviews so here you go eleonora1 i decided not to block the anons since several of my lj friends read this story too and it hasntreally been a problem if it becomes one though i will block as to ron do you think he ll ever learn i didntthink so either plenty of italian puns in this one though nothing derogatory i hate that kind of thing and well that scene next chappie read the note above before you kill me thepurpleemperor okay wow that um feels bad for making you cry i hope this one is better enjoy haruka lune i ll see you in three weeks harry announced brightly throwing his arms around remus waist enthusiastically he waved at severus and hermione nodded frostily at ron who had refused to apologise to luna citing a right to my own opinion mate slipped an arm around luna back and boarded the hogwarts express inside he felt a slight pang of loss he d never travelled on the hogwarts express without ron and hermione and while hermione was on his side she also had obligations to her boyfriend although harry still couldntunderstand how she could stand being with someone who had as hermione had once so excellently put it the emotional range of a teaspoon in spite of his slight discomfort he was also excited he was spending the entire trip with luna sirius was meeting him on the other end of the line he had a fortnight and a half with the grim animagus before moving up to kent and severus had promised him the bedroom with the cherry tree outside the window the idea of having a bedroom that was entirely all his own was excitement enough the idea that he had a cherry tree too just like remus had described having a pear tree outside of his window as a young boy before he d moved to the attic was positivelythrilling to him so what do you think severus turned to remus expectantly remus considered the walk from the apparition point a wood on the other side of the village had been close to three miles though it was a pleasant three miles at least remus had felt at home almost instantly as they passed a small market a cinema a bookstore two or three other miscellaneous shops a school so small that remus could almost picture it as a one room a tea shop another tea shop and what severus had referred to as the ground shop which was to say a shop which sold nothing but various kinds of ground coffee ground tea and ground tobacco now they were on the west end of town looking at a house whose windows had been neatly covered in plywood to protect them from tree branches and young boys with stones some of the roof tiles were missing and the back porch was a complete mess courtesy of late april thunderstorms but for the rest it looked all right nothing a bit of paint and roof tile couldntfix or so remus thought goodness severus didntyou leave anything useful here remus picked gingerly though a pile of old newspapers called notizie di magia 1 also known as the italian answer to the daily prophet the oldest paper dated back fifteen years and detailed the downfall of lui che non deve essere chiamato 2 remus understood only one word of the entire piece amava italian for he loved remus wouldnthave known even that if he hadntknown some small amount of italian grammar which he d picked up while trying to understand an exceedingly exasperated severus who enjoyed swearing in very long and ungrammaticalstrings of an unintelligible mix of spanish italian and rom 3 he flicked dispiritedly through the rest of the papers one announced harry return to the wizarding world a few were folded back to stories remus couldntread and one stuffed right in the middle and the true oldest of them all dated to august 1959 and listed the marriage of one armando snape and his english wife bronwen 4 clowes a small picture followed they didntlook happy to be together another paper the corner proclaimed it to be from the tenth of january 1960 had an announcement of severus birth the day before written in it along with a lengthy commentary on something or other that remus couldntdecipher with his limited knowledge remus old fashioned to the core bit his lip as he counted backward in his head december november october september august five months he heard a slightly cynical chuckle behind him and turned around sometimes i wonder what people would think if they knew how right they are when they call me a misbegotten bastard severus remarked pulling the newspaper out of remus hands and ripping it in half twice before throwing it in the fireplace and in answer to your question there a perfectly serviceable mattress upstairs and i left everything in the kitchen when i abandoned the place eight years ago so it should still be workable unless someone with faster fingers than brains decided to raid the place of course good so we can at least cook and wait a mattress severus i sure i can find some pillows in the closet one mattress is that a problem severus raised an eyebrow for answer remus picked up the entire pile of yellowing newspapers and dumped them in the rubbish bin remus sighed and stirred the rice on the stove severus hadntlied when he said everything in the kitchen was intact unfortunately this meant that everything in the kitchen was also food that severus liked or had been able to afford eight years ago remus had an appetite for very little of it hand cured cheddar cheese which could be spoilt by almost nothing short of nuclear war a good deal of pasta of the sort used for stuffed shells ravioli and chicken alfredo a half eaten jar of chunky peanut butter complete with spoon marks where severus had apparently eaten it straight out of the jar and tins of just about every tomato product imaginable peeled tomatoes stewed tomatoes tomato paste salsa with tomatoes tomato puree for what remus wondered several jars of spaghetti sauce that were all beginning to grow mold and of course the rice remus had found seven big sacks of it each sack weighing about five pounds severus had recalled getting them on sale because of this poor choice in money management and the need to get the old food out before bringing in anything new except perishables like fruit vegetables and meat of course they d found themselves eating rice every day for the last week rice porridge for breakfast courtesy of a frantic telephone call to remus mother who had supplied the recipe chicken and rice on several occasions several kinds of rice soup and the one severus had devoured happily while remus munched on a peanut butter sandwich refusing to touch the mass that came out of the saucepan rice in tomato puree well that answered one question with quartered peeled tomatoes and a liberal amount of oregano to this he had added cubed chicken and the whole thing had vanished into his mouth remus took his half of the cubed chicken and made a salad for lunch the next day at which time severus had grumbled about eating still more rice while remus smiled serenely and ate his second rice free meal of the week severus skipped dinner and ate the rest of the peanut butter early the next morning he vanished and returned two hours later with a vast supply of fruit which he called breakfast while remus suffered quietly through more rice was beginning to wonder how on earth the two of them were going to function as a couple living together outside of hogwarts so far their days had been mostly cooperative though there had been several explosive quarrels that usually ended with remus sulking and working upstairs and severus sulking on the open sunporch while replacing old glass panes one day it had rained and both of them had worked separately on different ends of the house by unspoken agreement both knowing that if they were forced by the weather to be together all day they would kill each other by noon it wasntthat they didntget along remus thought nor yet that they didntcare for each other it was simply that when thrown together in close quarters their opinions were different enough to cause problems now severus was standing behind him making him feel antsy and cramped it had rained again today and severus had spent the day in the greenhouse while remus painted what would become harry room neither of them had seen each other since lunch vegetable beef and rice soup and remus could feel the electric tension as surely as if he were about to touch a charged wire should you really be cooking when you re covered in paint well you were out in the greenhouse so i thought i should that did it severus knew or at least thought he knew when someone was implying that he d shirked his duty and he knew that in this case he most certainly had not he had cooked lunch he had cooked dinner the day before it was perfectly fair for remus to be cooking now without making a production out of it and he said as much in as many words ceasing only when he realised that remus had tears on his face and and was looking in the opposite direction as soon as he cut off right in the middle of a sentence remus turned and left the room hurrying up the stairs so quickly that his footsteps could barely be heard that gave severus pause more than anything else ever could remus never cried not because he was an emotionless drone if that had been the case severus would have found it far less shocking but because he was perpetually cheerful able to see good in the most dire of situations so what the hell had severus done he turned off the rice and sat for several minutes with a small glass mug of tea trying to figure out just what in the name of circe he was supposed to do next before saying to hell with it and going upstairs remus was laying on the mattress he refused to sleep on he d opted for several blankets on the floor instead insisting that he was far more comfortable that way severus had rolled his eyes and chosen not to say a word sobbing in a most un remus like manner severus was stunned his previous experience with remus suggested that the blonde would have thrown himself with a furious energy back into painting or stencilling or something that was at least semi productive at least it would make his half formed plan somewhat easier he hadntenjoyed the thought of trying to placate a furious remus who was ignoring him better than anyone had ever done he ran his hand gently over remus shoulder remus sniff well it was better than nothing remus i you what remus rolled over and inquired some of his old fire coming right back as he sat up furiously you re just frustrated you re tired you didntthink it never occurred to you that i working just as hard as you are and i feel just as much as you do that for every three steps forward we re going two steps back what severus sighed resignedly and closed his eyes all of those things of course because he d spent years not caring what anyone else thought and old habits died damn hard when you were under stress i look why dontwe go out tonight and just get out of the damn house you ve been working too hard and if you keep it up harry going to have a beautiful home and no parent to come home to you ll kill yourself you ll overstress yourself right into a heart attack and i d rather not deal with the sudden death of my loved ones when i home for the first time in eight years remus looked somewhat stunned when severus referred to him as a loved one it was a phrase the black haired man had never used before but i ve got to finish harry room tonight i poured all the paint into the pan already we can put a preserving charm on it go get in the shower remus nodded in agreement but instead of getting up to go get in the shower he slid his arms around severus neck and laid his head on a dark shoulder i just feel so like we re spinning our wheels you know severus didnt it was a phrase he d never heard before but he nodded anyway remus smiled a somewhat watery smile and pushed off for the one working bathroom in the house in town severus steered them toward a tea shop where they ordered a plate of sandwiches both of them had eaten enough rice to last them for a lifetime they lingered for about an hour both dreading the return back to the house both of them agreed that it would be beautiful when they were done but just now it felt like some kind of devouring monster finally severus announced his intention of buying something from a nearby shop and told remus to meet him at home remus dragged his feet all the way feeling more than ever that he would like nothing so much as to use a few simple charms which while convenient wouldntproduce nearly as good results as manual work and get it over with remus had just uncovered the paint when he heard severus downstairs rummaging in the kitchen several minutes later found him staring as his partner came into the room rubbing his hands and looking exceedingly pleased about something and then picking up a paintbrush severus seemed to have a mortal fear of painting it was for that reason that remus was now goggling at him like he d just done a handstand with sparklers sticking out his ears both events were equally remarkable coming from the man in question let get this knocked off tonight and then tomorrow we can clean up the floor and lay the carpeting and then we ll be done in here until we move the furniture in right remus just nodded he scrubbed red paint off his skin with a fervor remus hated the feeling of drying paint it made him feel like his skin was being pulled on in the most annoying way finally he was able to rinse off and get out of the shower the master bathroom at least had also still been in working order along with the kitchen in fact it was rather nice so remus had not had to give up the luxury of a hot shower he wrapped his dressing gown around himself and stepped out of the bathroom and right into severus arms severus embraced him for several seconds before saying anything and when he did he spoke so softly that remus almost didnthear it i sorry remus snuggled closer smelled the dust on severus dressing gown and sneezed slightly then he laughed severus pulled him back into the bedroom where remus promptly started rummaging through his trunk looking for night clothes finally extracting a pair of rather ugly cotton pajama bottoms and making severus wonder why exactly gryffindors seemed to be so obsessed with red white and black tartan plaid remus tugged them on and made for his blanket nest several feet from the mattress remus lupin if you insist on sleeping on the damn floor one more time i going to be sleeping on the floor with you remus turned around and had to fight the urge to laugh long and hard severus was wearing a disapproving look so reminiscent of minerva mcgonagall that remus almost expected him to start taking house points then the reality of what severus had said began to sink in and the urge passed almost immediately severus intended for both of them to sleep on the mattress together shit remus stood with his mouth open trying to formulate a decent response and finally gave up when severus closed the bathroom door and the water went on one more time er what this for severus remus eyed the bottle of wine severus had picked up in town he didntdoubt his partner taste on the few rare occasions that they d gotten a bottle over dinner severus had proven that he was perfectly capable of choosing a decent wine even if he was no expert but he was wondering what on god green earth could have compelled severus to bring a bottle of wine into a mostly disordered house we re celebrating celebrating what we only have one room left to paint and since it our own we can take as much damn time as we feel like severus offered him a glass which remus accepted and tasted cautiously severus did have good taste in drinks but remus simply couldntstand dry wine severus why does this taste like strawberries because it strawberry wine 5 you told me you liked it i do i just didntknow you could get it around here severus snorted we re in a small town remus not the middle of nowhere remus sighed and smiled to himself this he enjoyed this might make all the repetitive and mind numbing work worth his time he snuggled down into the sheets on the mattress good night severus reference notes 1 news of magic in italian 2 he who must not be named in italian this refers to voldemort 3 a more common but less correct term for the romis gypsy or gipsy 4 a welsh name meaning dark pure bronwen clowes is obviously a pureblood since this story was started before hbp and severus is a pureblood in this fic armando name means of the army 5 when we moved into our new house and finally got the kitchen unpacked my mom and i pulled out a bottle of strawberry wine to toast the new place and all our hard work i ve had champagne and sips of a few mixed drinks note to people who ve never had alcohol you re really not missing anything and didntreally like them but strawberry wine is quite good not something i d drink every day but not half bad either i dontsee remus enjoying strong tasting drinks so this would be something he d like liner notes it official bottle is one year old and what a year it has been this time notes will be at the end of the chapter please read them for some important information as always this story is rated t pg 13 for implied sexual scenes language and homosexuality dontlike dontread but dontflame where on earth have you been severus pounced on remus as soon as he entered the kitchen an unperturbed remus set four brown paper bags on the table and started unpacking them i wanted to get something for dinner and we needed paint for the sunporch greenhouse whatever you call it why do you need paint for the greenhouse it glass remus you dontpaint glass but the frames holding the glass in place are made out of wood and that already been painted at least once so i dontsee why i cantpaint it again white in a greenhouse always looks horrible severus and it gets so dirty i ve been scrubbing the damned frames for a week and they still look like nobody touched them in twenty years twenty five they haventbeen painted since i was twelve see that my point remus announced triumphantly severus sighed fine paint it but if you get any paint on the glass i wontget any paint on the glass severus you re forgetting the kind of family i grew up in remus set the fourth bag on a chair by the door that led out to the room that had formerly been a sunporch severus few rare specimens had more or less taken over since he d started growing his own potion ingredients the last functional furniture had left the room fifteen years ago and then pulled out the cutting board so he could slice tomatoes severus slipped into the greenhouse massaging his hands he d spent the evening painting the bedroom they d celebrated one more room only to discover that severus office also needed to be repainted as did the room down the hall that remus wanted for only merlin knew what but those rooms could wait and his hands felt horrible he thought there was something very wrong with the idea that a man could spend sixteen years grading thousands of essays a year and yet when he picked up a paintbrush he got something akin to very bad writer cramp remus what the hell are you doing remus looked up from where he was cheerfully running a wide roll of tape around the windows keeping paint off the glass you mean you haventeven started yet remus eyes bugged i had to move everything out of here severus and that meant looking up every single one of those plants so i wouldntdamage any of them and then i spent half an hour trying to find one of them in your magical plants dictionary only to realise it was basil you could have saved me time and told me that you had an herb garden out here too and then when i was done with that i had to wash the windows before putting up the tape so it would stick even those new pieces you put in were positively filthy so no severus i haventstarted yet severus held up his hands defensively all right i understand it an eyesore and i need to learn to clean up when playtime is over you donthave to yell remus smiled the smile grew wider and before too long he was laughing loudly playtime is that what you call it why not it something i enjoy doing so you cantreally call it work remus shook his head and rolled his eyes he reached the end of the windows and slapped the tape roll down on an old card table with a sigh finally he surveyed his handiwork momentarily before moving back to the other end of the greenhouse and picking up a small can of paint why dontwe have a cup of tea and then i ll help you severus decided not to ask the words since remus would undoubtedly have said that he could handle it just fine on his own thanks with this in mind he stated the words instead it was all a matter of inflection and as he d expected remus looked grateful for a smile like the one remus gave him he would have taken a bullet to the head a bit of pain in his fingers was nothing remus leaned back into the pillow on his side of the mattress and sighed he was tired he d spent the morning trying to make the back yard usable the afternoon had gone to scrubbing the brick patio and until eleven o clock that evening he d been on the sunporch none of it was particularly hard work although remus suspected that could be why it made him so tired his hands did a good deal but his mind had lain idle for most of the day something he found peculiarly exhausting to top everything off it was unbelievably hot for a night in britain and he didntthink he d be able to sleep at all remus had forsaken his normal nightclothes in favor of a pair of blue jean cutoffs that had formerly belonged to severus he d found them in a trunk in the attic and severus had confessed to wearing them for yardwork back when there had been an actual yard to work in as opposed to a forest of weeds they were maddeningly hot around his waist but he was stuck with either the blue jeans or a pair of flannel pajama bottoms and he was not going to wear flannel on a night when the thermometer read 26 degrees 1 severus stumbled out of the bathroom drying his hair with a towel normally he would have used a drying spell he hated going to bed with wet hair or even damp hair but severus who spent most of his time in a cool windowless dungeon was even less tolerant than remus when it came to the unpleasant heat he d taken a cool shower and he intended to let his hair stay wet if not dripping as long as possible it kept the heat away remus raised an eyebrow when he moved out the door and down the staircase but that was all good what this for remus eyed the small bottle of strawberry wine now about half empty from their last celebration he didntknow where severus had kept it and experience told him that severus could store things in very strange places only this afternoon he had found a bunch of paperback books in the linen closet stacked up underneath the spare bedsheets for no apparent reason it sounded like a good idea so i brought it up from the cellar we ve got to drink it soon in any case i think it starting to go over wine doesntgo over that quickly if it been resealed severus the cellar severus shrugged there a wine rack down there i found it when i was clearing out all my old school essays remus cringed if the wine rack had been covered up by old musty boxes for so long that severus had forgotten it even existed a mean feat in and of itself since severus almost never forgot anything remus wasnttoo sure he wanted to be drinking something that had been sitting in it he slowly dragged himself back to whatever severus was saying sorry i wasntpaying attention severus rolled his eyes and looked irritated i said i never even knew it was there i didnteven keep cooking wine in the house until a year or two ago and i haventbeen here since before harry started at hogwarts so there hasntbeen any alcohol here since my father died i never had any use for a wine rack remus couldnthelp himself did you clean it no i shoved the bottle in through a few cobwebs and rolled it around in the dust for awhile before i put the glass back over the front of the rack of course i cleaned it before i used it remus do you think i want old parchment bits floating in my glass remus smiled sheepishly sorry shall we have a toast then but i ve never done anything worse than that what about you remus knew full well he shouldnthave had two glasses of wine so close together he hadntbeen lying when he said he really couldnthandle alcohol but he hadntbeen able to help himself and it was only the two of them in the house anyway he was still far from drunk but he knew this this glass his third although he d only allowed severus to fill it halfway would have to be the last one or he would end up with a problem severus considered the question carefully before answering once when i was twenty two i got really stoned dontlook at me that way remus there were a bunch of us all drinking from the same fizzy drink 2 bottle and apparently somebody laced it with something and i got my ear pierced in three places it swelled up so much i couldnteven get the hoops out you had your ears pierced with hoops severus you re never supposed to pierce with hoops one ear remus one ear three holes and really if i was so high i was willing to get my ear pierced at all do you honestly think i was in any condition to know how it should be pierced true did i ever show you the tattoo i gave myself no but i ve seen the one on your back for lack of a better word it creepy as my sister would say and what may i ask is so creepy about a scene from hamlet i think it very noblish noble something like that take this away from me before i get pissed 3 absolutely out of my mind and do something really stupid wontyou remus handed over his wineglass it too hot to be drinking like this severus admonished he had already had three and a half glasses and was showing no visible effects you re the one who started it remus pointed out if there wasntanyone else around i think i d go skinny dipping i dontremember ever having a night this hot in devonshire you probably never did and you can undress if you re so damn hot you donthave anything i ve never seen before on myself a thousand times at least unless you have a prince albert ring i never got around to getting one of those before my insane phase passed remus laughed neither did i but these jeans are staying right where they are don juan severus considered that last statement contrary to popular belief he was not as impervious to alcohol as he liked to pretend and he d had just enough to consider being really really foolish want to make a bet on that a bet on what your blue jeans remus made a face i donthave anything to bet if i win you have to do whatever i want and if you lose severus remus i never lose he leaned over to kiss his blonde haired partner on the mouth and revelled in the sweet taste the wine had left on remus lips remus looked slightly unfocused probably reciting the multiplication table backward or listing the countries of the world or whatever damn thing he did to keep himself calm in the face of temptation which struck daily about a thousand times he tried to shift his weight to his other leg to compensate for severus greater size and they tumbled down onto the sheets the light blanket twisting itself maddeningly around severus knee as he landed with his back on the mattress and his head just below his pillow remus hit his head on the edge of the mattress and laughed this isntgoing to work severus severus kicked the blanket off the mattress why did they have a blanket even a light cotton one in the middle of july he wondered it wasntas though they needed it and threw his weight to the right rolling them over and away from the side he planted one hand firmly on either side of remus head and took a deep breath the rapid change in position had left him lightheaded as though he were hanging upside down by his knees from the monkey bars on a muggle playground do you want to bet on that too harry sat nervously with his head pressed tightly against sirius back and his legs clinging to the saddle for dear life why had he allowed himself to believe that there wouldntbe so much difference between a broomstick and a flying motorbike he had been determined to learn to ride the monstrous thing sirius called black beauty then sirius had kickstarted the motor and harry had squeaked in a manner that was embarrassingly reminiscent of lavender brown getting caught misbehaving in class he couldntimagine how anything that size could sound so loud how an inanimate object could seem so positively feral and wondered why sirius hadntgone deaf years ago then they d gone around a corner on their way out of london ministry rules said no flying in or within ten kilometers of large cities so they d had to wait until they were twenty minutes into the country to find out if the levitating mechanism even worked anymore he d grabbed onto sirius waist feeling grateful that he hadntbeen pitched off and he d been sitting in the same position ever since he wasntplanning on letting go ever he knew full well that as soon as he did even if they were back on solid ground and the bike was turned off he was going to fall off and the machine was going to topple right over on top of him and break his back which according to a frighteningly casual sirius was perfectly possible if you werentcareful they came down at last just outside of a small town whose name harry didntcatch and roared off through the village not everyone stared but a few people did most notably girls around harry age or so who seemed to be staring not at the blue jean clad boy on the back but the man in the black dragonhide jacket sitting in front harry wondered if sirius had noticed and if he had what he thought of it remus had said on several occasions that sirius didntnotice attention unless he wasntgetting it so maybe he didnteven realise what kind of trail he was leaving behind him or maybe he did and was just laughing to himself about it the thought would have made harry laugh if he hadntbeen concentrating so hard on not falling off something he was actually in no danger of doing although he had no way of knowing that the bike stopped in front of a white house with a large front porch the back tire skidded harry yelled in panic the sound muffled by sirius jacket and then sirius put down the kickstand and harry breathed a huge sigh of relief sirius looked over his shoulder as far as he could and grinned although harry didntsee it because he d buried his face in the back of sirius jacket as soon as the bike had started to skid isntthis great i never getting on this thing again sirius you drive like a lunatic harry had finally plucked up enough courage to raise his head about an inch so he could express his outrage you could have gotten us both killed nah it not as easy to wreck this thing as you seem to think it is harry now would you mind letting go my legs need a decent blood supply if i going to stand up harry blushed and released his death grip on sirius waist sorry sirius shrugged remus doesntlike it either i tried to teach him how to ride it this was years ago and he just sort of stared at me like i d gone out of my mind sirius tone made it clear that he thought remus was missing out on something really wonderful harry thought remus was definitely the one with the right idea he certainly wasntgoing to be learning how to ride that monster by the time harry had allowed himself to be coaxed off the bike and onto a set of still shaking legs and if sirius liked flying so much why hadntthey just used brooms harry wondered remus had come out onto the porch and was waving at them from the front steps harry sped up so he could hug the man he d missed remus for the past three weeks more than he d ever missed anyone in his entire life and enjoy the good feeling of a friendly familiar face in a place he d never been before he hugged remus tightly and thenwrinkled his nose apparently remus had spent his morning working in dust harry pulled away so he could sneeze still got a suicide death wish then have you sirius remus queried as sirius returned from wheeling the motorbike carefully to the other side of the house sirius grinned at remus disapproving look and shook his head before offering harry a paper tissue sirius absolutely refused to carry a cloth handkerchief for some reason harry sneezed one more time into the tissue what exactly had remus been doing to get so dusty he wondered rolling around in the yard before cutting in on sirius and remus conversation as a sudden realisation popped into his head remus you ve been shagging remus tried to look disapproving again but a blush was slowly creeping up his cheeks harry that completely inappropriate and it also none of your business sirius stepped back and scrutinised remus carefully you know moony he right you do have that sort of starry eyed i just spent my night in a place without supervision kind of look remus favored sirius with a look that might have been a scowl if remus had allowed it to develop more fully instead it just looked like a pout i not even going to respond to that sirius come on let go harry panicked go where this time remus smiled severus told me quite clearly that i not allowed back in the house what until four o clock remus continued serenely as though harry hadntspoken at all so i thought we could go into town and get some tea there this really amazing shop just a block from the main road and then we can pick up a few things before we come back out here that ought to take up the time fairly well harry where on earth is your trunk harry glanced helplessly at sirius who shrugged figured i could send it through the floo tonight so we wouldnthave to worry about it on the bike moony you cantshrink something that big without shrinking everything inside of it first and that takes too damn long remus sighed right it so nice up here when you re not screaming along on a deathtrip harry said breaking a long silence remus smiled at him and laughed a little a deathtrip harry yeah on that motorbike i think next time i ll stick with my broom i ve had enough bad experiences with flying vehicles for one lifetime thanks remus shifted his shopping bag to his other hand and chuckled severus told me about you and ron trying to run over the whomping willow you re quite lucky you managed to get out in one piece well two pieces i suppose you cantreally say one piece when it two people harry kicked a stone sitting on the side of the road the streets in town were paved but a mile past the edge of the village the roads all became dirt remus said they got horribly dusty sometimes probably because of the drought in a normal summer they d be too wet or recently wet to blow all over the place before too long the road ended and they stepped onto the grass in the front yard what harry took for a cat wrapped around remus legs and purred hello sadie harry this is sadie she a kneazle severus got her in london harry squatted down andreached out cautiously to scratch behind her ears er hi remus laughed as sadie batted at harry hand she likes to play with moving things harry you might want to be careful he banged on the frame of the screen door hey are we allowed out of exile yet severus voice floated down the stairs ten more minutes you cantcome up yet are we at least allowed in the house a long pause i suppose remus smiled and shook his head before leading his two escorts into the living room harry gaped he had never imagined a place that was spotlessly clean and welcoming privet drive was spotless and horrible hogwarts was neat and tidy but it was a school and was therefore never completely clean except for the hospital wing a place harry hated the burrow was clean but chaotic and full of what aunt petunia would have termed junk the old apartment he d shared with remus was dusted and vaccuumed most of the time and there were always enough dishes to eat from but the beds were rarely made and there was usually a large amount of general clutter it was also the place where harry had been happiest and so through a process of elimination he had come to equate cleanliness with unhappiness this room though seemed to speak of a life where order abounded and good feelings reigned supreme instead of the unyielding easy to clean furniture he d suffered at the dursleys this living room had soft fabric chairs and a sofa and a rug that covered most of the floor he could see wooden tiles around the edges of the carpet the coffee table came from the same set as the sofa and chairs but they didntfeel stiff and formal even though they matched each other the pale curtains were clean but not starched to death they hung naturally allowing the summer breeze to blow them gently inward like the top layer of a formal gown the fireplace was made of large stones which though they werentcovered in soot bore all the telltale signs of having been used and sitting on one side of the wide front edge was a large gameboard made of cloth that could be used for playing draughts 4 or wizard chess several pictures were hung on the wooden posts that formed a bannister for the staircase there were two empty spaces on the end but harry was less concerned with these than with the fact that he was in not one but two of the photographs already hanging there he d never had his picture hung on the wall before he suspected that the large cupboard on the far side of the fireplace was probably full of the puzzles and games remus so dearly enjoyed there was after all a book shelf right next to it that was filled with his collection of mystery stories remus guided them through this room and into the kitchen which was just as clean bright and beautiful as the living room with the same tiles on the floor but only two small rugs one in front of the sink and the other in front of the oven harry glanced at the framed picture hanging over the kitchen table and then did a double take in the middle of the frame was a cloth sack the front of which proclaimed that it had once been filled with macpherson rice remus saw him staring and laughed we had to eat seven bags of that that eeeeeeeccccchhhhhh remus finally concluded before adding we only made it through two we gave the rest away and that one of the two we finished we figured we d keep the bag just to remind ourselves and you never know who going to see it and ask why we have a framed rice bag hanging over the kitchen table makes a great conversation piece remus motioned the two of them to sit down and poured iced tea harry opted for a cold glass of milk instead before he moved to the counter to turn something that was soaking in something else explaining as he did so that there was a barbecue pit on the back patio and they were having some kind of marinated chicken recipe that belonged to severus and tomorrow he continued we re having cheeseburgers it ll be the first meal with red meat in it that we ve eaten in the house since we got here severus said that once we get a general order we can start planning meals if we want like we did when it was just you and me in the house harry have a biscuit they re in the jar on the table i have no idea what they re called severus gave me the recipe so i could make them but they re some kind of spanish thing 5 he got this old cookbook that full of positively loads of foreign things foreign only to someone who never bothered learning about anything that wasntcajun southwestern or traditional a familar voice announced from the doorway harry his mouth full of the spanish biscuit had to settle for semi shouting mmmmphhh to announce his presence he would never have imagined that he could miss severus snape of all people but on the other hand his marauderish genes seemed to be saying there was a prime opportunity harry swallowed severus your shirt buttoned wrong severus looked mildly annoyed and started rebuttoning his shirt as he moved to sit down at the table i just got dressed i didntbother changing out of my work clothes until i was finished remus still standing by the countertop chuckled into his hand and then blushed as sirius sent him a pointed stare remus finished with the chicken and joined them at the table severus jumped up as he did remus raised an eyebrow at the uncharacteristic display of energy what on earth got into you today severus you ve been up and down all remus broke off to glare at sirius and harry who were both laughing care to share the joke harry harry continued to snicker helplessly while sirius managed to plaster on an unconvincing look of angelic innocence remus sat and waited until harry caught his breath i was only just thinking it not necessarily that something else got into him but maybe he got all right that quite enough severus broke in from the back door where he was balancing the tray of chicken one handed on his knee so he could open the door we re going to be eating in twenty minutes dontmake me punish you for indecencyyour first day here harry rolled his eyes and downed the rest of his milk in a single swallow okay now are we allowed upstairs remus called out the back door severus there was an indistinct answer from the far side of the patio are we allowed to go upstairs yet another indistinct answer remus chuckled as long as we dontgo into the room at the top of the stairs not the bathroom the one next to the linen closet um okay well what do you think remus pressed as harry stood wide eyed in the door of the bedroom it was magnificent the two or three rag rugs courtesy of gram who loved making them were new laid over an oak plank floor almost like the one in the living room at devonshire the wooden furniture was exactly like the furniture in remus childhood bedroom harry highly suspected it had been made by remus senior and for the first time in his life harry had things his own comb and hairbrush instead of the old ones he d scavenged from the trash when aunt petunia had thrown them out sat next to a small stack of cassette tapes on the mirror backed dresser and a cassette player sat in the corner on a set of shelves the bureau remus told him already had his clothes in it some were older gently used clothes from a couple of remus american cousins it was tacitly accepted that these were work or play clothes but most were new or clothes that sirius had already sent on a week ago and they fit him instead of hanging off like old skin there were books on those shelves in the corner too and even though he couldntsee them harry knew they had to be interesting he trusted remus and severus for that the window looked out on the back yard and a small houseplant was sitting on the sill there was a small sofa where he could sit and read and a tall three bulb lamp next to the desk pushed neatly into the corner opposite the shelves the walls had been painted a fresh light sugar brown color with a cream colored skirting board and trim the ceiling was just like the floor only stained remus had gone into positive esctacies about it he loved wooden ceilings in the coming months he would be able to reach out the window pick a pear and eat it down to the core before depositing the remains in the dustbin next to the desk harry was certain there would be other things in places he couldntsee in the desk the bedside table the closet maybe a couple of treats hidden in the bureau or under the mattress and better than any of that he thought was the fact that he could do with it as he saw fit a poster or picture on the walls blinds instead of curtains the furniture in different positions it mine remus thought he wouldntever get tired of those hugs mmmmmmm harry shoveled a mouthful of chicken and noodles into his mouth severus raised an eyebrow as harry gulped a healthy mouthful of tea and went back to the noodles you know we have a saying in italy about people like you mmmmmm roughly translated it says he who acts like a pig will be butchered for his bacon and bristles harry swallowed with a good deal of difficulty but sirius didntfeed me he cantcook so we just had loads of sandwiches and mcdonald and things like that i need some nutritious food before i just waste away into nothingness right remus remus responded by primly cutting a small bite off of the chicken breast in front of him mixing it with a bit of pasta and then carefully lifting the whole thing to his mouth sirius chuckled harry sighed so that that then remus announced as he put the last of the dishes in the cupboard you need to get ready for bed harry it almost nine o clock it ll be past ten before you can get to bed harry sighed before plodding upstairs to take a bath and put on his pyjamas he didntwant the evening to end but then on the other hand he d still be here tomorrow some time in the night remus became conscious of being watched he opened his eyes slowly and found harry standing in the doorway peering in harry do you need anything harry jumped and then answered smiling a little no i fine there was a pause before the door closed remus smiled and laid back down curling up under the light blanket next to him severus rolled over and settled back far away thunder sounded rain was on its way and on the other side of the hall in a room with a pear tree outside the window the happiest boy in the world only wished he could look in the mirror of erised at that moment it would be a great conversation piece if he could only have told people that he d looked and seen only himself exactly as he was end ofyear one author notes phew we ve finally made it this is far from the end of the story though so dontdespair or if you re getting bored i guess you can get off here ha ha bottle has two more years in harry world plus final edits to go through incidentally i started writing not prewriting there a difference with me exactly a year ago bottle first made its appearance on the internet on 1 january 2005 what an amazing year it has been thank you all so much for sticking with me and helping me to become a better writer friend and person with your emails and conversations there will from this point onward be two epic stories going on in this account bottle will soon be joined by the first chapter of harry potter and the riddle glass a version of the long awaited book seven for all those too impatient to wait for j k rowling if you like bottle you will almost certainly like riddle glass it has the benefit of a full year improvement and a very well written plot according to those who have beta ed the plot for loopholes this means however that i will be alternating chapters of bottle with chapters of glass so if i normally update once a month for example it will now be every other month one month for one story one month for the other always haruka lune reference notes 1 celcius degrees the fahrenheit temperature for us readers would be 80 2 fizzy drink is the english as opposed to american word for soda pop 3 drunk 4 checkers 5 the food i am thinking of here is called a churro they are sweet and the recipe i tried had chocolate in the middle and was made with rum although there are several different kinds liner notes i meant to post this in the last chapter but i forgot oh well here it is as of chapter four i will be borrowing part of a plotline from another writer whose name i dontremember it was a story that wasntparticularly realistic to begin with and they abandoned it more than a year ago so i dontfeel bad for borrowing although i dontremember the name the story was called a personal affair and is posted somewhere on this site so i hereby alerting everyone to the fact that yes this is a borrowed idea most of the storyline has changed from the original though in fact the only thing i truly using is the classifieds ads idea a u warning this is still in an a u though not heavily so see ch 1 or 2 for an explanation of the a u because i not writing it all out again i sure you get tired of it too disclaimer remus wacky family belongs to me nothing else in this chapter does except for remus tattoo which was kindly translated by gary stu archiving see ch 1 please rating this has gone up to pg 13 t for mentions of homosexuality personally i dontfeel that merits a rating change but a lot of other people feel otherwise so i bent to the masses this time and nothing else actually so it essentially still pg k with a twist oh well dedication this fic is dedicated to eleonora1 and immortalflick with a nice dash of kudos to my best friend alicia she of harry box yes that the one she my unwittingsounding board for a lot of this stuff and it without her we would not have the lupin tribe or the circumstances involving remus being in it harry paid little attention to remus or percy preferring to sift through the box aunt petunia had given him there were far more pictures in the albums than he had ever imagined some moved some didn t and there were many people in the old photographs that he didntknow one group of them seemed to be related to remus who was also in the photograph four of the women in the picture had a slightly more feminized version of his face framed by the same sandy blonde hair a fifth retained the same small build and the habit of tipping her head downward as she smiled but she was a redhead it was about the time harry found this picture that percy got out of the car thanking remus for the ride and harry scrambled into the front seat he didntmince words remus is this your family remus glanced at the picture and a grin stole across his face those are my sisters the ones your parents knew anyway there are more remus laughed a loud ringing carefree tone that made the woman in the convertible to their left look over in slight consternation harry my family is related to the weasleys through my mum that should tell you a lot right away big family remus laughed again enormous there are twelve children and only two of them are boys well i suppose i too old to be classified as a boy anymore but ty not ty remus peered into the rearview mirror for a moment before answering tycho tycho gabriel lupin i should feel lucky for getting away with a half normal name it was harry turn to laugh there nothing wrong with your name remus the werewolf shook his head you sound as bad as my mother i suppose it could be worse we ve got a female gabby too mum started recycling names years ago so a lot of us share our first names as middle names it drives dad and rachael crazy harry blinked how many of you did you say there were again twelve but only three still living at home raena melody and ty get this the oldest could be the grandmother of the youngest rachael was nineteen when i was born and i was twenty seven by the time ty came along poor kid it cantbe easy being the baby in our family that for sure actually i know it not i was the baby for twenty three years must make for some pretty wild holiday dinners remus fairly howled with mirth oh you should see christmas dinner at my mum house harry have you ever tried to fit thirty nine people around one table harry shook his head in disbelief well we have we have to do it every year actually it tight but we manage usually once in awhile someone shows up with a broken leg or something and then we have to split or there not enough space i told mum i was bringing you for christmas if you wanted to leave hogwarts for the holidays and she was just about in tears kelly youngest just turned six and he a complete klutz i ve seen the kid walk straight into a doorframe when he was looking right at it so he ends up with more food on the floor than he gets in his mouth nobody likes sitting next to him we always have to make more space for somebody or other poor remus harry shook his head and blinked remus hmm no i mean your sister son is named remus oh right it a family name did you sell the rights to it harry teased expecting remus to laugh with him he was stunned when remus groaned and let his head thud down jokingly onto the steering wheel they were sitting at a stoplight why does everyone keep asking me things like that does it bother everyone that i didntget the need to be prolific gene harry blinked hard startled sorry i just well i mean i er no i can understand why you d ask that i the only one over thirty who doesnthave any kids except you now but you re going to be the single black haired boy in a sea of blondes but i ve never even been engaged it drives gabby crazy gabby the oldest one second oldest rachael the oldest she hasntgot it through her head yet that i not interested in any of her girl friends gabby i mean rachel doesntpay much attention in one direction or the other why not because she minds her own business and she thinks that if i happy unmarried i should be allowed to remain happily unmarried all her friends are in their sixties and seventies anyway no i mean never mind why does it drive gabby crazy no well i mean why are you not interested you re only thirty something it not like harry trailed off confused remus laughed again and shook his head i suppose you ll have to find out sometime as they came to another stoplight he leaned over and rolled up the right leg of his pants about halfway up to his knee harry saw a small shape outlined in black and for one wild moment of insanity he thought remus had the dark mark tattooed on his calf then his mind cleared along with his vision and he brought the miniscule symbol into focus an upside down pink triangle about half an inch from apex to apex rimmed in black a short latin motto resided beneath it also upside down and harry tilted his head to read it fastosus in me what that supposed to mean pride in oneself i nearly drove madam pince crazy trying to get a decent latin dictionary so i could do it you d think with almost all the spells in the wizarding world being in latin i d be able to find one but no i had to search the entire library one book at a time to find one that not even the exact correct translation but i couldntfind anything else wait a minute you did this yourself remus nodded i ve done a few for others too all better than that thankfully headded rolling his pants cuff back down i suppose i shouldnthave used myself as a guinea pig that why the words are upside down i forgot my leg was upside down too and well there you have it i did it backward thinking i was putting it on so it would face properly but now everybody thinks the whole thing is upside down by accident i really defeated the entire purpose harry snorted so what was the purpose remus rolled his eyes a statement of self harry a rebel call i suppose you could say an expression of my canttell me you dontknow what a pink triangle is especially one that upside down harry racked his brains marauders symbol harry was certain if remus rolled his eyes any harder they d get stuck and remus laughed softly at harry confusion merlin harry how over bloody innocent are you a pink triangle is a gay pride symbol it was remus turn to worry about the state of harry eyes which currently bore a great resemblance to moody overlarge magical orb you you re cry and get over it harry remus replied cheerfully then we can start discussing who gets to do the dishes you dontthink it a big deal remus just looked at him in slight incredulity is it harry paused considered concluded no i guess not but why didntyou tell me i mean why didntyou was there any real reason for me to tell you before now no i guess not i dontconsider it a big deal harry i donteven date it just a matter of preference like preferring chocolate to vanilla do you compare everything to chocolate remus the werewolf grinned as he pulled into a mcdonald so they could stop for lunch just about liner notes i apologise now part of this chapter is going to be a bit corny remus as rock player sprang from haruka singing with the stereo daydreaming and doing dishes all at one time and now i cantpicture him as anything but an avid guitar player and it my fault see note in the last parentheses after this chapter things are going to pick up a lot as gets his first letter from remus also i cantdecide so i asking you all to please vote in your review or in an email to me should harry be allowed to stay in the flat alone on the condition that he doesntleave the flat for anything barring a fire or something obviously or should he be forced into being babysat when remus is away a u warning yes we re still in the wonderful world of mild a u the current a u elements 1 dumbledore has allowed harry to leave the dursleys and live with remus 2 remus is in a rock dance band no i didntmake him a world famous rock star it just a local gigs in bars kind of thing 3 remus goes a little bit little kid in here i was trying to show his inner maurader coming through but it doesntwant to write very well not annoyingly so i dontthink but he does turn his bedroom into a well you ll see when you get there disclaimers again we all know harry potter and his world arentmine but oh the joy if i could clean the cat litter with a wave of the wand remus flat is a miniaturized more convenient version of my house and the music group he is in as well as its other members is my creation as well currency translation rates it occurred to me that i listed a half pound notebook in here so i listing the exchange rates as of this writing january 2005 for anyone who cares u s dollars to the british pound 1 87 i round to 2 i not good in math british pounds to the wizarding galleon 5 according to j k rowling so there are also about us 10 in one galleon i using us prices and then just translating them to pounds sorry i not doing that much research so if the prices are drastically different than what they should be sorry archiving see ch 1 please dedications eleonora1 and immortalflick on this site my best friend alicia off this site she doesntwrite fanfiction are you kidding me she doesnteven like it that much she just helps me write okay i think that it enjoy okay pick a bed harry was torn apparently remus had fudged a bit to dumbledore he d converted a somewhat spacious single bedroom into a slightly undersized pair of bedrooms by way of a large thick quilt hanging down the middle of the room so now harry had the choice of the front room with first dibs on the bathroom or the back room with the window the easiest way to settle the problem occurred to him suddenly and so he asked where have you been sleeping remus shrugged on the couch on the couch i didntwant to make a mess in here before you got to see it all nice and clean for thirty seconds harry turned his eyes skyward remushadntmade it any easier on him either apparently remus hadntbeen kidding when he d told harry he had his work cut out for him he d begged harry to ignore the dozen or so coffee mugs scattered in and around the kitchen sink the huge piles of sheet music and composer sheets sitting on the couch and coffee table and a large fruit juice stain on the carpet near the bedroom harry would never have pictured remus as a clutterbug but the evidence was right in front of his eyes he didntknow anybody else who kept nearly twenty coffee mugs with only one person in the house there were only three rooms in the flat living room kitchen and bedroom they also had a private bathroom which remus seemed to consider the epitome of luxury and all three were a bit odd remus had evidently blended the elements of the wizarding and muggle worlds until he had all the implements he considered most convenient there was a refrigerator for example but the stove only worked by matches or magic harry ran over all these things in his mind as he considered where he wanted to sleep still unsure as to how remus admission in the car was going to affect everything it wouldntaffect anything at all in a perfect world harry thought but unfortunately the world really not fair especially to me these days it seems remus finally broke into harry tumbled thoughts fine if you wontdecide then i ll just take the front one and you can have the window harry shook his head huh remus didnteven acknowledge that harry had spoken merely depositing the boy trunk in front of the bed near the window and then wandering out to the kitchen harry traipsing hurriedly behind him to drink harry shook again he really needed to stop getting lost in his thoughts sorry remus patiently repeated himself i asked if you wanted anything to drink he replied opening the refrigerator and adding there water milk apple cider coffee tea hot and iced and hot chocolate oh and i ve got some orange juice left in here if you want it er whatever you re having is fine remus set a small pan on the stove lit it with his wand and started adding things like cocoa and sugar and milk when it was all melted and stirred and simply waiting to heat he turned and sat down at the table something you should know right now is that i not exactly a rules friendly person harry i think having too many rules undermines the purpose of having them sooner or later they start to get really ridiculous and people start disregarding them but dumbledore said you could only stay here if i wasntdoing stupid things like letting you stay out until one in the morning or allowing you to go places where you could get into trouble so i thought we d sit down together and talk about rules you re not five years old you should be allowed to help set your own boundaries within reason that sounds fair excellent remus paused long enough to pour hot chocolate and add ice cream to his own mug before pulling out a simple half pound muggle notebook and two ballpoint pens one of which he clicked open and immediately began drawing doodles on the edges of the first page of the notebook the other he passed to harry with his free hand right so rules i telling you right now you re not staying out past eleven unless i with you because if i donttell you that i going to be hideless molly ll just skin it right off harry laughed and then answered so long as i not always doing all the housework or something i fine well there only two of us so i dontknow how to assign housework to be honest when i was a kid there were so many of us i was the ninth one that we just drew lots but that doesntexactly work when there are only two people involved i dontsuppose dumbledore would consider it irresponsible to suspend judgment on that until we have a few different opinions i personally go crazy doing the same things day after day after day that why i alternate the days i do things but now i babbling you should stop me when i do that harry remus teased harry blushed i canthelp it if i was strictly trained not to interrupt rules were made to be broken but then you already know that harry turned his head sideways to read the schedule remus was outlining in the notebook friday and saturday out gig what that supposed to mean remus didnteven pause in his writing as he answered dumbledore and most of the rest of the order pointed out that if i didnthave at least a semi steady paying job i wouldntbe able to support you which is now one of my basic responsibilities so i called up this girl i used to be in a local music group with her name raven to see if they happened to be looking for a guitarist again and they were good luck on my side at last so i usually on gigs now on friday and saturday nights that what all the music out there is for i used to be a lyricist for the group i did a lot of things we all did there were only five of us and we did a lot of things in fact at one time we were that close to becoming really big and putting out an album but then our pianist left and the whole deal fell apart that doesntsound like very good luck to me well it was more than ten years ago they ve got a new one now and she fantastic but anyway on fridays and saturdays i usually not home so you ll either have to come with me or someone will have to come over or you can go somewhere it your choice but most of the time i can take you with me if you want that d be awesome harry exclaimed i didntknow you played guitar since i was thirteen remus answered him grinning you ll be surprised harry when you realize that i do know how to have fun that doesntinvolve books harry knocked on the bedroom door nervously he d heard remus let out a loud whoop several minutes before and since then there d been nothing but silence a month in the flat with remus it was now well into the first week of july had taught him that mysterious noises followed by silence plus a lack of knowledge of remus plans had a tendency to add up to trouble it open harry pushed the door open uncertainly only to be creamed in the face with a large ball of leaves he spluttered remus remus laughed from a crosslegged position on the floor it too hot out there so you turned our room into a giant leaf pile in october absolutely it my bed and not yours anyway harry i left yours completely intact see remus pointed around the quilt or rather what had been a quilt and was now another giant leaf pile toward harry bed and trunk the only non leaf ified pieces of furniture in the room harry plopped down onto what had been remus bed with a loud crunching noise i still dontget why we didntjust go to the community swimming pool or something because this is more fun right what did you do transfigure everything yup remus made some kind of noise between a giggle and a snigger sniggering sounded like too mean a word for the sound he made but giggling sounded immature and schoolgirly and pushed harry back into the leaf pile bed do you know the best part about a transfigured leaf pile is harry harry shook his head hesitantly no slugs or other nasty insect things that insist upon getting up your pant legs and in your hair and all kinds of other not so wonderful places remus mmm when did you turn into such a kid i ve always been like this harry remus replied sitting up and picking several bits of maple foliage out of his hair and going back to always slightly serious lupin i just know when it appropriate to act like this and when it not and right now there no reason for it to be inappropriate so here i am playing around in a giant leaf pile that used to be my bed and my dresser and nightstand incidentally but i dontthink i ll have such a hard time sorting those out harry sat up breathless from a leaf fight and pushing each other around and trying to trip remus into the leaves instead of the other way around and all kinds of other things he d never done before having had nobody to do them with and pushed his bangs out of his eyes we should do this again sometime i didntknow you were so good in transfiguration third in the class but anyway harry i wanted to ask you something boy you sure know how to change topics at the speed of light it a werewolf thing but harry what would you think if i said i wanted to start dating again harry stared in disbelief why are you asking me because you re living with me so should i take that as a no i dontmind then i guess so but what made you i mean well you said remus rolled his eyes affectionately terribly articulate arentyou but honestly since i ve had you here i ve been spending more time with people fairly close to your age not to mention you and i ve realized i really not that old harry gaped merlin remus you re only thirty six remus sighed it feels so much older than it sounds sometimes but i realized i dontreally have to shut down my entire life because my hair a bit gray or i cantturn cartwheels for six hours straight anymore so i asking you if you d mind harry stared at him calculatingly there was a look on remus face that belied whatever came out of his mouth and harry very seriously suspected he was already up to something so he said so remus what are you up to hmn remus looked startled i mean you re already on for somebody or something arentyou harry former professor blushed i dontknow how you figure these things out harry waved the implied question aside okay so who is it remus face turned even redder well i dontknow him actually harry gaze narrowed what that supposed to mean the werewolf burrowed down beneath the leaves with a muffled just a minute and reappeared several moments later shaking leaves out of his hair again with a newspaper in his hand well i was reading this the other day and remus hmm why did you have a newspaper under your bed shrug i do those kinds of things right but you were saying right i was reading these the other night and this one here he just sounds interesting the classified ads remus nodded and pointed to a small ad near the bottom of the page harry read it interesting for remus maybe somebody who read a lot and enjoyed mostly quiet pastimes was not harry idea of a good mate but then he wasnt remus and the guy sounded all right beyond that go for it that night remus sat down and wrote a letter liner notes random although this is listed as a chapter it more an interlude in response to an email a rabid reader but not reviewer sniffle sniffle sent me demanding to know more standard liner notes apply here but i not typing them all out for something this short the man reclined on a long cream sofa near the fireplace and reread the letter he d received at dinner it was a reply to that fool ad he d placed in a moment of extreme weakness and then cussed himself for and now he was cussing himself again for actually finding the respondent interesting the name of the letter writer was r my or at least that was what his friends he said almost everybody called him r my enjoyed books and music and the theater and seemed to be one of those overly kind generally na ve souls who meant well he sounded intelligent however and that mattered to the man on the sofa he wouldnthave been interested if this r my hadntsounded intelligent he couldntstand ignorance now he was deliberating did he write back to r my or not his instincts screamed not to for all he knew it was some kind of trap set by the other side and he d be killed if he responded but some smaller nearly forgotten part of him urged him to take the chance it might not come again this part argued finally he came to a conclusion sitting down at a table with quill and ink he began to write harry harry harry wake up harry let out an uhnn and rolled over burying his face in the pillow harry harry he wrote back this was enough to pique harry interest huh the man from the newspaper what about him he wrote i thought you had to write him first i did harry day before yesterday now do you want to get up and come get some orange juice and read what he said or do you want to lay here for the rest of the morning remus obviously meant the question to be rhetorical so harry reached halfheartedly for his dressing gown cursing under his breath when he saw the face of the alarm clock it read 6 52 on a summer saturday morning no less it took harry almost half an hour to get out to the kitchen even though he d forgone his normal morning shower he had the feeling remus would burst if he had to wait five minutes more to share his news harry had barely poured himself a glass of pumpkin juice before remus thrust the letter excitedly in his face here harry took the paper cautiously and examined it it was nothing but plain cream paper though curiously soft and velvety it was covered in a slightly sharp square linear handwriting having determined this harry read dear r my i must congratulate you i hadntintended to answer any responses i received i placed that ad in a moment of weakness and i ve been cursing at myself right up till now i decided to stop when i realized somebody interesting had answered me i never expected an answer from somebody with a child or even a teenager in answer to your question no i dontmind children so long as they re not very small my sister five year old is sufficient to drive me to insanity within ten minutes i truly had to laugh when you said that almost everyone just calls you r my i also use a different name with my friends my first name is just an annoying reminder of relatives i ve spent a lifetime running away from feel free to call me natasha a strange name for a man i know but apparently it has some kind of ethnic meaning in some cultural group my mother was part of and i far prefer it to the alternative i d be glad to hear from you again having intelligent conversation even one with day long pauses in it certainly is an improvement over talking to the walls yours ever nat harry sat looking at this strange missive with mixed feelings the man manner was slightly abrupt but there was nothing wrong with that harry felt some sort of kinship with the absent natasha already the mere fact that he preferred his middle name to his first one was a big indicator for harry he knew he hated being called my boy even by albus dumbledore because of the connotations the word boy had taken on at the dursleys no there was some other reason for him to feel odd about that letter if only he could figure out what it was liner notes yay lots of reviews from they all seem to be from one person oh well that good stuff let all hear it for eleonora1 one of the coolest writers on fanfiction net and one of the people to whom this story is dedicated for her reviews of three consecutive chapters lol okay i ll get on with the liner notes a u warning we re still in the a u of harry living with remus and remus actually being able to afford a flat and a car albeit a terribly old and weasleyish car we re not leaving it people get used to the idea disclaimer iliad neverwinter and the unnamed crow who is in fact a raven named poe all belong to me now takes a deep breath these things do not the harry potter universe j k rowling velour paper for letters stephen king salem lot sticky bathroom door my sister first apartment the iliad the odyssey these belong to homer but you probably already knew that the name neverwinter stole it from a video game called neverwinter nights andremus nightstand borrowed from disney and bruckheimer films it is from pirates of the caribbean archiving see ch 1 please rating this is and will remain in a pg 13 category for awhile at least until a few chapters after remus and natasha meet yes that is on the horizon random notes i feel bad most of this chapter is fluff and that is specifically directed at yulara who wanted to read some of remus letters you ll get to read one he wrote in the next chapter for those who care reviewers darkmew13 this chapter is remarkably low on humor factor it mostly fluff ugh how did i write something like this but you can bet your bottom dollar that the reveal in three chapters is going to bring lots of laughs yulara my remus is a serious yet fun loving guy who just has to cut loose some of the time and let go hence his kidlike behavior a chapter and a half ago but he is also a bachelor and so i am exaggerating a stereotype for laughs i think most bachelors out there will understand if i give remus a sink full of dirty coffee mugs and an unmade bed and then blame it on his singleness if i was his significant other he d be as good as a bachelor because he is in fact based off me eleonora1 phew okay let see what i can do i was aiming for unbelievable with remus family remember we know nothing about him from the books except a bit of his school life most of the kids are a bit spread apart but remember that there were seven kids between rachael and remus the biggest age gap with no kids in it is the one between remus and raena which is 23 years raena is 13 you ll find out in another chapter why remus younger siblings dontseem to be at hogwarts and why there are such huge age differences and is it severus no it natasha and no natasha is not an oc you ll just have to wait and see who he is just like anyone else i d torture you and say it albus or percy but you can find their middle names in the books dedication this story is dedicated to eleonora1 immortalflick and my best friend alicia but this chapter is a slight detour that wasntreally needed i really ought to post it separately but i won t and it is dedicated to yulara sorry for the superlong notes on to the story remus carefully folded the letter along the creases closing his eyes and reveling in the feel of deliberately creased velour paper he had no idea whether natasha was rich or poor had no inkling as to why he would use such elegant and expensive paper for simple almost daily notes but he loved the idea he sat on the edge of his bed his bedside lamp carefully turned so as to not disturb harry on the other side of the quilt and as he pulled his legs up onto the coverlet he unfolded the paper again it was his third letter from natasha and the two had already progressed beyond professions and formalities every letter he received asked after harry and almost always wanted to know what was for dinner each word hinted at a wry sense of humor hiding behind a nearly impenetrable mask remus felt sixteen years old again sixteen and getting his first kiss or first love letter or the first time he d sneaked out to join someone in a walk next to the lake at hogwarts it was a giddy feeling a wish to memorize every curl of the paper and each one of the penstrokes in the characters that danced across the paper to the tune of language the feeling came with some small downsides two nights ago harry had slammed the bathroom door rather too hard it had to be slammed or it stuck and wouldntclose and remus calm unshakeable always steady remus had jumped and gasped at the sudden intrusion into his quiet dishwashing time and dropped a soapy glass on the floor where it shattered but beyond the slightly heightened dreaminess and the general feeling that there wasntanother shoe to drop there simply couldntbe remus life went on as usual true he d received some rather odd looks at the last order meeting he rather suspected these were directed however to the fact that his hair was brushed and his clothing looked like he d actually been paying attention when he put it on and harry was constantly trying to get him out of the house for some reason let go to a movie roller skating bowling but overall nothing had changed or so he tried to tell himself the truth was that a thousand little tiny things had changed since he d received that first letter he d begun paying attention to what he was wearing instead of simply throwing on anything that matched and didnthave too many holes he d stopped jokingly griping over chores which had finally been sorted out he was willingly almost automatically washing his cups in the sink instead of waiting for them to pile up he d started going to bed at a decent hour instead of staying up until all hours he no longer toyed with his food before he ate it and he d started putting on weight so that he looked more like a human being than a scarecrow and he d lived every two days with a feeling of excitement two days was the amount of time it took between sending a letter and receiving a reply he d already measured it which was why he was now sitting somewhat agitated on his bed then he heard it the tapping of claws at the window remus jumped up he scattered the three old letters as he did so hurried through the quilt and opened the window a glossy black crow with one white feather at the tip of her right wing in a manner that suggested some kind of defect in her genes stepped through the open portal and let out a sort of croon of contentment remus held out his hand and she climbed up onto it he didntknow why he d labeled it already as a she and rode demurely back to the bed remus sat down and then carefully untied the letter tied to her leg she fluttered her wings and remus gave her the last bite of the steak sandwich he had sitting on his nightstand she crooned again in thanks and flew to the perch normally inhabited by remus owl iliad harry had expressed amazement at the fact that remus owned an owl but it wasnttoo hard to understand his mother owl odyssey had had two owlets and remus had adopted one of them continuing the homer named tradition that gabby had started remus eagerly unrolled the paper which magically straightened itself and then folded into three sections he unfolded this new letter carefully over top of the three he d picked back up off the floor and read dear r my it was good to hear from you on tuesday today actually although it will not be tuesday by the time you receive this setting lesson plans for almost a thousand students is a real headache and reading your letter and now responding to it is certainly a welcome break you asked me what i thought of rock music i dontusually listen to it but certain groups or songs can be quite good if i happen to be in a noisy mood i usually prefer opera again a rarity though more a more frequent rarity than a wish to listen to elvis presley or some such muggle performer or classical music but quite frequently i listen to nothing at all i find that music tends to break my concentration not a good thing when correcting papers or some such unpleasant but unavoidable task i try to avoid bars and clubs and such places although i frequented them when i was a good deal younger and admittedly stupider than i am now i can understand though why some people would enjoy them i rather fancy my habit of sitting in complete silence and isolation for six hours at a time doing nothing but writing would be off putting to some i do play the piano how did you know or perhaps i could answer that for myself the fact that i was able to follow you quite easily when you were discussing writing keyboard music was most likely what gave me away my parents insisted that a well bred boy should always know how to play the piano and i took lessons for ten years some time after i turned twenty it became a bit of a hobby and i do still play occasionally if only to keep in practice how is harry you mentioned in your last letter that he was being quite restless being almost sixteen does that i think it would certainly explain why my after lunch class and before dinner class are always the most annoying there cantpossibly be anything worse than trying to correct papers with handwriting so atrocious it cantbe read unless perhaps it would be trying to correct those papers while thirty students squirm and whistle and occasionally even throw things at each other and trying to keep order i have to get back to these lesson plans before i decide i simply not going to finish them today i hope to hear from you again soon natasha p s this is my crow neverwinter your owl seemed a bit beat out by the time he got here so i thought perhaps he d better stay for a day or two until he rested up remus folded this new letter and placed it on top of the others smiling at the mental image of his mostly he amended unknown correspondent in a roomful of flying paper airplanes he d already discerned that natasha was a teacher though what he taught and where remus had no idea he thought it might be beauxbatons he was mostly certain that natasha was a french name it probably was beauxbatons actually remus could have paid his entire year rent on the flat with a single paycheck from beauxbatons that would explain the crow crows were after all far more expensive to keep than owls and remus was fairly sure that natasha had mentioned having two of the great black birds at one point and the expensive paper strange he thought that he had made so many judgments about this man without ever meeting him in his second letter natasha had said that he didntwant a picture of remus he would rather make his decisions about an unknown based upon character rather than be swayed by a pretty face this idea had thrilled remus to no end it was a maxim which he often tried to put into practice but his own looks nice but with an air as though he d been a doll thrown on a thrift shop shelf had put so many people off that he d given up trying to be accepted by that rule it was that belief however that made him able to stand people like mundungus fletcher who otherwise would certainly have ranked low on remus people to know list he d tried to form a mental picture of natasha based on what he knew but it was a hard and uphill battle he thought that natasha must have dark hair and very large eyes and long slender hands this he had just garnered from the fact that his writing partner played piano he was probably quite thin slightly built like remus himself but at that point remus mental image collapsed he d never been able to get much farther than that and when he did it never seemed to fit remus slipped the letters into the false bottom in his nightstand drawer pulled the lamp cord and rolled over brooding staring into the darkness liner notes well we have a correct answer to the challenge i posted in chapter one which victor hugo story was originally called what there is in a bottle of ink so my best friend alicia the victor hugo loving nut lol sorry sissie you know i love ya will have a small part in the reveal chapter it not too late to enter i ll accept guesses all the way up to the posting of the next to last chapter and merlin knows when that will be this is my entertainment typing this and reading the wonderful reviews you people write me a u warning we re not leaving the a u i ve created harry is living with remus see ch 1 and 2 if you re clueless so i not posting this warning again unless i further a u it disclaimer that right i j k rowling hiding behind wonderful internet anonymity doing what i d do with these characters if i didnthave to pander to the general public absolutely harry would get to live away from the dursleys and remus would be gay and have a car on top of that and one of the male characters would have the middle name natasha get real sorry i running out of ideas for funny disclaimers archiving see ch 1 rating pg 13 for mild language homosexuality mild interspecies violence read werewolf bite scars and potential human hexing werewolf violence and eventually i going to stick remus in a floral blouse just checking to see if you were paying attention i not really disturbing content warning there is a slightlyselfinjuring remus in here alicia yes the best friend pointed out to me that in spite of the fact that remus is cutting himself for a good reason some people might find it off putting so here is your warning remus cuts his hand deliberately in this chapter to set up a mark for harry protection unless remus sets up another mark for someone else this will be the only case of deliberateself injury in the story reviews yulara i glad you like nate crow i have no idea if her genetic abnormality the single white feather is actually possible but she a magical breed of crow so i hiding behind that excuse i ve got a rather powerful songfic in the works right now if you stay a faithful reviewer you might just get the whole thing dedicated to you grin yes i was sorted into slytherin on account of being sneaky and manipulative how did you know eleonora1 well i answered your review in an email have i mentioned i love reviews but i am going to say it again you read the entire lexicon over my li l scribblings is deeply honored and you never know for all i ve said i may just have resurrected sirius from behind the veil and it he that remus is writing to actually i always come up with juno as dear siri middle name so it isnthe but you never know i evil it could be peter too honestly for all you all know it davey gudgeon remember the kid in poa that remus says nearly lost an eye to the evil tree or someone similar muahaha i not telling not telling well actually eleonora knows who it is but she going to be nice to me and not spoil the surprise right right uh eleonora enjoy note this was originally supposed to be a single chapter with the next one to be posted but it already longer than my normal chapters and it would have created a positively insane mega chapter about 20 pages long so i split it in a convenient place sorry if it seems abrupt dear nate it two o clock in the morning and i couldntsleep so here i am trying to make letters go in a somewhat straight line it not going too well the last parchment i ruined by letting my mind wander and by the time i realized i was still writing i d filled half a sheet with random lines from hamlet how are you doing i suppose i should have asked that straight off but i seem to have been doing that a lot lately mixing questions and so on it would help if i could get to sleep at a decent hour not too much going on here since your last letter harry birthday is in a week and i trying to plan something raven furious because i told her i cantplay that night apparently we had a gig scheduled already it would be nice if she d be bothered to tell me these things and harry irritated with me because i told him i was playing a big one i really dontwant him to know we re going anywhere until we re there he never had a decent birthday in his life poor kid i feel bad for lying to him it something i really dontmake a habit of but i dontknow how else to keep him from having any idea suggestions neverwinter seems to be a much better post bird than iliad i sent a letter to my mum a week and a half ago and he hasnt returned mum swore over the telephone i hope you know what those are that he stayed a night and left which should have put him home two days ago but i haventseen so much as a feather leave it to iliad last time i got a call from a bird sanctuary that caught him two hundred miles from here and then the volunteer who found him told me off for trying to teach an owl to act like a carrier pigeon i sitting here listening to something i think you d like on the cd player we just got i know you know what that is it a musical called jekyll and hyde about a man who well it was a book too so i wonttell you too much in case you d care to read it i rather fancy it something you d enjoy it all about the latent power of evil and how it works and how good ideas can go very terribly wrong if not properly executed i really feel bad for wizards who think that they cantenjoy muggle works just because well because they were written by muggles it like saying dracula is terrible just because it perpetuates myths about vampires that arenttrue and thattherefore muggles know absolutely nothing about what they re saying i just realized i making very little sense talking about things like myths that arenttrue quite redundant really i really ought to have answered this yesterday when i got it but on the other hand it rather comforting to have something to do when you re too tired to go to sleep an odd state to be sure i suppose it really not too much of a loss really i d be getting up in three hours anyway i going to stop rambling now in the hope that i haventcompletely annoyed you to death and that possibly you ll find a single sentence in this unbelievable drivel that worth answering best r my remus rolled up the letter and whistled softly to neverwinter who was roosting on iliad still deserted perch he and harry had discovered quite by accident just how well trained the odd feathered crow really was he had been confirmed in his belief that nate was either extraordinarily patient extraordinarily bored or a combination of both the bird could talk although she really couldnthold an intelligent conversation particularly well she responded to basic commands like whistles and snapping fingers and he d once heard her recite a very small portion of poe the raven though that really could be quite by accident as well all she d actually said was quoth the raven remus had been quite tempted after that to introduce her to his superior and give her a slightly mean surprise he and raven had been on the outs just lately because of his announcement that he wouldntbe able to play on the thirty first and she d been rather nasty to him about it responding to his whistle neverwinter soared into the front room with another accomplishment iliad had never mastered not knocking any lampshades or breakables onto the floor he and nate had been using the crow instead of iliad the absent bird being quite obviously not in a position to deliver letters remus had spent three days in an anxious state worried that nate would think he d stopped writing harry volunteered hedwig but she was on the outs with remus too apparently she didntcare much for his driving or something as she d nipped at him the day he d brought harry to london and she d refused to so much as look at him ever since he d tried to borrow her as harry had suggested and she had flown off to merlin knew where harry was frantic at least until mrs weasley managed to call him from the telephone box in ottery st catchpole it seemed hedwig had taken refuge with the weasleys and was quite haughtily refusing to go home remus suspected it might have something to do with moony who would be coming out to play tonight and then nate had sent a note by neverwinter inquiring as to whether or not he was all right because he d never taken so long to answer a letter and suddenly they d had a post bird again remus sighed and absentmindedly stared up at where the moon had been a few hours ago it had set already rubbing the scar on his neck idly that was another worry of remus what would happen to harry tonight he was setting up a mark for the boy certainly it wasntas though moony wouldntrecognize him but surely it couldntbe safe or healthy for harry to remain over the full moon harry unfortunately had set up everything with dumbledore in the flat harry was and in the flat harry would stay in spite of the wolfsbane potion and the sign he was arranging remus couldnthelp but worry well it wasntas though he was going to be running rabid at least he thought remus slit his finger wincing and managed to extract two drops of blood onto the spoon before his finger closed of its own accord being a werewolf could have its advantages he admitted in a moment he heard the water in the shower turn off and he hurried to stir syrup into harry chocolate 1 before the boy came into the kitchen it was one of remus small idiosyncrasies that harry should have his breakfast waiting for him drink included but he had a second reason for not wanting harry to catch him at it today there was no reason to upset harry when all remus was doing was protecting him and finding remus stirring blood into his chocolate would definitely upset the already turbulent teen remus had read extensively on the subject of dark creature protection when he was younger and was well aware that a werewolf could choose to mark another being by blood so that the other being couldntbe harmed by a werewolf he d dug up some of his old books in the past week and immersed himself in them until he d found his answer it was a good thing he d bothered to check too he thought to himself as he d remembered it harry would have had to do the injuring part and take the blood directly from the cut and he knew the boy d never have agreed to that inconsequential as the wound might be harry trailed into the kitchen still yawning and shot a death glare and a resentful thanks at remus as he took his chocolate harry still hadntforgiven remus for the gig he was supposed to be playing on the thirty first remus pulled pancakes out of the oven where he d been keeping them warm an odd trick to be sure but he d learnt it from his mother and put a plateful on the table help yourself harry stared suspiciously at the stack of pancakes on the plate they were chocolate chip pancakes and he was sure remus was kissing up until he realized remus had just poured chocolate syrup on his own breakfast then he was too stunned to think of anything else didntyour mum ever tell you that terribly unhealthy mmm mmm remus looked up surprised at harry initiation of a conversation he d been getting the silent treatment for four days and did his best to swallow hastily what did you say i asked if your mum ever told you how unhealthy that is remus reached for his own chocolate before answering i used to have a positively enormous glass of milk whenever i had chocolate chip pancakes mum didntreally care that i d be on a sugar high for the rest of the day so long as i was drinking my week worth of dairy while she could sneak it into me i really never liked milk when i was younger oh the table lapsed back into silence it was close to eight o clock that night when remus looked outside and closed the curtains harry was curled up on the couch rereading quidditch through the ages for the thousandth time harry no response remus raised his voice slightly harry still no answer not so much as an indication that harry had even heard him harry potter i talking to you remus despised reprimanding anyone but if harry wanted to play the cold shoulder games over something this important then it would be the last time he d stay here for a full moon oh politely incredulous and subtly insulting to remus authority harry go to your our room and stay there tonight okay no leaving not for anything and if i have to go to the bathroom hold it how considerate harry barbs were getting more and more annoying and finally remus snapped he knew exactly why harry was so furious with him but that didntmake it any easier look harry i trying to take care of you here i have to keep us both in food and bills and soon we re going to have to get your schoolbooks and n e w t books are expensive i ve always bought my own before i very glad for you but dumbledore and molly both are going to kill me if i dontat least get you new clothes for school and on the money we ve got right now i cantafford to do that without something good coming in i thought you said dumbledore hired you back i said i applied harry i haventheard from him yet and even if i had spending money we dontyet have is an excellent way to dig ourselves into a very deep debt hole i thought i told you to go to bed it only eight o clock harry stop being so damned petulant harry looked up shocked having never heard remus curse before i dontcare how late you stay up as long as you sleep but i want you out of the living room now it almost moonrise harry finally complied that was to say he let out a hefty sigh to show just how displeased he was heaved himself from the sofa slid his book noisily back onto the bookshelf and headed for the bedroom door when he was almost there he paused remus hmm what do i do if you try to get in for the first time since informing remus that he would be staying tonight harry sounded slightly nervous that depends on whether or not i sound like some kind of bloodthirsty maniac if it sounds like a dog scratching to get in and go to bed you re fine and if you sound like a bloodthirsty maniac you have my express permission to hex me unconscious and i ll explain to amelia bones later why you were doing magicif i have to harry smiled a very little bit as though he didntreally believe what he d been told you d ground me if i hexed you not if it was in self defense harry just shook his head and slipped through the door good night remus remus and harry both got through the full moon with no problems out of the ordinary harry devenlet moony into the bedroomto sleep and so was woken by an anxiously furious remus the next morning who wanted to know how harry could be so bloody irresponsible it did do one good thing for remus though harry was speaking to him again notes 1 a seemingly common european term for hot chocolate and yes i using european indiscriminately because i have seen it in translated versions of french and german works as well as british ones you can find the term in goblet of fire when everyone goes to the boys tent after the quidditch match for one more cup of chocolate and ginny falls asleep spilling her chocolate on the floor 2 chips is the oxford u k word for what we americans call french fries our american chips are called crisps in british english liner notes well here your next chapter eleonora1 who is demanding an update there isntmuch remus nate in here it mostly platonic remus harry other people it a good deal longer than my normal chapters but oh well that okay enjoy disclaimer i think you people all get the point by now it doesntbelong to me archiving see ch 1 rating pg 13 for mild language homosexuality and i think that it this time around reviews eleonora1 put the knife down please eleonora violence is not the answer no it really isn t i wasntaware you d react so strongly to a remus grawp pairing no nonononono don t put the knife down it was only a joke oh dang you pointed out an error i somehow left in there that should be corrected until i make the correction iliad is banded around his leg with a metal band like we real world people use the band contains either a phone number or a tracking number to allow someone to identify the bird if it is caught it works like a microchip sort of and then to contact the owner it is illegal at least in the us to resell a bird if it has been caught with a tracking band on its leg neverwinter and poe are also both banded but as they are very well trained it rarely matters remus does his best to use normal paper or parchment that is charmed to look like paper since this is how homing carrier pigeons and other homing birds carry their messages most muggles would simply assume that iliad was being trained as a homing owl though that not a very smart thing to do and not suspect anything more and i glad you like my remusness darkmew13 coming right up enjoy it was another three days before anything was heard from nate and when news came it wasntreally news at all rather a small parcel addressed to harry with a short note wishing him a happy birthday and delivered by a raven who promptly left again harry opened the parcel somewhat excitedly he d resigned himself to the fact that he d be alone the next day so an unexpected gift was a rather nice way to segue into that to find a gorgeous leather bookmark and a rather juicy book on wizarding history that covered just about everything he would ever want or need to know in a far more interesting way than binns ever thought of in his wildest dreams always assuming of course that binns still had dreams in his spectral state remus was secretly thrilled that harry would have something that would make him stop needlessly brooding for the next eighteen or so hours and so he left harry on the couch completely absorbed in a duel between morgan le fay and some wizard remus had never heard of in spite of his avid collecting of chocolate frog cards he was quite proud to own one of the five most complete sets in britain and the fact that the wizard probably featured on one if he didn t then it only proved he d always been quite obscure and had probably first shown up and died in the duel with le fay abandoning abruptly all thoughts of chocolate frogs and battles in camelot remus set about the much more concrete task of making lunch bringing a sandwich and chips 1 in to harry on the sofa harry barely acknowledged him turning a page as he picked up a sandwich half and bit air a throaty caw greeted them both and harry stood up scattering his chips hither and yon over the carpet and dropping his book facedown on the sofa with no regard to the bookmark intended to avert such treatment with a dismayed neverwinter the evil bird in question was currently sitting on top of a lampshade devouring the spoils of her cunning swoop harry chased her into the kitchen remus wasntentirely sure what he intended to gain by it and after scolding her severely for stealing his lunch harry removed the scroll tied to her leg neverwinter flew to the second perch in the bedroom iliad had finally returned and remus had promptly seen the need for another roosting implement in case of visiting post birds and sulked no crow liked being disciplined and neverwinter was no exception harry tossed the scroll to remus picked up and disposed of his chips and sat back down on the slightly crippled sofa it had seen many years of jumping up and plopping down and overnight guests and all manner of spills picking his book up and the other half of his sandwich which had miraculously not hit the floor and returning to camelot remus slipped the band off the scroll completely familiar by now with the unrolling and refolding procedure and waited for the letter to calm itself before sitting down next to harry to read dear r my drivel can be a good thing i dontrecollect at the moment where i heard of the idea but it believed that we d go insane if we didntdream it not so much sleep we need as it is lack of reality i must confess to being fully familiar with the two o clock insomnia syndrome it a rare night when i can get to sleep before one o clock at the very earliest i find your choice of abstract time authors and reading materials quite amusing if you happen to be quite familiar with hamlet then you will of course know why 2 i am afraid i ve not been much help insofar as distracting harry from what i consider the true drivel in your letter playing one against the other is never a good idea but i do hope he enjoys the package i sent him history of magic is somehow never as good in classes as it is in books you might want to consider taking your owl to the apothecary in diagon alley if he has been making a habit of disappearing he may be under a messenger curse which would put you in a very bad position if you use him for sensitive material i never use poe for sensitive material he also has a habit of disappearing ravens have a tendency to be rather unreliable whereas neverwinter has never given me any reason not to trust her but if you are unable to keep two birds then it is a very good idea to keep a close eye on the one you do have i have indeed read the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde and have seen its musical counterpart in the west end although i confess i should probably find it more entertaining if it were not so intensely personal to me for sheer literary value it is indeed an excellent piece of work it translated excellently to the stage as well but it is not something i would care to see or read on a regular basis dracula i have never been able to enjoy i rather fear it is the result of growing up in a pureblood family i could never truly take pleasure in tolkien or lewis 3 works either i just took notice of the fact that you asked if i was aware what a telephone is i am perfectly aware and have used them several times although i find the incessant static to be quite off putting i try to stay away from them if i can help it but muggle electronics can be quite useful tools if only one knows how to use them unfortunately i still working on those accursed lesson plans so i have to close for now nate remus folded the letter with a small smile and slipped into the bedroom to put it in his nightstand with the others fourteen of them now and lay back on his bed happiness reigning indiscriminately throughout the apartment for the first time in a week harry harry remus shook harry shoulder in what he hoped was a good imitation of being frantic nnnn harry wake up harry he shook harder finally harry sat up hair tumbling into his eyes what remus did his best to look completely panicked harry i overslept it almost nine o clock now could you give us a hand huh intelligent harry may have been but a bright morning star he was not the group i was supposed to be there three hours ago harry i ve got my guitar and two of the synthesizers and all of the mikes clip ons and floor mikes and raven going to kill me remus accentuated this worried rant by pacing the floor and running a hand over his face trying to hide the fact that he was actually trying not to burst into laughter umm right uh remus can you give me i dunno fifteen minutes to get a shower remus nodded hoping he looked distracted i better call raven and let her know we re on the way oh she going to kill me for this remus hurried toward the phone as harry practically flew into the bathroom remus waited until the water went on and he heard the shower door slide shut before he picked up the receiver it wasntraven he called remus and harry hurried out the door when suddenly harry said something that made remus all but jump remus shouldntwe have to load stuff into the car everything in the car harry it was a terrible lie and he knew it as soon as he realized the backseat was empty the trunk would never hold everything he d claimed it to hold and it was impossible to use shrinking charms on remus there nothing in i enlarged the trunk i didntwant anyone seeing what we ve got we re probably going to have to go through a pretty bad section of town to get there as soon as we can oh remus yes remus hurried to start the car i thought you couldntlift the synthesizers by yourself oh merlin now what he could say he d levitated them into the trunk but harry would never believe that because the parking garage was too public a place and anyone could have seen him with a wand out and two synthesizers floating along merrily behind him i said raven and sinelle couldntlift them alone i can do it if i put my back to it anyway i cheated a little let harry fill in the blanks for him a lightening charm that would work exactly excellent remus turned left out of the garage trying to seem like he was hurrying when he wasntreally unfortunately the cool water of the shower plus a hurriedly drunk cup of coffee had woken harry to the point that he picked up on their direction remus yes i thought you said we were going to a place in charing cross we are remus charing cross is east you should have turned right damn he was out of good lies too we have to stop somewhere else first oh remus breathed a sigh of relief it was almost twenty minutes later when he finally pulled into the parking lot harry stared at remus incredulously as he pulled the keys from the ignition remus this is a pizza arcade 4 i know that remus pocketed his keys as he got out of the car are you coming harry stared suspicious you sure dontseem like you re in a hurry now harry are you coming or not harry considered his options i guess i coming good harry blinked as they walked into the pizza arcade not only had he never been in one he was sure he was seeing things four red headed people were waving at him and instead of picking something up and leaving or some similar task remus guided him to the table with the redheads where harry was promptly slapped on the back by the weasley twins high fived by ron and hugged by ginny surprised harry stared at remus you said you said you were playing tonight remus shrugged so i lied feel honored i dontblatantly lie to too many people fred or george broke in whole thing was our idea really harry remus called up at the shop and wanted to know what kinds of things you might like to do since we d spent more time with you than he had and he doesntget out much the other twin broke in and we put our heads together and thought you might like this switchback to the first twin because there almost no teenager who doesntlike video games and of course all teenagers like pizza and loud noises no fred i think that might just be us ron never went in much for the exploding quills 5 harry grinned happily at the twins and then since they promptly entered into a conversation with remus that seemed to be a pickup from wherever they d left off over the telephone he turned his attention to ron and ginny ron immediately began updating harry on everything that had happened since hedwig took refuge at the burrow effectively cutting harry off from talking to his friends and then suddenly interrupted himself to say and guess what harry i learned how to use a telephone d you reckon remus d be upset if i called you up sometime at the mention of his name remus promptly shooed harry and the two nonidentical weasleys toward the arcade the entire group got heavily involved in a discussion over pizza forty minutes later it seemed that fred and george had been trying to copy the marauders map to sell and hadntbeen meeting with too much success they could force the copies to vanish their contents show the people moving within the walls or reveal the contents only with an individually set password but they couldntdo all three ron argued that perhaps the original map had a copyright charm on it ginny was of the opinion that the original had been created with a series of spells that had to be used in exactly the right order to create the effects of the original map hermione had suggested in a letter to the twins she and her parents were again in france that perhaps the map had been created through several obscure spells or spells invented specifically for the purpose of writing the map remus simply watched the entire group with amused eyes as they deliberated on possible causes for the twins failure finally remus leaned forward and tipped his head in secretively you re all wrong actually the original map was hand drawn and then set in motion with a set of six basic spells the trick is in the quill you use fred and george turned extremely interested toward remus ron and ginny both stared though they both knew remus alter identity as moony neither expected him to part with such a secret so readily harry meanwhile was shaking from contained laughter remus had already told him the whole story right down to how the map would alter its own details to match the grounds as they changed and why all right mate no fair keeping it a secret what d you know about the map remus leaned back looking quite amused well i not so sure i should tell you that it would make the teachers jobs a whole lot harder oh come on remus you ve got to tell us now no no i sorry i just dontthink it a good idea harry finally poked him in the ribs come on remus spill you told me that different harry these are they could have been the next marauders if they d only known who the originals were and if they d had access to an initiation ceremony remus rolled his eyes groaned and finally leaned forward again fine but you canttell anyone else do you understand the twins nodded and remus pulled out a sheet of notebook paper from his pocket where he always kept a spare sheet or two in case i get any ideas while i around everyone at the table watched as he slipped the pen out of his jacket pocket clicked it open and started scribbling some kind of very complex looking formula with several short phrases mixed in after about a minute he clicked the pen closed put it back in his breast pocket and pushed the paper across the table to fred who examined it critically remus mate this just makes invisible ink i know that you have to use a phoenix feather quill and yes it has to be done by hand there used to be four of them there are only two now but they were all done one at a time by hand dontlose that meanwhile george eyes had all but popped from his head reading the spells written down on the bottom of the paper cloak charm animation charm bloody hell these arenteven hogwarts grade spells these are above n e w t level mate who did this remus gave the twins a mischievous glance let just say mr moony hasntretired from the game yet and he hasthree excellent successors fred was carefully folding the formula paper into his jeans pocket but george was staring at remus wait a minute you mean you you re nobody sitting at the table had ever heard either of the twins completely lost for words before and so everyone laughed as george gaped like a fish out of air finally he came to himself with a typical weasley twin question you got anything more like this mate remus only laughed silently his eyes still darting mischievously from one person to another before he answered if i did do you honestly think i d give it away for free he looked at his watch harry are you going to use the rest of those tokens before we leave or are you planning on saving the entire half a cup for souvenirs it was a thoroughly worn out but happy sixteen year old harry potter who returned home with his guardian that evening he turned his wrist to stare again at the watch he d got with his tickets a replacement finally for the watch he d lost to the lake in his fourth year harry was startled by the large barn owl sitting on his bed when he slipped into the bedroom to change into his pajamas before joining remus for a cup of hot chocolate he retrieved the two letters it carried one of which was addressed to remus and watched as it flew away through the window he d accidentally left open before they d left that morning harry meandered out through the living room and into the kitchen where he handed remus one letter and then opened the other remus my o w l s came in remus put his own letter down to read harry s wonderful how did you do harry flicked through the multicolored certificates e plus in transfiguration a conditioned in history of magic what does conditioned mean remus took the certificate and examined it in history of magic it means you didntcomplete the test but based on the answers you gave they estimate your whole grade would have been an a if you d finished oh harry didntwant to think about why he d not finished the test and so he continued flicking through the certificates e in charms p in divination well i always knew i d fail that one i guess that means i can drop it now o plus in defense against the dark arts i knew i got an o in that one the day i took it e plus in care of magical creatures remus i passed potions harry jumped up knocking his chair over and stared at the pale orange certificate in his hands he d gotten through with an o conditioned and a short explanation given afterward that he showed extreme promise and exemplary understanding in his potions theory exam remus carefully tugged the stiff paper from harry hands not wanting to tear it and a grin spread easily over his face congratulations harry picked his chair up and sat back down running his hand through his hair and staring at the o w l summary sheet sitting on the table in front of him there it was in green ink on yellow parchment potions o conditioned i not sure if i should be happy because it a required n e w t for auror training or if i shouldntbe because it means two more years with snape harry made a face remus meanwhile was examining the rest of the certificates you got an e in herbology too harry you forgot that one i only read them in the order they came out of the envelope remus i did harry turned his head around to read over remus shoulder i did you did really well harry we ll have to put these in a book like the one i ve got from when i was in school we ll just leave the divination one out and pretend you didnttake it he added winking impishly at harry who was playing aimlessly with the multihued certificates now scattered across the kitchen table i cantbelieve i got an o in potions snape going to be furious professor snape harry remus corrected automatically carefully stacking harry o w l certificates and slipping them back into the envelope now let see what dumbledore wants with me shall we he added as he carefully slit his own envelope along the top he pulled out a sheet of parchment folded separately from the rest his eyes moved rapidly back and forth for several moments a grin spreading slowly on his features and then beaming widely he pushed the letter across the tabletop toward harry who read only the first two lines before he looked up caught remus eye and then they both started laughing when at last they were able to stop remus pulled the rest of the parchment out of the envelope and flicked through it well i suppose this means i have to start setting lesson plans tomorrow harry remus murmured tucking the entire sheaf back into its envelope in the meantime dontyou think it time we headed to bed as harry burrowed beneath his sheets staring out dreamily at the moon before he fell asleep he thought drowsily that he d never known a birthday could be so much fun just as he drifted off to sleep he wondered what had ever become of the other three copies of the marauders map author tee hee hee hee i evil i guess you ll have to review and then read the next chapter to find out reference notes 1 i seem to have accidentally included this reference in the last chapter just for those with slow loading modems who don twant to go back chips is the british oxford english word for what americans call french fries the oxford for potato chips is crisps and is used in goblet of fire when harry decides he will not accept even a crisp from fred and george in the future after the incident with neville and the canary creams 2 nate is referring to the line to sleep perchance to dream from william shakespeare hamlet the work remus was randomly quoting from 3 i assume the reference to j r r tolkien lord of the rings trilogy which i have never read but have no problem abusing as a literary reference is self explanatory lewis is c s lewis the author of the chronicles of narnia four books of which i have yet to finish both of these created their own mythology much as rowling admits to doing so it is unlikely that nate would be able to enjoy what would seem like nonsense to him because in his world it would be inaccurate 4 i dontknow if these exist anywhere but in the united states i feel bad for people in other countries if they don t for people in the us i thinking of something like pete pizza or chuck e cheese here for those who dontknow what pete pizza or chuck e cheese are when you go into a pizza arcade you order a pizza and buy game tokens half of the place is a restaurant but the other half is a giant video game arcade you go play games with your tokens until your pizza is delivered at our local chuck e cheese s they call your name over an intercom and then after you eat you go play games again it easy to spend the whole day at one and you can collect tickets from the games to redeem for some pretty cool prizes 5 a new trick item from weasleys wizarding wheezes of course liner notes this was written when i was taking a break from setting up my creative writing portfolio which is only half done due tomorrow and it 11 00 at night be thankful i posting this you ingrates it d serve you right if i didn t just kidding the break from staticky cover pages and sorting shuffled pages was a good one and well needed oh one other thing i just joined the master and the wolf fqf and am in the process of writing a rather twisted in a good way remus severus for the third wave i ll post a notice in my liner notes for this story when i ve posted at the fqf disclaimer does j k rowling have pillows under her mattress because it too old and sagging and she cantafford to replace it no well then i not her and we all know she the grand high poohbah of harry potter so archiving see chapter 1 rating pg 13 for mild language andhomosexuality please dontflame me about these things this is your fair warning reviewers eleonora1 be patient young jedi the band will show up in the next chapter yes i answering your review in reverse order because i feel like it yes remus tells his identity to the twins i agree seeing it not once but in double would be hilarious and you never know remus might just have a few more marauders tricks up his sleeves severus opinion on harry ace of the test well i guess you ll just have to see for yourself sometime soon nate will not remain nate for much longer in fact only until next chapter muahahaha neverwinter she probably my favorite character to write very mischievous she is in my mind remus is and has always been ever since the second time i read the book in fact an avid chocolate frog card collector an opinion that only solidified when i saw how many people online make him a chocolate addict and it not necessarily that nate is trying to impress remus in spite of your opinion on the subject when i revealed his identity to you o impatient one nate is quite a caring person in my mind and truly felt badly when he found out that harry has never really had much of his own to speak of yulara well you never know nate could be severus i could have misled eleonora so she d be completely thrown off when i make the reveal next chapter i have not read much shakespeare but hamlet is undoubtedly the best i have read i pick most of these works from things that either my friends or i enjoy so if i dontknow facts about them i e i couldnttell you who an elf who a hobbit or what an ork is from lord of the rings i can ask around and get some dirt fast so you are seeing either a a lot of my favoritesor b works similar to my favorites i honestly have no idea if pizza arcades exist elsewhere and in fact i not sure they re even called that it just seemed to fit what they are so i used it but both of my best birthday parties ages 4 and 12 were held at chuck e cheese s our local pizza arcade so i built on experience remus is always kind he remus and what this about an abandoned story no cries pouts well enjoy remus sat with the end of his quill in his mouth cogitating furiously he had a secret he had a secret that had to be shared before he could go any further but he wasntsure he was ready to share it he d had too many bad experiences with people who couldntlook past his secret once they knew about it finally in complete frustration he slammed his quill on the table it broke and he was not so angry that he couldntspare a moment to grieve a little over the loss of an almost brand new writing instrument and turned in his swivel chair until he was facing completely away from the kitchen table it had not originally been a swivel chair but it was so old and loose that finally remus had given in and magically modified it because he was tired of the seat coming off now it was in danger of coming off again as remus stood so quickly he nearly knocked it over he wandered into the living room where harry was again reading the book nate had given him for his birthday harry no response harry still nothing remus was almost ready to raise his voice before it occurred to him to try closing the book so he did exactly that slipping the bookmark in place as he did so and harry looked up i thought so come out of the world in your head anne shirley 1 and join the big people in the real world i need your help harry groaned openly the last time remus had said i need your help harry had spent the day aiding him in scrubbing floors and carpets and furniture because dumbledore had declared that there would be a core meeting of the order and he wanted remus to sponsor it it was really just a sneaky way of finding out how harry was doing and living now that he was in remus care remus looked annoyed harry honestly it not like i going to make you scrub the toilet with a toothbrush i just need some advice advice is easier to get than help i know remus paused sitting down while deliberating on the best way to open this discussion finally he decided the direct approach would be the best one harry i need to tell nate about my problem you mean about being a werewolf remus nodded that easy just come right out and tell him the truth remus rolled his eyes it not that easy harry what do you think i ve been writing at the kitchen table for the past two hours a royal summons harry grinned a bit at the idea of remus writing a royal summons and then got serious again you cantjust dance around it remus tell him the truth just like what you told me when i asked if you d told him if he really the person he seems to be he ll understand a lot of people dontwant to associate with werewolves harry and they re decent enough otherwise you seem to think that being straight open about it is going to solve any difficulties i might encounter here harry stood up with a huff i dont think that remus but it a lot less risky than beating around the bush until he thinks you ve actually got some really horrible secret that even worse like like oh i dontknow like you re really ludo bagman in disguise that a good one remus actually laughed that time well it not like i ve actually got too much to lose right go slap those bigoted bastards a good one harry to say remus was shocked would be like saying voldemort had made a couple of bad decisions harry grinned apologetically sorry i got to the last letter before you did it growing on me the blonde rolled his eyes wonderful habits he teaching you what really in that book the marauder in him couldnt resist a teasing jab before stridingout to the kitchen and then back into the living room and up to harry school desk he returned to the kitchen with a ballpoint pen quills after all were very highly overrated nate was in the middle of a book when neverwinter soared through his window he idly closed his rather riveting edition of the hunchback of notre dame 2 offered neverwinter a piece of the chocolate chip biscuit sitting next to him and unfolded the letter from r my he d been a bit startled at first by the other odd habit of writing everything on plain composition paper taken straight from a muggle notebook but it had quickly gone past surprising to become somewhat endearing immediately his eyes riveted on the phrase i have something i need to tell you and his chest filled with icy dread this was it this was the reason he d stopped seeking people out and become his own little shell sooner or later something rammed into the perfect setting and it moved and tore and was revealed to be only cloth not reality after all he half considered not reading the letter and then logic came back to him as he realized that i have something i need to tell you could be something as simple as i going abroad for a bit and i wontbe able to write for about two weeks nothing that extravagant of course because r my definitely couldntafford it especially not raising a teenager but something that simple nothing to panic over he lowered his eyes again to the paper dear nate i finally figured out how to tell when you re approaching a delicate topic if you ve spent two hours sitting at your kitchen table with a piece of paper in front of you and a quill in hand trying to write and finally you end up breaking the quill by accident because you get so bloody frustrated well that a fairly good indication i have something i need to tell you and i can only ask that you finish this entire letter before making a decision you dont have to of course but i would sincerely appreciate it if you did the thing is this i a werewolf nate raised his eyes from the paper stunned r my usual letters sounded like they came from a man of manydifferentkinds of faces sensitive kind talented humorous but they did not sound like they came from a werewolf at least according to what he knew of werewolves they were vicious and bloodthirsty even in their human forms and certainly would be neither interested nor able to hold an almost expert conversation on literature a good deal of it old and obscure neither did they write music worry about telling white lies or adopt teenagers they certainly didntget up at dawn or keep a birdfeeder almost certain that this was another quirk of r my odd sense of humor nate read on i know you re probably wondering why i didnttell you before and the truth is i not really ready to tell youabout itnow but i think you know enough about me as a person to make a decision about whether or not you want this to end whatever it is we ve got here i intended from the very first letter i sent to tell you the truth if things worked out and i could be wrong here it certainly wouldntbe the first time but i think things are working out i dontwant to keep someone i care about in the dark but i think you d understand if i said i didntwant to just indiscriminately reveal my condition to any random person i happened to speak to or write to in this case time and experience both teach you to be wary of things like that i suppose i ve taken up enough of your time if you ve decided to stick with it and hear me out even though it certainly not a pleasant subject so i passing the ball off to you always r my nate stared out the window this hadntbeen welcome news at all but did he really care assuming r my was telling the truth and he had no reason to believe otherwise then all of his beliefs about werewolves were nothing more than illusions and he had a lot to learn if r my was lying and based upon how guilt ridden r my had been over harry birthday nate considered this highly unlikely then all of his beliefs about r my were nothing more than illusions and he had gained only experience from this entire thing he sat with the letter hanging from his hand gazing blankly out at the sky as it changed from blue to gold to black but still had only questions without answers reference notes 1 if you ve never read anne of green gables well shame on you what are you reading this for go read it after you review of course anne shirley is the main character and is a very imaginative girl who cantbe drawn from her dream world for almost anything 2 heh heh heh i not telling you why i put this marker in you ll have to figure that one out for yourself
