haired man sitting at a window seat in the quaint little caf they used to lunch at sitting down in front of him tonks waited for graham to acknowledge her presence you know i not supposed to tell you this right he asked without looking at her tonks didntanswer her face was set hard as she waited for graham to tell her what he d brought her here for graham slipped a piece of parchment over the table finally looking up to meet her eyes tonks held them for a minute before unfolding the paper and reading the single line written in graham familiar script an infant of black and blue what is this tonks asked quietly i was given that and instructions to find any infant born in the past year that fits that description graham paused and placed a hand over tonks causing her to look up tonks the child in that photo sirius and hermione blacks daughter what colour eyes does she have tonks glared at graham and kept her mouth shut tonks i only trying to help you you can help me by staying away from my goddaughter you dontunderstand i want to stay away from her for as long as possible our orders are to find any black haired blue eyed infant then report to the minister his officials take over from there and if i can stop them questioning two of the people who helped save the wizarding world i will graham paused again tonks what colour are you goddaughters eyes he asked again tonks eyes were filled with worry as she answered quietly glancing back down at the piece of parchment blue graham sighed and sat back we believe that may be a part of a new prophecy tonks head snapped up again what but prophecies are supposed to be kept secret the ministry cantinvolve themselves if the prophecy wasntfor them that what i thought which means there must be more to this than what we ve been told graham stood to leave my advice is to keep your goddaughter away from ministry officials for as long as possible it may not be anything but graham let his sentence run off as he patted tonks on the shoulder and left leaving her staring down at the small piece of parchment an infant of black and blue o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus woke in the early hours of the morning and frowned normally he was accustomed to waking at this time in an effort to steal back some of the sheets tonks was so good at pilfering in the middle of the night tonight however the presence of the duvet covering him woke him rolling over he noticed the bed was otherwise empty and a soft glow was emitting from under the closed door slipping on a robe remus stepped out of the room and into the small lounge area where he found tonks sitting on the couch in front of a small fire taking a seat beside her remus looked at what she was holding it was the photo of sirius hermione and elizabeth that had been sitting on her desk in her office tonks remus asked quietly concerned as a small tear rolled down her face nymph what the matter he asked gently wiping away the tear tonks looked up and met his eyes i ve been warned by a friend at the ministry to keep elizabeth safe remus frowned safe from what the ministry tonks i dontunderstand tonks handed remus a piece of parchment an infant of black and blue graham team has been ordered to find an infant born in the past year that matches that description then report it to the minister they think it might be a new prophecy remus read the line thoughtfully the way it was worded made it possible that it was part of a prophecy is that all they had he asked looking up at tonks and meeting her eyes tonks nodded it probably nothing you know but i cantstop thinking that maybe it is something i dontwant it to be something remus sirius and hermione have been through too much already remus pulled tonks into his arms and placed a small kiss on the top of her head i know he whispered his mind wandering to that single line on the parchment o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o i going to give elizabeth a bath hermione announced walking though the living room of their chambers where sirius was going through some homework set for his newts class do you want to help she asked knowing sirius loved to bath elizabeth sirius grinned up from his work i ll be in soon hermione wandered into the bathroom with elizabeth in her arms and placed her on the mat on the floor she turned the water on before opening the cupboard above the sink how about some bubbles she asked elizabeth who just grinned up and made ba ba sounds hermione laughed bubbles it is she said as she poured a small amount into the warm water turning off the taps she turned to undress elizabeth before slipping her into the bath giggling elizabeth immediately began to splash sending foamy white bubbles and water into hermione hair out in the lounge sirius was finding it hard to concentrate on his work with the sounds of hermione and elizabeth laughter floating in to meet his ears after a few minutes of torture sirius stood and wandered into the bathroom hermione heard sirius approaching and still supporting elizabeth back turned to greet him as he walked in you two make a lot of noise hey since when did we have gold bubble bath confused hermione turned back to the back and gasped as she took in the gold bubbles floating in the water before looking at a grinning elizabeth they werentgold she whispered in shock they were white sirius frowned then looked from hermione to elizabeth before grinning and moving in to kneel next to hermione hello my little munchkin can you change the colour of the bubbles again elizabeth just giggled and shrieked continuing to soak sirius and hermione in the process as both watched on to see if the bubbles would change again sirius remus voice flowed into the room hermione in here moony sirius called not taking his eyes off elizabeth remus stepped into the bathroom and elizabeth grin grew as she recognised the sandy haired man and in between the giggles and splashes the bubbles turned to amber um remus started as sirius and hermione grinned at elizabeth who just did that wasntme sirius stated hermione hermione shook her head a beaming smile on her face not me sirius turned to elizabeth elizabeth elizabeth giggled again and continued to splash the now amber coloured bubbles about moony grab the camera sirius ordered not taking his eyes off his daughter remus did what he was asked bumping into tonks in the process what the rush she asked as remus grabbed sirius camera come and see he said grinning and leading the pink haired witch into the bathroom the camera ready in his hands remus entered first and was followed by a slightly confused tonks as soon as elizabeth saw the auror her face lit up and the bubbles turned violet o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ten minutes later and sirius was flooing harry and ginny to tell them the news as hermione dried elizabeth off and dressed her on the couch tonks prepared herself to give sirius and hermione the news sirius noticed the change in tonks demeanour as he sat opposite them on the couch and frowned at his cousin alright tonks he asked as hermione handed him elizabeth while she went to dry herself off tonks glanced nervously at remus who elaborated for sirius tonks found something out at the ministry and she just a little worried about it sirius frowned what did you find out maybe we should wait for hermione tonks suggested sirius eyed tonks suspiciously but let the matter settle until hermione entered the room eyeing the subdued group warily once hermione was seated sirius turned to tonks for an explanation elizabeth settling comfortably in his lap tonks handed sirius the piece of parchment one of our teams has been given this she explained as sirius and hermione read the line they re looking into any child born in the last year that fits that description hermione frowned and sirius face was unreadable as he slowly looked up from the parchment back to tonks clearly wanting further explanation tonks uncharacteristically cowered under the stares from sirius and hermione they think it may be a new prophecy she murmured is that all they have hermione asked her eyes falling on elizabeth tonks nodded at the moment that all they ve been given when they find a child fitting the description they have to inform the ministry officials it doesntmean anything remus murmured from beside tonks you shouldntworry too much at the moment just try to keep elizabeth out of sight sirius grey eyes fell on his daughter and he pulled her closer there must be quite a few black haired blue eyed babies out there he murmured remus is right we ll just keep her away from the ministry for as long as we can they cantbe doing this if it a prophecy they are supposed to be private hermione pointed out that what i said tonks answered a burst of green flames in the fire place interrupted the group and harry stepped out followed by ginny dusting themselves off as they made their way over to the couches where my favourite little witch harry asked walking up to elizabeth not noticing the quiet group of adults elizabeth squealed happily as harry lifted her up in his arms her fingers immediately reaching for his glasses what going on ginny asked glancing around at the others she was still dressed in her training robes from st mungo where she d begun studying to be a healer harry was also dressed in his training robes after finally starting auror training harry now took the time to glance around at the sombre faces surrounding him what happened hermione handed harry the piece of parchment and explained what they d just learnt harry glanced down at the smiling child in his arms and shrugged doesntmean anything he stated simply his face unreadable as the others glanced at each other they all knew how he felt about prophecies o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius and hermione heard nothing else on the matter for the next two months tonks was updating them regularly from what information graham was able to pass on and from the sounds of it the ministry was beginning to become frustrated with the whole thing rumours were beginning to build up with some reaching ginny at st mungos and others reaching harry and draco at the academy nothing though was able to prepare sirius and hermione for what was in the daily prophet at the end of november sirius and hermione joined remus and tonks in the great hall for breakfast hermione transfigured a chair into a highchair for eight month old elizabeth to sit in as the owls arrived with the morning post sirius and remus both unfolded copies of the prophet as hermione put a small piece of toast in front of elizabeth to chew on holy mother of merlin sirius cried upending his tea over remus paper with his exclamation and earning curious glances from the student population as well as one from his daughter sirius hermione asked concerned but sirius eyes were already scanning the page breaking news ministry reveals prophecy for the first time in history in a shocking press release from the minister of magic robert tomkinson reveals an almost six month old search for a prophesised child with the ministry searches pulling up no apparent leads it has put a call out to the community for help the following is the prophecy released to the media born to the two of time stolen an infant of black and blue unknown dark or light a fresh mould to hew vigilance in the wind as the sky begins to once more darken a new peril in the air should this infant be taken the minister has expressed his concerns about keeping this infant safe from any immediate danger and requests that any new parent whose child has black hair and blue eyes be brought forward as ministry searches so far have come up negative hermione had tears in her eyes as she read over sirius shoulder as soon as the black haired wizard had finished reading he stood and picked elizabeth up out of her highchair grabbed hermione hand and walked out of the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer nada nein nope o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

of the ancient site disturbing the thin layer of mist at ground level with their long strides the pale smoke like substance forming intricate ribbon like patterns in the night air looking around the figure pulled out a thin stick and muttered something in latin under their breath while waving their hand around out of thin air a small cabin appeared to which they entered swiftly closing the door behind them with a soft thud that didnteven warrant an echo in the stillness around it a few moments later the building disappeared and the calmness of the night took over once again not many ventured to this place now the comings and goings of the hooded figures were few and far between only something of great importance would merit a gathering of the remainder of their kind in one place the hooded figure made their way through the dark corridor moisture dripping from the damp walls he hadntbeen summoned in the traditional way that was impossible now no thanks to the boy who lived but felt there would be a gathering after what had been revealed in the daily prophet earlier that day the prophecy had ignited a small hope in the remaining death eaters and they were going to grab every chance they could to avenge their dark lord o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius watched hermione standing next to elizabeth crib quietly singing a lullaby to woo the dark haired child to sleep sirius mind flicked to the prophecy in the paper this morning he and hermione hadntspoken of it yet in fact the day had been relatively subdued as they shut out the rest of the outside world and spent a day playing with their daughter sirius sighed and stepped up to hermione standing behind her and wrapping his arms around her waist before resting his chin on her shoulder as she continued to sing sirius watched as elizabeth blue eyes began to close and her breathing even out as she fell into a content sleep after a few minutes of watching elizabeth sleep hermione turned in sirius arms and he held her tight as she clung desperately to him as if her life depended on it one of his hands crossed her lower back the other tangled in her hair as she pressed her face into his shoulder trying desperately to stop the inevitable tears from flowing come on sirius whispered leading hermione out of the room and into the lounge a small fire lit by the house elves crackling slightly to ward of the chill of the years first snow sirius sat down on the couch and pulled hermione down into his side a position they d come accustomed to in the same ancient building all those years ago in the gryffindor common room it elizabeth isntit hermione asked quietly born to the two of time stolen an infant of black and blue sirius quoted from memory i cantsee how it isn t we ve had time stolen from us in more ways than one and black and blue sirius soft voice trailed off leaving a silence to settle over the room hermione rested her head on sirius chest tucked snugly under his chin as she drew irregular patterns with her fingers across his shirt as he stroaked her long curls o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus was beginning to grow dizzy with the amount of pacing taking place in his chambers sitting on the couch next to his he could see ginny was suffering the same fate as harry and tonks both too agitated to stay sitting walked backwards and forwards across the room earlier in the day an irate harry and flooed to remus chambers the daily prophet clutched in his fist as he d began to rant it took about ten minutes for remus to grasp hold of the fact that harry had flooed to his chambers because sirius and hermione had apparently temporarily disconnected their fireplace from the floo network since then remus had been unable to calm the james look alike down harry harry stopped and turned to face a frustrated redhead would you stop pacing i trying to think here harry sighed and sat down next to ginny remus looked at tonks caught her gaze and sent her a pointed look sighing in a slightly more dramatic fashion than harry tonks sat down beside remus what are we going to do ginny asked into the silence we re going to keep elizabeth away from the damn corrupt ministry that what tonks stated emphatically you work for that damn corrupt ministry remus pointed out tonks ignored the remark and continued look no one knows about elizabeth except for graham and i trust him with my life her birth certificate is safe and confidential unless the ministry decides to breach confidential forms tonks glanced around at the others therefore we keep a low profile keep elizabeth out of the public eye harry nodded and smirked slightly if worse comes to worse i ll just use my boy who defeated you know who status i sure it ll count for something it shouldnthave to remus murmured glancing down at the parchment in front of him the prophecy written in the center his elegant script circling it with different theories for now we just have to keep elizabeth safe o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o three weeks later sirius was woken by a soft knocking at the door he hermione and elizabeth were back at their house for the winter holidays and christmas this year decided to bring with it a blizzard which unfortunately for sirius meant no intrepid bike ride come in sirius called softly so not to wake hermione the door opened and harry stepped into the dark room with elizabeth in his arms merry christmas sirius harry greeted quietly he was wrapped up warmly to ward off the blizzard raging outside since sirius and hermione had disconnected the floo network at the house as well as hogwarts ginny and i are off to the burrow are you sure you wontcome sirius took elizabeth from harry and sat her down on his stomach and shook his head tell molly maybe next year send our wishes harry nodded we ll be home later i think remus and tonks are going to the burrow too sirius nodded and wished harry a merry christmas before his godson slipped out of the room sirius looked to elizabeth who sitting on his stomach was staring up at him with her bright blue eyes merry christmas munchkin he whispered lifting her so she was cradled in the crook of his arm between himself and hermione best be a little quiet mummy likes her christmas morning sleep in elizabeth grinned at the sound of his voice but remained quiet as she grasped one of sirius fingers in her own hermione stirred and rolled over stopping when she felt her daughter between herself and sirius cracking open her eyes she took in her family both of whom had their eyes on her merry christmas love sirius whispered hermione smiled and re positioned herself on the bed so that elizabeth was encircled by her parents who watched as the bright blue eyes began to close as elizabeth fell back to sleep hermione smiled and closed her eyes again leaving sirius to watch the two sleeping beside him sirius brought up his free hand and began to gently stroke hermione curls happy to just lie in on christmas morning with his family in his arms the sky outside was dark the sun blocked out by the storm and sirius found his mind cleared for the first time in weeks as he just lay there no thoughts of the prophecy or the ministry just nothing as he listened to the sounds of hermione and elizabeth breathe he didntknow how long they lay there before there was another knock at the door padfoot its ok moony sirius called quietly remus stepped into the room and grinned at the sight tonks and i were just on our way to the burrow he whispered placing a small wrapped box on the night stand we ll pop by later sirius nodded merry christmas remus remus smiled merry christmas sirius remus remus turned to see a blue haired tonks poke her head into the room sending sirius a smile he cut the auror off come on they re sleeping you can see elizabeth later when the door was closed sirius reached for the small box remus had deposited next to his head gently pulling loose the ribbon sirius lifted the lid off looked inside and grinned what with people giving me keys for christmas he said quietly to himself lifting out the two identical keys revealed a note at the bottom of the box sirius frowned confused for a moment before breaking out into a huge grin and gently nudging hermione awake unable to keep the new breakthrough to himself o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus and tonks arrived to a warm reception at the burrow molly was bustling around her kitchen as the others celebrated christmas any offer to help molly was received with a threatening wooden spoon if anyone came near her cooking glancing around the room remus was pleased to see that any photo displayed with elizabeth in it were ones of her sleeping molly and arthur though no formal discussion had taken place were being cautious for the young one they knew the ministry knew where they lived they knew percy who although had apologized to his parents was still strongly loyal to the ministry and could visit home at any time it was these two factors that had swayed sirius and hermione to stay at home for christmas no one had argued their decision even when no explanation for not coming was given tonks came up behind remus and wrapped her slender arms around his waist turning in her arms remus turned to look down at her and smiled lunch is ready she said beaming he knew she was bursting to announce what the couple had treated themselves to for christmas remus let himself be led to the table and took his seat between tonks and harry fred and bill sat opposite with ginny beside harry remus was also surprised to see draco at the table apparently he and harry had long put aside their differences and had become quite the team at the academy a light hum of conversation struck up around the table as the food was set down by molly and arthur dontwait dig in arthur quipped taking his seat no one needed to be told twice and began to pile their plates with food remus listened to harry and draco account of their stealth training exercise before harry sentence faded off as he glared somewhat at the doorway noticing the rest of the table had quietened remus saw percy standing at the door brushing off the snow from the blizzard raging outside percy dear i didntrealize you were coming molly exclaimed recovering from her shock and conjuring an extra chair percy looked around the room well one is inclined to attend christmas dinner when one is invited he stated pompously fred glared at his older brother just like one is inclined to reply to said invitation instead of turning up in the middle of lunch now fred molly started as percy sat down percy busy at work it quite alright he didntreply remus himself found it rather rude on percy part but could see that molly and arthur were pleased their son was home for christmas remus harry voice came from beside him get anything nice for christmas he asked curiously remus smiled and glanced at tonks who was grinning back at harry nodding slightly he let the auror announce what she d been dying to share actually harry we thought we d treat ourselves instead of buying each other gifts tonks said beaming at the messy haired wizard across the table fred and bill had caught the tale end of the sentence and were waiting for tonks to finish remus handed harry a box similar to what he d given sirius and hermione frowning in confusion harry opened the box every eye at the table now on him grasping hold of the keys and reading the note harry turned back to the couple beside him spare keys he asked to what remus saw draco roll his eyes at what harry had missed beside him ginny was grinning to our house tonks answered realization dawned in harry green eyes and he beamed at tonks and remus congratulations looks like we ll be taking a detour between here and sirius and hermione then remus chuckled and shook his head and leave sirius out i dontthink we d live that one down so remus fred grinned across the table a mischievous glint in his eyes you have a beautiful woman and a house all you need now is to get married and have babies remus shot tonks a glance and was surprised to see her blushing um we haventreally fred scolded arthur with a hint of a smile on his face leave remus and tonks alone those are matters not to be discussed with all your friends present percy cleared his throat from further down the table his eyes were on remus in a slightly pointed look so you actually believe you re going to breed then are you he asked in a superior voice molly let out a sharp gasp in surprise and every other set of eyes in the room sent glares in percy direction remus opened his mouth to reply but was cut off by tonks so what if we are i dontbelieve that is any of your business her violet eyes flashed dangerously and remus silently hoped she would keep her wand in her robes quiet contraire miss tonks it is the ministry business to know the going ons of half breeds i think they ll be surprised one is actually in a relationship didntreport that one did you i didntbelieve my personal life was so sought after by the ministry remus growled out percy nodded it is wise to be precautious about situations like this how long have you had the witch under your spell then bill rose to his feet fred draco and harry following suit get out bill whispered now bill it christmas molly looked positively distraught and at a loss at what to do sorry mum bill apologized not taking his eyes off percy but he has no right speaking to remus like that if he has nothing better to say he can shut his trap or leave molly and arthur sent pleading looks to their son and percy nodded agreeing to drop the matter though not looking too happy about it the others all took their seats and remus sent an apologetic look to molly who just smiled warmly back lunch progressed at a more civil manner mainly due to the fact that eighty percent of the table wasntconversing with percy and blatantly ignored him retreating to the lounge after everything had been cleaned up draco sat beside remus on the long couch are you going back to hermione after he asked quietly remus nodded hermione asked me to pass on the invite he answered passing on a small smile knowing the friendship the pair had draco smiled and nodded keeping his eye on percy who was unfortunately studying the family photos around the room where are black and miss granger he asked looking around the room as everyone stifled groans sirius and hermione who no longer goes by granger are spending christmas at home harry replied cautiously percy nodded i didntrealize they had a child ginny scoffed you met her at my graduation git she muttered under her breath oh percy seemed unable to remember but shrugged it off what colour eyes does she have an odd question weasley draco mused any normal person would ask what her name was percy glared at the blonde i merely curious no doubt you all know of the new prophecy no one answered molly was beginning to grow worried again but there was no way she d put elizabeth safety behind her grown son who was more than capable of looking after himself she has her mother eyes tonks answered standing up from her position next to remus brown percy asked glancing back at the photo are you sure miss tonks you are an employee of the ministry it ll be best if you did not lie they re brown i should know she is my goddaughter and it ll be best for your health if you stopped poking your nose into other peoples business tonks was standing in front of the redhead now and was glaring at him menacingly is that a threat remus jumped up and pulled tonks back before she did anything she would regret bill and fred were in the process of not so subtly shoving their brother out of the door neither of them being stopped by molly or arthur as percy ended up outside in the blizzard once percy had left the room fell silent christmas hadntreally turned out at all christmassy and remus wondered how sirius and hermione were faring o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius placed elizabeth in her highchair as hermione pulled down one of her mother cookbooks from the shelf turning sirius paused eyeing his wife flicking through the pages hermione feeling his eyes on her turned and raised an eyebrow what you re going to cook why not just magic it hermione shrugged and turned back to the book i not doing anything we are going to cook besides it ll be better done the muggle way if you say so sirius moved up to the counter and stood next to hermione where do we start turkey o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o an hour later the turkey or damned bird of hell as sirius had called it was roasting in the oven and hermione and sirius were contemplating what dessert to make apple crumble sirius said pointing to the recipe it not really a christmas dish what about christmas pudding hermione asked sirius looked at the recipe for christmas pudding and shook his head too hard apple crumble will be done quickly which means we have more spare time hermione contemplated this before reaching for some apples in the fruit bowl apple crumble it is i ll peel you do the crumble sirius fetched the sugar butter and flour required for the crumble from the pantry sitting in her highchair elizabeth attention was focused on the small snitch in her hand the quaffles and bludgers had already been biffed onto the floor her mother laughter brought her bright blue eyes back up to her parents what sirius asked and eyebrow raised as hermione laughed at him hermione pointed at his face and attempted to curb her laughter you have a bit of sirius wiped his face smearing more flour over the already present smudge making hermione laughter grow from her position in her highchair elizabeth let out a giggle mimicking her mother you think its funny do you sirius asked reaching out and smearing flour on both hermione and elizabeth cheeks elizabeth giggles grew while hermione gasped and stopped laughing sirius and hermione stared at each other brown and grey in a standoff simultaneously they both lunged for the bag of flour sitting so innocently on the bench o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o five people appeared outside the large cottage with a pop in the middle of a chilling wind do you think they ll mind if we re a little early draco shouted over the wind whipping around them what ginny yelled back bloody disconnecting the damn floo harry mumbled under his breath as he followed remus and tonks up to the front door of the house stepping in the group stomped the snow from their boots and removed their heavy winter cloaks sirius remus called there was no answer but they could hear laughter coming from down the hall pushing open the kitchen door the group was greeted by a sight similar to what they d just been in the room and its occupants who had yet to notice the new arrivals were covered in a fine white powder sirius had hermione from behind pinning her arms to her side as she struggled to get free an attempt that was futile while she was laughing so much elizabeth was clapping her powder covered hands together as her parents covered the room in flour while still holding hermione sirius managed to get one arm free and proceeded to pour the remaining flour over hermione head half of it ending up on him in the process elizabeth squealed when she saw the new occupants of the room signaling to her parents that they had an audience moony we werentexpecting you till later sirius stated grinning through the layer of flour on his face evidently the lycan responded dryly sirius and hermione grinned at each other the observers all wearing small smiles of their own um we ll just you know get cleaned up hermione grabbed sirius hand and went to leave the room pausing to grab elizabeth on the way dontworry tonks offered stepping into the flour and lifting elizabeth from hermione arms i ll clean her up give her a bath in the other bathroom would you like that she asked turning to the now grey haired child in her arms elizabeth grinned and began to bounce in tonks arms as the blue haired witch carried her up to the spare bathroom sirius grinned at hermione race you to the amusement of the others left in the room the couple sped up the stairs hermione shoving sirius out of the way in the process i guess we should clean this up ginny said looking around the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius stared at his reflection in the mirror hermione coming up behind him look on the bright side at least you ll know what you ll look like when you get old sirius shook his head the grey haired man in the mirror mimicking his movements not me i will never go grey flour fights the exception sirius turned and looked down at hermione you are so beautiful he murmured stroking the side of her face what all covered in flour sirius shook his head the laughter in your eyes it lights up your whole face it reminds me of when you were pregnant hermione blush was hidden behind the flour on her cheeks as sirius claimed her lips in a fiery kiss both tasting the fine powder on each other their clothes were removed slowly sirius lifting hermione shirt leisurely over her head holding each others eyes for a moment before they were caught in a slow sensual kiss both pouring every drop of love they could in the simple action clothes aside they stepped under the steaming stream of water colour coming back as the whiteness was washed away hermione grinned into the kiss and positioned her mouth next to sirius ear remember what happened last time we were in this situation sirius grinned elizabeth he murmured moving his mouth down to her neck and concentrated his ministrations in one place enticing a moan from the witch in his arms as she pressed herself as close to him as possible sirius hands trailed down hermione side and he lifted her up onto his hips and pushed her gently against the wall i love you hermione he murmured i love you too sirius sirius muttered the appropriate spell quietly before gently entering hermione earning himself a gasp as she arched against him and began to move in a familiar rhythm with the man she loved o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o an hour later sirius and hermione showered and dressed entered the lounge and were greeted by knowing smirks around the room taking a seat on the couch sirius pulled hermione down so she was curled into his side elizabeth was sitting unsupported in the middle of the room and seemed to be the sole entertainer of the group so moony got yourself a house sirius asked grinning at his friend harry mouth dropped how d you know sirius shrugged well there isntmany things spare keys will get you into draco sniggered at harry your brain just works a step behind everyone else potter harry chose to ignore the blonde and turned back to sirius and hermione your turkey cooked and sitting in the oven if you still want it sirius looked at hermione maybe later we were going to eat it before you lot arrived but we um got sidetracked sirius eyes gazed around the room why did you arrive so early anyway we werentexpecting you for a few more hours did molly and arthur throw you out an uncomfortable silence filled the room and hermione glanced suspiciously at the surrounding faces what happened percy happened ginny answered simply right sirius said grabbing a gift from under the tree i dontneed to know anymore today who this for he asked reading the label elizabeth he grinned and joined his daughter on the floor showing her how to open the brightly wrapped parcel it was christmas a time for friends and family no worries about the worlds problems or what was about to shock the group in the coming months o o o

have yet to find a single black haired blue eyed child meanwhile the daily prophet has been inundated with letters from the wizarding public expressing their opinions on the matter the parents of the child are being unreasonable writes mrs rocksborrow of sussex it clear the ministry wants to keep this child safe for its own benefit and the benefit of the wizarding community i say stop being selfish and bring your child forward others express their anger at the role the ministry has taken in the matter prophecies are supposed to be private writes an anonymous reader firstly the ministry has no right doing what they have done secondly i whole heartedly support the parents of this child keep it safe away from the ministry who have greatly overstepped their bounds sirius put the paper back on the table and sat back in his chair he was dressed in dark dress trousers in a black shirt with grey pinstripes and presently waiting for hermione to finish getting ready are you ready sirius turned to see hermione walk into the room covering her dark blue knee length dress with a warm coat as her heels resounded against the stone floor sirius nodded in affirmation as he not for the first time lost the ability of speech in the presence of his wife maybe we shouldntgo i sure your parents will understand hermione smiled sadly and knelt down next to sirius chair we canthide forever sirius i need to explain to my parents what going on it too risky writing to them besides they booked a table at a restaurant for us it ll be nice to go out sirius nodded as there was a knock at the door that ll be draco i asked him to baby sit sirius grabbed hermione hand and grinned you asked draco hermione nodded and sirius grin grew this ll be interesting i asked harry hermione went to open the door and found two trainee aurors in the midst of an argument look hermione asked me to baby sit you can just wander off home to ginny sirius asked me why dont you go home and get your beauty sleep draco hermione stood at the door listening to this for a good minute before either of the boys noticed her you can both baby sit elizabeth will probably be a handful tonight she slept most of the day harry and draco looked at each other before following hermione into the room evening boys sirius greeted as he came into the room carrying elizabeth hey sirius harry returned while draco just nodded in greeting ok hermione started as she grabbed her purse sirius just changed her so you may not have to worry about that her dinner in the fridge try to get her to eat as much of the small jar as you can heat it up first but test it before you feed it to her harry and draco nodded as hermione followed her mental checklist she should grow tired around nine or ten if she still awake after ten put her down anyway we shouldntbe too late diapers are here hermione pointed to a bag on the table she also crawling a lot now so just keep an eye on her she cantget into the cupboards but she is beginning to climb sirius moved towards hermione handing elizabeth off to harry in the process if she makes a mess give her a bath and make sure you keep your wands out of reach sirius grinned at the two boys who were listening to hermione every word slowly he began to usher hermione towards the door if she plays up her favourite toy is the stuffed wolf she usually calms down if you give her that by now sirius had hermione at the door and was slowly edging her out and guys harry and draco waited for hermione to finish no brooms the door closed with a gentle click and harry and draco looked at each other before glancing down at the black haired child in harry arms o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the group of thirty or so death eaters had gathered and were presently discussing a new turn of events there was no leader as such they all came to decisions as a group majority holding the upper hand and until someone stepped forward or they were all caught it seemed like a good strategy so it appears he living here a cloaked figure pointed to a point on a map in front of him he isntalways home spends most of his time at hogwarts or the ministry the witch may be a problem if she there but a small group of five should be able to handle the matter the rest of the death eaters nodded and five hands rose as volunteers the next thing discussed was the new prophecy the ministry was helping greatly in revealing their information to the public the death eaters new they still had a chance of finding the child and the ministry seemed to be doing most of the work for them little did they know they were about to get one step ahead of the ministry that was so eagerly passing on information o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry was sitting on the floor playing with elizabeth while draco moved over to the table picked up the small jar of baby food and began to read the label microwave for twenty seconds on high caution may be hot harry glanced at the blonde and noted his puzzled expression want to borrow my glasses funny draco retorted rolling his eyes here he said chucking the small glass jar at harry who caught it deftly i ll fill her cup up with water yeah i think they keep that in the taps shouldntbe too hard to find draco ignored the remark and went to fill elizabeth cup up with water before placing the lid on top harry read the label on the jar and smirked knowingly before tapping it with his wand and muttering a heating charm elizabeth curiously watching his every move o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks stifled a yawn and glanced at the clock on the wall one hour before she can get away from her desk the office was deserted and she seemed to be the only auror on the night shift her assignments had piled up as the minister handed her team all of the remaining death eater case files while almost every other team was out looking for the child in the prophecy tonks wasnttoo sure why her team was the one to be singled out and not included but for once she wasntcomplaining besides graham who was on his way over to her desk kept her filled in tonks he greeted with a small smile how are you doing fine anything yet graham shook his head nothing no black haired blue eyed children or leads tonks nodded and a shadow of a smile graced her features i did have one ministry official ask some interesting questions though tonks smile vanished and she frowned up at graham percy weasley inquired if i knew sirius black or hermione granger black tonks corrected automatically black seemed rather interested in their daughter what did you tell him nothing said i d never met the pair or knew anything of their daughter he said i should look into it and i said young man you are in no position to give me orders i think i can run my own investigation tonks smirked i would have loved to see the look on his face after that graham chuckled slightly before becoming serious again look tonks he said lowering his voice you need to know she cantbe hidden forever i ll stall for as long as i can but i can promise anything tonks looked away and remained silent graham sighed and placed a hand on her shoulder you ll be the first to know if we get that order tonks didnthave to ask what order graham was talking about and a small tear escaped down her cheek as grahams retreating footsteps echoed through the empty room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o elizabeth was seated albeit rather unhappily in her highchair as harry and draco stood in front of her draco with her small spoon and jar of baby food in hand is it cool enough harry asked as draco scooped a portion onto the spoon how should i know test it draco just looked at harry and raised an eyebrow clearly saying uh no harry rolled his eyes and dipped his little finger into the orange substance on the spoon it was warm not too hot not too cold shrugging he stuck his finger in his mouth draco stared at harry and blinked before wiping the remainder of food on the spoon on the cloth we have no idea where that has been do we lizzie elizabeth grinned up at the blonde as he dipped the spoon back into her food her grin disappeared as the spoon came nearer to her mouth where the food suddenly vanished um draco looked at harry who was staring wide eyed at the spoon then back down to elizabeth who appeared to have a satisfied expression on her face try again harry suggested draco dipped the now empty spoon back into the food and went to feed it to elizabeth where inches from her face the food vanished into thin air frowning draco dipped the spoon into the mixture again distract her harry bent down and picked up her stuffed wolf and began to wave it around in front of the black haired baby determined draco attempted to get some food into elizabeth mouth happily distracted by her flying moony elizabeth didntnotice the food until the spoon was in her mouth smiling draco pulled away the spoon and elizabeth moved the food around in her mouth before swallowing it and looking up at draco as if to ask why fifteen minutes later and half the food on harry draco and elizabeth the other half hopefully in elizabeth and the trio were done for the evening with food that harry started was a mission and a half i think she going to be the death of us yeah and that was only feeding her draco looked over at harry you can clean her up now what i managed to feed her with my help yes but i was the one that actually accomplished the task therefore you can clean her up and you can help draco sighed and headed for the bathroom fine harry grinned and picked up elizabeth want a bath huh we can show draco your bubble trick five minutes later elizabeth was sitting in the bath filled with bubbles as harry and draco crouched at the side with their sleeves rolled up elizabeth then began her favourite pastime splashing the next thing harry new being closer to elizabeth he was feeling and apparently looking like too if draco laughter had anything to do with it very much like a drowned rat harry grabbed a towel and wiped his glasses as elizabeth continued to splash hey the bubbles are green harry looked back down at the bubbles which were now green and grinned at elizabeth well at least you can recognize a slytherin when you see one you mean she done this before draco asked eyebrows raised harry nodded it was the first evidence of her magic not that any of us had any doubt elizabeth giggled and began to splash again moving slowly down the bathtub resulting in two trainee aurors looking like they d paid the giant squid a visit o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o an hour later found both harry and draco on the floor dry and proudly looking over the mini quidditch pitch they had built from elizabeth building blocks while the tot occupied herself with her stuffed animals growing bored and noting the great big towers of blocks just inviting her over elizabeth crawled over and before either wizard could stop her swung her small arms and knocked over half the tower grinning she looking up at a pair of green eyes and a pair of grey as they looked back down at her in shock giggling elizabeth proceeded in the destruction of the rest of the boys construction i i did she just harry stuttered she did harry frowned and screwed up his nose what that smell o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o no way come on malfoy no i am not doing it i just bathed her with my help there is no way i am doing it well i not so you donthave a choice hermione your best friend potter and sirius is your godfather so so that means you can change her no there is no way i changing her i dontknow how and you think i do you ve been around her enough surely you ve changed her once no sirius or hermione do it sometimes remus tonks or ginny we ll just get lupin then he can do it look outside can you see the large glowing orb sitting there in the sky tonks working ginny training at night yes malfoy believe it or not people do get hurt at night you might just be paying ginny a visit if you keep that tone up i not changing her you do it and some of that privileged upbringing needs to be taken down a notch what are you doing putting my glasses on the coffee table what does it look like why because you are giving me a headache it wouldntbe a problem if you just changed elizabeth or you could i dontknow how neither do i this is getting us nowhere how about we both do it wow draco malfoy actually compromising shut it potter uh where elizabeth what harry reached for his glasses which had conveniently vanished from the table draco where is she i cantsee a thing shit draco find her scratch that find my glasses so i can help somehow i think elizabeth is a tad more important than your glasses draco was on the other side of the room and frantically searching under all of the chairs and desks behind the doors in hermione and sirius room under the bed in the closet in the meantime a practically blind harry searched for his glasses draco come out here i here shit they donttrain us in stealth for nothing just keep your eyes open accio glasses draco spotted harrys glasses come flying out from behind one of the floor length drapes before hitting harry in the head when the gryffindor star seeker didntsee them coming chuckling draco wandered over to the curtain and pulled it back revealing elizabeth grinning up at him reaching down the blonde picked her up there you are had us a little worried there donttell daddy draco whispered or mummy he added after a second thought carrying her over to the changing table he shot harry a glare you too boy wonder o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o exhausted harry and draco slouched on the couch the death of us i swear draco muttered looking down at elizabeth who was falling asleep in his lap make sure to pass on the message to hermione and sirius i dontknow how they do it oony draco looked down at elizabeth again and then at harry holding her arms out elizabeth repeated her statement oony harry draco murmured grab her wolf harry reached down and passed elizabeth her soft grey wolf who accepted it and snuggled back down into draco arms before slowly falling asleep o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o grinning broadly at the gift in his hands sirius and hermione made their way through the hogwarts corridors as the last straggles of students made their way back to their dorms before curfew i cantbelieve my father gave you a stapler why not he had two and besides i already envisioning brilliant uses for it involving one of our favourite staff members sirius you can t fifty points from gryffindor sirius frowned as he rounded the corner to see snape standing in front of three first year gryffindors one who was on the floor and appeared to be in pain but professor we were on our way back to the tower and melanie tripped i think she needs to go to the hospital wing a brave young girl standing in front of the potions master spoke up its curfew therefore points will be deducted frowning hermione stepped out and over to the group crouching down next to melanie now snape what exactly is the problem sirius asked walking up to the greasy haired wizard your students are out after curfew black give them a few minutes to actually get back to the dorms before you start deducting points better yet perhaps you could help melanie here to the hospital wing clearly she needs it you have no right to tell me how to do my job these students need to be punished not by you they are my students you can scurry back down to the dungeons and patrol your corridors not mine snape glared at the animagus before turning on his heel and leaving the hall with a billow of robes sirius glanced down at the group as hermione healed melanie ankle and began to dish back the lost house points fifteen points for standing up for yourselves ten for helping your friends and add five for helping me have the pleasure of annoying snape sirius what he asked grinning and winking at the girls as they giggled and headed off to the common room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione opened the door of their chambers quietly and slipped into the room sirius following behind her on the couch fast asleep was draco with elizabeth in his lap harry glasses askew was on the settee in front of the fire reaching down and plucking elizabeth from draco arms hermione gently shook the sleeping blonde awake wha its ok draco you can stay here if you want just not on the couch there a bed made up in the next chamber still half asleep draco nodded and walked out into the hall harry mate wake up sirius prodded harry and the messy haired wizards eyes shot open i up i up huh he asked slightly confused looking up at sirius go home ginny will be waiting bleary eyed harry made himself a portkey and mumbled his goodnights and something about never again oh wait sirius and hermione looked up as harry seemed to remember something she said her first word what sirius and hermione exclaimed in unision shhh you ll wake her up harry reprimanded what did she say hermione asked her brown eyes flashing excitedly moony the last thing harry heard was sirius death threats against his best friend o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks opened her eyes wondering what had woken her remus lay beside her exhausted the full moon having set in the early hours of the morning a breeze fluttered through the open window and tonks felt chilled to the bone o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry opened his eyes wondering what had woken him ginny lay beside him content and breathing deeply after a long night at work a light breeze fluttered through the open window and harry had a feeling of dread that he hadntfelt in over a year o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o let go five cloaked figures made their way through the mist hovering above the ground towards the small cottage no longer bathed in the light of the moon the sharp angles only just visible in the dark hours of the morning o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer not mine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 12 i d die for you o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry made his way down the dark hallway he d left ginny sleeping not knowing if there was actually anything wrong his wand out in front of him unlit as he took the hallway by memory his uncovered feet were soundless across the soft carpet as he passed elizabeth nursery descending the stairs harry felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck and continued slowly coming to the base and heading to the left towards the front door harry froze and became alert with the sound of heavy footsteps on the front porch raising his wand higher he watched as the person on the other side tried the door locked harry smirked he wasntthat stupid a bright light shone under the door for a moment as the lock clicked out of place again the person on the other side attempted to open the door locked harry wasntthat stupid muffled voices could be heard outside and harry could hear footsteps make their way around the house as more attempts were made to unlock the door harry knew whoever was trying to get in was determined to otherwise they would have knocked or left by now what he didntknow was who was trying to get in the only ones who knew where he lived where sirius and hermione house was was a select few none of which would reveal the location suddenly the door began to shake with soft thuds as the person on the other side began to physically force their way in looking back over his shoulder in the direction of the back door harry decided the best position for him to be in incase of an attack was in the middle silently moving on his bare feet he made his way to the dining room which separated the kitchen and the back door from the lounge standing in shadow harry waited o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry flinched ten minutes later as the front door was blasted open sirius was going to be pissed the good news was that the blast would have most likely woken ginny preparing her for the chance of an attack looking out into the hall harry aimed his wand at the four cloaked figures slowly making their way into the house then his world went black o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry didntknow how long he d been out cold for voices echoed around him as the rope tying his hands burned into his skin behind his back as he tested the strength of the knots cracking an emerald eye open harry took in the scene around him five death eaters were presently talking amongst themselves unaware that harry had regained consciousness on the floor by the doorway into the kitchen ginny wasntin the room and harry couldntdecide whether this was a good thing or not harry harry almost jumped out of his skin with the soft voice next to his ear donttalk i going to untie you harry remained silent as an invisible ginny began work on the knots binding his hands ah potter ginny hands froze but harry felt he rope loosen and slip free glad to see you re awake now we can have some fun harry glared at the tallest death eater in the room none were wearing their trademark masks and harry recognised all five from posters displayed at the ministry what do you want harry growled out stupid stupid potter the only female death eater in the room shook her head you didntthink we d just let you get away with killing the dark lord did you well yeah i was kind of hoping for a little peace the next thing harry knew he was flying across the room and into the bookshelf on the other side slumping to the floor harry groaned in pain i think we overestimated you potter your nothing but a lucky little boy a heavy boot collided with harry stomach and he tasted the metallic tang of blood in his mouth bracing himself for another blow harry covered his head with his arms the surprised exclamations from the death eaters as bolts of red light shot out from the middle of nowhere prompted harry to rise shakily to his feet blood dripping from a split lip and a gash on his hairline harry watched as the death eaters shot blindly at ginny around the room one hit their target harry heard the soft slump of a body falling to the ground as ginny was hit by a bolt of red light harry limped determinedly over to the next death eater who was still staring at the spot where ginny had been pulling his fist back harry hit the death eater squarely in the jaw sending him crumbling to the floor leaping over the couch harry spotted his wand on the small coffee table and set his sights on it as the remaining two death eaters the woman and the tall male shot bolts of light at the teen as he ran across the room grabbing his wand and diving over the back of the sofa harry ducked a too close for comfort green stream of light and grunted as he hit the floor oh no you are not shooting that green shit at me he mumbled as the couch shook and began to break apart with curses and hexes ennervate harry poked his head around the side of the couch as one of the fallen death eaters was brought back to consciousness upstairs you know what to do we re leaving soon harry stood and aimed at the closest cloaked figure who was then shot back through the bay windows and out into the black night glass shattering out onto the deck turning around harry faced the last death eater two were still on the ground one now outside while the other had disappeared upstairs you made a bad choice coming here harry stated as his hand shook with adrenaline quite contraire little potter the feminine voice of the witch in front of him was cold and harsh as she began to laugh you had some very interesting photos on your mantle piece harry blood ran cold as heavy black smoke began to fill the room the distant crackle of flames could be heard down the hall expelliarmus harry bolt of blue light missed its target and hit the wall behind the woman ducking harry continued to shoot and dodge as the duel between the two began to tire him already weak from the blow to the back of the head and the collision with the bookcase harry vision began to blur off to the side the death eater who d been sent upstairs glanced back in at the duel before heading out the front door a photograph clutched in his hand as he reached the edge of the wards and apparated with a crack growing tired potter harry stumbled slightly over a piece of bookshelf on the floor taking a deep breath harry tried to focus on the blurry target in front of him his muscles were aching and his eyes stinging from the black smoke as the house began to fall apart around them a loud cracking brought both sets of eyes to the ceiling as a large split appeared from the floor above diving out of the way both harry and the death eater covered their heads as the nursery from the top floor fell into the lounge in a heap of yellow debris and flames harry wand flying from his hand as he hit the floor painfully harry slowly stood from his position aware of the fleeing death eater and looked around the room the blood draining from his face as he took in the destruction ginny o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus woke in the early hours of the morning and noted the absence of a warm body lying next to him sitting up and wincing slightly remus looked around the dark room before getting up and heading downstairs slipping on his dressing gown and slippers in the process walking into the small lounge remus spotted tonks sitting on the window seat gazing out at the starlit sky silently moving over to her remus slipped in behind tonks and pulled her gently against his chest couldntsleep he murmured in her ear tonks shook her pink head and snuggled down into remus arms o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ginny harry called out desperately trying to make his way through the rubble to get to her an almost impossible task as she was covered by his invisibility cloak for the love of merlin be alright harry began to pull back pieces of wood ignoring the scorching pain as the smouldering wood burned his hands tears streaked down his soot covered face in a mixture of panic and pain as the black smoke billowed like heavy blankets into the room harry did a double take as he spotted a pale hand under a large beam of wood his invisibility cloak had been burnt in places revealing parts of ginny as she lay still ginny harry gasped out as he positioned himself to move the beam his shoulder underneath legs braced and ready to push screaming in frustration harry used all his remaining strength to lift the beam it didntbudge harry tried once more before falling painfully to his knees and pulling the cloak away to reveal ginny face she was on her back her fiery red hair falling over her face shakily harry brushed her hair back ginny wake up he whispered desperately looking around for his dropped wand ginny harry gently shook her shoulder but the redhead remained unconscious as the flames began to build up in the lounge coughing back the smoke harry got to his feet and shakily began to search for his wand outside it began to rain o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks relaxed back against remus as he drew lazy circles around her hand they sat in a content silence as the sun slowly rose in the distance a shower visible slightly to the east how are you feeling tonks asked quietly a little sore nothing unusual if anything i ll be stiff from sitting down here all morning tonks chuckled slightly are you implying i fat no silence descended on the couple again for a few minutes do you want me to move tonks asked quietly no o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius was woken by a small hand grabbing his nose keeping his eyes closed sirius decided to see what his daughter was up to the small hands moved from his nose to each of his cheeks pinching softly before slapping numerous times dada sirius eyes flew open and he found himself staring at a pair of sparkling blue eyes hello munchkin say that again elizabeth just giggled and grabbed sirius ear and yanked ow no sweetie that attached daddy needs that glancing up sirius noticed hermione sitting on the bed beside him with a cup of tea smiling down at the pair did you hear what she said sirius asked as elizabeth crawled onto his chest yes i did she was determined to wake you up hermione chocolate eyes were full of amusement shining in the morning sun elizabeth hands found their way back to sirius face and covered his mouth where sirius proceeded to blow causing a raspberry sound against her small fingers giggling elizabeth pulled her hands away and bounced up and down on her father chest before moving her hands slowly back to his mouth and shrieking when he repeated the previous action o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus and tonks had been sitting at the window seat together now for a good couple of hours and neither felt any inclination to move reaching into his pocket of his robe remus found the small object he was looking for moving it around in his fingers he contemplated the situation he hadntplanned on doing this today but decided now was as good of a time as any pulling the object out of his pocket remus held it up in front of tonks violet eyes where she stared at the simple gold band between his fingers as remus rested his chin on her shoulder remus tonks breathed nymph remus started yes let me finish sorry remus chuckled as he gently slipped the ring over tonks finger marry me yes tonks spun in remus arms and pressed her lips to his cupping his face with her hands i love you she murmured against his lips i love you too o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius watched hermione swing a giggling elizabeth in her arms as they made their way to the edge of hogwarts grounds dumbledore had given them permission to spend the weekend at home and due to the fact that they d decided to disconnect the floo they made their way down to the edge of the grounds before the threatening clouds began to drop their load usual place sirius asked hermione nodded and secured elizabeth in her arms before apparating with a crack sirius grinned and followed ending up in front of hermione who had an expression of horror on her face hermione sirius asked his grin fading as concern flooded his grey eyes harry hermione breathed sirius spun around his eyes widening as he took in the billowing cloud of smoke further down the street go get remus sirius yelled as he took off down the street towards the house his boots splashing though puddles left by the morning rain sirius skidded to a halt in front of the house or what was left of it images of the night james and lily were killed flooded his head and sirius tried to call out to his godson ha arry leaping over the small fence sirius ran up to the smouldering ruins the smell of burnt flesh bringing bile to his mouth merlin no harry ginny sirius made his way swiftly but cautiously through what was once his house sirius turned into the lounge the first thing he noticed was the untouched rocking chair in the middle of the room surrounded by burnt furniture sirius gaze fell upon a lump on the floor and it took him a moment to recognize it for what it was this time sirius was unable to stop himself and he ran outside next to the shed where the content of his breakfast was brought up again o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus tonks hermione called out as she ran up the path to their small cottage remus was already at the door when hermione reached the porch hermione what happened harry hermione gasped out passing elizabeth off to tonks take her to dumbledore meet us in the hospital wing hermione grabbed remus hand as tonks went to floo back to hogwarts hermione remus repeated as he was dragged outside the wards what happened tears streaked hermione face as she answered i dontknow o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius eyed the front door warily as he wandered back into the house it wasntharry he thought to himself harry sirius called out again sirius the voice was soft barely audible but sirius picked it up nonetheless using his wand sirius cleared the area around where the sound had come from harry wand in hand was sitting propped up against the beam that had trapped ginny the area around them was slightly scorched but not burnt like the rest merlin harry sirius gasped as he knelt next to his godson ginny harry managed to rasp get ginny out sirius nodded and gently moved harry off the beam before pointing his wand at the large piece of wood wingardium leviosa sirius murmured guiding the beam off an extremely pale ginny footsteps up the path indicated hermione return get harry sirius ordered as he gently bundled ginny in his arms remus propped harry up alongside him and waited for sirius oh my god hermione murmured looking around her eyes fixed on two bodies in the middle of the room hermione sirius murmured we need a portkey hermione tore her eyes away and shakily looked around the room before heading for her rocking chair sirius gently laid ginny on it before turning to harry harry can you keep hold of the portkey he asked softly harry cracked his eyes open the dry blood around his face restricting his movements its ok mate we ll help sirius wrapped his hand around his godsons and placed it against the chair as hermione murmured the spell a few moments later the familiar tug of the portkey took them back to hogwarts o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer i do not own harry potter o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 13 in these arms o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione stood at the end of harry bed looking down at her unconscious best friend his face was pale and gaunt aside from the black eyes and minor burns that also littered his body he was going to be alright his chest rose and fell slowly as the oxygen charm madame pomfrey had performed helped his scorched lungs take in air hermione shuddered involuntarily as she stood alone with her arms crossed in front of her sirius remus and tonks were with dumbledore trying to piece together the night though hermione pondered they wouldntget very far without harry or ginny looking to her left a few meters away hermione took in the small figure lying on the bed ginny fiery red hair was spread out on the starch white pillow that mirrored the colour of her normally rosy cheeks madame pomfrey was currently busying around the young healer in training trying to keep her breathing and her heart rate steady the school nurse would be more than happy to send her off to st mungos to get proper care but dumbledore had said no and was planning to keep the entire ordeal quiet hence the present discussions with sirius remus and tonks which for once hermione was glad not to be a part of switching her gaze back to her best friend hermione thought wandered back to her house their home the blackened shell the choking smoke that still lingered in the air the smell of the death eaters the small once white cot that lay broken out of place in the middle of the living room hermione fought back the tears at what could have been a tragic night had her and sirius not been invited out by her parents having initially planned to spend the entire weekend at home as it was though it was just two of her best friends one unconscious while the young woman whose life he d saved hung onto that last thread that kept her in this world stop it came a soft voice from behind her hermione turned to see sirius walk into the room his grey eyes concerned as he moved towards her and pulled her into a warm embrace stop what hermione asked as she allowed herself to be enveloped in her husband arms thinking i canthelp it what if sirius hand over her mouth stopped hermione from finishing her sentence leading her over to the soft couch that had been positioned next to harry bed sirius shook his head don t what ifs donthelp believe me i know what happened happened poppy said they should both be fine hermione looked to ginny lying still on her bed but look at her sirius she barely with us sirius stormy eyes followed hermione and he took in the frail form over the other side of his godson ginny strong she ll pull through hermione soaked in the confidence in sirius voice and wished she could be as optimistic as he was what about arthur and molly hermione asked settling back down into sirius side not taking her eyes off harry dumbledore flooed they re on their way hermione allowed her eyes to fall shut before they flew open again where elizabeth she asked sitting up slightly sirius sent her a small smile it ok she with draco he told me to tell you you owe him big time for babysitting two nights in a row hermione settled back down once again and closed her eyes he doesntmind i think he become rather fond of elizabeth sirius smiled as exhaustion overtook the woman in his arms i think your right love i think your right o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione hermione woke as someone gently shook her shoulder hmmm she murmured groggily opening her eyes to be greeted with an amber pair at eye level remus she asked before the previous days events came back to her sitting up and waking sirius in the process hermione eyes found harry in the same position he was in when she d dozed off he hasntchanged remus said softly from in front of her poppy says ginny improving slowly though she isntcritical anymore hermione felt sirius run his hand comfortingly down her arm as he sat forward blinking away the nights sleep if you re up to it we need to go back to your house and sort through some stuff tonks team will turn up tomorrow on an anonymous tip about a possible muggle attack remus said addressing the couple in front of him anything personal that can be salvaged needs to be removed hermione glanced at sirius who met her eyes i can go through it if you want remus offered no hermione stated turning back to her friend it ok we can do it it would be nice for some help though remus smiled slightly and nodded standing from his crouched position his joints clicking as in the process reminding hermione and sirius that it had been the full moon just days before how are you feeling moony sirius asked getting to his feet and stretching remus smiled slightly i fine padfoot thanks sirius nodded well he started might as well get this over and done with you sure you want to come he asked hermione hermione nodded i just going to speak to madame pomfrey let her know to contact us if there is any change sirius watched hermione wandered into the main portion of the hospital wing before turning to remus reality really hit me yesterday remus remus raised an eyebrow surely the war already did that sirius shook his ebony head not that they found our house remus death eaters if a scattering of voldemorts minions can find us just think of what the ministry can do remus then realized whom sirius was actually talking about we at least have people on the inside at the ministry we should have at least some form of warning if word gets out about elizabeth sirius eyes were more troubled than remus and ever seen them before and the werewolf opened his mouth to continue but thought better of it when hermione walked into the room ok she said to the two wizards let go o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius hermione and remus stood outside what was once sirius and hermione home black burnt wood covered the once comfortable cottage the windows were all but completely gone the rain that had fallen had lessened the damage but it was obvious the house could not be saved oh sirius hermione breathed staring at the house where she had married the man beside her the house that served as an escape from normal everyday life their home sirius slipped his hand into hermione and gave it a gentle squeeze come on he murmured leading the way to the house remus lingered behind deciding to start on the exterior leaving sirius and hermione with some time alone o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o careful sirius warned as they bypassed the living room and made their way directly up the stairs still clasping sirius hand hermione followed silently her eyes dancing over framed pictures barely recognizable that she knew had to eventually come down and unsalvageable even with the best charm work would have to be discarded sirius led hermione past the nursery which was now in the living room a gaping hole having swallowed up their daughter room and into their bedroom the pair stood in the doorway and looked around so many memories made in a now unrecognizable environment the large four poster bed was no longer standing the legs on the left side having collapsed the soft white drapes were completely gone almost nothing was left a small sob escaped hermione lips and sirius pulled her into his arms as she began to cry freely into his chest sirius stroked his hands through hermione long curls comforting her it just a house he murmured knowing full well it was more than that but but we ve lost so much we cantreplace i know sirius murmured as hermione tears subsided slightly but it could have been worse it could have very easily been worse hermione sighed against sirius chest i know it just so hard o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus wandered over to the small shed beside the house and muttered and unlocking charm before pulling the door open and allowing himself a much needed grin as the sunlight streamed in to the small room illuminating the contents well padfoot you ll be happy about this o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione pulled down her wizarding books off the bookshelf and deposited most of them into the large box she had transfigured and marked as rubbish lying on the other side of her was a box marked keep in it lay one item her beloved first edition hogwarts a history having been given to her with all the necessary preservation charms including fireproofing sirius was over next to the large closet depositing raggedy remains of robes into a similar box to hermione and leaving the assortment of muggle clothes where they were unlike hermione sirius keep box still lay empty pulling down a pair of unrecognizable dress robes sirius gasped and stared at what was in front of him sweetheart come over here for a second will you he called out to hermione across the room standing from her crouched position hermione cocked her head and wandered over to where sirius was standing what is it look sirius gestured into the closet and hermione stepped around him gasping in the same fashion that he had hanging in front of her was her wedding dress as perfect as it was on her wedding day reaching out and sliding her hand down the soft white silk hermione felt tears spring to her eyes again as she gently lifted the dress off the rack and neatly folded it before putting it in the keep box sirius grinned at hermione when she stood back up see we didntlose everything he glanced over at hermione box did you get anything else hermione smiled my hogwarts a history o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when sirius and hermione had finished upstairs all of the keep items were now contained in just a single box including harry firebolt which rested on top four boxes were filled with unsalvageable wizarding material the muggle items remaining where they were downstairs remus was in the living room clearing another bookshelf of wizarding material the stench of the bodies that lay in there were charmed with a temporary anti smell repellant and had been covered while the trio worked around them remus lifted up a photo album and brushed the soot off the top before gently opening it its contents falling out in a pile of ashes at his feet looking up the amber eyed wizard noticed both sirius and hermione staring at the object in his hands which one was it remus asked quietly knowing he had copies of at least their wedding day and ones just after elizabeth was born hermione pregnant album sirius murmured all the ones i took before elizabeth was born do you have copies remus asked placing the album in the box with the rest of the rubbish hermione eyes following its descent some sirius said turning away trying to hide the break in his voice not many though silence descended the room and the group worked in silence until all traces of the wizarding world apart from the dead wizards lying in the middle of the floor was gone from the house o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o it was in the shed sirius barley heard remus as they exited the house and noticed the gleaming motorcycle on the front lawn i d forgotten about it sirius replied a grin forming on his face as hermione smiled next to him glad sirius was able to salvage something as well i ll take it back to hogwarts he turned to hermione want to come for a ride o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus stepped into the hospital wing after having dropped off the box of salvageable belongings in sirius and hermione room looking around him remus was greeted by the sight of numerous heads of red hair as ginny remaining family members gathered in the private room off the hospital wing looking over to the side remus spotted tonks with elizabeth and headed towards her you know i usually dontmind your hair colours but mustard tonks tonks looked up shocked as remus approached her spare hand going to her head mustard stop playing with me remus it should be pink afraid not remus replied taking elizabeth from her arms and allowing the metamorphmagus to conjure a mirror tonks frowned at her reflection and changed her hair back to its vivid pink with a satisfied smirk how are they doing remus asked glancing over at the beds harry woke up for a few minutes about an hour ago asked how ginny was but fell unconscious again before he heard the answer tonks turned to look at ginny ginny improving fast madame pomfrey was surprised but she should be ok we just dontknow when she ll wake up tonks paused and turned to remus who still held elizabeth in his arms how d it go at the house remus grimaced not good sirius and hermione managed to save a box of belongings including hermione wedding dress but almost everything else was destroyed they lost a lot tonks stuff that cantbe replaced why cant we just have a little peace where are they by the way tonks asked looking at the door expecting the couple to walk in remus glanced back down at the witch beside him deciding not to mention the fact that her hair was now a slime green colour they re bringing sirius bike to store here o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius let the motor of his bike die down and waited for hermione to dismount before swinging his leg over and leaving his bike in one of the un used garden sheds the couple walked in silence hand in hand around the edge of the castle towards the entrance hall sirius did you hear that hermione asked coming to a stop hear what sirius asked looking around his hand going instinctively for his wand a small sob sounded from behind one of the large stone pillars in the small courtyard i heard that one sirius stated moving off in the direction of the sound sirius and hermione moved around the pillar and was greeted by a small bundle of black red and gold robes the young students knees were pulled up and her head was buried in her arms as they trembled sirius crouched down beside the figure and placed his hand on her shoulder hey the student head shot up and she jumped as sirius and hermione looked at her in concern melanie hermione asked joining sirius beside the young witch who d sprained her ankle in the corridor two nights ago what the matter red eyed and blotchy the first year shook her head it nothing sirius frowned slightly you cantbe crying over nothing what has got you so upset he asked growing concerned about the welfare of one of his students i i its just i dontthink i in the right house she whispered tears welling in her eyes again what sirius asked slightly shocked do you not like it in gryffindor no i love it in gryffindor its just arentgryffindors supposed to be brave sirius shared a glance with hermione who was now on the other side of the first year why do you not think you re brave hermione asked gently stroking melanie straight brown hair i had a detention and i didntgo to it sirius frowned again that doesntmean you re not brave he paused and sent melanie a wink it means you re a little rebel sirius hermione admonished melanie looked between the two its not that i wanted to rebel i was too scared to go to detention sirius asked growing more confused its not that bad at least they donthang you up by your ankles in the dungeons anymore sirius hermione reprimanded again when melanie cast a fearful look at her with the mention of the dungeons why were you afraid of detention melanie who gave it to you professor snape the small witch answered looking down at her hands i accidentally spilt my potion in class in our first practical and he yelled at me said i was a stupid clumsy muggleborn and had to come to detention today to fix my clumsyness sirius stared down at melanie in shock as hermione pulled the young girl closer he met hermione eyes and knew she was thinking the same thing why give a detention for an accident like that a and that why i dontthink i should be in gryffindor i too scared to go to a detention sirius sent melanie a smile that ok i scared to be in a room with snape alone too his greasyness might be contagious sirius grin grew when melanie let out a small laugh in the midst of her small sobs hey hermione started have you heard of neville longbottom she asked quietly to the girl in her arms melanie nodded i read about him when i first got my hogwarts letter and his name is in the entrance hall he fought along side harry potter in the war hermione nodded did you know he was a gryffindor yes all the older students that remember him said he was brave melanie looked back down at her lap like what gryffindors are supposed to be like hermione laughed well he was one of my closest friends and do you know what his biggest fear was when he first started hogwarts melanie shook her head professor snape hermione answered melanie looked up at hermione then to sirius really she asked neville longbottom was scared of a professor sure was sirius answered remembering remus tale of neville boggart but he found his bravery the sorting hat knows what its doing you re very brave melanie you just have to find it how dontlet snape remarks get to you he a sour old man whom no one loves sirius what melanie looked at sirius didntyou go to school with him yes why melanie grinned you just called him old she answered before blushing realising she d just insulted her professor hermione however burst out laughing and stood helping melanie up and ignoring sirius affronted look at just being called old heading back to the castle hermione turned to melanie who was walking between her and sirius so you read all about harry potter before you came here melanie nodded i wanted to know as much as i could about magic before i started and it seemed like he was pretty important it wasnttill i d read about him that i realised he was like a superhero hermione grinned and sirius chuckled as melanie continued to talk revealing herself to be quite the jabber box when she wanted to be all the older students said he was at the castle a lot before i started because he was dating ginny weasley but i haventseen him yet i guess he doesntcome now that ginny isnthere sirius glanced at hermione you know she does have a valid point harry doesntcome to visit as often as he used to that probably because of his training hermione answered rolling her eyes at sirius put out look you know harry potter melanie asked in awe sure he my best friend and professor blacks godson really melanie seemed to think to herself for a moment hermione hermione granger harry potter best friend hermione nodded making the young witch more confused but the books said you went to school with him you re like married and have a baby that sirius answered as they approached the doors is a very long story perhaps one for another time melanie looked slightly disappointed but nodded for now you can go back to the tower if you want i ll talk to professor snape thank you professor black melanie smiled before turning and walking briskly off and melanie the young witch turned back around i ll see if harry will visit sometime really she asked her eyes growing wide promise he a little busy at the moment but i ll let him know thank you professor black she said beaming and waving goodbye before turning down the hall i going to kill snape sirius growled as he and hermione made their way to the hospital wing o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the first thing sirius noticed when he walked into the private room was tonks hair currently flashing between mustard and slime green the others in the room attempting to hide their amusement as the auror remained oblivious to her wild hair the first thing hermione noticed when she walked into the room was the object on tonks finger grinning she bounced excitedly over to tonks and wrapped her arms around her friend in a hug congratulations she exclaimed not noticing the confused looks she was getting from the rest of the room walking over to sirius bill sent hermione a weird look i think your wife has lost it mate sirius watched hermione and tonks with a bemused expression as they both started to talk rapidly their hands moving in quick succession i think you may be right about that he turned to remus who was sitting beside harry bed with elizabeth playing at his feet hey moony our woman have gone nutters remus chuckled no padfoot hermione just very observant what tonks exclamation brought the rooms attention back to the two witches tonks was standing with her hands on her head glaring at the rest of the room remus in particular why didntyou say anything she said panically attempting to keep her hair a nice vibrant colour try morphing you natural look hermione suggested after unsuccessful attempts at pink blue and orange tonks scrunched up her face and long black hair cascaded down her back cracking open her violet eyes she raised an eyebrow at hermione who nodded it not changing good with that tonks spun on her heel and strode over to remus and whacked him upside the head ow tonks there a room full of weasley who didntsay anything yes but they arentmy fianc are they she retorted whacking him across the head again fianc the room shocked at tonks statement were even more shocked at who had spoken harry moony remus grinned sheepishly at his best friend as everyone else gathered around harry bed ginny he rasped out quietly she ll be ok harry molly answered she still unconscious but madame pomfrey said she doing well harry nodded closing his bruised eyes again sirius hermione we re here mate sirius answered as madame pomfrey bustled in to check on her patient elizabeth harry murmured madame pomfrey turned to the group space now she ordered everyone bar sirius and hermione stepped back the couple earning a glare from the school nurse harry what about elizabeth hermione asked glancing at her daughter presently in remus arms please sirius hermione he needs air step back remus gently pulled hermione back but left sirius beside harry bed harry mate what about elizabeth they know hermione eyes widened and she scooped her daughter up into her arms as sirius paled and stared down into his godsons green eyes that were filled with guilt o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o important it been suggested to me a few times now to just use a spell to change elizabeth eye colour this would be the easy way out so it cant be done otherwise i would have no plot as most of it is based on her appearance and i want a plot its kinda useful disclaimer i dontown harry potter or sirius black sigh or remus lupin sob o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 14 bad medicine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius stifled a yawn as he and remus made their way from their monday lessons to the hospital wing he and hermione had very little sleep the night before both staying awake watching elizabeth sleep i still cantbelieve you didnttell me remus it not some little thing you forget remus rolled his eyes sirius was insistent at reminding him every few minutes that remus hadntinformed him of his engagement when they d spent the whole previous day together i already told you sirius things kind of got a little hectic it just slipped my mind turning the corner and passing the passage way to the dungeons sirius opened his mouth to argue back professor black startled sirius turned to see two young gryffindor witches running up the stairs from the dungeons sirius glanced at remus and the pair made their way to the top of the stairs to meet the frantic girls what the matter sirius asked frowning down at the two who were trying to catch their breath professor snape melanie sirius took off down the stairs before they could finish his black robes flowing out behind him remus curiously following sirius he called trying to catch up what sirius rounded the corner at the base of the stairs to be confronted with a growing crowd of students gathering outside the potions class voices coming from within dontlie to me you worthless little sirius grey eyes blazing pulled the door open to find snape face red from yelling towering over a terrified melanie snape sirius shouted dontyou dare speak to a student like that this has nothing to do with you black snape snapped turning on the animagus get out of my class i dontthink so sirius snapped back pulling melanie to her feet and tucking her in behind him why on earth do you have a first year in your class alone and insulting her i deserve a little more respect than some little gryffindor lying to me sirius turned to melanie and his face fell it was his fault kneeling down beside her sirius attempted to meet her eyes which she refused to comply to i sorry melanie i didntget a chance sirius voice trailed off as her hazel eyes met his they were full of hurt that hit sirius hard standing back up sirius turned back to his childhood enemy is this about miss epps detention he asked trying to keep his voice calm snape nodded she didntturn up said she was with you i for one knew exactly where you were yesterday and it wasntwith one of your students sirius shook his head for your information both hermione and i were with miss epps yesterday i was going to inform you but didntget the chance no i guess you wouldn t snape sneered too busy looking after the family you re failing miserably at protecting and ending up failing on one of your muggleborn students really black you re not doing very well at the moment are you sirius glare hardened at the insults both professors unaware of the crowd looking through the open door remus now crouching next to melanie trying to calm the child was shocked that sirius didntthump the potions master what is your problem snape do you get off insulting others it a childhood rivalry grow up already dontpunish my family or students for what i did to you at school you re one to talk do i have to ask who used some sort of muggle device to bind all my parchment together it may have been rivalry at school black but its not that easy to forgive and forget sirius shook his head not me when have i in the last few days had a chance to do something like that i ve been as you so elegantly put it failing miserably at protecting my family and on the side of forgiving and forgetting have you failed to notice the friendship that built between harry and draco snape chose to ignore the last remark you re a thorn in my side black always have been always will be and that godson of yours is no different that godson of mine is in the hospital wing right now that godson of mine has never done anything to you to deserve your foul treatment of him you re pathetic is it pathetic to hold something against the boy whose father practically tortured me at school severus remus interrupted dontgo there dontgo where lupin james potter made my life miserable at school i entitled to hold a grudge not against harry sirius growled getting frustrated and wondering vaguely why the conversation had taken this turn snape smirked i just returned what his father did to me sirius had snape robes bunched in his fists in a flash his voice was low and menacing you ruined harry life when he was one you son of a bitch and you know it if i hear you re treating my students like this again merlin help me if i cantstop my actions with the threat hanging in the air sirius released the potions master and slipped his hand round melanie s leading her out of the room past the shocked crowd gathered outside remus frowned in confusion processing sirius words before turning his amber eyes on snape it was you he stated quietly you told voldemort snape glared at the werewolf get out of my class remus glared back his amber eyes shocking snape slightly before he swept out of the class after sirius the crowd already starting to dissipate sirius remus called trying to catch up in a minute remus sirius answered quietly leading melanie over to her friends crouching back down beside her sirius sent her an apologetic smile i sorry i didnttell snape melanie the weekend wasntthe best that ok professor she said before frowning slightly was it because there something wrong with harry potter she asked remembering sirius mentioning he was his godson sirius nodded yeah it was and when he all better i ll bring you to meet him sirius eyes flickered over to her friends jessica and samantha can come too is he going to be ok jessica asked obviously worried about the trios superhero he ll be fine and let me know if snape remains the pompous ass he is ok the three girls nodded before heading back up the stairs away from the dungeons sirius stood and turned to remus the apologetic look still in his grey eyes i sorry remus i should have told you remus nodded yes you should have i understand now why you hate him so much does harry know sirius nodded dumbledore told him in his sixth year and then harry told me i should have told you too and hermione i just sirius frowned unable to come up with a valid reason for not telling his friend the truth its ok sirius i not going to hold it against you but i think snape might especially after that little incident i dontthink he going to let that one go that easily sirius shrugged as they made their way towards their original destination we ve argued before yes but not in front of a crowd of students and especially not in front of a crowd of students who witnessed you win the argument and threaten their potions professor oh yes oh o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a week later a subdued group sat in the hospital wing fred had returned to his shop on diagon alley along with bill who d been helping out both ready to return at a moments notice dumbledore had given molly and arthur a room until ginny had woken though most of their time was spent with their daughter both now sitting beside her bed their faces draw with worry and lines that portrayed the last few years tonks sat on one of the long couches that had been placed in the room her long black hair cascading around her shoulders her head drooping as a week of investigation and paperwork involving three dead death eaters caught up with her remus was no where in sight having promised his fianc e he d pull out some books regarding her morphing as madame pomfrey between ginny the recovering harry and the students had little time to deal with the colour of tonks hair sirius and hermione sat on the couch beside the one tonks was stretched out on both their eyes centered on elizabeth who was on harry bed attempting to reach his glasses before she was subsequently tickled by the messy haired wizard the ticklish trait of hermione obviously having been passed onto her daughter the giggles of the child penetrating the silence of the room neither sirius nor hermione had received much sleep in the past week between sirius classes visiting harry and ginny and their constant vigilance of elizabeth sleep seemed to evade the pair on the bed next to harry ginny lay with no sign of her coma lifting madame pomfrey had healed her broken bones and other injuries the blow to her head obviously taking longer to heal o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o are you crazy we cantpossibly get into hogwarts a photo of hermione sirius and elizabeth was slapped down onto the small table surrounded by death eaters but we need that child that child is in one if not the most protected buildings in the wizarding world nelson there is no way with our dwindling numbers we can get in there the woman who had spoken was presently nursing some minor burns from her encounter with harry potter the blood traitor and his family cantstay in the castle their whole lives they ll leave eventually nelson a tall dark haired death eater with elegant features replied black wontrisk it fifteen death eaters around the table all that remained of voldemorts followers nodded in agreement she has a point nelson a point helena here couldnteven get rid of potter for us you try taking on the one who defeated the dark lord helena snapped back or do you not want to risk your pretty face do you even realize what that child will become if we take her nelson asked addressing the group she will be the next dark lord she will finish what voldemort started o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o late february tonks sat at her desk staring for what seemed like the thousandth time at the newspaper clipping on the wall born to the two of time stolen an infant of black and blue unknown dark or light a fresh mould to hew vigilance in the wind as the sky begins to once more darken a new peril in the air should this infant be taken it not going to disappear if you keep staring at it tonks turned in her chair to see graham standing beside her well done the other week on those death eaters tonks shrugged not really wanting to be reminded about the three week coma ginny was in it was an anonymous tip no big deal graham nodded what with the hair he asked tonks hand went to her black locks i dontknow it wontstay the colour i want it to so i ve resorted to this graham perched himself on the edge of his desk what colour does it go tonks glanced at graham suspiciously why do you want to know i not going to give you something to joke about graham grinned my great aunt was a metamorphose used to tell us heaps of stories tonks still stared suspiciously what makes you a non metamorphmagus think that you know more than me graham shrugged just try me what colour does your hair go after a slight pause tonks answered mustard and a horrible green colour graham stood and grinned i think you need to talk to remus and then insist madame pomfrey do an exam why tonks asked the retreating graham graham tobias sinclair get back here and tell me why o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o excuse the rant i tired and stressed and just found a vent i dontusually rant like this but everyone has their off days vegetatakingkadoolde if you re still reading this after your review take this into consideration there is a novel length time turner fic that precedes this called bed of roses ergo sirius is not pedophilic although i dontthink there is anything wrong with present day non time turner sirius hermione fics and nt do you mean tonks or was that a typo sorry im a little confused especially because in my story tonks is with remus and ron is dead re bed of roses and because its my opinion what i like i dontthink i really should have to rethink some of the couples just because others do not like them if you dontlike it dontread it simple did you even read it or did you just read the summary and decide to review because if you read it you would have realized there was a prequel in fact it says that in the summary n a re above end rant disclaimer if

prophet 2nd march 2000 order of merlin up for grabs in an abrupt press conference last night the minister for magic robert tomkinson announced the ministry frustration at the ice cold case of the prophesised child i am just failing to understand stated the minister why no one has come forward clearly keeping this child safe is the priority of the ministry he then furthered his conference clearly shocking all those that were present by announcing the possibility of an order of merlin commendation for anyone who passes accurate information onto the ministry that leads to the location of the black haired blue eyed child letters to the editor concerning the prophecy on page five harry sitting on the long chair next to ginny bed frowned down at the paper as sirius and hermione walked into the room with elizabeth have you seen this he asked waving the paper around good morning to you too hermione replied handing elizabeth over to the green eyed youth as she stretched out to him and no not today how ginny harry smiled as sirius and hermione took seats beside him she woke up for an hour a couple hours ago then fell back to sleep sirius grinned see i told you she d pull through three days previous after being in a coma for a month and a half ginny had woken up still being affected by as draco put it having a nursery fall on your head she was only able to remain conscious for small amounts of time sleeping soundly for longer periods good morning everyone the three on the sofa turned to see tonks her black hair still cascading down her back bounce into the room remus stepping in behind her with a blue box wrapped in a bright lilac bow in his hands how my little birthday girl elizabeth grinned and giggled as her godmother approached her and began to bounce in harry lap ongs tonks grinned at hermione and sirius she not going to call me that forever right i dontknow ongs would be a cool nickname tonks turned to glare at the newest arrival only a weasley twin would say something like that the fact that fred grin didntwaver was proof of his everlasting humor and acceptance of the loss of george what everyone standing around for we have a party to get started he grinned and turned to elizabeth after all its not everyday you turn one o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the black robed figure walked briskly through the ministry people weaving around them as their path refused to waver for anyone reaching a large pair of oak doors the figure pushed them open and stepped up to the secretary at the large desk can i help you the blonde witch asked looking up from the piece of parchment she was writing on i here to see the minister do you have an appointment no but i think he would want to see me the witch raised an elegant eyebrow in question it to do with the prophecy the figure smirked as the witch retreated hastily to the smaller doors at the other end of the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o at midday the small group of eleven sat in ginny room harry wearing a pirate hat fred had handed him was sitting on the end of her bed quietly conversing with the witch who was smiling tiredly at the scene around her bill and fred the latter decked out in a clown costume complete with rainbow suspenders wig and bright red nose were currently entertaining the birthday girl with wizarding balloon animals which as it turned out were extremely realistic at the moment elizabeth had hold of the tail of a bright blue barking dog molly busied herself at the small table perfecting elizabeth birthday cake which she had offered to make arthur remus and tonks were sitting on one of the sofas tonks looked rather nervous after madame pomfrey had come in to announce she could do a full exam later on in the afternoon while remus and arthur discussed muggle kitchen appliances and their uses sirius and hermione were both on the floor with their daughter both wearing bright grins as elizabeth wearing a soft blue dress to which fred had added copious amounts of glitter giggled and waved her small hands around in excitement o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham looked up from his desk as a rather official looking official dressed in navy robes made his way hastily towards him auror sinclair he asked when he got to grahams desk yes riegel hartlem minister of magic office riegel stated the minister requests you in his office immediately and he couldntsend a memo graham asked slightly skeptically riegels expression hardened auror sinclair you have been ordered alright alright graham started hastily holding out his hands and getting to his feet i coming o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred all decked out in his clown costume looked around the room he d run out of balloons and decided to find something else to entertain elizabeth with sirius was now standing next to remus and arthur though his eyes gave away the fact that he wasntpaying much attention to the other two wizards his grey gaze had settled on hermione who was on the floor with elizabeth as she entertained herself with some silver and gold building blocks the expression on hermione face was enough to ease the unsettling feeling in sirius stomach it had been a while since he d seen his wife face so calm and relaxed in fact since the attack on their home sirius hadntseen her smile one of her truly magnificent smiles as his gaze remained on his family hermione glanced up and caught his eyes and her face broke into the smile sirius barely moments before had been thinking about sirius moved from his position and sat down on the floor next to hermione elizabeth looked up from what she was doing and grinned up at her dad giggling before her attention went back to her building blocks sirius positioned himself slightly behind hermione and she leant back into him as he stroked her hair away from one shoulder so he could rest his chin there without being suffocated by curls she having fun sirius commented lightly in hermione ear i having fun hermione replied it days like this that make me believe we ll get through all of this sirius silently agreed but didntvoice it instead choosing to continue to watch elizabeth play taking blocks from her when she offered them to him i ve run out of stuff fred announced to the room everything else isntentirely appropriate for a first birthday or a hospital room maybe we should see what elizabeth been given sirius suggested i sure she ll have something exciting he glanced down at elizabeth what do you say munchkin do you want to open your gifts elizabeth grinned as sirius eyes fell on her dada up she held her arms out to him and sirius stooped down to pick her up before helping hermione to her feet and moving over to ginny bed ginny who had folded her legs beneath her under the blankets smiled at the small black haired birthday girl as sirius placed her on the expanse at the center as harry handed hermione the first gift a large box sent through from her parents o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham entered the ministers office aware that riegel followed and closed the door behind him ahh auror sinclair if you d like to take a seat the minister began gesturing to a large red chair i believe you are heading up the investigation into the location of the child in the prophecy graham nodded as he sat down yes i head one of the teams but not the whole operation minister tompkinson nodded but you were the first team to start leading the investigation is that correct yes sir the minister nodded again that is the reason why you are here o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o as it turned out the first gift proved so much of distraction that for the time being the others were abandoned hermione parents had sent through to their granddaughter a muggle playdough set complete with an array of different colour dough and cookie cutters the gift had not only caught the attention of elizabeth whose fingers were presently squeezing through the cold dough but the others in the room who d never seen or used playdough before dudley had some of this once said harry who was currently rolling a yellow ball of playdough in his hands i think most of it ended up in my hair the colours remind me of my hair tonks said almost wistfully ginny frowned confused why is your hair not vibrant tonks she asked curiously oh right tonks answered forgetting ginny didntknow apparently my abilities have gone haywire been happening for a little over a month madame pomfrey is going to have a look this afternoon what colour ginny asked curiously mustard and slime green ginny finished with a grin tonks sent a suspicious look at the redhead how d you know i did an essay on metamorphmagi for one of my classes tonks face lit up so you know ginny shrugged i only training madame pomfrey will have to do an exam remus looked slightly worried as harry glanced down at ginny he knew she knew and also knew that if it was bad news she would tell tonks o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o where did you get this information graham asked his face hard and unreadable as his mind worked overtime a rather reliable source who wishes for now to remain anonymous tompkinson answered with a smile you ll be taking your team to the hospital wing of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry immediately to retrieve the young girl from her parents graham stared at the minister as a silence descended on the room a bit overwhelmed with the news the minister asked with a smug grin no graham answered in a low voice the minister misunderstood graham statement not overwhelmed well you re doing better than me then took me all morning for the news to sink in graham looked up sharply his brown eyes flashing no he started i not leading my team into hogwarts the minister did a double take w what he stuttered before frowning dumbledore has no right to stop you you shouldnthave a problem getting in graham stood his six foot two frame unfolding and towering over the minister still seated at his desk no i will not lead my team into hogwarts to take that child away from her parents do you even realize who they are the minister stood now too but came only midway up graham chest she is the daughter of sirius black and hermione granger and i will not take no for an answer auror sinclair you will go to hogwarts and retrieve that child graham hands began to shake in anger this is sirius and hermione black two of the most powerful wizards of our time they helped defeat voldemort what gives you the right to take away their child the ministers face was turning slightly maroon by now as if someone was cutting off his oxygen supply i dontcare what they did with respect to he who must not be named their names are not harry potter therefore they are insignificant you will go to hogwarts and bring that child back here that is an order auror sinclair graham stepped back calmly tore off his auror badge and threw it on the ministers desk find someone else to do your dirty work he spun around to find the exit blocked by riegel and would you please ask your lackey to move before i give him a hand to get out of my way the minister stony faced and obviously rather angry sent a small nod in riegels direction and graham exited the room in a flurry of red robes o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione gently pushed elizabeth small hands into the wet plaster in front of her before removing them to reveal small little handprints grinning hermione looked up at remus and tonks this is great thank you sirius finished the job with his wand the words elizabeth rosalyn black 2nd march 2000 first birthday appeared in the plaster before it dried that brilliant moony where d you get it sirius asked looking up at the werewolf a little shop on diagon alley i think fred you know the owner dontyou fred nodded angelina decided to drop her auror training after the war opened up a small gift shop it just down the road from work angelina owns a gift shop harry asked slightly surprised that his old quidditch team mate would turn to retail fred nodded brilliant at it too hermione molly started interrupting the group as hermione cleaned elizabeth fingers when do you want to do the cake hermione shook her head not until draco gets here he had training this morning then he needed to pick something up tonks attempted to hide behind remus as madame pomfrey entered the room i can see you now miss tonks remus glanced down at the witch beside him do you want me to come with you tonks shook her head you stay here i ll be back soon tonks followed madame pomfrey out of the room as remus caught a small secret smile on ginny lips o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham raced through the ministry it wouldntbe too long before the minister found someone willing to go to hogwarts and he needed to find tonks as fast as possible not knowing if she would be with sirius and hermione graham thought the best place to start looking was her and remus house he sped through the crowded atrium people moving for him even though he no longer had his badge it was the high ranking colour of his robes that caused people to move out of his way as he made his way to the various fireplaces at the other end of the atrium o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks sat on one of the small hospital beds a few students curiously watching the auror from their own madame pomfrey did a series of general tests with her wand before that small secret smile that tonks had seen on both ginny and grahams face appeared what tonks asked stating to feel annoyed what is with that smile what smile would that be dear madame pomfrey asked that one tonks exclaimed beginning to feel frustrated madame pomfrey chose to ignore the statement tonks have you been feeling particularly nauseous lately tonks frowned i do feel slightly sick at times i put it down to my bad cooking what has this got to do with my abilities well my dear it appears you are expecting tonks frowned as draco walked into the room with a small box in his hands expecting what tonks asked confused draco raised an eyebrow catching the tail end of the conversation a multicoloured werewolf i expect o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o after an unsuccessful trip to tonks house graham found himself getting to his feet in the three broomsticks not bothering to brush himself off he hurried over to the young barmaid aurors have you seen any aurors come through here the young auburn haired witch nodded about ten minutes ago she didntget a chance to finish as graham took off out the door and up the street o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a baby tonks asked staring wide eyed at the school nurse who smiled and nodded i going to have a baby tonks tuned out the others in the room as the news sunk in how am i going to tell remus then another though occurred to her what about the laws they haventbeen passed yet madame pomfrey expression hardened no law regarding werewolves rights to have children is going to change the fact that you re pregnant and no one will stop you from having a family i sure between you and remus you can come up with something before the laws are passed tonks smiled feebly at the nurse before realizing draco was still standing beside her maybe you should go and tell him draco suggested with a grin o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham sped through the halls of his old school passing the curious students who d already seen a group of red robed wizards walk down the corridors from memory he headed for the hospital wing rounding the last corner he spotted the familiar red robes about to enter the large doors praying tonks was inside graham did all he thought he could as he drew his wand tonks o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks and draco both paused halfway across the room frowning tonks pulled out her wands as she heard graham frantic voice muffled slightly through the wooden doors what draco started before deciding to pull his wand too a muffled curse was heard through the door before the sound of a thump what going on out here madame pomfrey asked rushing out of her office startled at the auror and auror in trainings fighting stances both their wands pointed at the door the door swung open to reveal four robed aurors behind them tonks noticed her dark haired friend in a pile on the floor o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus smiled as he watched sirius and hermione dance in slow circles in the middle of the room there was no music but the couple were lost in a blissful little world of their own encircled in each others arms elizabeth was in molly arms her eyes slowly starting to droop closed o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o what do you want tonks snapped knowing she outranked the lead auror auror tonks the blonde wizard seemed a little surprised to see her there before shaking the feeling please lower your wand not until you tell me what a fellow auror is doing unconscious in the hall burke mister malfoy auror tonks lower your wands immediately you dontwant to risk harming any of these students already in the hospital wing tonks glared at the auror and lowered her wand draco following suit what do you want what through there the auror burke asked pointing with his wand to ginny room that is a private room madame pomfrey snapped burke ignored the mediwitch and strode over to the room the other three aurors following behind tonks and draco both stepped to block their path o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a muffled shout through the door brought the groups attention to the disturbance cautiously bill wandered up to the door before he reached it it was flung open and a struggling tonks and draco were shoved into the room in all the commotion the next thing anyone new was tonks and draco on the floor molly shrieking and elizabeth in the arms of auror burke disclaimer i do not own harry potter or the song used for the chapter title which shockingly is not a bon jovi song even more of a classic o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 16 another brick in the wall o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o for sirius the few moments from when he had hermione settled snugly in his arms to when the door was blasted open seemed like an eternity compressed into an instant bill was knocked over by tonks and draco and before anyone could react elizabeth was unceremoniously plucked from molly arms remus had initially crouched to help tonks to her feet but stopped and stepped over to block the exit when elizabeth had begun to wail his wand trained on the three wizards surrounding the auror that had taken her over to the side he saw harry still with his pirates hat helping ginny back into her bed the young witch having jumped up in anger only to buckle at the knees with her actions arthur and fred still dressed as a clown had their wands out all pointing at the red robed aurors sirius was in his hand like lightning but unlike the two weasley men was aimed between the eyes of the wizard holding his daughter beside him hermione stance was the same her face pale in a mixture of horror and rage the room would have been silent was it not for the piercing screams coming from the child in the arms of a stranger an eternity compressed into an instant hand her over sirius shouted the second elizabeth was in the unfamiliar aurors arms the auror winced slightly either at the murderous look in sirius grey eyes or the wails in his ear by the order of the minister of magic he stated raising his voice slightly this child is to be taken into the custody of the ministry for her and the wizarding communities protection you re going to need protection if you donthand her over elizabeth wails grew her small vocal chords running raw with her screams its ok sweetie mummy here hermione voice trembled as she tried unsuccessfully to calm her daughter you re outnumbered hand her over sirius snapped now tonks draco and bill slowly found their feet and stood wands raised there was only one wand in the room still tucked in robes the boy who lived currently dressed like a pirate didntrush his actions as he made sure ginny was ok you cantpossibly think this rag tag group can take on aurors sirius didntmiss the snide glances towards fred and harry you re outnumbered sirius repeated if you donthand my daughter back now you will not attack ministry aurors burke interrupted lower your wands and let us leave he sent a glare in remus direction faltering slightly when he noted the feral look in the amber eyes you think you re just going to walk out of here tonks snapped you need to re think you re strategizing burke burke was about to counter his colleague when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye the kid dressed as a pirate was making his way over you stay back he warned his wand now pointing at the only person in the room that was moving he unarmed burke you cantharm him tonks revelation made fred smirk as he lowered his wand and pocketed it moving up to the nearest auror daring him to cast a spell at the multicoloured clown harry stepped around burke small team and stood in front of the man holding the screaming child give her back he murmured i under orders from the minster himself i will not not burkes voice trailed off as harry reached up and removed the ridiculous pirate hat the aurors eyes falling on the familiar lightning bolt scar give her back harry stated again his voice rising slightly in burke arms elizabeth was stretching out towards harry the only familiar face she could see through her tears but i harry could see the fear sparked in the aurors eyes this man was standing in front of a very angry boy who lived few experienced a pain free encounter with the look that was currently residing in the emerald eyes sirius held his breath elizabeth wails had turned into sobs as she tried to keep her small lungs taking in air without another word burke transferred elizabeth to harry her small arms immediately tightening around his neck harry stepped back and made his way over to hermione who bundled elizabeth up in her arms trying to calm the distraught child down tears streaming down her own face as her heart rate slowed fractionally once he knew elizabeth was safe harry moved to stand by sirius who while his wand was still trained on burke looked torn as to whether or not to stay where he was or to go to hermione remus stepped away from the door and took his place next to tonks the aurors looked at their team leader and burke gave a curt nod before walking out of the room if the minister wanted this child he can come and get her himself o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry watched as sirius and hermione hurried around their chambers packing up items elizabeth was asleep in hermione arms as her mother packed up her clothes remus was the only other person in the room standing vigilantly at the door hermione let me no but hermione looked up at harry her chocolate eyes rimmed in red i can t harry harry nodded noting the glance that sirius sent his wife since harry had handed elizabeth back to hermione the only person she let take her daughter from her was sirius where are you going to go harry asked helping hermione by shrinking elizabeth cot sirius glanced at remus who gave a small nod remus and tonks for now the door opened and four wands were raised then lowered as dumbledore walked into the room trailed by snape immediately sirius moved to the headmaster how did they get in he snapped what happened to hogwarts being safe i am sorry sirius hermione i can assure you they will not be allowed back in you do not need to leave sirius glared and stepped back to resume packing we re not staying here they know where we are so you re running then snape asked smirking always were good at that werentyou black running from your problems sirius already on edge didntreply he merely strode up to the potions master grabbed him by the collar of his robes and dragged him to the door throwing him unceremoniously out into the corridor before stepping back inside and closing the door behind him always wanted to do that he murmured to no one in particular as he resumed the task at hand o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks glanced down at graham currently an occupant of one of madame pomfrey beds thank you tonks murmured graham gave a shaky smile it didntreally help though tonks shrugged you tried thank you and besides burke isntknown as the most logical auror out there graham gave a dry chuckle before becoming sober again no one else was hurt what about elizabeth tonks shook her head ginny leapt out of bed probably not the most brilliant idea her family with her now graham looked slightly confused arthur daughter what happened tonks smiled slightly and patted graham on the shoulder madame pomfrey will look after you she said stepping back i ll come back later turning to draco who had just been checked over by madame pomfrey tonks motioned him to follow we need to check outside the grounds if sirius and hermione want to leave they ll have to apparate and i dontthink running into more aurors is the best what about the floo tonks shook her head we disconnected the floo after the attack on harry and ginny the network was under the name john so hopefully they wontbe able to trace the old records to us draco nodded as the pair exited the castle through the large entrance hall doors o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius shrunk the last of the trunks down and pocketed it before turning to hermione who was holding elizabeth close ready he asked quietly hermione nodded as sirius slipped his hand through hers and led her towards the door harry and remus following the group walked in silence down the corridors in the back of hermione mind she noted the absence of the students that occupied the castle harry apparently noticed this too where is everyone approaching footsteps brought the four to a stop as tonks and draco rounded the corner tonks was shaking her head as she neared the group there are two teams patrolling outside the grounds they dontwant you leaving sirius mumbled something that sounded rather like an obscenity before turning on his heal hermione following her hand still clasped in his sirius hermione asked as he led her outside near the herbology classrooms give elizabeth to harry hermione he murmured as he unlocked the shed with his wand where he kept his bike what hermione asked holding elizabeth closer to herself sirius turned to her his grey eyes soft as he reached up to cup her cheek he can apparate her straight to remus we ll go over the lake take the long way hermione glanced at sirius bike battling with herself on whether or not to take elizabeth with her hermione harry said softly from the side i wontlet anything happen to her but hermione eyes filled with tears again she glanced down at elizabeth who was still sleeping sirius arm settled comfortable around her waist as he pulled her close his other hand resting lightly on elizabeth head come on hermione it ll be ok sirius murmured hermione glanced up at sirius before turning to harry i wontlet her out of my sight i promise hermione nodded mutely and gently handed her sleeping daughter over to harry harry made sure elizabeth was secure before turning back to sirius and hermione i ll see you soon sirius nodded and harry turned on the spot and disappeared with a crack sirius turned back to remus tonks and draco we ll find out what we can padfoot remus said answering the unasked question sirius nodded and swung his leg over his bike hermione climbing on behind him wait hermione turned as draco walked up to her pulling the small box he d been carrying into the hospital wing out of his robes this is for elizabeth there a note in there with it draco said handing the box over to hermione thank you draco draco nodded and stepped back as sirius started the bike remus stepping up and performing a disillusion charm on the pair and the bike be safe he murmured to his friends before the bike headed down the hill then up into the air as sirius and hermione started making their way across the lake the trio headed inside and draco split from tonks and remus i going to go and see ginny and the others let them know what going on tonks nodded i should really head over to the ministry see if i can find out who tipped them off draco shook his head as he walked off you have something to tell remus tonks he called as he disappeared around the corner tonks froze she d actually forgotten looking up at remus who was looking back down at her his amber eyes curious she tried to figure out a way of telling him oh bollocks she exclaimed before taking a deep breath remus um maybe you should sit down she suggested taking his hand in hers remus raised an eyebrow as there were no chairs in sight i fine tonks his eyebrows then furrowed in concern what did poppy say he asked realising he hadnthad a chance to speak to tonks about her exam tonks took another deep breath my hair will go back to normal eventually remus nodded ok he said slowly any idea when eventually will be just under eight months in her mind tonks winced she needed to get from point a to point b and was taking the long way round ok remus repeated sounding slightly unsure at what tonks was telling him it would be about nine months in total tonks said her path from a to b looking more and more like a worm tonks let this new bit of information sink into remus head before she continued and i ll need to take some time off work remus frowned tonks just tell me or should i go and ask draco tonks shook her head and sighed i pregnant remus blinked tonks stomach did an uncomfortable flip as remus expression remained blank almost lost remus she asked quietly say something slowly remus mouth formed a smile as the news sunk in a baby he asked in a soft whisper tonks nodded and smiled and the next thing she new she was in a bone crushing hug from her fianc o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the sun had already fallen from the sky as sirius and hermione wound their way through the snakelike streets of a small town the street lights lighting up the moist road like daggers through the tar this was the last town the last point of muggle civilization before the windy road to elizabeth then as quick as it had come the town was gone replaced by tall trees lining the roadside trees that surrounded remus and tonks house trees that enclosed elizabeth in a leafy veil of safety sirius felt hermione grip tighten as the minutes drew out she like him could feel the magical pull towards their daughter sirius slowed suddenly his mind elsewhere he almost missed the small driveway between the trees turning in a wide arch he steered the bike down the last few kilometres to the small house hidden in the trees the only sign of inhabitance was the pale glow of a light from one of the upstairs bedrooms as sirius slowed the bike to a stop hermione glanced up at the golden light a shadow moving in front of the window to investigate the source of the low purr outside sirius slipped his hand in hermione and headed towards the door muttering a series of unlocking charms before the door swung open sirius led hermione up the stairs meeting harry at the door to the room emitting the warm light she still sleeping he whispered as hermione made her way past him and over to the transfigured cot sirius sent harry a soft smile thanks mate harry nodded and returned the smile before heading off to one of the other small rooms for some much needed rest hermione glanced up as sirius gently shut the door behind him and made his way over to her wrapping his arms around her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder as he gazed down at the sleeping form wrapped snugly in a pale pink blanket what are we going to do sirius hermione asked quietly sirius didntanswer sirius didntknow o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o daily prophet 3rd march 2000 child found in a breaking interview this morning it has been announced that the black haired blue eyed child has been found the minister was glad to inform the press on this breakthrough even if it did come with bad news the child was positively identified late yesterday afternoon after an attempt made by the ministry to take her into custody one official stated that attempt was thwarted and for the time being her location is unknown to the ministry it has been confirmed that the child in the prophecy is elizabeth rosalyn black now one year old and the daughter of hogwarts professors sirius and hermione black also known throughout the wizarding community as harry potters godfather and best friend it has also become clear that a small group of wizards and witches close to the couple including ministry workers and harry potter alleviated the attempts of the team of aurors in bringing the child to safety if anyone has any information on the location of sirius or hermione black and their daughter they are urged to contact the ministry as soon as possible o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer not mine damn dedicated to rainyndawn just because she is awesome o o o o o o o o o o o o

asleep when nonsensical babblings brought her from her slumber rain was falling against the cool glass of the window and the air was cold as hermione rolled over to glance at sirius mongs give proony back his chocolate hermione grinned as sirius fell silent again small frown lines appearing between his eyes jim you know what remmie gets like without his daily dose of chocolate jim james prongs sirius rolled over suddenly and hit the floor with a thud hermione stifled a giggle ow hermione maneuvered over to the side of the bed and looked over the edge at a now awake sirius are you alright hermione asked grinning down at the black haired wizard who had closed his eyes again it cold it quite warm up here hermione replied with a grin is that so without waiting for a reply or opening his eyes sirius reached up and yanked on the duvet bringing it and hermione down on top of him the latter giving a small shriek of surprise as she fell to the floor much better sirius commented smiling as he wrapped his arms around hermione he opened his grey eyes to be met with amused chocolate ones looking down at him morning love good morning and as much as i love being in your arms the bed is more comfortable than the floor i dontknow the floor was pretty comfortable last week hermione cheeks turned slightly red at the memory causing sirius to chuckle and pull his wife down for a kiss which before long had wiped the embarrassment from hermione head just the embarrassment mind getting caught in the moment sirius rolled hermione over his lips not leaving hers for a moment as the couple became more passionate breathing heavily sirius broke the kiss and grinned down at a confused hermione i think we have an audience leaning forward to look over sirius shoulder hermione caught sight of elizabeth standing in her crib her small hands grasping the bars in support smiling hermione lay back down her head colliding with the floor ow sirius smiled down at hermione and gave her a quick kiss on the nose before untangling himself from the duvet and moving over to elizabeth i ok hermione started pulling herself up i dontneed any help getting up or anything thanks for asking sirius with elizabeth now in his arms grinned back at the slightly disgruntled hermione who wrapped herself in a robe and glanced out the window the morning sun blackened out by the dark clouds what were you dreaming about hermione asked with a smirk as she wandered up to sirius and elizabeth sirius cocked an eyebrow and eyed hermione suspiciously nothing o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the minister looked around the darkened room lit only by a few candles no one dared meet his eyes what do we have on the blacks he asked the room his voice echoing in the silence no one answered well sir a strawberry blonde wizard with wire framed glasses answered hesitantly its just that well we cantgo up against mister black because he was wrongly imprisoned for twelve years and umm not what you would say adequately reimbursed for that mistake tomkinson frowned fine what about the wife then this time the strawberry blonde wizard stayed quiet waiting for someone else to speak up a witch with long dark curls answered instead there nothing that we know of an incident with an unknown spell that sent her back in time can we use that the minister interrupted did she break any of the laws the witch shook her head not that we are aware of the minister huffed what else there is nothing else they both helped harry potter in you know who downfall the minister was silent and the rest of the room waited for his response sir yes the minister looked down to the end of the table where a young trainee was sitting what about drawing them out by using the ones closest to them o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks fidgeted as the ministry elevator took her to her floor she was in her deep red auror robes her long black hair cascaded down her back and her wand clutched tightly in her hand hidden amongst the folds of her robes her violet eyes flickered to the small lights illuminating the numbers of each floor each flash brining her closer to one of two things the answer to who told the minister about elizabeth or ministry officials ready to apprehend her as the elevator doors opened at her floor tonks stepped out carefully and made her way slowly down the hall tonks tonks spun around at the sound of her name her hand clasping her wand tighter merlin stu dont do that sorry umm i just wanted to ask why a band of the ministers men were at your desk what shhhh tonks violet eyes flashed dangerously as she spun on her heel entering the room that housed her team desks tonks spotted the officials in deep blue robes gathered around and rifling through her papers members of her own team and others were watching the proceedings with curiosity striding up to them the petite aurors voice lifted across the chatter of the room what do you think you are doing the blue robed officials jumped back hastily before recognizing tonks as the auror they had been sent to retrieve auror tonks yes and what may i ask gives you the right to search through my things this question was ignored as three of the wizards stepped towards her tonks took two steps back auror tonks you have been asked to accompany us to the minister tonks glared up at the tall dark hared man with a grotesque moustache on what grounds for withholding important information throughout the course of an ongoing investigation tonks glared but had no reply tonks tonks turned back to stu who had followed her into the room looking around the rest of her team wore expressions of shock bringing her gaze back to the men in front of her tonks raised an eyebrow i guess i ll be going to see the man we all bow down to and call minister then without another word tonks spun on her heel and started to stride out of the room the officials following close behind o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry and draco exchanged a glance they d turned up at their daily training hoping news of their involvement in yesterdays events hadntbeen made public for the public part draco himself was still in the dark however their team leader a broad shouldered wizard who liked to be called mac was not considered to be part of the public and had been sent a very interesting owl from the minister the previous evening he was not happy i have to say that i am not happy with you two the large muscular auror trainer glanced at harry boy who lived or not you should have reported this information if not to the investigating aurors to me at least neither harry nor draco replied mac sighed very well the minister has requested to see you i expect you to go there immediately dismissed o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o where harry sirius looked up as hermione walked into the small kitchen with elizabeth in her arms holding up a piece of parchment that had been left on the table sirius answered gone to the ministry with draco to see if they can figure anything out looks like it just us for now hermione glanced down at elizabeth who was attempting to crawl out of her mother arms ok ok down you go hermione placed the squirming child on the floor and watched her begin to crawl around and amuse herself so sirius started as hermione looked back up at him so hermione repeated moving to sit at the small table sirius following suit and pulled his chair closer to hers do you think we ll be safe here sirius asked shocking hermione slightly you dontthink we will he voice had risen slightly higher than normal sirius shook his head and smiled slightly i didntsay that i just want you to feel safe hermione let out her breath oh well then yes for now i do feel safe good silence descended throughout the room sirius was watching hermione with concern he could almost see the clogs in her head turning as she tried to get her mind around the situation hermione was watching elizabeth as the black haired child pulled herself up to her feet and maneuvered around the small coffee table in the lounge off to the side tap tap tap hermione and sirius both jumped at the noise while elizabeth eyes lit up at the sight of the snowy owl at the window sirius stood and went to the window to let hedwig in out of the rain the white owl flew into the room shaking the water from her feathers in the process and placed a letter and a copy of the daily prophet on the kitchen table in front of hermione sirius sat down again beside her and opened the letter from remus while hermione opened the daily prophet she read the headline and blanched o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks and the wizards escorting her met up with harry and draco half way to the ministers office they nodded at each other and remained silent for the rest of the journey curious faces watching the group as they passed as they entered the large doors of the ministers office all three pairs of eyes fell on the two people sitting nervously in the chairs placed along the wall tonks frowned draco grey eyes were astonished at the sight and harry well harry emerald eyes hardened in anger at the sight in front of him the minister had gone too far bringing these two people in o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer just had an awesome week away didnt even get drunk enough to believe i owned harry potter o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 18 wildflower o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o snuffles stay put dumbledore is on his way to the ministry moony sirius frowned down at the obscure note that remus had sent with hedwig turning to hermione sirius opened his mouth to voice his confusion before he could say anything hermione stood suddenly sending her chair flying to the floor with a clatter as she walked briskly to remus and tonks broom closet the copy of the morning daily prophet was still clutched in her hands and sirius was left sitting at the table with his mouth open and elizabeth on the floor of the small lounge staring wide eyed at her mothers actions sirius stood quickly as hermione grabbed a broom and moved swiftly across the room to prevent her exit hermione sirius started staring confused at the furious witch in front of him what are you doing going to the ministry sirius stared down at hermione for a moment her words slowly sinking in what he yelled his shout making elizabeth jump slightly hermione didntsay anything further but handed sirius the newspaper that was bunched up in her hand sirius took the paper without his eyes leaving hermione face once he was sure she wasntgoing to take off out of the house he lowered his eyes to the front page muggle parents brought in for questioning o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o mr and mrs granger harry asked walking swiftly up to the worried couple sitting in the chairs draco and tonks on his heels at the sound of harry familiar voice hermione parents stood and turned harry anne started her eyes rimmed red they they said hermione missing they dontknow where she is did they force you here harry asked glaring at the ministry officials outside tomkinsons office the smaller of the two ducking through the large wooden doors john frowned at harry in confusion no we came willingly they said that hermione was missing along with sirius and elizabeth we wanted to help come on harry started gently taking hold of anne grangers arm and leading her out of the room i taking you home i dontthink so harry harry stopped and turned towards the minister who had just emerged from his office you have been requested to see me and the grangers came willingly they will stay till i have spoken to them no harry snapped they came willingly under false pretences i taking them home you can talk to me all you want later the ministers eyes hardened mister potter you are to remain here you have no authority to pick and choose where you go should the need arise while you are employed by the ministry i am not going to leave hermione parents here for you to use them to get to their daughter out of the corner of his eye he saw draco and tonks move behind him harry what going on harry turned to anne granger who was getting rather frustrated at what was occurring the ministry seemed concerned for her daughters safety whereas her friends felt it better that they leave hermione fine harry murmured you dontneed to speak to anyone you dontknow hermione parents relaxed slightly and harry began to move towards the exit once more mister potter you are not to leave the ministry premises till i have spoken to you and he will not i can assure you of that minister harry turned to the door where dumbledore stood and relaxed somewhat i will escort the grangers home and give them the correct information minister you are free to talk to your employees tomkinson seemed torn he now had no right to hold the two muggles who both seemed less than willing to cooperate than they had when first brought in nodding curtly to the aging headmaster the minister turned to auror tonks and his two top trainees beckoning for them to follow the potter boy waited till the grangers were out of the room before he stepped through the doors to his office o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the combination of the crash of hermione chair sirius shout and the fact that her parents seemed to have forgotten about her caused elizabeth to attempt remedy her current situation and promptly burst into tears sirius looked up from the paper dontmove he told hermione as he moved to sweep elizabeth up in his arms and attempt to calm her down remus sent a note with the paper he explained over elizabeth sobs as she began to quieten slightly dumbledore gone to the ministry your mum and dad will be ok the ministry has no right to keep them against their will the ministry has no right to bring them in in the first place hermione said through clenched teeth no they don t sirius agreed but you wonthelp matters by storming in there and telling that to the ministers face we arentalone in this hermione hermione shoulders lost their tension and she glanced down at the broom in her hands before sitting shakily on the two seater couch sirius looked down at elizabeth who was placidly watching him with red rimmed eyes her cheeks covered in small tear tracks pleased with his success at calming one of the females in the house sirius sat beside his wife placing elizabeth on his lap and slipping an arm around hermione shoulders and pulling her closer it ll be ok he murmured we ll just wait for an owl from dumbledore o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry tonks and draco all stood in front of the ministers desk none of the three sitting on the chairs offered to them the minister moved around to the other side of his desk and eyed the trio before taking a seat and clasping his hands together i have to say i disappointed in the three of you especially you auror tonks he remarked glancing at the witch wondering momentarily why her hair was long and black instead of the vibrant cropped colours he normally associated her with you knew who the child was in the prophecy and where she was to be found yet you did not inform the investigating auror teams or myself the minister paused to see if any of them would say anything but none seemed to think they needed to explain their actions to the minister this will not go unpunished auror tonks i suspending you till further notice you will clear your desk and inform stewart that he is in charge of your team for the time being again the minister paused and was surprised to actually see a flicker of relief wash over tonks face he assumed she d expected worse punishment mister malfoy you will not sit your auror exams next month and will wait till next years exams the blonde frowned and his grey eyes hardened but he did not say anything mister potter you will also not sit your auror exams next month and will be able to sit them later on in the year no the minister looked up in surprise first for the fact that one of them had spoken secondly for what had been said would you care to elaborate further mister potter if i am not to sit the coming exams i will not sit them till next year i will not sit a special exam just so you can finally have me working for you tomkinsons eyes widened at the last remark before he narrowed them mister potter as much as your ego might assume the ministry is not as eager to have you fully trained as you think is that a fact harry asked in that case allow draco to sit his exams later on in the year as well if you dontpush mine back or bring his forward i ll walk out of here and never have anything to do with the ministry again tonks and draco exchanged glances both knew harry strong ambition to become an auror and immediately assumed he was bluffing either way the minister didntgive harry a chance to make his choice the minister glanced at draco and nodded very well you can both sit your exams in october until then you will attend training as per usual but will follow a slightly different regime auror tonks i will inform you by owl when you will be able to return to work until then your pay will be terminated tonks violet eyes didntchange from their hardened stare and draco and harry both looked at each other knowing what was to come next i am assuming tomkinson began that you are not going to inform me of the whereabouts of sirius black hermione granger or look draco interrupted speaking for the first time they have been married for almost two years show some respect the minister glared or their daughter he asked continuing and ignoring draco no one spoke and the minister sighed very well you may leave i have a question tonks stated speaking for the first time since entering the room who told you the minister immediately new what tonks was asking and smiled slightly you are not privy to that information at this time tonks glared her eyes flashing dangerously and tomkinson glanced to the guards at the door i will find out who the snivelling little snitch was tonks stated and you better find adequate protection for them when i do with that tonks spun on her heel and left the room her ruby auror robes billowing around her ankles as harry and draco followed her o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius looked down at hermione she was curled in a ball on the couch her legs draped over his as she slept he d put elizabeth down for her afternoon sleep half an hour ago and returned to find hermione in the same position as her daughter a gently tapping on the window brought his gaze up from his wife face and he quietly stood to let the hogwarts owl into the room taking the note sirius gave the owl a treat before it flew off its ok sirius whispered to himself as he watched the bird fly out of sight its not like i wanted to reply or anything he muttered before glancing down at the note opening it he was relived to see dumbledore elegant script snuffles and company the problem has been sorted without incident and the parties involved have been informed of your wellbeing and whereabouts they send their love and hope for your safety as well all do yours ad sirius smiled and moved to crouch next to the couch hermione was on reaching over he gently shook her shoulder hermione sweetheart wake up hermione eyes flickered open to be confronted by sirius soft grey eyes and gentle smile mum and dad hermione asked sitting up slowly while blinking away sleep sirius handed her the note from dumbledore watching her as her chocolate eyes absorbed the information and the remaining tension in her muscles relax sirius smiled at hermione as she looked up at him i guess i should have thought things through huh she asked a little ashamed of her earlier actions its alright i probably would have done the same thing if it were you or elizabeth my parents however would be another matter entirely hermione chuckled and shook her head smiling at sirius attempt to lighten the mood o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry walked alongside draco as they followed tonks having offered to help her with her stuff draco had a small smile on his face the same smile that he had seen flicker momentarily across tonks face as they had left the ministers office am i missing something harry asked the pair we have to wait another seven months before we can sit our exams and tonks just got suspended for merlin knows how long and you two felt the need to find something about the situation worthy of a smile tonks paused and fell into step on the other side of harry the minister just did remus and i a favour how so harry asked confused as to why suspending tonks without pay would be a favour to her and remus i needed to take some time off and with the current laws i would have rather the officials not known why tonks explained as draco shot her an exasperated glance the metamorphmagus really did have trouble just spitting out the relevant information i guessing that these current laws have something to do with remus harry asked glancing down at the slightly shorter witch beside him tonks nodded under the current law werewolves are not allowed to have children though i think the law is worded slightly differently to that something to do with the feral breeding of unwanted beasts that that umbridge woman wormed into the bloody laws harry glanced at draco as tonks explanation went off on a tangent the small smile on the blondes face and the slight nod he gave harry was the all the answer the young man needed congratulations tonks he said interrupting her tirade of verbal abuse towards umbridge what oh thanks tonks answered a warm smile gracing her features as the thought of umbridge was overtaken by her child i thought the laws were being changed harry asked as the group slipped into an empty elevator tonks pushing the small button for her floor they are most of the steps have been completed thanks to the ministers apparent lack of prejudice they just need final approval after that remus and i should be fine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the daily prophet 7th march 2000 werewolf rights abandoned in a shock announcement the plans for allowing the expansion of werewolf rights has been put aside by the minister himself known for his lack of prejudices the ministers intentions are at the moment unknown the law that was to be passed in the coming months included allowing registered werewolves the right to work for the ministry the right to marry a willing partner and to have children the wizarding community is torn with this information with many glad to see the possible laws abandoned and just as many shocked and outraged after all the apparent progress this announcement has come in the wake of last weeks discovery of the identity of the child from the prophecy as of yet the minister has no comment on the progress of the search for sirius and hermione black o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius glanced around the small lounge as he entered from the hall the morning sun was rising giving the room a soft glow the birds chirping from the trees outside and the running of the shower upstairs were the only sounds to break the stillness of the morning ignoring the growing pile of unread daily prophets collecting dust in the corner sirius headed for the kitchen to begin breakfast he and hermione had come to a mutual decision not to read the prophet and managed to obtain the relevant pieces of information from the others sirius himself was still furious at tonks news that the new werewolf rights had been abandoned believing that remus and tonks chance for happiness had just been pushed aside for his not able to voice his concerns to his friends through the risk of the letters being intercepted on the way back to hogwarts sirius bottled the anger up intending to use it at a relevant point in time preferably towards the minister if it ever came to that using his wand to quickly cook the bacon and eggs setting them aside with a warming spell sirius set out two plates and glasses along with a pitcher of orange juice the sounds of the water ceasing upstairs made sirius smile though the situation they were in was not the ideal hiding from the ministry now with hermione and elizabeth was a far cry better than when he spent the majority of a year as a dog hermione walked into the room wearing a pair of faded muggle jeans and a soft white cardigan her curls were wet and hung in long strands down her back glancing up at sirius when she walked in she noticed the small smile gracing his lips good morning she greeted what got you in such a good mood i cantbe in a good mood sirius asked slipping a hand around hermione waist and stepping closer i didntsay that i was just curious i heard you coming sirius murmured i couldnthelp but smile a faint blush graced hermione cheeks as sirius lowered his lips to hers for a soft kiss a soft giggle followed by a raspberry and more giggling interrupted sirius and hermione pulling back sirius smile widened and he gave hermione a quick kiss on the nose before spinning on his heel and running up the stairs oh right hermione called after him grinning go when she happy not screaming her lungs out sirius grinned at hermione remark as he entered their room where they had placed elizabeth cot the black haired one year old was standing up holding onto the bars for support and she broke into a wide grin when she saw sirius enter the room good morning munchkin did you have a good sleep dada up elizabeth held out her arms and sirius stooped to pick her up come on then let go see mummy sirius said in a low voice upon re entering the kitchen he noticed hermione had a small bowl of weetbix with mashed bananas on top set on elizabeth high chair setting the blue eyed child down sirius sat opposite hermione and eyed his breakfast along with the bacon and eggs that he had already prepared hermione had placed a couple of boxes of cereal on the table fresh fruit and toast grinning at how well hermione knew him or his appetite at least sirius began to eat his breakfast while watching elizabeth with amusement she had almost mastered feeding herself that is most of the food actually made it into her mouth these days as she enjoyed her breakfast humming quietly to herself sirius turned to face hermione and sent her a crooked smile you know what elizabeth reminds me of he asked pointing his fork in the general direction of his daughter hermione raised an eyebrow at the what in the sentence and waited for sirius to continue a sponge a sponge yes sirius answered a thoughtful expression on his face as hermione raised her glass of juice to her lips she absorbs basically anything edible and it just passes straight through her and out the other end hermione choked and spluttered as her orange juice got caught in her throat at sirius explanation coughing to regain her breath hermione glanced from elizabeth to sirius are you ok sirius asked with a grin hermione nodded her eyes watering slightly elizabeth had paused in her consumption of her food and after glancing up curiously at her mother proceeded to reach out for a piece of sirius bacon breaking off a small portion and handing it to her sirius turned back to hermione if she is like a sponge like you say hermione began coughing intermittently she gets that from you she stated casting her chocolate eyes down to the food in front of sirius and for relating our daughter to a sponge you can have the honour of changing her next the grin on sirius face morphed into a grimace as he glanced at the remnants of weetbix and banana on elizabeth high chair o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o two weeks after the incident in the hospital wing remus entered his chambers warily after a hectic day of classes tonks and graham the latter having been discharged earlier on in the week by madame pomfrey had been covering for sirius looking up he noticed a red headed female sitting on his couch ginny he exclaimed when did you get out of the hospital wing ginny smiled earlier today i had no one else to see harry still at training and hermione well i cantvery well go and visit her by myself well not at the moment remus answered sitting down next to her on the couch i sure you ll be able to visit soon i dontthink i want to risk it ginny replied a worried look on her face i cantimagine what the ministry would do to elizabeth if they found her or sirius and hermione remus added give the minister long enough and the charges will lead to possible imprisonment in azakaban ginny shook her head and glared not at the werewolf but at the possibility he had presented they cant do that not after what hermione did to help harry or the fact that sirius already spent twelve years there as an innocent man remus shrugged they want elizabeth and i dontthink they worry about who they hurt to get to her ginny eyes softened i sorry about the new laws not being passed remus i know you and tonks were relying on them somewhat remus shrugged and offered the redhead a crooked grin you know tonks she doesntcare what the laws say she ll do what she wants o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the daily prophet 20th march 2000 ministry reports on investigation of elizabeth rosalyn black late last night the minister for magic robert tomkinson issued a report on the ongoing investigation of the prophesized child elizabeth black though progress is slow going the minister has recently issued a protocol allowing him to intercept any owls entering or leaving hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry when questioned about this move the minister explained to the press that the majority of the black allies were either housed or working at the school and would be the most likely to involuntary lead officials to the couple now that they have been cut off from friends and family the minister hopes they find it in them to bring their child into the ministry where she can be kept safe o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o what are we doing just sitting around for this question was posed by a dark robbed figure in a small room with his companions it had been almost a month since the ministry had worked out what the remaining death eaters already knew about elizabeth they were now no closer to taking the child from her parents than they had been when she was at hogwarts and it seemed the ministry had a snitch on their side someone who knew the blacks we are looking came a female voice its like searching for a needle in a haystack the blacks do not want to be found therefore the likelihood of them being found is highly remote what do you propose we keep looking but we have a better chance of taking the girl from the ministry than her parents i say we wait till the ministry finds her then make our move o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o how are sirius and hermione faring dumbledore looked up from his meal to raise an eyebrow at snape beside him to his left he felt remus eyes also flicker to the potions master they are fine severus it was nice of you to ask it was not for my benefit headmaster i am merely getting rather tired of students pestering me on the wellbeing of their transfiguration professor remus eyed the greasy haired man suspiciously snape hadntbeen informed of where sirius and hermione were and his trust in the wizard had dropped considerably since he learnt that he had given voldemort the prophecy concerning harry i am also curious snape continued either unaware of or ignoring remus glare how you are able to contact them since the minister is watching the owls and the floo i have my ways severus you of all people should know this dumbledore eyes twinkled as he continued i ll make sure to pass on your concerns next time i contact them slightly put out snape turned back to his meal o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius was woken by the chirping of the birds as the warm spring sun tried to find its way through the heavy drapes groaning and muttering about going bird hunting later sirius rolled over and pulled the covers over his head for the past month they had been at remus and tonks the only days he had not been woken by those blasted birds was if it were raining or if elizabeth beat the feathered fiends to it his movements disturbed hermione who had begun to grow accustomed to sleeping in opening her chocolate eyes slightly she spied sirius pulling the covers over his head in a vain attempt to drown out the birdsong grinning she ducked under the covers to join him creeping slowly forward she placed her lips just over his ear and blew gently a soft whistle emitting from her lips if you keep that up i ll be hunting more than birds later sirius mumbled as hermione tried not to laugh and regained her composure to whistle again in his ear growling sirius rolled over and pinned hermione to the bed groggily opening his eyes sirius glared down at her momentarily before slumping down on top of her earning himself a soft oof getting comfortable sirius found himself relaxing again you re heavy hermione stated from beneath him no response sirius mmhhmm i ll start whistling again i wontmove as if reading her mind sirius reached out slowly keeping his eyes closed and held hermione arms at her side to prevent any chance of her going for her wand sirius mmmhhhmm as much as i love being this close to you do you know how much you weigh i dontexactly go around sitting on myself do i hermione rolled her eyes at the wizard still sprawled over her and looking rather comfortable take my word for it you re heavy sirius opened his eyes and looked up at hermione now that not very nice i dontgo around calling you fat hermione grinned yes that because you like your manhood too much which at this moment doesntlook like it got that long to live sirius got the message and after paling slightly rolled off to the side taking advantage of her newfound freedom hermione snuggled into sirius side resting her head on his shoulder as he pulled her closer breathing in her scent and forgetting the threat to his nether regions i like it here he murmured but you miss everyone hermione answered knowing what was on his mind the mood of the room chilling slightly mhmm sirius shifted slightly that and i dontlike hiding or running for that matter i think i ve done enough for two lifetimes hermione lifted her head and looked down at sirius he had a slight haunted expression on his face which he tried to hide with a smile when she looked up at him tracing her finger along the side of his face her eyes following her movements from a pale scar from his time in azkaban down to a scar on his chin he d picked up during the final battle we ll find a way through this she whispered resting her head down on his chest again as he stroked a hand through her curls unbeknown to each other both sent their eyes in the direction of elizabeth cot and both knew then there was no way they would risk their happiness and freedom if it meant loosing her o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione wandered down the stairs later on that morning dressed in a flowing full length skirt and a white singlet intent on enjoying the day sun elizabeth in her arms was also dressed for a day out in a small pink dress with a matching hat sirius she called entering the small lounge before noticing the small note on the desk taking the dog for a walk hermione smiled and shook her head before grabbing a book elizabeth play mat and bag of toys before heading out into the sun o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius made his way back to the small cottage as padfoot his canine nose guiding him in the correct direction he d adequately run off a fair amount of energy charging through the underbrush startling a number of birds which he managed to prevent himself from leaping at and through a number of cool streams he now trotted at a leisurely pace back to the small cottage his ears perking up when he heard hermione voice followed by elizabeth giggling and answer in her own gibberish a few discernable words mixed in changing back to his human form sirius made his way quietly through the trees smiling when he spotted hermione sitting on elizabeth small blanked holding the blue eyed child in a standing position keen on getting the little tot walking at an early age looking around sirius noted some wildflowers growing around the edge of the trees stooping he started gathering a handful adding to the assortment of pinks and yellows the odd fern for greenery smiling at his success sirius stood and made his way back through the trees he noted hermione hand resting on her wand and her eyes alert as he drew near before relaxing slightly seeing him come out of the trees hand behind his back did you have a nice walk hermione asked as he approached brilliant sirius smiled and crouched down next to his family bringing his hand around from behind his back and presenting hermione with the wildflowers for you he said smiling at her surprised reaction oh sirius thank you they re beautiful hermione took the impromptu bouquet from sirius sirius attention was drawn away from hermione when elizabeth pulled herself up her small hands supporting herself on his knees as she looked up at him with a slightly expectant expression hello munchkin he greeted with a smile before bringing a single buttercup around and presenting her with it her bright blue eyes fell on the flower which she took in her small fist before falling backwards in a sitting position her eyes on the gift smiling sirius looked back at hermione who was observing the scene with a warm smile of her own i going to go and put these in water she announced standing and leaving sirius with elizabeth sirius shifted from his crouched position onto elizabeth play mat lying down beside her on his side resting his weight on one elbow as he crept his fingers in a spider like fashion towards elizabeth small toes noting the movement out of the corner of her eye elizabeth attention shifted from her flower to the fingers as they neared she tried to pull her feet back glaring accusingly at her father before attempting to slap his hand away bad she stated her small hands hitting his sirius chuckled and stopped annoying her pleased with her success elizabeth sent her attention back to her flower hermione returned and sat back down on the other side of elizabeth what have you got there sweetie she asked elizabeth looked up at her mother and held out the flower showing it off before bringing it back to a safe point close to her small body flower hermione said slowly elizabeth looked down at the object in her hands and back up at hermione fower sirius chuckled causing elizabeth to look over at him and smile fower she stated passing him back the buttercup daddy fower sirius took the flower with a smile as elizabeth crawled over to hermione up she asked hermione lifted elizabeth up slightly and grinning at sirius turned elizabeth around to face him placing the child on her feet do you want to go to daddy she asked dady sirius grinned at his daughter enthusiasm to get to him sitting up slightly ready to catch her if she fell sirius waited to see what she would do next they had done this activity before usually once hermione let go of elizabeth she d fall to her knees and crawl straight to sirius this time however was different elizabeth looked down at her feet once hermione had let her go as if wondering what to do next slowly much to hermione delight she put one foot in front of the other perking up at this sirius sat up straighter that it come to daddy elizabeth grinned as she quickened her pace walking at first then falling into sirius arms where she found herself wrapped in a big hug well done munchkin sirius praised grinning over her head at hermione who had her own grin to match o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the daily prophet april 6th 2000 malfoy manor searched in a surprise search late yesterday afternoon ministry officials and aurors descended upon the newly renovated malfoy manor for the possibility of the blacks being there draco malfoy the only remaining malfoy after his fathers death in the final battle and his mother subsequent suicide was reported to be furious at the raid which turned out to be unsuccessful and is looking at laying charges for the invasion along with the malfoy manor being searched all known properties of sirius black and his friends are being searched o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione sighed and ran her hands through her hair she d just been speaking to dumbledore and the news wasntgood after receiving no owls in the last few weeks from their friends or the delivery of the daily prophet the news of draco and sirius properties being searched annoyed her it also worried her what would they do if the ministry worked out that remus and tonks owned a house o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o melanie and her friends walked down the corridors of hogwarts on the way to the library to complete an essay set by tonks on transfiguring inanimate objects into small animals excuse me the three girls turned to look up at a red headed wizard with horn rimmed glasses looking down his nose at them would you know where i could find ginny weasley i was told she was staying here melanie eyed the red head suspiciously neither her nor her friends speaking up one for the fact that they didntknow where ginny weasley was and two well didntyour mother always tell you not to talk to strangers the wizard smiled down at the trio in a somewhat forced way that made melanie more wary i her brother i just visiting surely you would know where she was then melanie said picking up her courage to speak to the stranger the wizard frowned his eyes narrowing you should know where professor lupin was then probably in his class which is where its not where it was when i was head boy the defence against the dark arts class go back the way you came take a left at the portrait of the tigers in tutus and carry on down that corridor till the end you should find the door you need thank you the wizard spun on his heel and strode off in the direction melanie had sent him once he was out of sight her friends spun on her melanie the both gasped out in unison that not the way to professor lupins class samantha finished melanie grinned spun on her heel and linked her arms with her friends dragging them in the direction of the library o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry strode through the corridors of hogwarts his black robes flowing around him as he tried to ignore the stares of the students as he passed he d been at hogwarts now for over three months and he still wasntused to the awe struck stares of the younger wizards and witches turning into the entrance hall he spotted a rather irate red headed wizard and attempted to make a quick escape back the way he came harry cursing under his breath harry turned back around and plastered a curious expression on his face percy what brings you here percy frowned i came to see ginny but it seems i was misdirected by some first years maybe i should say something to dumbledore young witches should learn to respect elder wizards harry frowned at the last remark but grinned inwardly at the intuition of some of the first years meet a stranger send him straight to the exit o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the air was warm and the birdsong soft as a beautiful spring afternoon befell the occupants of remus and tonks small cottage in the woods hermione put a sleeping elizabeth down for an afternoon nap and caught sight of sirius outside though the reason for their presence here was sinister the atmosphere of the past month had done wonders for the family the fresh air and sun was a complete change to what sirius was used to when running from the ministry hermione let out a small sigh as she watched sirius below he was wearing faded jeans that sat low on his hips he had discarded both his heavy black boots and shirt and had opted to clean his bike the muggle way as she smiled at sirius attempt to work out how to turn on the muggle hose which had obviously come with the house when remus had purchased it hermione noted the lack of tension in his shoulders as the warm sun fell on the tanned skin his shoulder length locks of ebony falling around them before he reached into his pocket and pulled out a length of leather and tied them at the nape of his neck as if feeling her eyes on him sirius paused in his actions and glanced up at the window hermione was looking out of seeing her watching him he sent a warm smile and waved holding her eyes for a moment before returning to his task hermione pulled the drapes closed leaving the window open a fraction and headed out of the room sirius had worked out how to use the hose and was busy with a soapy cloth by the time hermione wandered outside most of his bike now covered in a lather of bubbles hermione wandered close to sirius on the lawn then sat on the cool grass choosing to watch sirius rather than help him sirius glanced up and acknowledged her presence with a smile hermione caught the warmth of the smile but also the mischievous glint behind his eyes i should have brought a book hermione murmured to herself readying herself to run should the need arise eyes still on sirius though slightly more warily hermione watched as he picked up the hose to rinse of the lather feeling this was a good time to rise from her position on the ground hermione got to her feet moving over to the other side of the bike hermione eyed sirius they were in a dance one wary the other clearly amused you look a bit hot sirius observed with a grin i fine hermione shot back with a grin to match his own she had positioned herself next to his bucket filled with soapy water and had her wand at her side neatly hidden in the folds of her knee length skirt sirius let the water flow over his bike rinsing away the soft white bubbles leaving trails of white in the green grass underneath hermione caught the quick glance of the grey eyes in her direction and before sirius could even think of moving his wrist to wet her with the hose he had a bucket of soapy water tipped over his head spluttering he wiped the suds from his eyes and glared at hermione who was currently trying to suppress peels of laughter oh ha ha sirius said as suds dripped from the ends of his hair which had come loose from their binding hermione began to laugh at the sight as sirius shook his head like his canine counterpart to rid himself of the suds before hermione knew what was happening an icy blast of water hit her letting out a small scream of surprise she tried to step away from the flow of water but it followed her as well as the sound of sirius chuckles sirius hermione gasped that cold the stream of water stopped and hermione glared sopping wet at sirius who had joined her on her side of the bike you didntthink i d let you get away with that sirius asked with a grin i still a marauder yes hermione answered with a small grin her wand behind her back just remember how long i ve known you sirius looked confused for a moment before getting a face full of water from hermione wand taking his spluttering as a chance to escape hermione made her way further into the small yard sirius on her heels he abandoned the hose and opted instead to chase her his goal to rid her of her wand catching up and grabbing her around the waist sirius spun the struggling hermione in his arms his hand finding her wand and grasping it before she came up with any other ideas both dripping wet and panting hermione tried to free her wand hand but to no avail here i am sirius panted leisurely washing my bike and you come along and proceed to drown me and you werentthinking of doing the same thing hermione asked trying to catch her breath sirius put on a look of complete innocence and cocked his head now would i do something like that to my beautiful wife for no reason yes sirius changed his innocent look to affronted i shocked you think that hermione grinned still trying to get her wand free ha ha she replied still having a firm grip on her wand she attempted to point it in sirius direction before sending another stream of water all this accomplished was sending water into the air and back down onto both of them by now hermione pale blue shirt and skirt were soaked through whereas sirius jeans looked like they were going to slip off with the weight of the water through them seeing as this was accomplishing nothing except making both parties laugh like there was no tomorrow while fighting over control of the wand hermione stopped the stream of water well at least the afternoon was refreshing sirius remarked with a grin noticing just how wet hermione was the water had caused her curls to lengthen and her hair cascade in wet rivulets down her back while her already tight shirt clung to her like a second skin hermione was aware of sirius arm still wrapped around her waist as she was pressed up against his bare chest heat emitting from him through her wet top you can let go now hermione breathed looking up at him through her eyelashes and let you free while i unarmed what do you propose we stay like this forever sirius glanced down with a look of sincerity i wouldntcomplain sirius lowered his head and met hermione lips in a sensual kiss both relaxing their grip on the single wand between them as sirius bundled hermione in closer to him hermione feeling the kiss right down to the tips of her toes pressing closer to sirius warmth her hands flat on his bare chest wand apparently relinquished at some unknown point hermione felt sirius lose his footing on the wet grass and attempted to stay upright as sirius landed on his back with an oof are you ok hermione asked looking down at him with a grin just dandy sirius answered a little annoyed that he d actually caused the interruption of the rather good snogging session letting hermione pull him to his feet sirius resumed his previous position his arms around hermione waist as he gently began to nudge her in the direction of the door his lips finding hers again and somewhat hampering the process of getting inside getting frustrated at having four feet to control hermione it seemed having lost some of her motor functions sirius lifted hermione onto his hips her legs draping around his waist as he walked up the few steps to the small deck before hitting the front door or rather hermione head hitting the front door ow sorry sirius barely gave hermione the time to process the apology before he crushed his lips back to hers while kicking open the door and entering the small lounge leaving behind a trail of water in their wake half way there sirius little toe caught the edge of something hard cursing and almost dropping hermione sirius eyes began to water as hermione muffled her giggles shh she whispered shaking with silent laughter you ll wake elizabeth rather irritated but extremely turned on sirius felt his knees hit the couch and the couple tumbled onto it in a tangle of limbs both pairs of hands busy attempting to get rid of wet clothing hermione fingers ceased at sirius jeans which seemed to have glued themselves to his contours when he tugged her top over her head a hand would be ni ooohh hermione thought trailed off as sirius found her weak spot on her neck causing her to wither beneath him her hands abandoning his jeans and running up his sides attempt one to remove sirius jeans unsuccessful sirius content for now with his jeans or rather oblivious at present time to their hindrance unclasped hermione bra and slid it off her shoulders one hand straying to her breast the other around to the small of her back to press her against him his mouth still hungrily busy with her neck sirius moved his lips back to hermione s a hand now moving to her hair as she tangled her fingers in his own wet locks suddenly noting the painfully growing bulge in his jeans sirius attempted to remove them single handedly attempt two to remove sirius jeans unsuccessful sirius growled low in his throat in aggravation causing hermione to break away from the kiss and raise a questioning eyebrow damn jeans sirius muttered under his breath while grinning wirily down at hermione as he sat up on his knees to remove the aforementioned garment attempt three to remove sirius jeans successful third time a charm hermione murmured as she pulled sirius back down her hands now busy with his boxer shorts sirius own fingers skilfully removing her own undergarments her skirt having ridden up over her waist now appropriately unclad sirius grasped hermione wrists with one hand and held them above her head halting her protests with a smouldering kiss causing hermione to moan and wrap her legs around sirius hips locking them together at the ankle as his spare hand ran the length of her torso a faint murmur passed sirius lips hermione feeling the slight movement on her own before she lost all coherent thought and gasped arching her hips as sirius entered her rolling with his movements her hands still clasped by sirius above her head the pair parted at the lips hermione head arching backwards while sirius bowed his his forehead grazing hermione chin both breathing heavily sirius felt hermione shudder and moan beneath him as she climaxed and met her mouth once again in a passionate kiss as he felt himself peak o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ginny was rather shocked when harry entered their chambers her estranged brother following close behind percy she asked surprised to see him she hadntseen him since the encounter at christmas and the fact that he was here now after not coming while she was in the hospital wing made her slightly suspicious glancing at harry she could see the same thing reflected in his green eyes what are you doing here percy stepped passed harry whose face immediately hardened once the redhead had passed and up to his little sister i came to visit i ve been busy at work i sure you have harry muttered in the background i wanted to see you percy finished either not catching or just ignoring harry remark oh ginny said slightly unsure what to say how are you percy asked taking a seat on the couch ginny following suit and sitting beside him harry decided to sit on the armchair opposite percy sending him his best intimidating stance as possible i fine ginny answered i get a little tired now and then and a few headaches but i ok and you re staying here at hogwarts yes harry answered glaring openly at percy not that it concerns you percy glared back obviously annoyed at harry interrupting the conversation with ginny before turning back to his sister i thought you two would have had a house by now what with harry glory and all ginny glared and stood merlin percy could you be anymore obvious percy looked affronted ginny i afraid i dontunderstand what you mean get out ginny snapped pointing at the door but now percy stood and gave both harry who remained seated with a look of slight glee on his face and ginny a hard look fine just dontcome running to me when the ministry charges you with aiding and abetting criminals out yes percy i sure you already know how to get to the exit harry said from the couch with a grin just remember the tigers in tutus and you should be fine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione stretched languidly on the couch humming to herself in bliss from the lack of babbling or screaming she summarised that elizabeth was still asleep cracking open her eyes when she noted lack of warm body next to hers hermione looked over the edge of the couch in the prospect that sirius may have met another painful fate with the floor she was presented with her discarded shirt and underwear and sirius boxers but no sign of the man himself sitting up and pulling her clothes back on minus her bra after an unsuccessful search hermione made her way back outside missing the disarray and relative moistness of the room she found sirius where she had found him earlier his back turned to her crouched by his bike clad again in his jeans and obviously only his jeans after what she d seen next to the couch he was busy with a rag and polish finishing up his bike his buttocks at risk due to the presence of his wand tucked in his back pocket stepping quietly onto the grass with the intent on surprising him hermione frowned slightly when he looked over his shoulder at her and grinned how do you do that hermione asked stepping up to him her hands on her hips do what he asked grinning up at her grey eyes squinting slightly in the sunlight i can never sneak up on you sirius grinned and took hermione hand lightly pulling her down to his level she sunk to her knees as sirius moved to whisper in her ear i know when you leave a room when you enter a room when you re looking at me and when your trying not to look at me hermione smiled slightly at this confession sirius continuing to whisper pulling back slightly to brush her hair away from her face and looking into her eyes i also know when you re trying to sneak up on me hermione smiled are you almost done she asked indicating to the bike almost do you want to help hermione smile grew sure sirius positioned hermione in front of him his arms wrapping around her one handing her the rag before he rested his hand on top of hers guiding her movements in the back of her mind hermione had a distinctly asian voice instructing wax on wax off wax on wax of o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry and remus looked at one another before grabbing the portkey after a discussion with dumbledore he finally thought it safe enough to visit hermione and sirius and remus and harry had been given the privilege of being the first to go armed with messages from the others both wizards felt the tug of the portkey and momentarily found themselves in remus lounge remus looked around at the sunlit room taking in the discarded array of cushions a relatively wet floor sirius boxers and what he summarised as hermione bra poking our from under the couch i think you should burn your couch harry suggested his green eyes also taking in the odd scene in front of him i think we should both be glad we didntdecide to come any earlier remus said grimacing slightly his lips twitching as he noted harry pale hearing voices from outside the pair went to the front door to investigate sirius and hermione were busy polishing sirius bike sirius had his chin resting on hermione shoulder as he whispered into her ear causing the witch to blush slightly as she worked the chrome in front of her ahem remus interrupted causing a number of events to happen in quick succession hermione and sirius wands were drawn with a flick of the eye while harry and remus both ducked to the ground to avoid the beams of red light shot simultaneously from the wands glancing up from his position on the ground and looking over his shoulder remus noted two new scorch marks on the side of his house brilliant padfoot the werewolf mumbled before turning back surprised to see two wands still trained on him and harry as hermione and sirius came closer sirius remus started what shoot first and ask questions later sirius answered still eyeing the pair with an air of suspicion the only person they had spoken to recently was dumbledore and he hadntgiven them any warning of visitors so start asking questions harry mumbled sitting up slightly and rubbing his ribs sirius wand still trained on the pair stepped between them into the doorway effectively putting himself between remus and harry and elizabeth padfoot remus started put your wand down sirius glanced at hermione who had already lowered her wand obviously happy that the pair were in fact remus and harry and was watching her husband with amusement sirius lowered his wand and put a hand out to help remus up a warning would have been nice moony with the state of my lounge a warning would have been a brilliant idea sirius looked slightly guilty and hermione blushed deep crimson err sorry things kind of umm remus shook his head with a grin at sirius stuttering i believe there are some garments of yours in there you d probably want to put away or on he finished stepping back into the house and through into the kitchen hermione glanced at harry out the corner of her eye and sent him a glare when he smirked at her i going to check on elizabeth sirius stated snatching away the stray garments before heading up the stairs put a shirt on hermione called after him before turning to the lounge to rectify the mess she and sirius had left earlier it good to see you hermione harry said quietly watching her quickly clean the room hermione turned around and smiled at harry walking up to him where he pulled her into a tight hug i missed you he stated clearly hermione pulled back i missed you too you dontknow how good it is to see a different face i hurt sirius stated entering the room with a sleepy looking elizabeth in his arms a black shirt now covering his torso hermione grinned at him and poked out her tongue fine then he stated poking his back we ll just go and see uncle moony wont we munchkin hermione smiled at the retreating pair turning back to harry once they were out of sight what she asked after seeing the small smile on his face you guys are doing well you re happy hermione nodded the situation isntthe best but i think the fresh air has done a world of good for sirius harry nodded smiling i glad o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o daily prophet april 30th 2000 mixed views from wizarding community amidst the prophets ongoing reporting on the prophecy and missing child elizabeth black the paper has received mixed views on the matter from the community a number of irate members of society are in full support of the ministry actions condemning the choice of path made by the blacks and believe the child would be safer in the ministry care others however are in full support of the blacks chosen action believing that if the ministry cantfind the child then neither can the remaining rabble of death eaters many irate that the ministry would even consider taking a child from its parents o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus and ginny were walking slowly down the empty corridors in the late april evening remus had patrol and with harry and draco still at training ginny was bored and had asked if she could join the werewolf i glad they are happy ginny said quietly it makes the whole situation easier to handle knowing they are safe at your place the werewolf murmured his agreement his attention focused on the cold feeling he just got down his spine remus ginny asked what is it remus shook his head nothing i just thought someone was following us o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius stretched and yawned it was an early may morning well into spring summer quick on its heels as the sun shone through the window sitting up and looking around the deserted room he could hear hermione and elizabeth in the kitchen pulling on his warn jeans and a black t shirt sirius ran a hand through his hair pocketed his wand and made his way to join his family good morning hermione greeted with a smile did you sleep well sirius smiled and nodded moving up to hermione and slipping his hands around her waist giving her a soft kiss pulling back slightly sirius frowned and cocked his head removing his arms from their current position his hand went for his wand hermione looking at sirius in confusion did the same thing before moving swiftly over to elizabeth and picking her up out of her highchair sirius she whispered sirius eyes darkened the birds had stopped singing o o o o o

hermione large four poster bed his back resting on one of the large intricately carved posts as he rested his forearm on a bent knee smiling as he took in his sleeping wife the late november sun streaming through the windows giving her an angelic like appearance his gaze shifted to the slight swelling of hermione stomach five months into her pregnancy and she was beginning to show her robes now unable to hide the fact that she was with child reaching down for the camera remus had given him for his birthday sirius took a quick photo to add to his growing collection of his bride the sound of the shutter caused hermione to stir her eyes remaining closed as she stretched languidly in the morning sun sirius settled the camera down beside him and watched hermione wake up her eyelids fluttering open as she gazed at the empty pillow beside her before spotting sirius feet and meeting his grinning face good morning beautiful sirius said moving quietly from his position to join hermione at the head of the bed giving her a soft kiss his hand resting lightly on her belly mmmmm hermione replied smiling as she stretched again before settling comfortably under the warm covers i could stay here all day sirius chuckled be my guest it is saturday harry coming today i doubt we ll see him till later he ll be spending the day with ginny sirius replied as he stood and picked up the breakfast tray the house elf had left for hermione hermione sat up and took a cup of tea from sirius and smiled over the brim unless he burnt the house down then i think he d avoid us as if his life depended on it sirius grinned harry had been staying in the house that sirius and hermione had brought for the summer he along with draco had been accepted into the auror academy having sent their requests in before their newt s both declined the invitation draco deciding to work on restoring his manor for a year before he started his training and harry opting for a year off just to stay out of the limelight he had been given a house from the ministry but harry along with sirius and hermione didntlike the drawback the ministry would know where he was so sirius and hermione had suggested he stay in their place bought through a private muggle sale so the wizarding community wouldntknow where they were a loud trumpet sounded through the castle breaking the peaceful silence that had settled in the room hermione turned to sirius who wore a broad grin first snow he commented i just happened to inform some of the seventh years of the old marauder tradition did you now why arentyou going out there you always did like a snowball fight sirius smiled and tucked a loose curl of hermione behind her ear lets see snowball fight sleeping in with my beautiful pregnant wife snowball fight beautiful pregnant wife hard choice there he murmured closing the small distance between them i guess the snow can wait hermione whispered before she met sirius lips in a soft sensual kiss which was soon deepened by both parties sirius bringing both hands up to cup hermione face as he lay alongside her being careful not to put too much weight on her stomach which felt this moment would be a good time to interrupt the pair sirius broke the kiss and gazed down at hermione bump this was new hermione grinned and placed sirius hand on the small mound watching his awe struck expression as he felt his child kick madame pomfrey said she ll be more active now we re into the second trimester sirius raised an eyebrow she i thought we d decided we didntwant to know hermione grinned i know i just dontlike referring to our child as an it sirius shifted his gaze back down to her stomach where his hand still lay why not just call it the baby because it ll be a girl hermione stated confidently you sure i betting on a boy you know just because we are married doesntmean you have to disagree with everything i say sirius moved back up to hermione level and grinned at her there no fun in that and he said pointedly i really think it ll be a boy what makes you say that hermione asked grinning back only a member of the male species would interrupt a moment like tha t oh and what kind of moment would that be sirius and moved in for another kiss tease he whispered as he claimed her lips the couple uninterrupted by the outside world or their little world of their own o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a soft knock at dumbledore door brought his attention away from his meeting with snape on how the potion lessons were progressing since his return at the start of the school year come in he called resting his hands on his lap which was covered by a think woollen blanket to keep away the cold he watched snape visibly scowl as hermione entered the room her black robes pulled around her her cloak that sirius had gifted her for christmas in their seventh year wrapped warmly around her shoulders i sorry she apologized when she saw snape sitting in the room i can come back later its ok my dear come sit dumbledore indicated to the chair next to snape severus and i were just discussing the progress of his classes since the beginning of the term hermione smiled at the potions master i hope they are going well as much as i miss teaching i dontthink potions would be the best thing for me at the moment i not sure if was the best thing for you before your condition snape sneered now severus dumbledore started with a small frown but hermione was currently fixing snape with a glare of her own i pregnant severus snape visibly winced at her use of his given name i do not have a condition and the pass rate for potions last year was actually quite high so i think i did well enough for the students thank you very much hermione finished by rising and handing dumbledore a roll of parchment she had been assisting the headmaster in running the school since his return and not having reclaimed his previous strength he was grateful for the help hermione left the room and descended the stairs outside the office frustrated at snapes attitude towards her he still treated her like a student an inferior rather than that of his equal footsteps behind her made hermione turn around and she frowned as the permanently pale greasy haired wizard approached her do not think because you taught six months of potions miss granger that you have the right to actually take credit for the results i am not a student professor snape nor am i miss granger anymore you should know that you were at the wedding and i would rather you didntuse that patronizing tone while talking to me hermione chocolate brown eyes flashed in anger as she stared down the sickly wizard in front of her for someone who botches a simple rescue mission mrs black and in turn endangering my life significantly i can assure you i will use whatever tone i choose you never have nor will have any respect from me hermione stared at the back of snapes retreating back his dark robes billowing out as he disappeared around the corner his cold attitude towards her was not only because of the so called know it all status he had given her but because she had failed to save him that night in the cell tears welled in hermione eyes a mixture of hormones and reality as she recalled snapes behaviour towards her since his recovery hermione had beaten herself up over the failure of the rescue she didntblame snape at all for his actions wiping away her guilt ridden tears she headed off in the direction of remus and tonks chambers to have lunch with the auror as they planned sirius christmas present the blue haired witch much to hermione relief didntnotice the drop in hermione recently elevated mood throughout the afternoon later that night her husband did though sirius tried to recall what hermione plans for the day had involved to find the cause of the subtle pain he could see in her eyes she had her meeting with dumbledore which sirius concluded wouldnthave caused this pain he was seeing he did recall however remus mentioning a meeting snape had had with dumbledore also and wondered if the potions master had said anything to hermione sirius would have a word with snape in the morning for now he gazed down at hermione bathed in the light of the waning moon as she drifted off to sleep o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer nope still not mine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 19 the right side of wrong o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius trained his wand on the entrance way to the kitchen his face was pale and his hand shaking slightly portkey he whispered urgently to hermione who did what he said grabbing the frying pan from the bench and murmuring portus elizabeth was silent burying herself in her mothers arms as if she new she needed to be quiet sirius hermione whispered her brown eyes showing her panic it not working shit sirius cursed stepping back closer to hermione his brain working in overdrive as he heard footfalls through the lounge they were trapped o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the minister couldnthide the small grin on his face as he ate his breakfast in peace two weeks previous he had been informed that remus lupin owned a house the same remus lupin who was friends with sirius and hermione black it had taken two weeks of tracking and questioning muggles to get a location of the house but his team had pulled through and any minute now elizabeth black should be in the custody of the ministry o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius and hermione listened as footsteps echoed throughout the small house apparently whoever had come had come in numbers casting shield charms they waited whatever happens dontlet her go sirius whispered to hermione a young auror stuck his head around the corner and pulled it back quickly when he spotted sirius hermione was crouched behind him her arms wrapped around elizabeth they re in here aurors and ministry officials poured through the small entrance way wands raised wary of the two that stood at the far end of the kitchen give us the child and no one gets hurt sirius growled low in his throat the intensity in his grey eyes disturbing some of the aurors in front of him alright then have it your way sirius and hermione were prepared for the onslaught of spells sent their way their shields effectively keeping them out of harms way what came a sneering voice from the midst of the crowd you re not going to fight back sirius wasntgiven a chance to answer as more stunners were sent their way hermione stood now sidelong next to sirius to help him keep the shield up elizabeth tucked safely between the two of them sirius frowned as their shields began to give way they werentstrong enough to hold back the thirty something team that was attacking them as the thought passed through sirius head a disarming charm made its way through the invisible barrier hitting hermione and sending her backwards her wand flying through the air sirius eyes flickered to his wife in concern the moment distraction costing him as another onslaught of disarming spells shot through the barrier hermione watched in horror as sirius was knocked off his feet and sent flying through the kitchen windows glass shattering everywhere in a spray of shards followed by the thump of sirius hitting the ground outside struggling to hold back the tears hermione turned back to the aurors who still had their wands trained on her hand her over and we wonthave to hurt you hermione glared why cantyou just leave us alone she asked her voice small as they advanced on her and elizabeth hermione stepped back until her back hit the wall behind her cantyou just give us some peace spotting the discarded frying pan on the floor next to her hermione sunk to her knees hoping the auror she didntrecognize mistook the action as a weakness smiling inwardly as he lowered his wand and stepped closer hermione gripped her hand around the handle of the cast iron pan still holding elizabeth close to her hermione stood and swung with all her might the frying pan colliding with the aurors skull in a satisfying thunk followed by a robed body hitting the floor simultaneously the aurors and officials raised their wands again as hermione turned shielding elizabeth with her body the frying pan still clutched in her hand a blur of black fur leapt through the shattered windows landing on the kitchen floor between hermione and the aurors its paws leaving smears of blood from the glass over the tiles claws scratching trying to get purchase shocked at the grim like dog that had suddenly appeared its growl loud throughout the room the aurors stepped back slightly it black hermione watched as sirius leapt for the nearest auror his sharp teeth snapping at robes his horrifying bark echoing off the walls but as well as being trapped they were without wands and outnumbered padfoot yelped as he was struck by several spells and collided painfully with the wall beside hermione the wind knocked out of him sirius transformed back his face was covered by small cuts one nasty one along his hairline sending a slow stream of blood down the side of his face getting to his feet slowly wincing as he put his weight on his torn up bare feet sirius moved to stand in front of hermione and elizabeth the aurors shook their heads in disbelief some lowered their wands others sent another round of spells this time stunners to keep the wizard down they didntmeet their target instead bounced off a shield sirius had managed to produce without his wand sweat and blood covered sirius face as he tried in vain to keep the shield up the spells weakening him with every hit elizabeth was crying silently her small hands clinging to her mother clothes as she tried to protect her from falling debris in front of her sirius fell to one knee as the shield was broken and a stunner hit him in the chest rather than knocking him out as would be expected he rose to his feet again dontyou dare come near my family he gasped out through the pain blinking away the stray trails of blood that made their way into his eyes stuptefy sirius the single curse hit sirius and he fell to his knees before falling onto his chest putting his hands out on either side he struggled to get back up to his feet his arms giving way as he failed as two ministry officials stepped forward hermione leapt to her feet stepped over the knocked out auror and stood over sirius glaring in defiance at the oncoming wizards throwing the frying pan into the crowd resulting in another satisfying thunk step aside ma am one said raising his wand slightly we re taking him into custody hermione eyes widened for what attacking aurors it was self defence the officials eyes hardened step aside he repeated moving closer hermione chocolate eyes flashed before the officials and front line of aurors were knocked off their feet followed by a cascading effect behind them elizabeth small arms tightened around hermione neck as she tried to get as close to her mother as possible they gave no warning this time as hermione was hit by disarming spells none of the officials wanting the ministers wrath from stunning the child hermione was pushed backwards her foot snagging and twisting painfully on the auror on the floor behind her falling backwards she collided agonizingly with the wall a searing pain up her left arm before her shoulder hit the wall with a sickening pop sliding down the wall in pain hermione gripped elizabeth with both her arms ignoring the pain through her left on the floor sirius was stirring and attempting to get to his feet hermione watching in horror as one of the officials waved his wand causing the black haired wizard to fall painfully back onto the floor getting to her feet hermione stood bravely as the official advanced on her the blue robed wizard indicating for a young auror to follow hand her over putting her weight on her good ankle hermione stared defiantly up at the tall man in front of her no her voice was barely audible as her vision blurred stupid witch behind the official sirius stirred and saw the wizard draw his fist back hermione he shouted in warning but hermione was too dazed to notice as she was punched in the side of the head falling once again to her knees she still clung to her daughter even as her vision started to darken turning to the auror beside him the official gestured down to elizabeth take her he ordered before stepping back and casting a binding spell on the struggling sirius no he shouted desperately trying to break free the auror crouched down beside hermione and reached out for the wailing child please hermione whispered trying to remain conscious please don t the auror met her chocolate eyes and filled with sympathy please donttake my daughter i sorry he murmured reaching out and gently pulling elizabeth arms from around hermione neck a stray tear escaped down hermione cheek before she lost conscious sirius was already putting his full strength into struggling out of his bonds six aurors holding him back from the auror who gently cradled the screaming elizabeth in his arms no dontyou dare sirius shouted as they pulled him backwards away from hermione two aurors stepped past and picked up the unconscious comrade lifting him out and following behind the group struggling with sirius wait you cantjust leave her the official nodded to one of the aurors who pointed his wand at sirius and muttered a stunner you cant sirius pleas were cut off as once again he lost consciousness within minutes the room was empty save hermione and the birds resumed their song o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus opened the door to his and tonks chambers hoping to get a quiet lunch with the metamorph before the afternoon classes began what he wasntexpecting was aforementioned witch lying on the couch covered by a knitted blanket tonks he asked quietly stepping over and crouching by the long settee tonks opened her eyes and smiled sleepily at the werewolf hey you remus returned the smile hey he replied reaching up and brushing a stray lock of ebony hair from her face not feeling so good he asked gently tonks closed her violet eyes and shook her head graham practically threw me out of the first year transfiguration class i think this is the first time i ve had morning sickness in the morning only three months into her pregnancy tonks was yet to show any evidence of the child growing inside her save for nausea and the slight weight gain which she felt the need to remind remus of constantly i thought something was up remus said as he stood to bring tonks a glass of water had a funny feeling in class must be my fatherly instincts kicking in tonks cracked her eyes open and glared more like husbandly i the one that feels like i going to bring up everything i have ever eaten not the little one remus smiled as he handed tonks the water helping her sit up before scooting behind her and allowing her to snuggle into his side thoughts about food vanishing as he lay his hand protectively over tonks stomach o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry paused in their morning twenty kilometer run draco slowing down and standing beside him tired already potter he asked switching back to harry last name as they both often did while training harry shook his head and met the blondes grey eyes something wrong draco frowned harry instincts were usually bang on and immediately drew his wand and cast his eyes around the small wooded area harry shook his head again when he noticed draco movements no not here we need to get to hogwarts ginny draco asked i dontknow o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ginny looked up from her text book on treating miss cast spells when two wizards dressed in auror trainee robes burst into the room harry she asked standing up in confusion ginny are you ok he asked stepping up to her and pulling her into his arms i fine what the matter draco stepped forward harry here has been becoming more and more agitated all morning pausing his eyes widened slightly hermione he asked what ginny stepped back from harry what about hermione not answering harry apparated o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o bloody hero complex draco muttered as he walked briskly down the crowded hogwarts corridors to remus and tonks chambers ginny following close behind stepping up to the heavy wooden doors draco raised his fist and knocked what not going to barge in ginny muttered at his side draco smirked down at the redhead before remus opened the door draco he asked shocked to see the wizard arentyou supposed to be at training o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione harry called as he apparated into remus lounge still rather glad that he had managed to get passed the wards sirius he called when no one answered running up the stairs he checked both the bedrooms and the bathroom everything seemed to be normal glancing out into the backyard his keen seeker eyesight caught something glistening in the sunlight realising he was looking at broken glass he bolted down the stairs hermione he called again as he entered the destruction of the kitchen oh god he muttered as he took in the broken windows either hermione had become rather angry for some reason or something bad had happened he came to the conclusion that it was something bad when he spotted hermione slumped against the wall at the end of the kitchen hermione he gasped running through the kitchen his boots crushing the glass that had come back into the kitchen with sirius laying hermione gently flat on the floor he raised his wand ennervate he murmured hurriedly gasping in pain hermione woke shooting up into a sitting position before crying out and gripping her left shoulder which appeared to be at an awkward angle its ok hermione i here we have to get you help harry was particularly concerned about her left arm and the ashen colour her skin had taken hermione focused her eyes on harry for the first time they took them she whispered harry bundled his best friend up in his arms trying not to jolt her as he prepared to apparate back to hogwarts who he asked quietly the ministry we have to go to the ministry we will i promise we have to get you looked at first ok o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the minister looked down at the sleeping child in the cot that had been placed in one of the ministries hidden rooms he had the child everything will be fine now the black haired blue eyed witch lay peacefully now a few hours ago she d been putting her lungs to good use what this he asked the medi witch that had been assigned to care for the child glancing down at the small platinum bracelet encircling elizabeth wrist the medi witch shook her head it wontcome off we ve tried every spell we could think of that things staying put well try harder the minister ordered taking one more look at the girl before grinning in glee and leaving the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a n i working full time now so i not too sure when i ll be able to update next i was going to make this longer but i

disclaimer not mine sob what i would give to own sirius o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 21 dirty little secret o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the air was cold and crisp as a hooded figure dressed in black made their way quickly across the dark grounds of the ancient site disturbing the thin layer of mist at ground level with their long strides the pale smoke like substance forming intricate ribbon like patterns in the night air looking around the figure pulled out a thin stick and muttered something in latin under their breath while waving their hand around out of thin air a small cabin appeared to which they entered swiftly closing the door behind them with a soft thud that didnteven warrant an echo in the stillness around it a few moments later the building disappeared and the calmness of the night took over once again fifteen fifteen figures robed in black fifteen surrounding a small table in the center of the large circular room that used to house more than a hundred of voldemorts followers fifteen names written in elegant script on a piece of worn parchment fifteen roles to be played fifteen would take one o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o robert tomkinson minister for magic the wizard who was supposed to change the wizarding world for the better after the downfall of you know who stood silently in the empty corridor looking down into the mezzanine below hundreds of wizards and witches were present students parents graduates alumni ministry employees aurors and the odd ministry official all protesting against one thing the arrest of sirius black the minister could not understand it no he refused to understand it this man was a convicted murderer innocent or not why did the people love him so was it his relation to harry potter surely not frowning the minister turned away there was nothing he could do the arrest had been made the trial would go ahead if found guilty of assault then he would be punished o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius jolted awake with the sound of a lock sliding sometime during the night he had curled around hermione on the small cot in the cell from behind her sirius propped himself up slightly and brushed the curls from her face noting that she was still asleep he remained where he was two aurors walked into the cell one tall and lanky with short blonde hair the other medium set in height had long brown hair tied behind his back the taller of the two stepped forward hello sirius he greeted my name stu i a member of tonks team sirius relaxed slightly and nodded for the auror to continue tomkinson refuses to drop the charges but he been having some trouble controlling the outcome of your arrest what do you mean sirius interrupted more than half of the aurors have gone on strike many of them young ones you taught at hogwarts that and much of the ministry has joined them sirius raised an eyebrow so what is he going to do about it stu shrugged and crouched down so he didnthave to look down at sirius he pulled your trial forward to this afternoon he hoping that you re found guilty but i ve already had witnesses stepping up that are willing to testify sirius nodded what about elizabeth stu turned his gaze to hermione who had woken sometime during the conversation propping herself up she looked a right mess long curls normally long and elegant were a tangle her eyes were red and swollen her clothes still the disheveled ones from the day before sirius sat up with her and stu colleague conjured chairs for them to sit in that a different matter which i think will be dealt better with after sirius is released but he continued as hermione and sirius both opened their mouths to protest tonks is working on it along with harry and his friends o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o two young wizards exited the store on diagon alley their vibrant red hair bright in the summer sun the taller of the two with his long hair tied at the nape of his neck waited for the shorter redhead to lock the shop excuse me the two weasley men turned at the sound of the voice and looked down at a group of young wizards standing behind them are you closed a brunette with freckles scattering along his cheeks asked timidly fred nodded we have some stuff we need to do mate the young boys eyes flickered to the sign on the door closed until further notice how will we know when you re open again fred grinned and caught his sibling eye rolling his own pair the corner of his mouth twitching bill answered instead i sure you ll find out one way or another turning to his younger brother he began ushering up the cobbled street come on we need to get to the ministry o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus long strides echoed off the dungeon walls as he made his way back to the potion masters room for a second time the first the evening before had been unsuccessful sending the werewolf back to his chambers to send owls to anyone they could trust for help raising his fist he knocked on the heavy door in front of him severus the tinkering of glass followed by a smash was the only response he received frowning the sandy haired wizard turned the knob and pushed the door open to find snape blocking his entry family scowl on his sour face must you persist in disturbing me lupin yes remus fought back the marauder grin as snapes frown grew behind the pasty greasy haired man remus spotted an open trunk on the floor by the ingredients cabinet immediately the humor vanished going somewhere remus askedv his expression hardening snapes scowl if possible grew and mingled with the familiar scent of the potions room remus picked up something else fear stepping forward into the room causing snape to step back remus also noted the cauldron and spare robes in the trunk on the floor severus get out snape growled remus glared it just seems a little odd that you would choose this time to go away with all that been happening you know fully well dumbledore has cancelled the rest of the terms classes being only a few weeks till the exams the little brats can take care of themselves why dontyou just scurry back to the shell you call a home werewolf snape moved to push past the lycan but remus blocked his way feral amber eyes flashing dangerously o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o where blondie harry glanced at fred who along with bill had just joined himself and ginny at the ministry bumped into him last night harry answered said he knew someone that might be able to help find elizabeth who harry shrugged as they approached the double doors that would take them through the entrance of the ministry over to the elevators he said he couldntsay it not unusual for draco to hold back on some things and you trust him bill asked somewhat skeptically harry nodded as he opened the doors this is elizabeth and if there one person in this world draco cares the most for it her harry potter any comment on the arrest of your godfather harry blinked as camera flashes flickered in front of him leaving small imprints on his eyelids what your view on the actions of the ministry do you know the location of the child how are you involved harry and the others began to push their way through the throngs of reporters harry in the lead as fred and bill flanked either side of ginny how do you feel about mrs black choosing to join her husband in custody is it true you mister malfoy and auror tonks knew about the child and didntreport it are mr and mrs black to fight the ministry for parental rights how do you feel about your godfather returning to azkaban harry bit back comments that would surely be taken entirely out of context as he noted the flickering of quick quotes quills in the crowd reaching the elevators the groups stepped in and the doors closed catching his breath harry leant against the back wall oh to be harry potter fred commented a wry grin on his face o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco walked cautiously up the cobbled footpath leading to the large house in font of him this place was extremely difficult to find if you didntknow where to look you could take months just wandering or all night as draco had done after all a family in the intelligence business did not want to be easily found lucky for draco he knew where to look reaching the front door unscathed and eyeing the lion head knocker with a small amount of distain he reached out and brought it down the resulting noise echoing through the large house standing for a moment staring at the door draco wondered if anyone actually lived there anymore turning he looked out at the morning sun as it rose over the trees in the distance twenty four hours she had been alone twenty four hours draco draco turned to see his old school mate standing at the now open door hello blaise i need your help o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hello percy the redhead who had been sitting quietly at his desk staring into oblivion with no one else around jumped at the sudden noise spinning in his chair he flinched slightly at the four angry faces staring down at him go away percy replied spinning back around i busy fred looked down at the empty desk yeah right and proceeded to grab his brother chair and pull it out from under the desk the small castors scraping slightly harry stepped in and leant against percy desk while the rest of his remaining siblings crossed their arms why did you do it percy bill asked staring in shame down at his brother do what ginny glared you know very well what you where there at christmas you know that remus and tonks had a house percy frowned in confusion but was interrupted by fred before he could get a word in was the prospect of an order of merlin too much you had to sacrifice a little girl and her family to get it you make me sick percy got to his feet to defend himself if i had an order of merlin do you think i d be sitting at my desk doing nothing someone got there first so instead of jumping to conclusions maybe you should be looking elsewhere i didnttell the minister where to find elizabeth i had up until a few moments ago forgotten the lycanthrope had a house o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o i didnttell you about our house snape flinched slightly and stepped back from remus whose voice had more poison in it than the potions master had ever heard you must have mentioned it in passing no remus answered stepping closer both tonks and i agreed to only tell a select group how did you find out snape snape just glared you overhead ginny and i in the corridor didntyou snivellus you told the minister about sirius and hermione whereabouts remus stepped closer causing snape to back into the wall you sick son of a bitch you ve held that child in your arms you ve seen her with sirius and hermione and you do this snape raised his wand i wouldntmove any closer lupin or i ll have you up for assault and dontthink i wont it wont be azkaban for you half breed its straight to the lab and a nice little injection of silver after all who would believe an order of merlin recipient over a mere creature remus hesitated go on then run like the coward you are order of merlin or not you will not be safe as long as elizabeth has people who care for her wellbeing turning on his heel remus exited the room the vials of potions along the walls shattering as he unleashed his anger on anything but the snivelling little snitch behind him o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione shrugged on a pair of robes tonks offered her as the auror mulled around her desk memos flying back and forth as tonks gained all the help she could get looking up in unision the pair watched as harry ginny fred and bill wandering through the door hermione harry greeted with a wry smile you should be in bed hermione gave harry a steady look before turning and greeting the others the corners of her mouth twitching how sirius harry asked as ginny and her brothers went to talk with tonks hermione sighed as well as can be expected harry the taller wizard ushered her away from the others to a quiet corner we need her back harry hermione brown eyes held his own emerald ones i know we ll get her back pulling his best friend into his arms harry continued i promise o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the first thing sirius looked for when entering the small court room was hermione seeing her sitting off to the side harry and remus on either side of her sirius breathed a sigh of relief she was his rock at this moment no matter what else was going on he knew the only place he needed her right now was in the same room the room was also filled with friends official justice employees three judges and the minister as well as a scattering of reporters at the back dumbledore took his seat beside sirius at the small table provided sirius himself was still dressed in the clothes from the day before jeans shirt and no shoes and he winced slightly in pain as he took his seat waiting for sirius to sit before beginning one of the judges a grey haired witch with a large black pointed hat nodded in greeting before signaling the room to silence we are here today for the case brought against one professor sirius black charged at the assault of ministry officials and aurors glancing up the judge continued how do you plea professor swinging his stormy eyes to the minister sitting off to the side sirius answered not guilty all three judges nodded and the proceedings continued first up was an auror with bandages around his head his representative turning to sirius mr black do you recognize this man sirius shook his head no in the audience hermione recognized him and scowled the short squat man that had asked the question continued he received this severe head injury while on orders to obtain something from your possession and you say you dontrecognize the man no sirius repeated not from the floor of your kitchen oh sirius answered sure i remember him but i cantsay i know how he came to be on the floor though i was outside at the time having just been sent flying through the kitchen windows and out onto the yard maybe your wife knows something about it then sirius was on his feet in an instant slashes to the soles forgotten you leave her out of this i on trial here not her the judges agreed with sirius and the squat wizard ran out of questions i have a question everyone in the room turned to who had spoken go ahead minister the blonde wizard seated beside his fellow judges prompted not only did you attack aurors you did not bring your child forward that on its own serves a danger not only to those in your kitchen yesterday morning but the entire wizarding community therefore maybe a harsher punishment for your crimes is needed judges the judges turned back to sirius who was losing his temper professor black anything to add sirius did a double take at the anger in the judges eyes not for the fact that it was there but for the fact that it was pointed in the ministers direction suddenly he felt a bit more confident she is my daughter he replied to the minister i have a natural right to protect her from death eaters to the ministry turning back to the judges sirius continued may i ask a question go ahead turning to the minister sirius glared firstly you have no right taking elizabeth from my wife and i secondly self defence is not assault and thirdly what is your version of harsher punishment minister if you remember rightly i was in azkaban for twelve years it doesntget any harsher than that maybe you d like to go back again black the minister shot back you have no right to send me back there when an apology was all i got last time a measley sorry for falsely imprisoning you no sorry we took twelve years of your life because we didntbother with a trial no public apology just a little corner of the prophet proclaiming my innocence the ministry didnteven admit its mistake sirius paused there was no sorry for inflicting you with dementors for twelve years making me relive over and over again the events of my life that caused me the most agony i have all the right in the world mr black you re lucky you are even getting a trial convicted murders should not get a second chance sirius turned to the judges with all due respect i think this has been covered before you are correct mr black turning to the minister the grey haired witch continued minister tomkinson do you have any hard evidence to suggest that sirius assaulted ministry employees the minister sitting pompously in his aubergine robes stayed silent very well then in my personal opinion this has been a waste of time clearly the public disagrees with these charges and so do i therefore it is my right the judge turned to the minister and gave him a pointed look to release professor sirius black from custody and drop all the charges with no further questioning you are free to go sirius sirius nodded and dumbledore stood doesntlook like you needed me after all sirius smiled as hermione walked swiftly over to him you re always welcome albus excuse me madame judge over the hustle of the room the grey haired witch looked up from her parchment and at sirius yes what about our daughter her eyes softened as she gazed down at sirius and hermione who was now standing in his embrace i sorry sirius and hermione i cant do anything about that here she glanced at the retreating back of the minister and waited till he was out of the door come to my office tomorrow i ll see what we can do about it sirius nodded thank you o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o returning to hogwarts for the night everyone in much need of sleep the group decided to bunk down in sirius and hermione old chambers only one person missing where draco hermione asked wearily as sirius opened the door allowing harry ginny fred bill remus and tonks to file in after the pair harry gave hermione a wry grin he out there somewhere helping sirius wandered over to remus who had sat down in one of the chairs exhaustion etched into his features remus hmm something on your mind care to share remus glanced up at his friend as long as you promise to let it go for the time being sirius nodded i know who told the ministry where to find you sirius eyes hardened and he got a familiar look in his features that made remus pause keep going remus sirius warned you wontgo after them sirius shook his head i cantpromise you that i wontgo after them at all but i can promise that it wontbe till i get elizabeth back remus nodded knowing that elizabeth was sirius priority it was snape o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer the only thing i own is the little bunny in my head that gave me this chapter which was written eagerly before chapter 21 so no harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 22 kidnap an angel o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius woke suddenly the feeling of dread seeping through his clothes chilling him to the bone it took a moment for sirius to realize that the seeping through his clothes and the coldness around him was snow above him the night sky was alight with millions of stars like fireflies stuck in the blueish black thing frowning sirius sat up slowly the environment around him was somewhat familiar the gently sloping of the land nearby clumps of trees leaves lost to the winter leaving boughs covered in white to his left was the forbidden forest a dark looming presence of twisted tree limbs waiting for unsuspecting victims to wander into its midst standing slowly sirius took a minute to gain his bearings using the familiar landscape and night sky his astronomy lessons once again being put to good use wrapping his cloak firmly around his shoulders to starve off the cold sirius started the short trek to hogwarts which he presumed was only a few hills away he should reach hogsmead first maybe there he could find out what was going on it wasnteveryday you woke up in a snow drift with no idea how you came to be there nor the fact that when he had last remembered it was summer not the middle of winter cresting the hill sirius looked down on what should have been a nicely lit town ready to celebrate the festive season instead he looked wide eyed at a deserted ghost town most of the buildings had been gutted by fire and were mere shells of what they had once been stumbling slightly down the slope towards hogsmead sirius slipped on an icy patch causing his arms to flail as he tried to catch himself from falling regaining his balance he continued down the hill and onto the main street the place was a ruin there was no warm glow of lights from the windows no laughter of young children or the gossip of adults no carolers on the corner it was empty the buildings were black and burnt occasional scorch marks in the side giving hint to what had occurred a piece of parchment fluttered across the street like a tumble weed and sirius made a desperate grab at it clutching it between his fingers sirius turned his back into the sharp wind so that it wouldnttake away his prize as he opened the parchment up it was the front page of the daily prophet no date was visible the edges having burnt away but the headline was clearly discernible witch runs havoc on wizarding community the wizarding community is in a state of panic not once in history not grindelwald or voldemort has malice like this been seen the panic is widespread all over britain through the magical and muggle communities alike hundreds are dead thousands injured as sirius squinted and held his wand up to gain more light but the rest of the page was in ruin something bad had happened and for the life of him he couldntremember what turning back into the wind sirius made his way through the town his boots splashing through puddles as he wrapped his arms around himself to ward off the chilling wind that made his grey eyes water passing the three broomsticks the door creaking slightly before the wind caught the edge and sent it banging into the side of the building sirius turned away from the desolation and made his was up the hill just a few more climbs and he would be on hogwarts grounds growing tired of the climb sirius shifted into padfoot the going easier on four legs instead of two cresting the next hill sirius recognized the tall tree across the valley and up on the ridge one more hill after that point and then the grounds of hogwarts picking up his pace slightly he made his way down black on white through the snow the stench hit him first padfoots nose far more sensitive than his own glancing up the hill from the base padfoot whined as he spotted four figures hanging from the boughs two on one side of the trunk two on the other placed there as a warning to others it was on the quickest path to hogwarts changing back sirius decided he was better off without the smell and began to once again climb on two feet his socks wet as the deep snow trickled down his boots keeping his eyes resolutely in front of him sirius made it to the top of the hill the collar of his cloak pulled up against his nose and mouth to keep away the stench coming from the two bodies nearest him cocking his head to the side sirius heard screams and explosions coming from the direction of hogwarts frowning in confusion sirius momentarily forgot about the looming figures beside him until one of the ropes creaked chillingly in the wind without thinking sirius turned and looked up the blood draining from his face and bile rising as he fell to his knees and vomited in the snow remus once frighteningly bright amber eyes no longer held their glow the werewolf finally held at bay in death his arms were tied behind his back dried blood on his hands evident of his struggle to get free of his bonds the tear tracks in the grime on his face could mean anything fear anger frustration grief grief for not being able to protect the woman beside him tonks violet eyes were the same the spark of life once so vibrant was gone her bright pink hair stayed vivid even in death her wrists were similar to remus as were the rivulets of tears down her heart shaped face gasping for breath that would not come sirius leant against the trunk of the tree in support shuddering as bursts of air attempted to reach his lungs another creak of rope reminded sirius of the other two who were they did he know them also blinking back the tears of sorrow that were rolling down his face sirius closed his eyes and made his way around the tree bringing his eyes up before moaning and sinking to the ground his heart tearing in his chest lily gift to harry her vivid emerald eyes had once again been extinguished his messy hair whipped around his now pale face in the wind he had put up his usual fight his face was barely recognizable save the eyes and god forsaken scar the rest was a mess of bruises and gashes unlike remus and tonks harry had managed to free his hands the skin of his wrists hanging limply by his sides was raw the ropes having cut almost to the bone in his attempt to get free two small patches of red embedded in the snow below as a result tearing his gaze away from his godson sirius turned to harry companion long weasley hair fluttered in the wind escaping from the plait down her back ginny eyes were closed her face white like porcelain lips blue and cold lying down on the ground in the snow sirius moaned in agony grief racking his body why they were not supposed to be dead hanging from the sky for the world to see for him to see it had been merely hours since sirius had last seen all four this was wrong tears warming his cheeks as he lay in the snow sirius was dimly aware of his fingers beginning to numb in the biting cold trying once again to control his breathing he struggled to his feet reaching out sirius brushed his fingers along harry boot the body swaying slightly by the touch pulling out his wand sirius murmured a cutting charm and the rope above harry head came apart as sirius caught his godsons limp body in his arms fresh sobs racking his body laying harry down beneath the tree sirius did the same for ginny tonks and remus gasping when he had his best friend cold limbs in his arms he had lost them all now he was the last one the last marauder placing a preservation and concealment charm on his four friends sirius took a shaky breath and turned his gaze to the direction of hogwarts the distant sounds of a battle again reaching his ears stumbling down the small incline he began to make his way up the final slope making the crest sirius stopped grey eyes wide as he took in the scene before him screams were mingled with explosions and bolts of colourful light as once again battle befell the grounds of hogwarts the castle itself was on fire flames lapping the old stone as the wood of the interior burned holding his wand at the ready sirius made his way down onto the fields streams of scarlet staining the snow people were calling all around him begging for help but sirius not knowing what was happening continued on his way his mind set on one thing hermione startled by an explosion in the astronomy tower sirius paused and looked up he fluttered like a falling bird limbs twisting in the air as he fell sirius didntsee dumbledore hit the ground there were too many people in the way too many bodies turning to the entrance hall sirius found her she was alone battling back a handful of death eaters or whoever they were she was bleeding from a large gash on her forehead and her lip was badly split as she kept her weight off one leg running sirius was unaware of what was happening around him all he needed to do was to get to hermione shrill screams that were suddenly silenced caused sirius eyes to flicker to the left a woman was walking through the bodies no wand in hand and her lips were not moving but people buckled and fell dead as she passed she had long black hair that whipped up somewhat elegantly in the wind she was tall and slim with a certain set to her shoulders that was familiar to sirius sirius picked up speed when he saw where she was headed hermione had seen it too her bold eyes set on the figure as it approached her sirius gasped as he watched her lower her wand and shake her head unnoticed tears falling down her cheeks hermione he called out but she didntblink her gaze didntfalter from the figure in front of her tripping sirius stumbled slightly before regaining his footing and running as fast as he could to hermione he was almost there the emotional pain on her face was remarkable she was meters away from sirius when it happened a soft i love you left her lips before the light in her chocolate eyes faded she hadnteven turned to him it wasntsirius that she had spoken to her attention focused solely on the woman in front of her sirius caught her as she crumbled no no no no no no no no no he sobbed hermione wake up sweetheart tears were streaming down his face as a deep moan escaped his lips the pain of finding the others under the tree was nothing compared to this he felt like he was being ripped in two blood pounded in his ears and he began to shake uncontrollably wake up please wake up his cold fingers brushed along her cheeks as if he could transfer the life from himself into her just to save her to see the light in her eyes once more have her speak his name footfalls behind him made him look up gently laying hermione down brining his lips shakily to her forehead he managed somehow to get to his feet and turned to face the one the one who had taken her away from him his beautiful hermione it was like looking into a mirror her ebony hair cascaded down her back in long silky waves and she had the strong set jaw line and high cheekbones that many associated with his heritage but her eyes her eyes were crystal blue the colour painfully familiar the emotion not impassive pools of blue stared back at him void of any emotion as a cool smile formed on her lips hello daddy o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o gasp disclaimer not mine none of it this chapter is dedicated to emily

vision clouded and blood pounded in his ears as slender hands touched his chest sirius a feminine voice panicking sirius pushed blindly hands making contact with a body before there was a loud crash sirius a deeper more masculine and somewhat familiar voice this time sirius shook his head trying to stop the pounding as strong hands gripped his arms sirius open your eyes sirius eyes flew open and he gasped struggling back out of the grip familiar amber eyes looking at him in concern backing up quickly sirius tripped over a chair behind him heedless to the fall and scooted backwards until his back hit the wall the cuts on his feet reopened with the erratic movement and trickles of scarlet dripped slowly down his soles his breathing was rapid eyes wide moving from one person to the next hello daddy ringing through his mind the door to his and hermione room was open remus having rushed in after the crash tonks followed swiftly behind and helped hermione up from the floor where she had landed sirius remus stepped forward harry and the weasley siblings keeping their distance sweat beaded down sirius face mingling with the tears his pupils were large as fear gripped him his hands shaking as he huddled in the corner sirius looked up at remus as he slowly processed what was in front of him remus sirius whispered hermione walked slowly up to the black haired wizard on the floor and crouched down beside him reaching out slowly to touch his face it ok sirius she murmured trying to remain calm just take a deep breath sirius focused his gaze on the witch in front of him there were no open wounds save for the bruise on the side of her face there was no blood and life flowed through the eyes gazing back at him hermione sirius breathed reaching out to her his face cracking as his fingers traced down her cheek oh merlin sobs racked sirius body as hermione pulled him close holding his head in the crook of her neck as she stroked the silky black hair its ok she whispered rocking slightly to calm him down meeting remus eyes the werewolf nodded and left the room with the others as sirius broke down in hermione arms o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the world was bustling all around him or all above him as he felt his surroundings tower above him his left hand clasped firmly in his father larger one it should be around here somewhere his father murmured it been a while he said grinning down at his sandy haired son over there true to his slight size the young boy voice was quiet but after years of listening to his son his father ears were well trained and he looked to where his son was pointing just catching the tail end of a hogwarts student running through the barrier all right then would you like to go first the young boy nodded and determination set in his gracile features he made sure the way was clear before running at the barrier hoping on the way that his blood would see him through sure enough the barrier appeared to dissolve around him and his skin tingled slightly with the feel of magic as he slowed to a stop on platform nine and three quarters his father coming up to stand just behind him well then son are you all ready to go i think so the slight crack in his voice betraying his nervousness bending down to one knee beside his son he lay a hand on the small boys shoulder you ll be ok dontdo anything you dontwant to do do what you think is right all right was the quiet reply ten minutes later and the small boy was seated in a carriage by himself a large book he d brought at diagon alley engulfing his small lap when the door slid open and a bigger boy with ebony hair wandered in nodding in greeting he stored his trunk and took a seat across from the boy and his book hi the dark haired boy greeted the sandy haired boy glanced up and looked around to check to see if the person across from him wasntaddressing someone else the dark haired boy picked up on this and smiled his shocking grey eyes sparkling with hidden humor i sirius black he said offering the small boy a hand remus the small boy answered ducking his head back down he d heard of the black family and his stomach knotted at the thought of sharing a carriage with one of them for the morning remus sirius said testing the name out on his tongue is that it just remus remus shook his head and for the first time met sirius eyes lupin remus lupin well then remus lupin sirius replied startled at the intensity behind the amber in front of him it nice to meet you a hint of a smile showed at the corner of remus mouth but it didntgrow further nice to meet you too he replied quietly sirius opened his mouth to continue the conversation when they were interrupted by another dark haired boy falling into the carriage at their feet sirius grinned down at the floor and remus stared at the magnetism that one smile possessed this boy would be able to get out of many things with that smile have a nice trip be sure to send a postcard next time haha very funny remus looked down at the boy on the ground as he began to pull himself up he was about the same height as sirius sitting across from the young lycan but that where the similarities ended instead of straight sleek ebony hair this boys black hair looked like a birds nest and wire rimmed glasses framed his eyes remus changed his opinion again when he saw the hazel eyes behind the glasses he had another similarity with sirius black the eyes held a mischievousness waiting to be unleashed hi james potter he said offering his hand to sirius sirius black first year james potter raised an eyebrow at the name but kept his mouth shut and nodded you yep and if his size is anything to go by so is remus here remus glanced at sirius in shock not expecting to be pulled into the conversation content to sit quietly by himself james looked over at remus his eyes trailing over his small form are you supposed to even be here you dontlook eleven remus glanced down at his lap his book now resting beside him on the chair not sure how to respond to the statement ow remus looked up to find james rubbing his arm and sirius glaring at him did your parents not teach you manners james glared back sorry mister black his expression changed to that of mock fear please dontcurse me or my family please master black the two boys held each others eyes for a moment before their faces split into identical grins and they began to laugh rather loudly in remus opinion catching his breath sirius looked over at the smaller boy who was shyly watching them you know what remus lupin remus shook his head confused slightly at the odd question my first promise as a hogwarts student i going to make you smile laugh even by the end of the day o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus stared into the empty fireplace no longer looking younger than his age the years of suffering the full moon made him look instead older than he was grey streaks of quicksilver running through his sandy hair he thought about his friend in the other room the young sirius black had failed his first promise as a hogwarts student unable to get the timid remus to truly smile let alone laugh on their first day at hogwarts but in true sirius black fashion that didntset him back it only made him that much more determined and remus was happy to remember that sirius was the first person that wasnthis mum or dad to make him smile o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione glanced over her shoulder one more time at sirius asleep on the bed before pulling the door behind her leaving it open slightly as she limped into the lounge remus was sitting on the couch staring into the fireplace his amber eyes moving to her as she sat down at the other end of the couch penny for your thoughts she asked quietly tucking her feet up beneath herself remus smiled slightly just thinking about my first encounter of the sirius kind hermione tried to mirror remus small smile but failed and averted her eyes the chocolate orbs scanning the room where are the others when remus didntreply hermione brought her eyes back round again resting on the werewolf his own eyes fill with concern they went to get something to eat are you alright hermione sirius is sleeping i should go back stay with him she replied avoiding his question and glancing back at the door she d just come through hermione implored remus as he reached out and gently laid his hand on her arm shocked at the constant trembling emitting from under his hand bridging the small gap between the pair remus took hermione in his arms as she began to sob he was so so scared he didnte even t tell me what ha happened i ve never never seen him so i cantdo this without him beside me remus stayed silent gently holding hermione as she cried into his chest i dontknow how how long i can hermione hands increased their grip on remus robes i need her i need my baby in my arms o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco sat back in the high backed chair he was in and brought his hand up to rub his grey eyes before glancing away from the array of parchments on the desk to the night sky looking back at him from the tall window opposite he was currently in one of the zabini many guest rooms refusing to leave the manor until he was given an answer since draco had arrived he had spent the morning talking with blaise and his father then the afternoon in pouring over the parchments in front of him looking back down at the parchments the inky script blurring as his eyes stung with fatigue draco started to sort them into a pile he couldntget anything done without some rest a popping noise made draco pause and look up the tips of a house elf ears visible above the desk leaning forward so he could see the creature draco raised an elegant eyebrow and waited for it to speak m mister malfoy sirs master is wanting you in the study draco barely acknowledged the stuttering elf in front of him before rushing out of the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the halls of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry were silent in the early hours of the morning as five people in an array of flannel pyjamas made their way down the corridor towards the kitchen in front were three weasley siblings bill and fred flanking their younger sister as they spoke quietly to one another most likely about what had just transpired in sirius and hermione chambers behind them followed harry and tonks the latter of which was still sporting two vivid red streaks through her ebony hair the metamorphmagus had been torn between staying with her fianc and the prospect of a cheese toasted sandwich with a side of chocolate and vanilla ice cream that her three month pregnancy craved after seeing remus eyes drift into their own little world of thoughts she joined the others at present tonks cast a worried look at harry are you alright harry she asked quietly harry green eyes glanced up and focused on tonks as if only just realizing she was walking beside him he saw something didnthe tonks swung her violet eyes forward again and sighed i dontknow o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco paused at the zabini manor study before raising a hand to knock it open draco came the reply from within the blonde wizard stepped in and nodded at blaise and his father before taking a seat draco blaise started this is a big ask even for us draco nodded i understand but it a big situation if money is an issue you know i have enough of it blaise shook his head there no problem with money but draco you re asking us to find this child for starters it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack secondly it could be azkaban not only for us if we get caught but for anyone else involved i understand that draco replied trying to keep his temper in check i also know that you two are the best in the business i wouldnthave come if i didntthink you could do it blaise looked down at the blueprints on the large desk before sharing a look with his father finding a protected room within the ministry with a case this big is all but impossible draco draco opened his mouth to argue when the rich tenors of mister zabini interrupted him but he paused and smiled at draco a zabini never backs down from a challenge draco let out a sigh of relief so you ll do it you ll find elizabeth for me blaise nodded as long as you are aware of the consequences i am but you need to know that no one else had anything to do with this you ll leave her parents out of it of course good one more thing elizabeth has a bracelet by right the ministry shouldnthave been able to remove it only elizabeth or her parents can it has a series of protection spells on it as well as a modified tracking charm mister zabini looked up suddenly at draco why dontyou use that then draco sighed i didnthave a chance to activate it or tell sirius or hermione the spell so if we find her blaise reasoned we activate the charm so if they move her we know where she is exactly o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione woke to the sound of rain hitting the window and an empty bed beside her sitting up and looking around she saw sirius sitting at the window seat leaning against the wall with his left leg bent at the knee and left arm resting over it as he gazed into the grey abyss outside moving over to him hermione sat down and positioned herself in his arms as he moved to accommodate her are you real sirius whispered as his arms tightened around her yes hermione whispered in reply sirius everyone was gone there was no one alive sirius looked down at hermione for the first time his eyes brimmed with emotion as they relived the memory of the night before we have to get her back she wasntour little girl not my little munchkin and she took everything sirius paused as he saw realization dawn in hermione chocolate eyes she took you hermione swallowed what about the others sirius broke eye contact and looked out the window battling with himself about how much he should tell his wife sirius you need to tell me i need to know what at stake without looking back at hermione sirius told her she wont need a wand to cause harm the emotionless eyes the colour of the sky will do that job for her she will have no respect for the dead hanging them as warnings to other hanging those who have held her in their arms who have sung to her made her laugh she ll be shell of our daughter there will be nothing of us left in her hermione shifted in sirius arms i think i going to be sick sirius loosened his grip as hermione stood and fled to the bathroom o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sorry not the best chapter but my muse has run away and i having trouble locating it i officially putting out an apb on my muse also sorry i haventupdated regularly i would just like to point out that harry potter or this fanfiction does not come first and foremost in my life i am a university student with a part time job so i update when i can thank you all who have been patient disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 25 something to believe in o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius exited his room alone to find remus by himself on the couch a book in hand how hermione remus asked looking up at his friend asleep finally sirius answered taking a seat next to remus i think exhaustion has taken over he leant forward and opened a letter addressed to him lying on the table you should get some rest too padfoot everyone else is sirius shook his head holding up the parchment in his hand another i sorry i canttake this case letter you d think lawyers would be jumping up and down for an opportunity like this you re going against the ministry not all would do that willingly hmm it their employer they dontwant to lose their jobs remus continued sure this case could make someone but it could also ruin their career not helping moony sorry remus paused as if searching for the right thing to say i can help sirius face showed his obvious relief thanks remus he said getting up and picking up some parchment and two quills i need you to write to any lawyer you know of o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the following morning sirius was woken by the sun streaming in on his face he moved and instantly regretted it as pain surged through a kink in his neck he never was one who could sleep comfortably on a couch sans when it was with hermione opening his eyes he spotted remus still sitting next to him amber eyes scanning through another letter have you been up all night sirius asked pulling himself up so he wasntso slouched pretty much you fell asleep a few hours ago why didntyou wake me back up remus glanced over at sirius one eyebrow raised you needed rest sirius yeah yeah sirius grumbled the few hours of sleep not improving his mood he stood and made his way over to his and hermione room opening the door and gently closing it behind him sirius eyes fell on an empty bed hermione he called in the bathroom sirius wandered over and opened the door to their bathroom and stepped in the slight smell of vomit reaching his heightened senses hermione was standing at the mirror in a bathrobe examining her face even with a full nights sleep she was still pale though the dark circles under her eyes had faded slightly the bruise on the side of her face was slowly turning a yellowy green colour as the days without elizabeth wore on are you alright sirius asked i wish people would stop asking me that hermione replied not meeting sirius eyes and wandering over instead to turn on the shower sirius reached over and turned it off sirius what are you doing pulling her close and forcing her to meet his eyes sirius answered sweetheart i dontcare what other people ask you i want to know if you re ok hermione sighed and rested her head on sirius chest wrapping her arms around his waist you know i not alright i used to being strong sirius but i just can t every time i think of what they could be doing to her it makes me sick i dontknow what to do she whispered as tears formed in her eyes here what we re going to do sirius said leading her to sit on the edge of the bathtub and crouching down in front of her we re going to get you all cleaned up we re going to find a really good lawyer and then we re going to get elizabeth back o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione stood in the shower letting the water run through her hair as she listened to the sink tap running as sirius shaved his figure blurred slightly by the frosted glass of the shower door as much as she new sirius didntcare what others thought of him he was going that extra length to seem more presentable and less azkaban like even if he would never admit it raising her hand up hermione tentatively applied pressure to her bruised shoulder wincing slightly as pale marks appeared where her fingers had just been before the green yellow hue returned sighing she stepped under the warm cascading water it brought similar comfort to that of an embrace and she felt the tension lax slightly as she closed her eyes to let the water run down her face a few minutes passed and she heard sirius moving around the small room relenting to the fact that she could not hide in the shower forever she reached for her towel before realizing she d forgotten to grab one from the rail opening her mouth to ask sirius for one movement out of the corner of her eye brought her gaze up to the white towel he had just draped over the top of the door allowing herself a small smile hermione reached up and pulled it down o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius finished shaving and picked up a hand towel to dry his face catching his reflection in the mirror he felt saddened as it were by the haunted look in his grey eyes it had returned after his vivid dream and no matter how many times he caught hermione eyes the image of them staring blankly at him would not leave looking away from the reflection sirius glanced at the shower where he could just make out hermione standing beneath the water reaching across sirius picked up a white towel and draped it over the door for hermione before sinking to the floor and leaning against the bath o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o towel wrapped around her hermione stepped out of the shower and stopped when she saw sirius sitting on the floor one leg stretched out in front of him the other bent at the knee and supporting his arm what are you doing on the floor she asked as he looked up at her with an innocent expression sitting hermione smiled and moved to step past him but was stopped by sirius hand grasping her ankle glancing down at him she met his grey eyes just sit he said softly pulling her down so she curled into his side her wet curls transferring water to his shirt as he wrapped his arms around her they just sat on their bathroom floor and hermione changed her mind there was nothing that compared to this embrace o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o it was mid morning by the time sirius and hermione joined the others in the lounge arthur and bill had arrived and the small couch in the centre of the room was filled with redheads around them were harry remus tonks graham and draco morning everyone sirius greeted softly as he and hermione took a seat glancing over at remus sirius met his eyes anything he asked remus shook his head and held up the rejection letters the occasional red howler showing through the mass of white what are they hermione asked glancing between sirius and remus they re from lawyers remus answered it appears you and sirius are having some difficulty in finding one willing to help a soft knock at the door brought everyone attention away from what they were doing draco closest to the door stood and moved to open it he was greeted by a sophisticated blonde woman her hair was pulled back from her face and elegant navy robes adorned her tall figure she was tall enough to look draco directly in the eyes he was startled slightly into momentarily mistaking her for his mother the warm eyes staring back the only thing proving him wrong err hello he started the blonde nodded in greeting hello i was wondering if sirius and hermione were available draco looked over his shoulder to see sirius making his way over to the door how can i help you he asked vaguely recognizing the witch in front of him hello sirius it been a while seeing sirius fight to remember the face she smiled and held out her hand natasha stonehawk you knew me at hogwarts as natasha tyler i was in ravenclaw an image of the witch in a green haze popped into his head and he sent her a wry grin right natasha stonehawk how can i help you he asked inviting her into the room i hear you re in need of a lawyer i received an owl this morning from remus lupin asking for my services hello remus she greeted spotting the werewolf on the couch good morning he replied thank you for coming natasha grinned at the curious faces around the room always a pleasure to piss off the ministry catching hermione eyes she sent her a warm smile hello hermione it nice to see you again hermione nodded remembering the witch had been civil to her back in her seventh year after letting her know what really happened between monique and sirius in the corridor sirius introduced everyone before natasha wandered over to the fireplace is this elizabeth she asked looking at the one of the many photos decorating the mantle hermione nodded and stepped over to the other witch that was her first christmas she said smiling fondly at the photograph of elizabeth in the bath white flour all through her black hair smiling natasha turned back around to the others sirius had transfigured furniture so a large round table with chairs now occupied the center of the room taking a seat natasha placed her briefcase on the table before putting the photo of elizabeth in the centre right she said taking a seat and pulling out a piece of quill and some parchment the hearing starts tomorrow the ministry wont give up easily but with the wizengamot you have a good chance of getting elizabeth back pausing she looked around the table i need to know as much information as you can give me elizabeth first words her first sign of magic her godparents who held her first anything that will work for your advantage i sure that you could all help sirius and hermione with this molly looked shocked why she asked simply to build our case o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius yawned as he slipped under the covers beside hermione after a long day of questions from natasha they d finally been able to slip off to bed before the trial the next day hermione hmm are you asleep hermione rolled over and opened her eyes to meet sirius across the pillow i love you he whispered reaching out to stroke the side of her face hermione moved closer and let sirius wrap his arms around her i love you too she murmured as she drifted of to the sound of sirius heartbeat o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o daily prophet 24th may 2000 day one of trial the first day of the trial for the custody of elizabeth black through the wizengamot begins today it is rumoured the ministry has hired warrick waslow the hottest attorney out of the wizarding law institute to represent them throughout the trial whereas the blacks have a well established lawyer old school acquaintance natasha stonehawk representing them a widow whose late husband died in the final battle against he who must not be named another prophet special edition will be published later on in the evening on the progress of the trial o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry looked around the immense courtroom as he took his seat it hadntchanged much since his last visit in the centre of the room still sitting ominously was the chair with its chains this surrounded by the seating of the wizengamot in its centric pattern what was obviously different were himself and other observers including the media sitting off to one side of the chair such as it was to be given capital letters there were two tables also placed in the centre of the room on either side of the chair he watched as sirius and hermione took their seats at the one closest to him natasha sitting beside them and pulling out a piece of parchment and a quill to his left sat ginny and the rest of the weasleys to the right draco and tonks harry himself was still quite angry at learning it was deemed unacceptable for remus to enter the courtroom at all glancing up he spotted dumbledore take his seat a few over from the minister and the rest of the wizengamot in their plum coloured robes pulling out parchment and what looked like quills charmed to record what is being said various reporters had their own quills out but looked worryingly like rita skeeter quick quotes quill the muttering around him grew quiet as dumbledore stood o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius met hermione eyes as they took their seats she was pale again and he noted nervous as well pushing down his own butterflies sirius as he sat between her and natasha sent her a small smile he reserved for her only no need to be nervous sweetheart we ll get her back hermione returned the smile and let out her breath nodding in dumbledore direction sirius looked up as dumbledore stood the chief warlock waited for the room to be quiet before continuing this trial i guess we will call it is going to be slightly different from traditional trials no one is going to be punished we are here solely for the purpose of the custody of elizabeth rosalyn black taken from her parents four days ago on the twentieth day of the fifth month dumbledore paused for a moment before continuing we will start with the ministry representative mr waslow then move onto ms stonehawk for opening statements members of the wizengamot can ask questions at any time the court will maintain order or persons will be removed sirius couldnthelp but think the last comment was directed at him especially when dumbledore blue eyes sparkling met his own stormy grey ones nodding at warrick waslow dumbledore took his seat standing waslow moved from behind his desk he was young only a few years older than harry and draco blond hair swept back from his face his black robes of the finest quality thank you albus he started i d like to open the argument for the ministry by directing the courts attention to the prophecy i think we can all agree that the child in the prophecy is in fact elizabeth black that has not yet been proven sirius was shocked at the interruption but smiled slightly as natasha stood and directed the fifty wizards in front of her we have no evidence that elizabeth is in fact the child in this prophecy yet she is the only child of black and blue to be brought in in over a year argued waslow the child in this prophecy may not even be born yet waslow nodded it is assumed that elizabeth black is the child in the prophecy i will direct the courts attention to the first line natasha took her seat and sirius met hermione eyes they new what was coming next born to the two of time stolen an infant of black and blue mister black may i ask how long you were wrongly imprisoned for twelve years sirius answered waslow nodded so in other words you had twelve year of your life stolen from you sirius nodded a yes or no mr black yes i had twelve years of my life stolen from me sirius couldnthelp but glare at the minister at this he of course wasntthe one that put sirius away but he felt obliged to send his look anyway right then waslow continued mrs black is it not true that you were sent back in time at the end of your sixth year at hogwarts yes that true hermione answered and it is true that you were put in a time trap was it yes for twelve years hermione said before waslow could get his next question out turning back to the wizengamot he sent them a charming smile from the statements just given i think we can agree that both mr and mrs black have had time stolen meaning we can reach the conclusion that elizabeth is in fact the child mentioned in the prophecy up on the stands the quills in front of the wizengamot were scribbling across the pages taking down everything that was said next to sirius and hermione in front of natasha a similar quill was doing the same thing standing once again natasha again argued her point i disagree again there is no definite proof that the child in the prophecy is elizabeth what if sirius and hermione decide to have another child and that child bears the same resemblance as elizabeth members of the wizengamot nodded and an old witch beside dumbledore spoke up we ll assume that there is the possibility that the child in the prophecy could be elizabeth but not conclusively mr waslow i ask that you refrain from jumping to that conclusion again waslow cocked his head in acquiescence of course smarmy bastard sirius mumbled under his breath which earned him two kicks from under the table one from either side considering the high possibility waslow continued that elizabeth is indeed the child in the prophecy i would like to bring the courts attention to the final line a new peril in the air should this infant be taken this is the ministry primary concern and reason for taking elizabeth to protect the wizarding community and alternatively the child from this new peril nodding to natasha waslow took his seat standing and mimicking waslow natasha moved out from behind the desk at the beginning of this trial albus dumbledore stated that elizabeth was taken from her parents four days ago the manner in which she was taken clearly puts the ministry credibility on the line waslow stood the blacks gave the ministry no choice they knew they should have brought the child in well before now natasha turned to her opponent they did what any other parent would do and protected their child the child needed no protection from the ministry they do not condone harming helpless children yet they condone releasing a private and confidential prophecy and then forcefully taking a child from her parents in not one but two attempts again it was for the protection of the wizarding community as a whole mr waslow waslow turned to dumbledore please let ms stonehawk finish waslow took his seat and natasha continued i ll direct the courts attention to wizarding decree three hundred and two subsection b paragraph a the primary rights to custody of children these rights fall to that of their parents if that is not possible primary guardians and finally into the care of the government the key fact here is that the ministry had no right taking elizabeth from the care of her parents over on the other desk waslow had picked up a spare quill and was scribbling something on a piece of parchment i d like to hear from her parents please sirius looked up at a black haired witch with green eyes a few seats behind dumbledore natasha nodded and turned to sirius and hermione the witch that had spoken pushed forward the first question you are both involved in the care of elizabeth she asked looking between the couple we are sirius answered you have a stable place of residence other than hogwarts we did sirius answered again it was destroyed a little after christmas the ministry has no record of this interrupted waslow mr black would you like to explain our home was destroyed by a fire in january my godson and his partner were lucky to get out alive a tall wizard near the front spoke up what then was your reason for not reporting this to the ministry sirius sent a pointed look to the minister we knew that the ministry was after elizabeth we wanted to keep as low profile as possible a report was filed with auror tonks our house put down as muggle to protect elizabeth sirius smiled at marlene yes to protect elizabeth mrs black the tall wizard proceeded you are muggle born is that correct yes hermione answered what experience do you have of raising a magical child then he continued hermione frowned none but not all witches and wizards muggle born or not has experience at raising a child mr black what is your level of raising a child sirius glared at the tall wizard he did not like this man or where his questions were heading i helped my friends raise my godson for his first year of life so you have more experience than your wife then sirius shook his head and smiled at hermione no i d never say that he turned back to the court hermione is a natural mother its instinct not experience you do not think trained ministry officials would be able to raise elizabeth in a stable environment at the same time as keeping the community safe sirius was about to jump to his feet but hermione beat him to it elizabeth is our daughter we will raise her how we deem best fit not by some trained caregiver this is not a trivial issue mrs black this is the entire wizarding community we are talking about no it isn t sirius was beside hermione now and natasha stood to try to calm them both down as sirius voice rang through the room this is about elizabeth and elizabeth only you took her from us and we dontknow where she is we donteven know if she alright or not she could be scared out of her mind and we are not there for her we re not there because of you silence had descended on the room throughout sirius speech and tompkinson was glaring at the finger pointed in his direction ms stonehawk please calm your clients down he stated placidly as if nothing had happened please sirius just sit down you re not helping matters sirius removed his arm from natasha grip and sat down resting his head in his hand as he took a deep breath i believe now would be a good time for a short recess dumbledore said addressing the room ten minutes should be enough noise broke out around the room as people stood to stretch their legs this is going to be a long day sirius muttered as he lifted his head and met hermione eyes you guys are doing brilliantly natasha commented from beside them just try not to lose your temper so much it works against you i dontknow hermione argued with a small smile i think sirius impressed some of them with his little speech o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when the trial resumed waslow stood again to address the court mr and mrs black why is it you did not come to the ministry as soon as you read about the prophecy in the paper waslow clasped his hands together before looking between the two eyebrows raised waiting for an answer we had no reason to trust the ministry sirius answered and why is that is the ministry not here to serve and act for the wellbeing of the public sirius scoffed our past encounters with the ministry have not exactly been great enough to warrant a level of trust explain please the tall wizard asked they seem to think wrongly imprisoning a man for twelve years warrants an apology and nothing else they accuse albus dumbledore a wizard of this court and harry potter of being crazy when voldemort returned audible hisses and gasps were heard about the room as hermione picked up from where sirius left off the ministry is also known to have had dealings with death eaters in the past you have no evidence of this mrs black argued tompkinson lucius malfoy hermione stated simply yes well that was that fool fudge doing in the past death eaters have no hold on the ministry now this is not the point interrupted waslow you should have come to the ministry immediately well said sirius we didn t and you put the entire wizarding community at risk with your actions and what happened to the community natasha asked well stated waslow caught slightly off guard nothing as of yet but she is only an infant then why did you take her asked hermione quietly the hall fell silent waiting for an answer the guarantee her safety answered tompkinson we cantkeep an eye on her when she is with you she is safe with us hermione argued back is that right asked tompkinson who was it again that let her go chaos erupted as not only sirius but half the spectators most of which were in the front row leapt to their feet in anger the wizengamot attempted to quieten the court as waslow returned to his seat smile in place sirius sirius stopped yelling as dumbledore voice rose above the rest sit down please sirius dumbledore pleaded to sirius with his blue eyes to just cooperate sirius nodded and sat down taking hermione hand in his minister tompkinson looked around we will take a break for lunch then reconvene for the days closing statements before returning tomorrow natasha stood with all due respect minister but we have all afternoon to work with tompkinson looked down at her frowning with all due respect ms stonehawk i have a magical nation to run as well o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the evening prophet special edition 24th may 2000 day one of custody battle the first day of the custody hearing for elizabeth black took place today in dramatic proceedings the ministry representative warrick waslow started the proceedings by bringing up the issue of public safety quoting numerous times from the prophecy itself the blacks representative natasha stonehawk came back with a very convincing knowledge of the law accusing the ministry of violating the parental rights of sirius and hermione black the trial continued like this for much of the day with sirius black losing his temper on more than one occasion though normally when a member of the court criticized his wife the trial continues tomorrow and could possibly bring forward a completely new set of issues to the picture o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

glanced out the tall window as the snow flakes drifted slowly down to the white landscape below no doubt there would be a snowball fight later if the weather cleared up there always was remus turned his amber eyes from the wintry sight to the book on his lap the christmas holidays were always a good time for some recreational reading for the small third year a loud noise from the direction of the portrait alerted him to his friends falling through the entrance to the gryffindor tower remus didnthide his small smile as james and sirius attempted to untangle themselves from each other glancing up both boys looked around to make sure no one had seen the incident it alright remus commented from across the room i the only one here your pride is still intact sirius and james grinned at each other before heading over to join remus remus looked on at his two much taller friends the past summer had been a rather speedy growing session for both boys leaving the already small remus far behind sirius told him not to worry and that he d most likely have a sudden growth spurt and will be looking down on them eventually what cha up to remus sirius asked snatching the book from his grasp i was reading remus answered with a friendly glare sirius shrugged and to remus horror threw the book onto a nearby chair sirius you really should be a little more careful the werewolf admonished but moony sirius started ignoring remus cringe at the nickname the boys had bestowed upon him minutes after confronting him a few months ago about his lycanthropy i need your undivided attention remus sighed what have you done now james looked affronted nothing what makes you so sure we ve done something ok answered remus what are you planning sirius grinned at turned to james he knows us too well o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o i cantbelieve i let you two talk me into this remus said currently crouched near the slytherin common room where peter sirius grinned at his friend we need you re brains peters not exactly up there with you on that front or your furry little problem skills james added before turning to sirius ready sirius grin grew i was born ready let do this remus if you will remus sighed again and rolled his eyes before tapping the bag of dungbombs with his wand and muttering a small charm brilliant said james standing up with sirius now we wait a few minutes later a slytherin came up to the portrait and looked around before murmuring the password after the portrait had swung back shut james and sirius turned to remus with expectant expressions snakes fang remus informed the pair thanks mate we ll be right back sirius said standing up unless you want to come with us remus shook his head it alright i ll wait here just donttake too long o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o remus felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck and he tried to sink further into the shadows sirius and james had been gone for about three minutes before footsteps resounded off the moist walls what do we have here remus shoulders sagged slightly as the tall blonde walked over to him i am allowed in the dungeons lucius he replied picking up his courage malfoy cocked his head to the side that may be but it slytherin territory you know how we feel about gryffindors especially little ones whose friends are no where around remus noted malfoy wand in his hand but didnttry for his oi malfoy what are you doing remus turned to see sirius and james heading towards the pair malfoy sneered ah look your little protectors are here leave him alone sirius ordered stepping between the blond and his friend sirius remus started it alright sirius ignored his small friend off to the side james had his wand drawn just in case why do you have your wand pointed at remus sirius asked i was merely wondering why he was in the dungeons alone sirius grey eyes glared at the pale wizard in front of him no reason to draw your wand on him i suggest you leave him alone is that a threat you bet it a threat you ll have me and me james added to deal with if you so much as touch a hair on his head malfoy gaze was cold but he was outnumbered with one last snide glare he spun on his heel and headed for the dormitories you alright sirius asked turning to remus fine you didnthave to do that remus said a little embarrassed with by the whole thing sirius shrugged we stood up for you yeah added james that what marauders do look out for each other years later once remus was on par on the height department with his friends and proven his worth many a time over the black haired boys would still stand up for him and some things just never change o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o 25th may 2000 sirius woke the morning of the second day of the trial and groaned his head was pounding more than any hangover had ever caused wrapped in the duvet he vaguely felt hermione shift beside him before her presence disappeared a few minutes of what sirius could describe only as pure torture though he has been known to exaggerate someone sat beside him on the edge of the bed startling him you know hermione started her voice just to the side if you werentwhite as a ghost and moaning like you d just lost your manhood i would have found it amusing that for once i managed to sneak up on you sirius opened one grey eye and glared at his wife amused expression here she offered holding up a goblet drink this it will help with the headache and probably taste like crap too sirius muttered sitting up slightly but taking the potion nonetheless swallowing the think liquid as the pain in his head subsided his eyes followed hermione around the room she had lost some weight over the past few days though he didntblame her food didntexactly hold the same appeal as it did a week ago the pallor colour of her face had eased slightly bringing a small amount of life back into her features however she still had that shaky aspect to her smile and hollowness in her eyes that sirius saw every time he looked in the mirror better hermione asked sitting back down on the edge of the bed sirius nodded thank you he said moving to get up and stopping hermione in the process she was all dressed for the day bar her hair which was tied quickly at the back come here sirius murmured and positioned hermione in front of him gently running his fingers through her hair he began their ritual of plaiting her curls into a long plait to hang down her back voices in the other room alerted the couple to the others all up and ready for another day china could be heard rattling as morning drinks were prepared i would kill for a coffee sirius said breaking the silence hermione stood plait completed and pulled a face i dontknow how you can drink that stuff sirius grinned slightly headache all but gone and pulled a good pair of black robes from the closet its good gets the blood pumping hermione shook her head and moved to the door leaving sirius to finish getting dressed as she went to see the others o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when sirius entered the room he looked around natasha was sitting at the large table still present in the middle of the room her quill flying over the parchment remus was talking to arthur off to the side while harry draco and the remaining weasley helped themselves to the breakfast the house elves had provided he moved over to hermione who handed him a steaming cup of coffee smiling he took it and brought the hot liquid to his lips where tonks has asked looking around the room again remus caught his fianc es name and looked up i let her sleep in couldntwake her he answered with a smile tapping at the window alerted the room to an owl wanting in fred was the closest and opened the latch taking the letter from the regal looking owl before it flew off glancing at the ministry seal he turned it over and looked up at remus it for you he said stepping over and handing it to the werewolf remus shared a glance with sirius whose grey eyes were suddenly concerned natasha had stopped writing and had her eyes on the letter a small frown on her face breaking the seal remus opened the envelope and pulled out the parchment his amber eyes scanning the letter as sirius moved over to him the door flew open and tonks rushed in a similar piece of parchment clutched in her hands i ve been subpoenaed she announced to the room remus looked up so have i o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the courtroom was set out identically to that of the day before save for the extra table placed slightly further back from sirius and hermione where remus tonks and two aurors sat remus was in his best robes his own despite sirius attempts to convince his friend to borrow a pair of his sitting beside remus tonks had opted not to wear her regulation auror robes and saw the disapproval on tompkinson face as she walked into the room her hair was still long and black with the vivid red streaks through the front that had appeared when elizabeth was taken beside tonks sat another auror this one in his scarlet robes and when sirius and hermione entered the room he ducked his head and avoided their eyes the auror beside him was one tonks new he was a good man tall and broad shouldered the only reason for him not to go on strike was his continuing belief of protecting the community sans a child neither remus nor tonks had been at the trial the previous day but had received a detailed account from the others it came to no surprise then that when waslow stood to begin the pair exchanged a glance that caused tonks some difficulty at suppressing a grin yesterday he started addressing the room as a whole we stressed the point of the safety of the wizarding community and although i cannot stress this enough i have another matter i would like to present to the court he paused and looked directly at sirius i believe that out of the ministry care with her parents elizabeth safety her life even is compromised beside tonks remus stiffened and his sensitive hearing could pick up the low growl sirius appeared to be emitting meters away at the front waslow was taken aback that the blacks didntjump down his throat perhaps they learnt their lesson from the day before mr waslow dumbledore said a curious expression on his face would you please enlighten the court if only myself why you deem hogwarts unsafe for a child to grow up waslow nodded i d like to call up remus lupin to answer a few questions sirius turned his head and met remus eyes remus could tell his childhood friend was none too pleased with the situation and the lycan hoped he wouldntdo anything rash to compromise the case remus stood as the broad shouldered auror escorted him to the center of the room adequately disguising his slight limp to all but those that knew him if you d please take a seat waslow instructed indicating to the chair remus sat and waslow waved his wand suddenly silver shackles appeared holding remus wrists and ankles in place remus clenched his teeth to bite back the scream his breath hissing through his lips as the silver burnt his flesh sirius was on his feet in an instant making his way quickly behind natasha fallen chair which had tipped when the witch had risen to her feet tonks flew past sirius and sank to her knees beside remus her hands going automatically for the silver trapping her fianc hermione had her wand drawn and while tonks attempted to remove the shackles with her bare hands hermione tried with her wand most of the room was in chaos but sirius voice could again be heard over the din as he advanced on waslow his wand pointed directly at the other mans throat take them off now he ordered grey eyes flashing dangerously take them off now or i swear to you you wontbe able to fight this case at all suddenly the silver shackles disappeared and sirius and hermione glanced up at the wizengamot while tonks tried to alleviate remus pain it was not as most would have suspected dumbledore who was standing with his wand drawn but the minister himself i will not have this type of behaviour in this court he stated glaring at his representative sirius moved over to remus and placed a hand on his shoulder silently asking if he was alright remus nodded as the noise around the room died down sirius glanced down at his friends wrists and bit back the bile that rose in his throat they were red and raw almost identical to what he had seen in his dream remus hanging lifelessly from the tree hands bound behind his back suddenly bandages obstructed his view and sirius glanced up at hermione before turning back to remus sirius remus asked are you alright with another quick glance at remus wrists sirius swallowed i fine he said quietly are you sure you re ok remus nodded again before thanking hermione for the bandages sirius felt a hand on his arm and turned to meet hermione eyes you re awfully pale she commented i ok sirius insisted before hermione could continue nodding once again at remus sirius returned to his seat hermione hesitating before following tonks was still crouched beside remus and was reluctantly pulled away to be taken back to her seat waslow cleared his throat i apologize i merely thought precautions should be taken into consideration marlene glaring at the wizard spoke up you were gravely mistaken mr waslow many of us have children or grandchildren who have been taught by professor lupin i think if we trust him with our children questions in a courtroom would be a walk in the park i disagree the room turned to the tall thin wizard who had berated hermione the day before about being a muggle born i will not go into the issue of a half breed teaching innocent children today but mr waslow had sufficient grounds to take the action that he did you may continue mr waslow waslow nodded and turned to remus what is your relationship with the blacks mr lupin remus who looked awfully pale a glossy sheen of sweat covering his features took a breath before answering somewhat hoarsely they are my closest friends waslow turned back to the court my question is this what kind of parents would befriend a dangerous half breed what state of mind are the blacks in what would be next a vampire mr lupin he continued turning back to remus what is your relationship with elizabeth black and remember you are in a court of law you are required to tell the truth between natasha and hermione sirius was literally seething as waslow presented his new case remus eyes flashed as he met waslow own blue pair elizabeth is my goddaughter audible gasps from the media made harry and the others turn and glare apparently this was deemed unacceptable in the opinion of the public your goddaughter waslow asked eyebrows raised interesting mr black he said turning to sirius what on earth possessed you to name a half breed a godparent to your baby daughter sirius glared because i trust remus with my life and that of my family s is that so is it not true that a number of years ago he almost killed members of your so called family namely your godson and wife sirius shifted in his seat that was not remus that was the werewolf but mr lupin is a werewolf is he not surely you wouldntwant to take the same risk after all it has happened before remus would not harm elizabeth sirius stated again how can you be so sure waslow asked sending another glance at remus who had his amber eyes on sirius because sirius answered meeting remus eyes remus would kill himself before he harms the ones he loves he like that moony is sirius said turning back to the court with a small smile always was a self sacrificing prat nonetheless you have put your daughter in danger i think you have stressed that point waslow natasha said standing up and moving around the table i d like to ask a few questions now waslow nodded instead of natasha turning to remus she turned to sirius and hermione mr black how long have you been friends with mr lupin for almost thirty years now so it is safe to say that you know mr lupin well enough to make a wise decision about making him godfather to your daughter sirius nodded the only person i know better than remus is hermione it seemed fitting to appoint him godfather yet interrupted waslow you spent twelve years in azkaban a man can change a lot in twelve years a half breed likely more sirius shook his head not remus tell us sirius natasha said glaring at waslow for interrupting who was it who held elizabeth in their arms first apart from you and your wife remus sirius answered automatically and what was her first word moony tell the court the significance of that word sirius moony is remus nickname from hogwarts i use it all the time i guess elizabeth picked up on it harry did the same when he was a baby i afraid i dontunderstand said the tall wizard in the stands what any of this has to do with elizabeth waslow eagerly stepped forward to answer i am merely trying to present to the court a reason for declining the blacks request for custody and i am merely trying to prove remus integrity integrity waslow asked from a half breed alright mcalister he said turning to the broad shouldered auror please bring miss tonks forward natasha still standing in the middle of the room with waslow conjured a chair for tonks to sit on next to remus tonks had barely sat down before waslow began asking questions miss tonks what is your relationship with mr lupin intimate tonks answered without preamble walsow opened his mouth slightly shocked at the answer sirius allowed himself a small chuckle at his cousin miss tonks that is a ring on your finger is it not tonks glanced down at her ring she didnteven think she d be able to take it off now if she tried yes it is you are aware miss tonks of the current laws regarding werewolves and their right to marry i am mr lupin answer this if your integrity is as great as your friends would have the court to believe why propose if you know about the laws tonks noted with concern that remus was shaking slightly but he answered nonetheless the laws were being changed tonks and i had no plans to follow through with marriage until this happened yet the laws were not passed and you are in a committed relationship with not only a witch but a high ranking auror i think you can see why that would be suspicious you canthelp who you fall in love with tonks answered clasping remus hand in her own shocked at the clamminess love asked a member of the wizengamot quite a strong word to use in the same context as someone who is not human sirius was on his feet why dontyou just keep your bloody prejudices to your fucking self sirius said dumbledore everyone is entitled to their opinion sit down sirius glared at the wizard who had spoken and sat down waslow who was looking at sirius with a raised eyebrow shook his head before turning back to tonks i ll ask the same question i asked your fianc he said turning the word over on his tongue like it was foreign what is your relationship with elizabeth she is my goddaughter waslow turned back to the court let run this through shall we mr and mrs black not only endanger their child by granting basic guardianship to a werewolf but they also chose a witch to be godmother who clearly from her choice of relations is not the most stable person to be around a child you son of a bitch tonks started standing sit down nymphradora dumbledore instructed there was concern in his blue eyes but also a warning right now they were in much more danger than mere questions on relationships miss tonks waslow continued you are a metamorphmagus are you not yes you are known around the ministry and even with your closest friends as having a rather colourful streak yes why is it then you come here with long black hair what does my hair have to do with anything answer the question a witch said from the back tonks shrugged grateful that her robes covered her four month pregnancy i wanted to wear it long it has been like this for most of the year though has it not asked waslow i do have people who can back this up if you feel like denying the claim tonks didntanswer very well then i ll turn the courts attention to this he held up a piece of parchment i quote metamorphmagi show certain characteristics in relevance to pregnancy the primary one being unable to control their morphing abilities the key sign being the green or yellow hue the hair takes now i believe that if miss tonks here is pregnant it not only breaks a number of laws but also throws all of mr lupin so called integrity out of the window why give elizabeth back to the dangers to the risks of that kind of environment natasha had had enough you re pulling at desperate straws here waslow there is no relevance to elizabeth custody in this ms stonehawk said the wizard who d caused sirius outburst earlier i think that there are a number of members of this court and the public who would disagree after all the safety of elizabeth and the community is the primary concern here hermione glanced up at sirius who met her eyes she was worried now more than ever their case hung in the balance miss tonks waslow said turning back to her if you would please demonstrate to the court your morphing abilities tonks didntturn to remus nor did she turn to sirius and hermione she didntlet waslow or the wizengamot see any fear any doubt in her violet eyes scrunching her face she concentrated on her trademark short pink hair across to the side sirius couldnttear his eyes away from his cousin as much as he didntwant to watch he couldntnot watch to his amazement tonks managed to keep her hair pink and when she opened her eyes again waslow suddenly had an extreme fear of the colour violet dumbledore smiled i believe that part of your case just failed mr waslow we will return after a lunch period thirty minutes should do sirius stood as soon as parchment could be heard rolling up throughout the room and headed over to remus moving quickly when remus stood and shakily fell to his knees alright my ass sirius mumbled as he crouched down beside remus to help him up we need to get you back to hogwarts i ok remus insisted i just need to lie down for a while can you get him back to poppy sirius asked tonks who didntlook to good herself tonks shook her head this is really draining me sirius i need to get out of here sirius turned to hermione who handed him a piece of parchment portkey she murmured it will take them straight to the hospital wing o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o outside of the courtroom harry draco and the weasleys stood in a small group i can not believe what just went on in there harry exclaimed finally able to release his frustration how could the wizengamot let that happen harry arthur said softly not everyone shares the same views that we do with regard to werewolves there will be a lot of people out there who believe sirius and hermione have given elizabeth an unsafe environment harry glared at no one in particular the whole group had been disgusted at what they had witnessed during the morning but there was nothing they could do about it it was in the hands of the wizengamot twenty five minutes later the group made to move back into the room when draco caught sight of a familiar face off to the side trying to catch his eye i ll be back soon draco said to bill who was closest before heading off towards blaise how is it going in there the ex slytherin asked as draco stepped up beside him hard to tell from our point of view its hands down but there are some bigoted people in there hm answered blaise look we found where they have elizabeth draco looked up suddenly where look i cantget sirius or hermione in there is just no way unless they wanted to take her wait what are you trying to say i can get you in draco but only to see her there is no way you can take her with you why not draco asked firstly i can probably get you in more than once so if sirius and hermione dontget custody then you can go back to get her out secondly i think they will get custody so we dontreally want you on the run from the ministry for kidnapping draco nodded fine take me to her are you sure just to see if she ok i promise i wonttake her blaise looked dubious but nodded alright he said pulling out an id badge from his robes and handing it to draco who this draco asked looking at the red head with short hair and round glasses that my friend is you the ministry seems to be having a slight problem with that bracelet of yours they re enlisting anyone they can who may be able to remove it i ve added this alias into the system but elizabeth wontrecognize me once we re in they wontbe able to see us one of you re requests was to have no surveillance because of the effect the charms have on your spells and the ministry agreed to this that the drawback you only have twenty minutes they figure if you cant work it out in that amount of time you wontbe able to work it out at all draco nodded let do this then weasl fy me o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o if draco had to admit one thing it was that blaise knew what he was doing somewhere wherever they were in the ministry blaise had the location of elizabeth down twists of corridors false walls and hidden charms the ministry had gone all out to protect the prophesized child blaise slowed and draco felt his heartbeat quicken you have to promise me not to take her this a big risk draco no matter what do not take elizabeth draco nodded right in we go mr schnitzer draco followed blaise into the small room where a witch sat at a desk ah mr hols i see you ve brought with you dr schitzer she said sending a smile to the red head draco nodded in greeting i ll just take the wards down for you now are you sure you need all of these down i dontthink the minister would be too pleased if we werentwatching her i cantdo my work without them answered draco and i think the minister would be pleased just to have this problem solved the witch nodded of course just take the corridor that way it the third door on the left draco nodded and moved without waiting for blaise to catch up when he reached the right door he turned the knob gently and eased it open oh merlin he breathed as he saw elizabeth sitting in a little playpen on the floor the rest of the room failing to grab his attention as he moved over to the small child wait draco whispered blaise coming in behind him and closing the door as elizabeth looked up at the two new faces draco paused remembering his appearance and turned back to blaise who preformed the charm turning back draco felt his heart skip as elizabeth recognized him she pulled herself up immediately and attempted to reach him bending down draco picked her up and he felt her small arms move around his neck as she giggled in happiness merlin he murmured glad that she seemed alright at first glance o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione frowned as she glanced over at the crowed wondering where draco was she didnthave time to ponder it too much before the court resumed for the afternoon apparently today the minister didnthave any further plans and was happy for the trial to continue natasha stood first this time eager to begin with her witness and final piece of her case to the court all morning we have heard about elizabeth safety and her wellbeing in the care of her parents she began walking around the other side of the desk mr waslow here has attempted to make a case that elizabeth is not safe outside of the ministry care this afternoon i intend to disprove this she turned to tompkinson to begin minister who if you were to name one specific person would you deem to be a protector a fighter if you will that will lay their life down for another just one name sir will do harry potter tompkinson answered with a frown natasha smiled apparently the minister had given her the exact answer she was after did you realize minister and the rest of the room that although we heard this morning that yes remus lupin is elizabeth godfather and he is a werewolf but that harry potter is around her just as much as remus now i know for a fact that mister potter would not be happy with this comparison of sorts but it appears that these kinds of comparisons appeal to some people natasha was pleased to see members of the wizengamot nod moving on mr black what was the first thing you did when the ministry came to the hospital wing on the day of elizabeth first birthday while the aurors where there or when they d left sirius asked when they had left we packed up immediately remus and tonks house was safe we went there we knew no matter how safe hogwarts is we couldntrisk someone snatching elizabeth in the middle of the night natasha nodded thank you sirius i would like to ask junior auror blake to come forward hermione turned around and gasped as the young auror that had been sitting with remus and tonks in the morning stood and walked up hesitating slightly before sitting in the chair sirius looked down at hermione confusion in his grey eyes auror blake natasha started you were at the house when elizabeth was taken into ministry custody were you not yes i was can you describe to the court what you witnessed that morning there were too many aurors and officials to fit into the small room but those that could sent spells at the blacks and where was elizabeth at this time in her mother arms mrs black was trying her best to shield her from most of the spells natasha nodded at auror blake to continue and he took a deep breath obviously uncomfortable where he was but seemingly glad to help they fought to protect elizabeth mr black was injured badly yet he still managed to keep up protective shields neither he nor his wife had their wands they did all humanly possible to protect their child and what other role did you play auror blake blake turned to hermione his eyes apologetic i i took elizabeth from her mothers arms hermione had tears rolling down her face as she relived the memory or elizabeth warmth slipping away i took her blake continued i took her and even as i was doing so mrs black was pleading for me not to she was barley conscious i believe her shoulder was dislocated her arm broken and her foot injured yet she still had the strength to hold onto her daughter thank you auror blake i have no further questions warrick did you want to ask anything waslow shook his head no i am quite ready for my closing remarks thank you natasha nodded very well then dumbledore said standing we will hear once more from both parties then retire for the remainder of the day he glanced apologetically at sirius and hermione though i believe some of us already know which way we will decide others may need time to think it over and go over their notes therefore first thing tomorrow morning we will reconvene here and vote on the situation immediately mr waslow you may go first i will say this and i can not stress this enough the safety of the wizarding community lies on the outcome of this case if you give elizabeth back to her parents you are putting all that we have built since the fall of he who must not be named in jeopardy not only that but it is clear that elizabeth is not safe in her home environment and unless mr and mrs black sever all ties with mr lupin you can not in your right minds let her go home to that situation thank you for your time i hope you make you re decisions logically natasha stood all this time the ministry has been adamant that elizabeth is safest with them in their care but it not the same you can not raise a child like that she will be a shell sirius cringed as natasha unknowingly used the words he had used to describe the witch he had seen in his dream to hermione the prophecy if the prophecy is so important to the ministry then take this into consideration before you make your decision a new peril in the air should this child be taken well she was taken you took her and if you choose not to give her back then i d look forward to the peril in store for you thank you o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o blaise looked on as draco played with elizabeth on the small play mat his blond friend had already activated the tracking charm before inspecting elizabeth for any injuries apart from the small child having lost some weight she appeared to be lacking any other injuries draco blaise murmured we need to go draco looked up before looking back down at elizabeth with resignation come here lizzie he murmured he was the only one to do that he mused as he picked elizabeth up again the only one to shorten her name come on draco they ll get suspicious you be good ok draco said to elizabeth you ll be back with your mummy and daddy in no time he moved to put elizabeth back in the small play pen when she let out a whimper of protest behind him blaise had stepped forward ready to change draco appearance again i sorry lizzie he murmured stepping back his grey eyes stinging as elizabeth started to wail in earnest the familiarity of draco features disappearing as she reached out for him i sorry o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 27 say it isntso o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione and sirius walked silently through the halls of hogwarts the day events replaying through both their minds the others had decided it was best to leave the pair alone and had gone their separate ways hermione smiled at sirius as they reached their chambers sirius holding the door open for her to walk through inside tonks and remus were waiting for the pair on the couch tonks hair was back to her natural black locks as she curled up next to remus who though his eyes were closed was gently running a hand through her hair sirius and hermione moved into the room and sat opposite their friends how did it go tonks asked as remus opened his eyes in lieu of the new arrivals we find out tomorrow answered sirius how are you guys doing just a little tired remus answered quietly madame pomfrey wasnttoo happy with us tonks continued placing her hands on her slightly rounded stomach she said that when i attempted to control my morphing i endangered the baby is the baby alright hermione asked concerned tonks nodded i under strict orders not to do that again hermione and sirius exchanged a guilty look don t murmured remus dontfeel guilty we d do it again in a heartbeat no you won t argued sirius there is no way you re going through that again remus what did poppy say about the silver tonks looked down at her hands and remus glanced at his bandaged wrists moony tonks looked up she said that if remus is exposed to any more silver his chances of making through are slim to none o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco hair once more the blonde locks that fell just past his shoulders and eyes again a piercing silver made his way through the empty corridors of his old school elizabeth cries still punctured his thoughts and he tried to push them aside as he approached sirius and hermione rooms opening the door he was slightly shocked to see only four people in the room where he was used to seeing a small crowd noting the blatant looks of concern on sirius and hermione features draco turned i sorry i ll come back later he said stepping back towards the door wait hermione said standing up and heading towards the blonde you werentat the trial this afternoon are you alright draco nodded and stepped back slightly as sirius came to stand behind hermione his grey eyes glaring at the younger wizard malfoy he started reverting back to draco surname where have you been confused at sirius tone hermione turned her head to face him shocked at the look he was sending draco who was standing his ground sirius hermione asked sirius glanced down at her are you not a least a little curious as to why draco here smells like elizabeth sirius asked his somewhat heightened senses picking up on the scent better than his wife s hermione eyes widened as she turned back to draco what draco glared right back at sirius not letting the older man intimidate him draco hermione snapped bringing his attention to her i he started not actually too sure where in fact to start by this time tonks and remus had turned to face the group and draco was becoming uncomfortable with the scrutiny he was currently under i went to an old friend for some help the zabini work for ministry intellegence he explained i asked if they could find elizabeth for you they did sirius ventured draco nodded blaise came to me at midday today why didntyou wait hermione whispered i had no choice the next thing draco knew he was up against the wall sirius fists in his robes what gave you the right he asked voice low what gave you the right to assume you could just sirius hermione said placing her hand on his arm let him go sirius glared once more and dropped draco before turning and striding into the bedroom the door slamming behind him i just wanted to see if she was alright draco said softly is she hermione asked softly her eyes on the door to the bedroom yeah for now o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione entered the bedroom to find sirius pacing she stood off to the side watching him till he stopped and turned to her what he started pointing in the direction of the living room gives him the right he didnteven let us know about this venture with the zabinis why did he get to hold her why does he get the scent of elizabeth on his robes sirius voice cracked when his daughters name passed his lips and he sank to his knees hermione moving over next to him why cant i sirius whispered tears in his grey eyes now soft and sorrowful as he pulled hermione into his arms o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o 26th may 2000 hermione felt the warm sun stream onto her face and she sighed rolling over her knees colliding with sirius opening her eyes she was greeted by two pools of grey staring back sorry hermione murmured sirius smiled gently it alright i was already awake hermione returned the smile and rolled onto her back smile still on her face today she whispered sirius chuckled he knew exactly what she meant o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when sirius hermione and the others arrived at the ministry the atrium was brimming with witches and wizards under an auror escort which dumbledore had insisted on the group minus remus and tonks made their way through every second person had a sign of sorts some proclaiming the good of the ministry with sayings plastered on them like for the community while people shouted abuse at sirius and hermione how can they let an azkaban convict raise a child mudblood you re a horrible mother hermione fought back the tears as they made their way through there was however also shouts of support a lot from old school friends or ex students who also carried signs that boldly went against the ministry it was nearing the courtroom however when they felt relieved they had left remus and tonks back at the castle give the wolf more silver someone had even started up a chant kill the beast kill the beast it was getting out of control aurors were fighting back witches and wizards who felt their opinion in the matter was valid enough for action sirius was growling low in his throat but hermione gripped his hand tightly there was a time and a place to stand up for remus unfortunately it was not this day o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the courtroom was silent as sirius and hermione took their seats next to natasha the media was highly anticipating the outcome either way it was good news for them papers sales had been through the roof all week the only empty seat left in the room was the ministers apparently everyone could wait for him the doors opened and sirius eyes narrowed as a man in familiar aubergine robes entered the room as he passed sirius the smell of cigar smoke and cherry reached his nose sirius hermione asked hmm why are you growling sirius glanced at hermione and cleared his throat before glancing at the minister taking a seat in his aubergine robes no reason he answered as dumbedore rose tompkinson looked extremely nervous his face pale as he turned to dumbledore i think everyone here would like to keep this short is there any members who have yet to make a decision dumbledore asked hermione scanned the stands in front of her no one stepped forward very well dumbledore continued the decision made today is final this is as far as the wizarding court system goes no matter the authority involved custody of elizabeth rosalyn black will be decided now those who believe elizabeth should stay in ministry custody please raise your hands sirius and hermione watched as hands began to rise there were fifty wizengamot members twenty six hands and it would be the end of the road the tall wizard at the front hand rose immediately followed by the witches and wizards who had been opposed to remus the minister also had his hand in the air sirius took hermione hand felt her squeeze back dumbledore nodded those who believe elizabeth should be with her parents the aging headmaster raised his hand first followed by marlene one by one hands went up into the air sirius tried to keep up counting each hand twenty twenty four twenty five thirty laughing sirius stood and pulled hermione out of her chair and wrapped his arms tightly around her burying his face in her curls across to the side they could hear cheers from their friends a take that you rotten bastards from what sounded very much like fred weasley sirius felt hermione tremble and pulled back to look down at her face tear tracks streamed down her cheeks but her smile was wide and her chocolate eyes bright leaning down sirius placed a soft lingering kiss on her lips before pulling back lets go get our baby hermione nodded as sirius glanced up at the minister who seemed to be in a rush to leave he the only one here who knows where she is hermione said from his side tompkinson sirius called as the minister walked across the room no way he muttered before taking off after tompkinson who had suddenly broken out into a run harry watched as sirius and hermione eyes followed the minister before sirius took off after him hermione on his heels without turning around harry leapt over the small barrier to the main floor and followed glancing over his shoulder draco and bill were right behind him leaving behind four rather confused weasley s o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius tore down the corridor after the man in the aubergine robes hermione close on his heels tompkinson sirius roared as the man entered one of the elevators the doors closing in front of them seconds later sirius and hermione were in the other just catching a glimpse of harry bill and draco following as the door closed why the hell is he running sirius asked frustrated beside him hermione agreed but couldnthide the happiness from her eyes they had their daughter back as the doors dinged open at the atrium sirius glanced out and spotted the crowd parting and a flash of the aubergine fabric hermione was beside him this time her smaller frame finding it easier to get through the crowd stop him sirius shouted somewhere in the crowd people opposed to the ministry stepped forward blocking tompkinson exit hermione reached him first and grabbed his arm spinning around the minister grabbed hermione other arm squeezing tightly causing her to release his in a cry of pain seconds later the minister had sirius wand pointed at his throat if you touch my wife again he growled eyes flashing i ll break your neck tompkinson released hermione who stepped back slightly behind them the others had arrived now we have that cleared up sirius said where is our daughter the minister sneered i think you already know the answer to that black what hermione asked you already have her the minister stated sirius shook his head if this is some kind of way to keep her you are severely mistaken tompkinson shook his head no it is you that is severely mistaken as of last night we no longer had your daughter what hermione whispered again her face paling before her knees gave way you son of a bitch sirius growled moving towards the wizard in front of him who stepped back if you hex me black you ll be sorry tompkinson said in a rush sirius didnthex the minister instead he pulled back his fist and slammed it into the side of his face causing the man to fall backwards robes flying up over his face where is she he shouted looking down at the cowering man sirius draco and harry were pulling him back its ok said draco i know how to find her sirius eyes flickered to the blonde before he turned to hermione and bill who was crouched down beside the witch her eyes now frighteningly blank sinking down beside her sirius bundled hermione up in his arms and strode silently through the now deathly quiet crowd o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the reformed group entered sirius and hermione chambers the mood somber hermione was walking now that the shock had died down slightly but still leant on sirius for support as everyone walked in remus and tonks who had been joined by graham stood up one look at hermione and tonks eyes filled with tears oh merlin she breathed draco strode over to the bookshelf and pulled open a draw at the bottom grabbing a handful of dusty maps sirius remus asked we got her back but they lost her hermione answered as she sank into one of the chairs its ok draco said again i can find her the group turned to the blonde who had his wand out and hovering over one of the maps when i saw her yesterday i activated a tracking charm on her bracelet he explained as he moved one map aside to look at another sirius face showed his relief a flash of guilt flickering in his eyes after yelling at the young wizard the evening before the door opened and the group turned to see dumbledore enter the twinkle in his eyes gone do they know who it was hermione asked dumbledore nodded it appears to have been a small group of voldemorts followers oh god hermione murmured as sirius sat beside her and pulled her close got it draco said triumphantly causing the group to rise and mill around the table o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o shaken from his ordeal in the atrium the minister pushed the large doors to his reception area open his secretary glanced up did a double take as she noticed the black eye and large bruise on the side of his face cancel all my appointments for the day he snapped as he strode towards his office but sir there already tompkinson opened his doors to see severus snape waiting at his desk the pale wizard glancing up as the minister entered before rising to his feet minister snape started not today severus but we had an arrangement snape protested or have you minister forgotten what you promised tompkinson circled his desk and sat in his high backed leather chair there has been a change of circumstances i afraid i am unable to award you your order of merlin snape stared at the minister letting the words sink in what he bellowed when he found his voice you see we no longer have elizabeth therefore your information leading us to her is forfeit you son of a bitch the minister winced that was the second time in less than an hour he d been called that and he eyed snape warily not wanting another black eye to match the one he was currently sporting you lose her back to the blacks and revoke my order of merlin you cantdo that well i might think of it differently if the blacks actually had the child for the second time in the office snape was momentarily speechless what last night fifteen death eaters entered the ministry found elizabeth and took her snape just stared dumbfounded inside he was rather pleased one more in the heart of black the minister glanced at snape an idea forming in his head actually i may have a way you can earn back your order of merlin snape glared what makes you think i d do anything for you after revoking it the first time tompkinson chuckled because i know you snape you fight for whatever side wins you re smart and you would do basically anything for an order of merlin something that people will remember when you are long gone snape continued to glare all you have to do the minister continued is find elizabeth and bring her back to me discretely what makes you think i know where she is i dontthink you do but like i said you re smart i sure you could find your old death eater buddies with no problem snape thought it over he was practically an outcast as it was and very soon he would have a rather pissed off animagus after him he had nothing else to lose o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o where is that harry asked as they watched a small blue glow emit from a point on the map that is in the scottish highlands dumbledore answered if memory serves that was grindewald fortress built inside a mountain alright harry said taking charge as draco enlarged the point on the map there looks like there is two main ways in the front door and the back door bill fred and graham you go round the back he said pointing to the small entrance on the map sirius draco remus hermione and i no harry glanced up at his godfather err no sirius his eyes still on the map repeated himself no hermione not coming all eyes flickered to hermione who looked up at her husband sharply excuse me sirius turned to face her you re not coming hermione glared there is no way you can make me stay here while you go after our daughter it not safe sirius stated i want you here with tonks and ginny ginny opened her mouth to protest but was cut off with a look from harry not safe hermione whispered before her voice began to rise again you have no right to tell me what i can and can not do sirius grey eyes flashed as he looked down at his furious wife i am your husband so do not tell me i have no right he growled she is my daughter too hermione shouted and i will not chance losing the both of you sirius yelled back so i have to sit at hogwarts like a good little wife hermione asked incredulously yes hermione had tears in her eyes shocked at what sirius was saying the couple oblivious to those around them why are you doing this she asked because you re pregnant god damn it o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 28 good guys dontalways wear white o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione stared at sirius as the room fell silent what she whispered eyes wide sirius broke the eye contact he and hermione held and looked around at the array of faces looking back at the couple glancing back at hermione he stepped closer ushering her in the direction of their room come on he murmured following close behind and gently pulling the door closed hermione wandered over and sat on the edge of the bed placing her hands on her stomach a look of confusion on her face sirius crouched down in front of her and rested his hands on her knees i not hermione started shaking her head while sirius merely sent her a gentle smile i would know she insisted i know sirius said softly in case you haventnoticed i do tend to watch you like a hawk hermione smiled it still doesntmean you know the charm right hermione nodded but elizabeth she protested her chocolate eyes darting back to the door sirius listened to the voices in the other room before replying harry and remus can plan it we ll join them soon you just you need to do this hermione he murmured hermione nodded and got to her feet making her way to the bathroom i ll just wait out here sirius said as his wife closed the door behind her o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o elizabeth was sitting on a small dais looking around at the group of faces looking back she didntlike these people they felt as cold and desolate as where they had taken her the room was dim and moist with flickering torches casting harsh lines on the dark stone walls that was easy remarked helena the only female left in the small group of death eaters we almost blew it the tall wizard nelson argued back we should have left mccraken here first of all helena replied we ve got her so stop complaining and secondly mccracken cantcontrol the voices in his head leave him be a cackle of laughter from the corner brought elizabeths soft blue eyes to a man huddled staring into the tip of his wand voices yes one could not stop the overpowering conviction that there were people living in the long shaft of wood so what next asked a short brown haired wizard off to the side everyone glanced back at the child in front of them this small delicate one year old would someday bring them everything their dark lord had worked so had for into fruition o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius stared down at his hands as he waited for hermione to come back into the room outside the setting sun cast warm colours all over the walls sirius felt anything but warm flashes of his dream appeared sporadically as nightmarish visions before his waking eyes death eaters had elizabeth his baby girl his munchkin it had been seven days since he held his daughter in his arms seven days that felt like a lifetime why did people always tear the ones he loves away from him o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione sat numbly on the edge of the bath before slowly sinking to the floor her wand lying forgotten at her side again she placed her hands on her stomach this time trying her hardest to put a smile on her face but as elizabeth face flashed in front of her eyes there was nothing apart from the warm tears that ran down her cheeks hermione sirius opened the door and hermione looked up meeting his grey eyes you got changed she stated simply simple things were easy sirius walked in heavy black travelling robes adorning his frame billowing as he crouched down beside her seven weeks hermione said softly i should be happy right sirius shook his head and pulled her closed not yet he murmured not yet o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius moved to open the door back into the main room when it opened slowly revealing remus on the other side hey moony sirius said gently as he and hermione re entered the room what the plan he asked as they moved back to the table with the large map on it we have two apparition points the werewolf answered pointing to one side of the mountain one here next to what appears to be a charred tree that where fred bill and graham are going and one here harry continued pointing to a point just south of a large spire type structure about two kilometers from the main entrance its further enough away from the entrance not to attract attention but close enough not to have take too long to get there that where we ll be apparating to you me draco remus and he trailed off glancing at hermione i staying here she said quietly you have three days if i haventheard from you then i coming to get you sirius looked ready to protest but harry just looked amused yes ma am sirius glanced back down at the map committing the image to memory there was nothing he could do to stop hermione following save binding her to a bookcase and donating her wand to the giant squid o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o melanie and her friends looked out of the first year dormitory window at the grounds below night had fallen but the moon was bright not full mind as they watched their defence against the dark arts professor walk out with the small group what do you suppose they re doing jessica asked melanie glanced down at the daily prophet article in her hands informing the wizarding world about the morning events they re going to get elizabeth back she said glancing back down at sirius and hermione who walked slightly behind the rest of the group o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks glared stubbornly at her fianc her black locks rising slightly in the wind the group had stopped just outside the hogwarts wards and were waiting for sirius and hermione to catch up remus smiled at tonks and pulled her close resting one hand on her slightly rounded stomach you shouldntbe going she protested i fine remus replied besides someone needs to keep an eye on that cousin of yours while hermione can t tonks sighed her violet eyes worried stepping closer still she rested her head on remus chest i have a really bad feeling about this she whispered just stay you know i can t remus murmured back resting his chin on the top of her head and holding her close till they were ready to leave o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry stared right back at the if looks could kill look ginny was sending his way what if one of you gets hurt she asked i could help harry shook his head we ll come straight back to hogwarts this is just so so sexist the redhead fumed ginny harry said gently pulling her close i know you want to come and i know you d be able to help but think about hermione and tonks you can help here too ginny glanced over at remus and tonks before her eyes flickered to sirius and hermione further back i just dontlike to be left at home she said her eyes showing her disappointment harry smiled apologetically i know he said gently kissing her come on let say goodbye to those siblings of yours and he led the way to where bill and fred were standing with draco and graham o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o here hermione said handing sirius a pair of think woolen socks they re charmed to keep dry just in case sirius smiled and took the socks pocketing them without taking his eyes off his wife face i going to bring her back he murmured placing his finger beneath hermione chin and lifting her face gently so he could look her in the eye you just be careful hermione said softly placing her hands on sirius chest while fighting back the tears i always careful he said with a small boyish grin before dropping it after the look hermione sent him i ll be fine its just a few death eaters i ll be back before you know it hermione nodded and if you re not i coming to get you alright sirius acquiesced before pulling her close and claiming her lips with her own in a gently kiss to warm him to the bone i love you hermione whispered i love you too sirius replied raising his hand to her cheek in a soft caress before stepping back and leading the way to the group o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ten minutes later hermione ginny and tonks were standing alone on the soft grass looking over at her two friends hermione smiled shakily and stepped away leading the way back to the castle o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham looked down the steep slope next to the tree he and the two weasley men had apparated to it was muddy and rocky things were going to get a little messy making their way down we do this quietly the ex auror instructed the curse breaker and joker i ll go first give it a few minutes then you can follow fred then bill another few minutes after that the two redheads nodded and graham turned to make his way down the slope using branches of nearby trees to keep his feet from sliding out beneath him reaching a stand of heather he looked back up the slope to see fred slowly following behind his elder brother keeping a cautious eye on the twin turning back around he carefully positioned his feet and continued down the slope towards the stone ridges of the mountain deeper in the gully o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius turned and looked back at the three wizards following him as they made their way up the hill to the spire a few hundred meters away from there the climb would continue till they reached the main entrance of the fortress harry was directly behind him followed by draco with remus bringing up the rear sirius eyes lingered on the werewolf for a moment just making sure his friend wasntstill feeling the after effects of the silver from the day before satisfied with remus level of health sirius turned and continued up the hill the summer air was crisp and cool in the scottish highlands and sirius could feel heat from a number of places around him on each hand he bore a ring each gifted to him from hermione one the valentines gift given long years ago the other his wedding ring the two objects emitted a constant feeling of warmth slipping his hand into the pocket of his robes his fingers wrapped around the thick pair of woolen socks smiling to himself his grey eyes moved back to the spire just ahead causing sirius to pick up the pace o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione gently closed the door to her and sirius room after saying goodnight to tonks and ginny both who were staying close by sighing she looked around the room the large four poster bed standing against the far wall seemed far too big for just one person her chocolate eyes flickered to the small bedside table on her side of the bed and the object that lay on it walking over she picked up the piece of parchment fingering the familiar script on the front spelling out her name sitting on the edge of the bed hermione opened the letter hermione it breaks my heart to leave you like this after all that we ve been through together we re having to part at one of the most difficult times we ve both ever had to face you dontknow how hard it will be for me to apparate away tonight leaving you here over the past week you ve been my strength no matter the front i ve put on if it were not for you i would be a broken man i only hope that my will to find elizabeth to return her to your arms gives me the strength to finish this without you by my side i love you sweetheart so much remember that all my heart sirius hermione blinked back the tears as she re read the last word again and lay back on the soft pillows on the bed that was far too big for one person o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o as the group approached the guard tower close to an hour after leaving hogwarts sirius gaze traveled up the height of it placed at regular intervals were long sharp spikes twisted while still hot to form a sickening sight to any that may wander near nice draco muttered i think the decorator had a slight mental problem sirius turned harry draco and remus were standing slightly behind him as the four wizards paused for a short rest opening his mouth to speak sirius hesitated and drew his wand his grey eyes flickering to the dense heather surrounding them they were not alone clapping sounded from behind the tower and the group wands drawn directed their attention to the sound well done a voice drawled before a familiar pale face appeared around the corner snape sirius spat glaring at the other wizard how on earth did you find this place the ex potions master asked looking at each member of the small party what are you doing here snape sirius asked ignoring the previous question snapes eyes moved to sirius and he glared hatefully at the other man have you not got it through that thick head of yours yet black that i hate you sirius glared right back i think hate is an understatement for once in your pathetic life black you are right i loathe you despise you even and i ve even worked out the best way at hurting you sirius remained silent a soft growl emitting from his throat just seeing the look on your face made turning you and your little family into the ministry worth it i donthave a care in the world for that little brat of yours but i know you do which is why the minister will be pleased when i bring her back to him you son of a bitch sirius growled advancing on the other man snape smirked and pulled a vial from his pocket remember black the best way to hurt you is through the ones you love as sirius drew close snape threw the potion in the air just before he felt himself being lifted of the ground by the force of sirius reaching him the vial shimmered in the moonlight before landing with a smash of glass at the feet of harry draco and remus o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer nope nada nein not mine hehe that rhymes right moving on o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 2 ghosts of christmas past o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione smiled as she watched sirius hang the christmas decorations in their living room the couple having returned home to spend the holidays with harry she caught the familiar deck the halls tune sirius was humming and was swept back to when her and lily had been woken up christmas morning by a slightly james potter altered version of the song what are you grinning wistfully at you do realize you married the man hermione turned to see harry walk into the room another box of decorations in his hands as he smiled at his friend i was just remembering how your mum and i were woken up christmas morning hermione answered with a smile harry green eyes lit up immediately with the mention of his mothers name and his smile widened oh yeah the marauders didntcover you in snow or anything please like we would do something as asinine as that sirius commented bending over to rifle through the box harry had deposited at his feet pulling out a santa hat and placing on his ebony head your father just played alarm clock is all i would also like to point out that the girls only came downstairs after my christmas carol rendition hermione laughed james version of deck the halls was what woke us from our peaceful morning slumber it was the muffled thump after your insults that brought us down ahh sirius grinned grabbing a tinsel garland and looping it around hermione pulling her closer i had two beautiful maidens sweep down to my rescue you know if i d known you d felt that way then i would have made my move sooner christmas was james and lily day hermione commented quietly sirius smiled sadly at hermione and placed a small kiss on her nose i know a small cough brought sirius and hermione attention back around to harry still in sirius embrace hermione smiled at her friend christmas day was when your parents got together i believe remus may have had something to do with a piece of conveniently placed mistletoe my ears are burning is that someone talking about me sirius grinned as remus walked into the room now moony why would you every think that hermione squirmed out of sirius embrace to greet the werewolf we werentexpecting you till tomorrow she commented giving him a hug tonks didntwant to spend christmas eve at hogwarts he said returning the hug and leaning down so he could whisper in her ear tonks is putting it in the shed make sure that husband of yours steers clear of it hermione grinned and turned back to the others to find sirius grey eyes staring at the pair suspiciously you know you two are lucky it christmas those kinds of whisperings can only mean one thing presents sirius finished this with a wide grin what cha get me sirius asked hermione as he followed her further into the living room you cantwait till the morning hermione asked lowering herself into the plush armchair next to the christmas tree at six months sirius was preparing himself for the quick rushes to the bathroom and the back complaints that madame pomfrey had told him about when entering the third trimester no hermione rolled her eyes and lifted her feet onto the foot stool as tonks walked into the room wotcher hermione hermione grinned at tonks appearance love the hair tonks she commented eyeing up the green and red spikes at least they arentred and gold right moony sirius said grinning and patting his friend on the back i d suggest stopping there padfoot unless you want to miss out on christmas dinner tomorrow remus warned when he saw harry begin to ask his godfather questions that would surly embarrass the

hermione was rudely woken the next morning when the warm duvet wrapped snuggly around her suddenly disappeared siriuuuuuuss hermione moaned curling into a ball which was a difficult task with her protruding mid section to try to save the warmth up it christmas hermione cracked open an eye and glared at the animagus i can not wait till you get woken by your child sirius ignored this remark and opened the curtains revealing a fresh landscape of white snow which much to hermione disgust intensified the light of the sun sirius knelt down beside her and rested his chin on his crossed arms please pretty please sirius changed tactics and grinned at the disgruntled hermione as she pulled the covers back over her i made breakfast hermione eyes warmed slightly as she tried to locate the warmth she had before being uncouthly woken what did you make hmm let see first i was just going to put cereal out then i thought nope this is christmas you canthave cereal for breakfast on christmas sirius paused when he noted hermione raised eyebrow and his smile grew so i made a beautiful christmas breakfast french toast pancakes fresh fruit cream chocolate sauce before sirius had finished his list hermione was out of the bed pulling on a warm bath robe and slipping her feet into her large fluffy black slippers before exiting the room sirius grinned he never thought he d see the day when hermione was tempted out of bed by food maybe i need to get her pregnant more often he thought as he followed his wife down the hall to salvage himself some breakfast o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione lounged comfortably in the living room as harry and tonks cleaned up breakfast being pregnant had more perks than hermione had initially thought oh yes just lounge about while everyone else does all the work hermione opened her eyes to see sirius grinning down at her i have an excuse and i was rudely woken by a mangy mutt hey sirius said affronted i am not mangy hermione just smiled up at him is there room for two sirius asked sitting on the arm of the one seater i already taking up enough space for two hermione pointed out as she rested her hands on her stomach sirius grinned and pulled hermione to her feet before taking her seat and pulling her back down onto his lap there sirius stated now there are three hermione raised an eyebrow and smirked malfoy like i d like to see how long you ll last before you lose all feeling from the waist down i dontcare sirius said sending hermione a soft smile i just wanted to share he reached up and cupped hermione face and pulled her down to meet his lips merry christmas he murmured merry christmas bugs hermione returned as she met his lips again before the sound of a camera snapping brought the couples attention to the three people who had wandered into the room way to interrupt the moment remus sirius commented sending a mock glare in the direction of his fellow marauder you didntexpect us to stay in the kitchen all day did you remus shot back amber eyes filled with amusement as he seated himself on the long couch opposite sirius and hermione sure i did you always did make a delicious turkey sirius grey eyes sparkled as he thought of the scrumptious christmas bird cook honey you dontmake turkey hermione pointed out as she patted him on the top of the head harry stood from his position from under the tree holding a large bag filled with gifts i going over to the weasley for the morning i ll be back later with ginny sirius nodded shifting to try and find a more comfortable position on the chair hermione looked down at him and grinned you ok bugs look a little uncomfortable there i fine sirius replied nonchalantly trying unsuccessfully to sound convincing hermione shrugged and turned to remus and tonks waiting to see how long sirius would last with the additional weight on his lap o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o later that evening a knock at the door interrupted the laughter of the house as harry and ginny listened to stories of the marauders who that harry asked curiously you didntinvite snape did you sirius sent a warning glare in harry direction he had for hermione sake asked the others not to mention the potions professor today hermione still hadnttold him what was bothering her but he always caught the flash of guilt pass her brown eyes whenever his name was mentioned without answering harry hermione stood from sirius lap where she had stubbornly remained most of the day to answer the door sirius relief was evident on his face and he stretched his long legs out in front of him you two are as stubborn as each other padfoot sirius winced as he stood and the blood flowed back to his legs i didntwant to insult her tonks and remus exchanged a significant look and sirius frowned what i didn t malfoy harry asked in disbelief as draco walked into the room carrying a single parcel hermione followed him and sat on one of the other long couches harry and ginny having settled on the single seater as soon as sirius had vacated it hermione sent her friend a warning look as draco sunk into one of the other chairs i invited him and i think we are all past calling each other by our lasts names at least for today draco looked around the room his gaze resting momentarily on tonks confusion passing his grey eyes oh tonks said standing up her spiked hair having caught the blondes attention tonks she greeted holding out a hand surprised you didntnotice the family resemblance she said with a grin draco took tonks hand the confusion still evident in his eyes here this ll help tonks changed her hair to long flowing blonde locks or maybe this she said switching to her natural appearance you re a black draco guessed i a tonks remus and sirius muffled their laughter at that comment and sirius cleared his throat she andromeda daughter draco a look of realization flashed across the young malfoys face as tonks returned to her seat beside remus the werewolf immediately raising a hand to her silky black locks and idly twirled them in his fingers a task he could not accomplish with the rock hard spikes tonks had picked out in the morning so sirius said speaking up in the descending silence presents first or food hermione and remus exchanged a look well it safe to say you wontbe making that decision anytime soon padfoot remus said smiling at his friend well molly insisted we eat while we were at the burrow so i could go for gifts first harry said offering a solution while ignoring sirius affronted protest presents it is then sirius said grinning jumping up and striding out of the room leaving the others to look at each other in confusion am i the only one worried that there is something wrong with that man ginny commented from her position on harry lap before anyone could respond sirius returned with his santa hat firmly in place right sirius said seating himself back down next to hermione who going first o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione smiled contently as she rocked backwards and forwards in lily old rocking chair that sirius had found and restored for her she as well as sirius was surrounded by baby books baby clothes baby accessories baby everything now all they needed was the baby harry hermione called from her seat can you pass me that one she pointed to one of the remaining boxes under the tree and her friend bent down to pick it up and pass it to her hermione pulled herself out of her new chair and wandered over to sirius who was talking to draco remus and tonks gaze following her knowing exactly what was in the box hermione smiled at draco before siding in next to her husband merry christmas she whispered handing him the small box sirius looked curiously at it and shook the box which rattled in his hands sirius put down his drink and pulled at the ribbon till it unfurled and fell to the floor sending a quick glance at hermione sirius lifted the top of the box keys he asked keys he shouted sweeping hermione into a hug put me down hermione laughed taking sirius hand and leading him outside the others following behind pulling on her cloak hermione opened the front door and led the group out into a landscape of soft pinks and peaches as the setting sun cast colours over the snow covered landscape beside her sirius bounced excitedly on his feet as they neared the small shed in the yard hermione unlocked it with a simple charm and led sirius inside as the others waited a loud whoop could be heard followed by a shriek and laughter as they heard hermione tell sirius to put her down again moments they heard an engine turn and a grinning sirius eased the bike out of the shed and stopped in front of the group hermione following smiling while shaking her head at her husband harley davidson 1979 flh sportster sirius prattled off grinning from ear to ear as the sleek black and chrome bike came to a stop nice draco commented before turning to hermione how did you afford wait where on earth did you find one hermione smiled as ginny hopped on behind sirius for a ride i have my ways harry handed the fiery redhead a helmet insisting that if she go anywhere with sirius grinning like that she was wearing one o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o www planete biker com

of trying to find sleep hermione gave up slipping out from under the covers that were void of any of the warmth sirius constantly emitted she stepped barefoot to where she d left her cloak pooled in a pile of think velvet next to the door setting the comforting warmth around her shoulders she slowly opened the door in the main room tonks and ginny had transfigured a bed each the bed closest to hermione had red hair sprouting from beneath the sheets and was still its occupant resting comfortably the other however shifted slightly as its occupant tried to find sleep tip toeing over hermione gently nudged tonks whose violet eyes flew open hermione she asked quietly hermione smiled reassuringly i was just going for a walk couldntsleep either hermione shook her head and stepped back as tonks exited the heavy covers and reached for her beloved combat boots hermione glanced down at her own bare feet the boots tonks had gifted her when they d first found her at malfoy manor sat back in her room the night breeze would be refreshing on her feet leaving a quick note should the youngest weasley wake hermione and tonks left the room quietly the pair walked in silence through the halls tonks boots thudding softly on the stone floors while hermione stepped silently beside her when they reached the entrance hall tonks glanced at hermione who nodded and opened the large doors slipping out into the crisp spring air the grass moist on hermione bare feet it strange tonks said breaking the silence trying to sleep do something so normal when there someone you care for out there somewhere it not strange hermione replied it love tonks smiled her hands falling on her stomach as they walked down the hill hermione initial destination now obvious as the small cemetery came into view in the moonlight tonks violet eyes darted to hermione stomach a look hermione didntmiss he did say he watches me like a hawk tonks grinned bit of an understatement there hermione blushed i cantbelieve he worked it out before i did tonks stepped through the small gateway leading into the cemetery and shook her head i cantbelieve he managed to work it out with everything that happened in the past week then again sirius is known for his peculiarity o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius felt snape hit something as a small explosion rocketed behind him snape gasped before a gurgling sound escaped his lips his dark eyes widening looking down between the pair sirius felt his blood run cold between the black robes between the hate between two mere wizards between life and death sirius gulped as he looked at the twisted spike protruding from snapes torso the tip dripping crimson into a small pool at their feet glancing back up his grey eyes met snapes own shocked pair as a trail of scarlet dripped from the corner of his mouth sirius opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out his hands now trying to support the gasping wizard in front of him the world around severus snapes eyes faded into darkness and the last thing he was startled to ever see were the remorseful grey eyes holding his own o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o as the glass vial neared the ground harry draco and remus all leapt out of the way landing painfully on his arm harry gasped as the bright explosion hit him shards of glass and liquid falling onto his legs as he caught his breath another sound made him leap to his feet his own pain forgotten o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o he didntclench his teeth this time to hold back the scream it was humanly impossible as the silver hit him as he dove for cover blinding pain hit his right leg and remus guttural scream of agony echoed off the sides of the surrounding valley and mountain slopes o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o spinning around at the sound of the werewolf scream sirius saw harry and draco move to remus his cry ringing loudly in the animagus ears tearing back down the slope snape forgotten sirius knelt by his best friends side remus breathing was ragged and quick as air hissed past his teeth remus remus look at me sirius pleaded as another agonizing scream tore from the werewolf throat his hand now clasping the other wizards remus cracked open his amber eyes and met sirius grey head on i going to get you out of here ok sirius promised as remus face lost its remaining colour and sweat dripped from every pore as remus eyes closed again sirius moved to look at the damage still squeezing remus hand remus right leg was a mess it looked like someone had set it on fire the skin was red and raw as blood oozed onto the ground below reaching out sirius gently touched the burns resulting in remus lurching away from him the quick movement forcing another scream to escape his lips we ve got to get him back to hogwarts harry said in a rush unable to tear his green eyes from the wound i taking him sirius said immediately not readily trusting the other two to do it harry shook his head you need to get elizabeth back i ll go no said draco you both need to get to elizabeth i taking him harry and sirius looked at each other and back down at remus before nodding alright sirius agreed you ll have to apparate using a portkey is too jarring draco nodded his silver eyes flicking to the still form of snape up the slope before coming back to the other two remus sirius said softly close so the werewolf could hear draco going to take you back to hogwarts it going to hurt a lot but we have no choice ok the only indication that remus had heard his friend was the slight nod of his head turning back to draco sirius nodded and helped the blonde get the werewolf to his feet once he was sure they were both secure sirius stepped back and without any hesitation draco apparated and the pair were gone staring at the spot where remus had just been sirius took in a ragged breath tonks voice in his head if remus is exposed to any more silver his chances of making through are slim to none o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione sat in front of ron grave talking quietly while tonks stood further back it always calmed her nerves to come here and talk to her friend warmth always followed like ron soothing reply a popping in the distance made her stop and she turned at the same time as tonks standing and making her way over to the other witch hermione squinted as she saw a figure struggling up the grounds of hogwarts that draco she said moving quickly to the exit tonks not moving tonks hermione asked when the metamorphmagus didntfollow her that remus she breathed hermione eyes flickered back from the pale witch to draco and the other person he was struggling with as realization dawned hermione took off grabbing tonks hand to make sure the witch followed wand out hermione raced up the hill and cast a featherweight charm on remus in the distance instantly draco managed to lift the werewolf into his arms and he turned to see where the spell had come from shocked to see hermione and tonks running up the hill towards him knowing he couldntafford to wait he turned back to the castle and ran as fast as he could remus unconscious in his arms having passed out after the apparition as he neared the entrance another spell shot past and the large doors slowly opened letting him through without pausing racing through the halls towards the hospital wing he could hear hermione and tonks gaining on him turning a corner hermione ran past and continued on to wake madame pomfrey while tonks slowed down to his pace a strangled gasp emitting from her lips as she took in the sight of her fianc o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius turned back to harry who d been quiet for a while now his green eyes were staring at a spot in the distance following his gaze sirius found himself looking at snape impaled on the tower beyond wait here sirius said softly while he made his way slowly back up the small slope reaching snape sirius found it difficult to tear his eyes from the placid pale face in front of him the blood had stopped falling ominously to the ground after snapes heart had ceased to beat his toes dragged in the dust and his arms hung limply at his sides reaching out sirius gently eased the potions master off the twisted spike and lay him lightly on the ground struggling slightly with the dead weight a minute later a shadow fell over snapes blank face blocking out the moonlight and sirius looked up to see harry staring down looking back down sirius brought his hand up and closed the dark staring eyes before using snapes cloak to cover the body sirius cleared his throat and stood glancing back at harry harry sirius asked quietly harry looked up from the body at his godfather his green eyes angry i glad he said forcefully i glad he dead he caused nothing but pain to those around him harry sirius said his tone more comforting as he stepped over to the shocked young man i glad harry repeated as sirius gently pulled him away harry may have been glad but sirius was just cold he d taken another life not in defence in anger in anger he d killed another man o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the hospital wing was a bustle of activity as draco lay remus on one of the unoccupied beds hermione and madame pomfrey were moving at speeds around the room gathering potions and salves to help students in the wing were woken and looked on curiously tonks stood next to remus her hand clasped in his as she brushed his bangs away from his eyes remus she murmured remus wake up tonks draco whispered his hands falling on her shoulders and pulling her back slightly you need to stand back tonks felt herself stepping back with the young malfoy her eyes falling to her fianc s leg where his robes lay in tatters his skin scorched closing her eyes she spun around to face draco what happened she asked quietly when draco didntanswer tonks eyes flashed open what happened she repeated more forcefully we met snape on the trail he threw a potion snape draco nodded i ll kill him tonks exclaimed as she stepped away from draco that son of a bitch i swear i ll kill him tonks draco said softly stepping up to the witch no tonks shouted ripping her arm from draco grip no she screamed letting her anger and grief out on a nearby tray of potions the glass shattering on the floor draco stepped up to her his eyes flickering to hermione who was watching her friend while trying to help madame pomfrey bundling the grieving witch in his arms he sank to the floor with her as her knees gave way i ll kill him she whispered i ll kill him draco merely rocked her to calm her down not having the heart to tell her her cousin had already done the job for her o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius and harry made their way up to the entrance of the fortress in silence in the distance large doors could be seen carved into the side of the mountain did you know harry asked sirius breaking the silence know what sirius asked that snape had told the ministry where to find you sirius nodded remus told me he worked it out before snape did his runner and he did nothing sirius glanced at harry and sighed remus isntthe kind of person to purposely hurt someone but snape just i am well aware of what snape just did harry he was the polar opposite of remus he cared for no one but himself climbing up a particular rough part of the trail sirius turned and offered his hand to help harry as they continued up the gully to the large mountain that bore down on the pair o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham slowed as the small entrance came into view and let the weasley catch up over there he whispered as he felt their presence behind him you two ready he asked slightly wary that though they were both members of the order neither had auror training nonetheless the two redheads nodded and graham led the way to the entrance hidden in the heather o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks stood off to the side as hermione and madame pomfrey prepared to cleanse remus blood the area around them had been curtained off from the curious eyes of the students and tonks had seen hermione surreptitiously cast a silencing charm the metamorphmagus remembered the last time remus blood was cleansed his face from the night of the battle as sirius and hermione helped him was still etched in her mind are you ready madame pomfrey asked hermione still dressed in her dark blue pyjama pants and black singlet her cloak forgotten at the door hermione nodded before turning to tonks you donthave to be here for this she said quietly yes i do tonks said stepping up to stand next to remus head madame pomfrey stood by remus right leg ready to focus on the worst area while hermione dealt with the rest moments later soft glows emitted from the witches wands they worked in silence for about ten seconds before remus lurched his amber eyes flew open as the pain hit him a strangled cry escaping his lips remus tonks pleaded trying to get him to focus his attention on her but his eyes were squeezed shut as he withered on the bed hold him madame pomfrey ordered as she tried desperately to keep remus wounded leg as stable as she could tonks tried to hold him down tears streaming down her face as draco stepped in quickly to help his strength only just able to keep the weakened lycan on the bed as more agonizing cries rose from her fianc s lips tonks turned to the nurse at the other end of the bed stop it please just stop it it has to be done madame pomfrey replied not taking her eyes off remus leg but you re hurting him tonks we have to hermione said over the noise tonks looked at the witch beside her tears were falling down hermione face as well as she struggled to complete the spell but tonks started if we donthe ll die hermione said quietly draco looked up from trying to restrain remus and glanced at hermione and madame pomfrey before his silver eyes fell back to hermione and her shaking hands stop he said causing tonks gaze to turn to him stop now it too much for all of you hermione shook her head and continued her glowing wand shimmering over remus i said stop draco yelled reaching out and grabbing hermione wand from her hand hermione let out a startled cry causing madame pomfrey to look up losing her concentration and breaking the spell on the bed remus stopped struggling but his breathing was ragged and punctuated with long moans i going to get ginny draco stated standing up straight and handing hermione back her wand donttry anything till i get back o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry

was large but warm the only one warm enough in the ancient fortress for a one year old that is where elizabeth was placed with a disgruntled helena the others arguing that her womanly motherly instincts might surface near an infant the males of the group refused to listen to helena arguments of only ever feeling the instinct to kill infants in their presence and left elizabeth with the risk of infanticide looking around at the portraits adorning the walls helena felt resigned to the fact that even though she felt like she got the bad end of the deal with the kid she would at least have the best chamber in the castle her catlike eyes flickered to the child in the cot she d transfigured on the other side of the room elizabeth blue eyes were closed as the events of the past day caught up on her small body o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o in the rising sun the entrance to grindewald fortress towered over sirius as he waited till harry was standing beside him casting his grey eyes further up from the images of snakes and spiders sirius felt infinitely dwarfed by the size of the mountain in which the fortress was entombed maybe we should have looked for another way in harry said quietly following sirius gaze sirius shook his head there was no time he replied reaching out slowly for the handle heaving slightly against the weight of the door sirius pulled until there was just enough room for him and harry to slip inside o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred stared down at the parchment in his hands it showed layer upon layer of corridors and rooms the floor they were presently on a bolder line of ink than the rest this place is huge fred murmured to the others it bigger than hogwarts bill chuckled i think hogwarts is a lot bigger that what everyone is led to believe what does it show graham asked coming back after checking one of the rooms off to the side it looks like she about ten floors beneath us fred murmured as they began walking down the corridor close to the wall we just canttell if she is alone or not on the map a small dot dimly blinked as elizabeth bracelet showed them the way the trio stepped up to a balcony and looked down into the chasm below the stone stairs spiraling down through the heart of the mountain and disappearing into the darkness of its bowels merlin fred whispered look there bill pointed out ignoring his brothers quiet exclamation ten floors below a faint flicker of light cut through the darkness let take it slow graham advised as the small group began to silently make their way down the stairs o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o twenty story below sirius and harry were slowly making their way up the stairs in darkness periodically checking an identical map to the one fred had the stone stairs were moist and slippery a thin film of moss and lichens building up over the years of emptiness from time to time godfather and godson had to skirt piles of rubble from the surrounding walls scorch marks evident of the ominous past that befell the veins of the mountain o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco sped down the hall vaguely aware of the fact that the sun had risen as his boots echoed off the walls students on their way to breakfast before the minimal classes offered started turned to look curiously at the blonde as he raced past reaching sirius and hermione chambers draco pushed open the door and looked around at an empty room he heard his quarry before he saw her a walk that nice where the bloody hell are you taking a walk ginny draco shouted moving into the master bedroom where ginny hurried out finishing tying her red hair into a ponytail draco what you are doing here you need to come with me now he said already making his way out of the room ginny followed processing what was happening as draco broke off into a run if draco was back and ginny was needed somewhere who is it she asked fearfully trying to catch up with the blonde remus o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o i think they need to hire a new repo man fred said stopping at the edge of a break in the stone staircase vaguely remembering a conversation between his father and harry bill and graham stepped up beside him and looked at the ten meters of shoddy wooden stairs spiralling downwards cautiously graham stepped out the wood was moist and dark and groaned portentously beneath his feet as he took another step eyeing the long haired ex aurors slow progress fred turned to his brother cantwe just charm the stairs he whispered bill shook his head his dragon fang earring following the movement too risky he replied you go next he instructed as graham reached halfway slowly fred made his way down testing each step before he added his weight ahead graham put both feet back on solid stone and turned to check on the others fred was about five meters from graham will bill a few meters behind him beneath bill feet he felt the stairs shift as a whole and froze just ahead of him fred did the same thing the whole damn thing is moving fred whispered fearfully at the bottom graham assessed the situation bill he instructed quietly wait there for a moment fred i want you to keep coming are you insane the redhead asked do you want to stay there forever graham whispered back just levitate the stairs or us we dontknow what wards they have up screw the wards fred bill whispered harshly from behind just keep moving outnumbered fred glanced back down at the stairs in front of him o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ginny followed draco into the hospital wing and ducked through the white curtain as he held it back for her oh merlin she breathed her eyes falling immediately to remus his right leg burnt red and raw rolling up her sleeves she quickly moved next to madame pomfrey we need your help to cleanse his blood hermione said as the healer in training stood opposite her you haventyet ginny asked shocked as she glanced down at remus pale face as the werewolf breathed erratically tonks was next to his head talking to him quietly hermione shook her head we tried she answered purposely not looking at draco ginny eyes widened you re going to do it again we have no choice do we hermione snapped the lack of sleep and worry for her friend taking its toll ginny nodded and madame pomfrey moved down the bed so ginny could let draco in he cast a concerned glance at hermione trembling hands before he put as much weight as needed on the lycan chest and nodded to the witches around him this time remus reaction was instantaneous and as the three wands began to glow he lurched on the bed trying to get away from the pain tonks helped draco hold her fianc down as his body was racked with spasms his cries echoing throughout the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o shakily fred put both his feet back on solid stone and he turned to bill who sent him a proud grin sending his own forced one back fred watched as his elder brother started towards them the stairs creaking beneath his feet about ten steps up from the end the whole staircase gave a sudden sway and fred felt the blood drain from his face as the wooden steps began to detach from the wall giving up completely on moving slowly bill sped down the remaining stairs as they began to disappear beneath his feet three steps from fred and graham all he felt was air o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o get back sirius called as he looked up to see falling debris rain down from above stepping back against the wall sirius and harry watched as pieces of broken wood flew past the odd part hitting the banister next to them and sending splinters through the air as the rest rumbled against the ancient floor of the entrance where they had come from o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o helena stepped cautiously into the hall and looked in the direction of the crash stupid rotting pile of junk nelson muttered from further back down the hall his head poking out of his door helena sneered back at him go back and get your beauty sleep nelson i going to go and check it out nelson nodded i ll watch over our precious commodity then shall i not caring what her fellow death eater did or not helena began to make her way down the corridor o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o bill opened his eyes and looked down he was hanging over the darkness beneath them his long legs kicking slightly in the air looking back up he met his brothers eyes you need to lose some weight fred breathed as he held onto bills wrist grahams head appeared over the edge and he offered another hand swinging his other hand up bill grasped both wizards above him and was slowly pulled up back over the edge alright fred asked catching his breath bill nodded his adrenaline racing i think so just give me a minute he replied his breathing slowing back down to normal o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco leant warily against the wall of the private room that had once housed ginny instead of her in the bed the red head lay asleep on the small couch next to him as remus occupied the bed looking over at the unconscious werewolf draco wondered if he d done the right thing in stopping hermione and madame pomfrey remus was as white as the sheets surrounding him as his chest rose and fell with the charm the medi witch had preformed to help him breathe next to him sat tonks her violet eyes blank as she stared at nothing in particular her fianc s hand lightly clasped in her own hermione was standing at the window now dressed in black robes staring lost in thought as if feeling draco gaze she turned frowning for a moment before stepping towards the door draco pushed himself off the wall and followed once the door to the room was closed hermione turned on him what happened she asked quietly you werenteven gone two hours and hermione trailed off unable to find the words looking around at the young faces curiously watching the pair from the beds draco gently put a hand under hermione elbow and lead her out into the hall we met snape on the trail before we reached the entrance he explained quietly what was to earn back his order of merlin hermione frowned confused before realization dawned and her eyes widened it was him draco nodded he was going to get elizabeth and take her back to the minister what do you mean was hermione asked her sharp mind picking up on the remark what happened i dontthink he meant for it to happen it was all so quick draco hermione said eyes worried what did sirius do he killed him o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o as bill stood a blinding pain hit his left leg and the colour drained from his face before he sat heavily back on the ground merlin he breathed as he held the top of his leg in a vain attempt to stop the pain bill fred asked sinking back down beside his brother i think i broke my leg bill answered a sheen a sweat on his forehead just go i ll catch up he ordered grasping his wand and attempting to remember the right spells to heal broken bones graham nodded from above come on fred fred looked torn but stood and followed graham leaving his brother next to the broken staircase o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione sat quietly in her empty chambers looking out at the sun high in the sky it was peaceful here the hospital wing was quiet but the wrong kind of quiet hermione was seeking despite the early summers heat she pulled her thick cloak around her shoulders the lingering scent of sirius filling her senses warmth evaded her bones she felt so cold inside and knew the warmness the fire in her bones wouldntreturn until sirius and elizabeth did soft grey eyes flashed in front of her own grey eyes that had reluctantly parted with her late last night tears welled in hermione eyes as she remembered dracos words sirius had killed him severus snape the wizard who had countless times attempted to ruin their lives and the lives of those around them was dead at the hands of her husband a man who behind his bravado of an exterior would never be capable of murder taking in a shaky breath remus still form appeared before her eyes his screams of agony echoing through her mind no sirius was not capable of murder murder is what lengths snape went to to anger sirius you dontaccidentally throw a vial of silver in the direction of a werewolf nor do you underestimate the lengths sirius black would go to defend a friend o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o helena stepped slowly up to the edge of the hall and looked down into the darkness that had been dulled slightly by the dust rising from below glancing up to her left wand held tightly and hidden in the folds of her robes helena began to make her way up the stairs the occasional piece of debris still falling past hidden in the shadows in the opposite direction sirius and harry exchanged a glance if the others had caused the fall the three of them should be fine against a single death eater it was up to them to get elizabeth back ready sirius whispered harry nodded and followed his godfather as he silently stepped out of the darkness and into the hall green eyes flickering down to the map in his hands harry saw that elizabeth should have been in the room four doors down and across the hall in front of him sirius moved slowly across to the other side no longer needing harry to tell him where his daughter was o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred stopped suddenly as graham held up his hand trying to quieten the sound of his thumping heart fred picked up the faint sound of a pair of boots coming up the stairs graham pointed to a pile of rubble a few steps down and fred nodded following slightly and crouching behind it waiting for the owner of the footsteps to appear o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o making her way up towards another faulty part of the godforsaken fortress the last thing helena expected was a bright blue beam of light shooting towards her mind switching to damage control she murmured a quick piece of latin before the light hit her in the chest and she felt herself fall back her wand flying from her hands and into the darkness below o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius reached out and clasped the intricate copper handle of the door that separated him from elizabeth harry pressed his back up against the wall on the other side of the door and nodded to sirius before the animagus had the opportunity to turn the handle a deafening alarm sounded throughout the ruins shit sirius cursed quickly turning the handle to no avail doors quickly opened around them and harry worked at defending himself and sirius as the older wizard tried desperately to get the door open stepping back sirius rammed his shoulder against the door adrenaline blocked the pain as he felt the crunch on impact praying elizabeth wouldntbe too close to the door sirius uttered a reducto effectively turning the door into a pile of splinters harry he called out as he rushed into the room sending spells past his godson and felling an unmasked wizard harry stepped backwards into the room as spells shot past there were thirteen death eaters remaining now thirteen well aimed shots would mean they d be able to escape this was easier said then done sirius rushed further into the room where a small cot stood and scooped his sleeping daughter up into his arms spells were flying past and sirius ducked behind the cot to avoid a red beam he took advantage of his new position and took out two death eaters from under the cot stop a voice boomed through the room sirius breathing hard straightened as the onslaught ceased in his arms elizabeth had woken and clung to his robes in the hall half a dozen death eaters were on the floor the rest had their wands raised in the direction of the animagus lower your wand a bodiless voice ordered sirius blood ran cold as the chilling reality hit him and he remembered the feeling of hermione being torn from his arms by invisible hands glancing towards the sound sirius paled further harry stood as still as a statue a line of blood trickling from his hairline his arms hanging at his sides at his throat was a knife seemingly floating in the air the blade pressed just hard enough to draw a thin line of blood from the boy who lived o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 31 borderline o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius felt himself breathing in the scent of elizabeth as she held onto him her small arms wrapped securely around his neck all around him death eaters were reviving their fallen comrades but sirius eyes stayed trained on harry hand her over black the floating voice behind harry ordered sirius glared defiantly and tightened his hold on his daughter go and find helena the voice ordered there may be more of them three death eaters peeled off from the group and headed in the direction of the stairs now black the voice said directing his attention back to sirius hand your precious daughter over sirius don t harry implored his godfather for his actions harry was rewarded with the blade pressing harder against his throat sirius weighed his options surrounded by nine death eaters with the only escape a narrow doorway across the other side of the room sirius put the odds of all three of them getting out safely against them get out sirius harry pleaded attempting to ignore the blade at his throat sirius was torn it came down to this his godson or his daughter i will not hesitate black the voice said humorously as if he was having the time of his life hand her over now no sirius growled out there was no way he would willingly give up elizabeth fair enough maybe a little persuasion then sirius watched in horror as the knife at harry throat shifted suddenly and sunk into his shoulder o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred froze as a scream of agony echoed up the stairs graham stood from his crouched position next to the female death eater and peered down the stairs that was harry fred whispered his feet already taking him down the stairs graham on his tail suddenly a green bolt of light flew past his head causing fred to suddenly scramble back up the stairs narrowly avoiding graham behind him the pair quickly made their way back in the direction of bill as spells caused the walls to crumble around them graham casting the odd spell back behind down the stairs running past the fallen death eater they quickly made their way to bills position who was sitting up wand at the ready what happened he asked attempting to stand as graham crouched down next to the banister and turned to hold back the onslaught of spells we have to get out of here graham called back to the weasley s what about the others fred asked incredulously graham ignored the question and muttered a quick reparo on the missing section of staircase go now he ordered we ll come back for the others he promised as fred opened his mouth to protest right now we need to get bill out of here not wanting to lose another brother fred helped bill stand and supported him as they made their way hastily up the stairs graham followed and shot spells behind as they twisted their way back up the spiral staircase rounding the corner at the top graham ducked under bills other arm and he and fred increased the pace of their escape o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry face was pale and clammy as a trail of blood dripped down his arm and onto the floor beside him the burn of the blade entering his flesh and striking his scapula still reverberated through his body to his horror he saw sirius thoughts running through the stormy eyes across the room as much as i enjoy playing pin cushion with your little boy who lived i wontask again hand her over black sirius tore his gaze away from harry and for the first time since he had picked her up looked down at elizabeth he bit back the sob that crept up as her mouth broke into a dazzling smile as his eyes me hers off to the side a death eater slowly stepped towards the pair sirius harry choked out dontyou dare o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione made her way quietly down the halls as she headed towards the hospital wing her thoughts jumped from sirius and elizabeth to remus his life hanging by a thread as his fianc e sat by his side hermione hermione turned to see draco coming towards her parchment in hand dumbledore found out how they got elizabeth out of the ministry hermione took the parchment draco handed her and looked at it as she kept walking a skill she d perfected in her fifth year on the parchment was a moving picture similar to a wizarding photograph it showed a small group of death eaters moving through white corridors before they were ambushed by ministry officials in the top corner a door appeared to open then close on its own hermione stopped at realization hit her i dontunderstand draco confessed stopping beside her the ministry wards would have picked up on invisibility charms or objects they used a potion hermione whispered more to herself than to dracos query draco frowned i ve never heard of a hermione stared walking again before the prophecy had surfaced she had been researching the potion lucius malfoy had used that fateful june morning back in 1979 the books and parchment had remained untouched in their chambers for almost a year o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the floor was cold and wet as sirius cracked open his grey eyes nearby the sound of dripping water echoed ominously throughout the darkness his first conscious thought was the lack of elizabeth in his arms this realization sent him upright causing a sharp pain to radiate from the back of his head wincing sirius brought his hand up and gently touched the tender spot at the back of his skull harry he called worriedly into the darkness a moan from the opposite corner sent sirius scurrying across the cold floor harry was on the floor shivering with numerous wounds around his face and neck the gash in his right shoulder was still bleeding and sirius quickly tore off a piece of his robe and applied gentle pressure causing harry eyes to open suddenly in pain its alright i just need to stop the bleeding sirius explained quietly wh where are we harry asked sirius squinted into the darkness it looks like a cell a dungeon most likely he paused and looked back down at harry what happened you hesitated they hit over the back of the head and took elizabeth sirius felt his eyes sting as he sat back on the ground they had been so close feeling harry shivering beside him sirius peeled off his outer robes and spread them over his godson his mind working on finding a way out with no wands this was going to be a problem o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione and draco entered the hospital wing to find ginny and madame pomfrey trying to get tonks to move away from remus so the medi witch could perform a checkup on the pregnant metamorphmagus hermione walked up to tonks and lay her hand on her friends arm go i ll sit with him till you get back tonks glanced at hermione and opened her mouth to argue please tonks just let madame pomfrey check you over for your baby sake hermione words hit home and tonks nodded and with one last glance at remus followed madame pomfrey from the room hermione took tonks seat and grasped remus hand in her own behind her draco and ginny sat on the couch at the back of the room hey remus hermione murmured looking across at the pale wizard in front of her he hadntwoken since they d preformed the cleansing charm the day before in fact his condition seemed to be deteriorating rather than improving it hermione dontworry tonks is just going to make sure your baby is ok she ll be back soon she paused as her eyes started to burn you remember dontyou you re going to be a father that why you have to pull through this remus you have to marry tonks and have a beautiful family to grow old with merlin remus you re so brave you have to pull through hermione allowed herself a sad smile remember that day you saved me from malfoy you took on two slytherins twice your size now you just have to fight this hermione was cut off as the door flew open and fred rushed in supporting a pale bill who was favouring his left leg immediately she stood her eyes going to the door waiting for sirius to come through with elizabeth when tonks re entered with madame pomfrey and graham hermione felt her knees grow weak o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius looked up as the door to the cell burst open a tall death eater sirius hadntseen before sauntered in with elizabeth in his arms sirius relaxed slightly to see that she was unharmed but was distressed at the wails she was emitting getting to his feet sirius found himself flying across the room and into the jagged stone that backed the cell dazed with a fresh trail of bloody dripping from his forehead sirius blinked to clear the fuzziness when his eyes refocused there was a female death eater crouched beside harry knife again in hand we have a problem black the tall death eater announced sirius recognized the voice as the one who d been invisible earlier it seems you have a way of keeping track of your daughter here he held out sirius and harry copy of the map with its blinking dot showing where elizabeth was now all you have to do is stop this what makes you think i ll tell you anything sirius asked groggily because if you don t helena here will make sure your precious godson knows the true meaning of pain sirius glanced at the witch next to harry who lazily pressed the dagger into harry cheek drawing a small line of blood me well i think it her pretty little bracelet sirius eyes snapped back to elizabeth no one seems to be able to take it off maybe we ll just have to forcefully remove it nelson the helena warned the last thing they needed right now was to harm the child dontworry helena it not her wand hand that all that important nelson drawled pulling another knife from his robes in his arms elizabeth had quietened in the presence of her father and was currently struggling in nelsons arms to reach him sirius glanced from elizabeth to harry and back again before coming to a decision the others knew where they were now he was just going to have to take the risk that they didnttake elizabeth elsewhere o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred stared at remus his eyes wide and confused before they moved to draco what never mind that hermione snapped vacating her seat for tonks what happened where sirius and harry we dontknow for sure exactly what happened graham answered he had a gash on his cheek and dust from the crumbling walls all through his brown hair but i think harry and sirius have been captured the room grew quiet the only sound being madame pomfrey small murmuring as she worked on bill hermione stood still for a moment before moving quickly out of the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius watched heartbroken as the two death eaters left once again with elizabeth s sirius harry stuttered grabbing his godfather attention what is it mate sirius asked quietly skirting over to harry on the floor when you g get the chance you have to get elizabeth a and get out he whispered i not going to leave you here you need to make a ch choice sirius i can look after myself you need to concentrate on getting elizabeth out harry argued look harry when your parents died i made a promise that i would look after you i ve never once broken a promise to your father and i not going to start now harry smiled slightly you have your own child to look after now besides i wouldntmind meeting my parents again sirius shook his head now you get those thoughts out of your head this instant harry james potter what about ginny did you think about her harry blinked she ll understand you have to get elizabeth out you re right but believe me we wontbe leaving alone there is no way i leaving you here by yourself harry attempted to chuckle through his shivering you re too stubborn for your own g good si irius sirius watched as harry drifted off to sleep sending out a silent prayer of help to hermione sirius transformed and curled up next to harry gently laying his head on his godsons chest trying to provide as much warmth as possible to the injured wizard o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione strode quickly around her room grabbing her combat boots out of the closet as she pulled on her light fighting robes draco appeared at the door and watched her progress i coming with you and there is nothing you can do to stop me the corners of draco mouth lifted slightly as he suppressed a smile i wouldntdream of trying to stop you he replied as hermione quickly finished plaiting her long curls before stepping into her boots and tying her laces good hermione picked up her wand and headed for the door let go then outside fred and graham waited ginny wanted to come but madame pomfrey needs her help with remus and well tonks fred explained hermione nodded so just us four then do you have the map fred handed her the map with the blinking dot reassuringly still on the parchment right we ll take the back entrance she said making her way out of the door the three men following close behind disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 32 damned o o o o o o o o o o o o o o all sirius seemed to be aware of was a continuous pounding at the back of his skull with every beat of his heart even in his animagus form he slept restlessly concern for harry elizabeth and remus refusing to let his mind rest he blew a puff of air from his moist nose with a sigh as he lay his head on harry chest feeling reassured with the stead rise and fall from beneath he didntknow how long he was awake for before the cell door crashed open causing him to whip his head around painfully and emit a low growl deep from the back of his throat rising to all fours he bared his teeth at the two death eaters standing in front of him just willing them to try to get closer behind him harry tried to sit up groaning and clutching his shoulder as he did so the two death eaters one short one tall looked at each other then back at sirius looking bored the tall death eater flicked his wand shooting a spell off in sirius direction sirius held his ground knowing harry was directly behind him the beam of blue light hit him in the side and he went flying through the air again his head hit the back wall with a crunch and harry blearily watched as padfoot slid limply down the stone wall to the floor before sirius reappeared unconscious with a fresh trail of blood dripping from his hairline shakily getting to his feet harry glared defiantly at the two in front of him before slowly making his way over to sirius but two sets of strong hands gripped his arms before he reached his godfather burning pain sliced through his right shoulder as he was manhandled to his feet and dragged from the cell fighting back nausea harry vainly struggled against his captors as they slammed the cell door shut leaving sirius limp form inside no harry managed to choke out as he dug his feet into the ground his boots leaving tracks in the dusty stone floor sirius in his weakened state he felt his magic halfheartedly surge before a fist connected with the side of his face and his world sunk into darkness o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham led the way as he cautiously entered the fortress hermione followed with fred behind her and draco bringing up the rear the group silently made their way down the dark corridor before reaching the staircase as graham fred and bill had earlier hermione found herself looking over the edge and down into the darkness below next to her graham made his way towards the stairs and hermione found herself following the first distant rumbling from within the fortress startled hermione behind her fred placed a hand on her shoulder and offered a reassuring smile she deduced that noises were common place in an ancient decrepit fortress a few silent minutes later graham turned be careful here he whispered this is where bill got hurt hermione cautiously stepped onto the repaired staircase and continued on into the bowels of the fortress o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry green eyes blinked as the world slowly came back into focus around him the fuzzy stone work in the large room grew sharper and he could make out the flickering flames of torches bathing the room in an eerie light the pain in his shoulder throbbed the ache hitting his nerves with each heartbeat slowly he rose to his feet and looked around the empty room only it wasntas empty as they liked to think he believed even in his weakened state he could feel them in the room with him swallowing away the dryness of his mouth harry moistened his lips tasting the metallic tang of blood on his tongue why dontyou show your faces he asked his voice gravelly as it rasped through his throat laughter erupted at different points around the room from the left corner near the door a bolt of light shot towards him causing harry to quickly duck to avoid the unforgivable the second was shot from behind and brought the boy who lived to his knees he didntallow them the satisfaction of a scream and waited the pain out before slowly getting to his feet again every muscle in his body trembling in protest you re all cowards he accused harshly no helena taunted we re slytherins she finished off proudly this comment was met by another round of laughter as a door off to the side opened and a visible nelson entered with elizabeth in his arms harry mind immediately switched to suspicion as the tall death eater placed elizabeth on the floor a few meters away from him before he turned on his heel and left the room a wicked grin encompassing his features as he exited harry took a cautionary step towards elizabeth before he was hit by multiple curses he felt a number of wounds open but the pain wasntfocused as another crucio racked his body bringing him to his knees the stronger sectumsempra taking him to the ground as gashes opened on his chest the blood seeping through his robes laughter again echoed through the room as the remainder of voldemorts followers took sport in torturing the boy who lived the onslaught ceased and the room became quiet save for harry ragged breathing as he rolled onto his back he cracked his emerald eyes open once again as small soft and somewhat soothing hands landed on his face elizabeth blue eyes looked curiously down at him trying to get his attention groaning harry brought his arms around to grasp elizabeth as he sat up blood running from the corner of his mouth smeared slightly by elizabeth small fingers he knew immediately what they were doing as soon as yet another crucio hit him pain racked his body again but it was elizabeth terrified screams of agony that hit the hardest as she struggled in his arms he couldntput her down no matter how hard he tried struggling to his feet harry tried in vain to block out the pain as he felt his magic course through his veins whispering a muted protego the pain stopped as the shield bubbled around him and elizabeth who continued to wail and struggle in his arms the room fell quiet again as an unfamiliar male voice filled the room well done potter but do you really think you can keep it up for long you re all insane harry groaned trying to block the pain she just a child it never too early to start breaking her in and how better to do that then relating you with pain in the back of the fuzziness harry noted that no one else was speaking up in caution of elizabeth associating their voices with the torture in his arms elizabeth had quietened but her small body still shook uncontrollably crouching harry gently placed her on the stone floor and stood over her his legs struggling with his weight as he glared at the invisible circle of death eaters the next spell broke his shield and sent him flying though the air and sliding along the floor grit digging into his skin before he came to a stop face down rolling slightly his vision this time remained constantly blearily as he met elisabeth tear streaked face her bright blue eyes filled with confusion staring back o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione felt herself automatically nodding to the warning before becoming lost in her thoughts as her adrenaline began to rise she recognized the feeling coursing through her veins she felt it every time she went into battle only this time it was ten fold it wasnta small rag tag group of students being where they shouldn t it wasntan ill fated rescue mission nor was it one of the greatest battles the wizarding world had ever seen no this was her battle focused entirely on the ones she loved sirius and harry whereabouts were unknown elizabeth beacon of hope blinked reassuringly on the map in her hands remus was fighting for his life at hogwarts tonks battling by his side the weasleys were all helping in their own way and draco well draco was behind her once again and she realized then that he had seemingly filled the void not only in her life but also harry s that ron death had left behind she spared a glance back at the blonde walking quietly behind fred no he hadntreplaced ron but it made the hurt seem to lessen slightly with his presence moving her chocolate eyes back down to the map in front of her hermione made sure the small beacon hadntmoved before she again focused her attention on their spiraling decent into the fortress o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the shock of ice cold water rushing over him brought harry out of unconsciousness once again blinking back the now diluted blood dripping into his eyes harry squinted up at the now visible death eaters surrounding him through the bleariness of his head he realized he must have lost his glasses when he d blacked out cruel laughter again erupted around him as he searched the floor in the back of his mind he knew the image he was projecting was pathetic harry potter boy who lived bringer of light destroyer of the dark lord was on the ground dripping with water and blood as he searched blindly for his glasses surrounded by the pettigrew of the death eaters the ones who would rather hide than fight his hand grasped the wire frames and his fingers curled around them before he slipped them into his pocket and shakily stood it wouldntbe long before he hit the ground again o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius gripped the bars of the cell and closed his eyes willing his magic to cooperate he may not have his wand but he still had magic in his blood gritting his teeth he tried to unlock the door pry it open or blast it open anything just to get out of the cage he was in and find harry and elizabeth the sound of footsteps and scraping brought sirius attention away from the door and to the dark corridor his grey eyes narrowed as two death eaters rounded the corner dragging his godson between them standing defiantly at the door sirius watched as one of the death eaters shot a stupefy in his direction only for it to bounce off the shield he had managed to cast hefting harry onto his shorter companion the taller one again tried to stun sirius and again failed sirius allowed himself a small grin which promptly fell when harry was dumped unceremoniously to the floor and a round of spells shot from the two wands knowing his shield wouldnthold sirius backed off and dodged them instead the sudden movement sending his food starved body reeling as his head spun o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione found herself again listening to the rumblings of the fortress age was catching up on it and she was silently horrified that her fifteen month old daughter was somewhere within the walls a rumbling close to home made hermione fred and graham turn suddenly wands raised as draco expertly dodged a large piece of stone wall which had taken it upon itself to squash the blonde wizard hermione met his eyes and a rather dusty looking draco who coughed as the dust reached his throat nodded that he was all in one piece allowing fred to step past her hermione continued to make her way down just in front of draco her instincts had kicked in when she witnessed the near miss and she found herself puzzling over them it wasntmotherly she knew what that felt like no this was more of what she felt towards harry hermione again turned to glance at draco determined to put a word to the feeling he raised a questioning eyebrow and hermione turned back around shrugging slightly right now she very much felt like the over protective big sister o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius woke and groaned he d lost count of how many times he d lost consciousness in the past couple of weeks and figured madame pomfrey was going to have a field day when they returned to hogwarts if they returned to hogwarts slowly getting to his feet he tumbled across to the trembling form propped up against the wall on the other side of the cell kneeling down beside harry sirius stared in horror at what was in front of him harry eyes were starting to bruise his nose was broken and bleeding and there were multiple abrasions from his hairline to jaw his stormy eyes moving south sirius took in the three deep gashes on the chest in front of him as well as the re opened wound in his shoulder and this was only what was visible bringing his hands up slowly sirius lay harry flat and started to gently remove his soaking outer robe without jostling him too much a moan announced the animagus failure at non jostling harry he asked quietly moving his head above harry so harry could see him when he opened his eyes harry cracked open one eye slightly the other swollen shut opening his mouth to speak harry coughed and sirius shook his head donttalk just let me see what i can do removing the remainder of harry outer robe sirius then removed his boots and sopping wet socks his fingers brushing against icy cold skin in the process moving next to harry chest sirius closed his eyes and blocked out the rest of the world concentrating again on his magic his head felt like it was going to split into two as he tried to heal the wounds on harry chest gritting his teeth against the pain sirius tried harder as he dug deeper within himself something moist and sticky gripped his wrist and sirius opened his eyes and looked down at harry hand around his own tearing his eyes away from the red bloodied knuckles sirius looked up at harry face don t harry whispered you have to he paused swallowed and tried again you have to get elizabeth out sirius shook his head i not leaving you here besides i cantget the doors open harry didntappear to hear his godfathers words and kept repeating himself get elizabeth out sirius frowned as harry tightened his grip on sirius hand in panic harry sirius started becoming worried what did they do o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione stepped up beside fred and graham who d stopped and looked down at the map graham glanced down the corridor which was eaten by darkness some thirty meters in according to the map elizabeth was in the same room she d been in earlier nodding graham again took the lead cautiously making his way slowly down the corridor fred hermione and draco following pausing every so often to look behind him draco collided with hermione as she pulled up to a sudden stop reaching out he gently steadied her without taking his eyes off their surroundings hermione glanced at graham and nodded pointing from herself to him in question graham glanced at fred and signaled for him to stay with draco standing on either side of the door graham waited as hermione reached out beside her and turned the knob letting it slowly swing inwards the ex auror stepped in first wand at the ready and quickly surveyed the dark room his stomach twisted as realization swept over him the room was empty behind him hermione moved in lighting the room with her wand graham watched as her brown eyes circled the room once then twice disbelief filled her eyes and her fighting stance dissipated as she processed what was in front of her her gaze flickered down to the parchment in her hands we must have the wrong room she murmured staring at the blinking dot graham gently took the map from hermione grip and studied it before stepping outside to double check it was the right room draco looked from graham whose hasty exit confused him into the room and back at graham his silver eyes questioning graham looked up and noticed the gaze before running his hand along the top of his head in frustration she isntthere draco swept into the room to find hermione moving over to a pile of rubble in the corner suddenly afraid of what she might discover he moved and quickly intercepted her i ll look he murmured before crouching down and moving away some of the larger rocks hermione numbly watched as the blonde wizard dug through the pieces of wall her heartbeat increasing as he straightened looking down at an object in his hand his elegant features pulled into a frown swallowing hermione followed the direction of his gaze in his palm lay the small silver bracelet he d given elizabeth for her birthday the same silver bracelet that only sirius or hermione could remove draco glanced up at hermione face as she gently lifted the bracelet from his hand deathly pale her eyes moved to his in confusion i dontunderstand she whispered tears forming in her eyes how sirius wouldn t what if she s draco gaze softened as he stepped towards the witch in front of him no hermione snapped stepping back startling the blonde as her voice bounced off the walls you said you said she d be here why isntshe here tears where falling freely down her face now as draco again stepped towards her why she sobbed tell me why draco caught her as her knees gave out and fred and graham watched helplessly from the doorway the forgotten map still in graham hand the beacon of hope still dismally blinking on the parchment o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer i do not have any rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 33 woman in love o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the bars stretched out before his grey eyes taunting sirius as they caged him from the outside world once again maybe if he stared at them long enough they would vanish from in front of him and he could get harry and elizabeth out he was so immersed in his staring that he didntnotice harry come up and stand next to him any reason why you were carrying around a spare pair of charmed socks harry asked his voice rasping weakly past his throat turning sirius reached out and grabbed harry elbow to help steady the wavering wizard you shouldntbe up sirius said concerned eyeing harry face which had taken on a purple hue in the last few hours i fine harry protested weakly as sirius turned him around wincing slightly at the movement fine my ass if i wasnttrying to get us out i d conjure you a mirror you were staring at the bars sirius what are you expecting for them to vanish before your eyes harry laughed at the look on his godfathers face before his face paled with the effort and he felt his legs turn to jelly merlin harry sirius exclaimed as he gently lowered harry back to the ground what did they do to you harry shook his head as he leant back against the stone wall pain and lots of it no need to be specific sirius face betrayed the fact that he was thinking about all the possible situations harry could have been in while he had been stuck in the cell even worse was harry newfound conviction to get elizabeth out tell me how elizabeth was involved please harry shook his head again i cantdo that to you sirius at least tell me if she ok sirius pleaded just tell me that much i dontknow harry answered honestly sirius grey eyes closed in frustration as he took a deep breath to try to stay level headed standing he spun around and approached the bars gripping them before he closed his eyes and focused again on his magic o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione eyes flew open as the sound of soft crying reached her ears standing swiftly her eyes roamed her surroundings she wasntin the small room where they had found the bracelet nor were draco fred or graham anywhere in sight instead she stood in the middle of a large ornately decorated ballroom that was slowly collecting dust another cry from near the main doors spurred hermione into action and she pushed the confusion aside as her feet carried her towards the familiar cry before she reached the other end however the doors swung open and death eaters filed into the room skidding to a halt hermione gripped her wand and looked around for a place to take cover all that greeted her were the long straight walls of the unfamiliar room cautiously she stepped over to the wall on her left and slowly moved forward so far not one of the death eaters had noticed her presence o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco stared at hermione sitting in front of him she had suddenly gone rigid in his arms and he d pulled back to find her staring blankly ahead her eyes having taken on an eerie milky colour across the room fred and graham were arguing about what their next move should be um guys draco called not having the first clue as to what was happening the two older wizards were too engrossed in their argument to hear the call tearing his eyes away from the sight in front of him draco glared at the pair hey would you both stop arguing and get over here fred and graham looked at each other before walking over draco pointed at hermione and stepped back bloody hell fred exclaimed peering closer to hermione face for a better look what happened draco frowned i dontknow he looked over at graham who was standing beside him looking down at hermione any ideas graham shook his head it like she in a trance but i ve never seen anything like this draco frown deepened i dontlike it he said as he reached down to shake hermione no wait graham cried out grabbing draco wrist i dontthink that such a good idea so what do you propose draco asked stepping back again as fred waved a hand in front of hermione face o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione looked down at herself and ruled out invisibility as she silently moved closer to the circle of wizards straining to catch their discussion she was ten meters away when the words reached her ears falling down around us where do you propose we go then helena somewhere that isnthere look black and potter found us and they werentalone how long do you think its going to be before others come so we move then a deeper voice reasoned and black and potter we take potter he ll be too weak soon to resist the torture hermione blinked at the revelation before she felt a surge of anger flow through her veins holding back she kept listening black well we can either leave him here to rot or take him with us to rot either way he ll never see his precious daughter again confident she wouldntbe seen but still cautious hermione stepped up into the circle elizabeth soft cries again reaching her ears taking a deep breath she slowly reached out to the closest wizard only for her hand to pass right through his arm curiously she peered at her hand before repeating the movement knowing there must be some explanation logical or not hermione took another deep breath and stepped into the center of the circle when the death eaters continued their discussion hermione quickly made her way to the cot in the middle a wave of unfounded joy rushed through hermione as her eyes landed on her daughter for the first time since she d been taken from her arms the newfound happiness however quickly dissipated as she took in elizabeth pale features and the dark circles under her small blue eyes hands initially flying to her mouth in shock hermione stared down into the cot as tears welled in her eyes oh god she whispered as she tried to reach out to elizabeth her hands feeling nothing but air biting back a sob she let her hands hover over her daughters small form as her tears now streamed freely down her face shh sweetheart mummy here hermione murmured i coming to get you mummy coming o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred curiously peered into hermione vacant expression as draco and graham argued about what to do he was almost nose to nose with the older witch when her eyes suddenly closed before flying back open bloody hell fred exclaimed again as he fell backwards onto the floor his heart slowly making its way from his throat back to his chest hermione had also fallen backwards as she fought back the rising bile and tired to control her trembling hermione draco asked stepping warily towards her i need the map hermione said holding out a shaking hand to graham and ignoring draco enquiry obliging graham handed her the parchment and hermione spread it out on the floor in front of her her chocolate eyes scanning quickly the others watched and waited in silence she here hermione said getting to her feet her finger pointing at the long ballroom deeper into the mountain the others looked at each other all unsure but none willing to voice their apprehension to the witch in front of them after a few moments graham spoke up maybe we should go back to hogwarts and re group draco and fred flinched as hermione gaze landed on graham closing her eyes hermione took a few deep breaths before explaining i saw them the death eaters they have elizabeth and are planning on moving her as well as sirius and harry we need to get them out now o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ginny stepped quietly into the private room in the hospital wing remus lay still his skin remained clammy and pale and the charm used to regulate his breathing was still active she had just overheard dumbledore and madame pomfrey discussing the full moon which would be occurring within the next week thus feeling completely helpless with the entire situation decided she d change remus bandages tonks sat beside her fianc only ever leaving his side for the daily checkups madame pomfrey insisted on standing on the opposite side of the bed to tonks ginny silently began the gruesome task of removing the werewolf dressings the burnt flesh stubbornly refused to heal and the wound showed no improvement as the bloodied bandages came free the whole of remus lower leg was currently hindering any hopes of a full recovery disposing of the stained bandages she gently began to wind a fresh one up the length of remus leg she d been taught early on in her training how to do this using magic but she felt more of a connection with her patients if she did it the muggle way it the fully moon next week tonks said softly not taking her eyes off remus face ginny looked up from her work she didntrealize tonks knew she was even in the room she opened her mouth to respond but was unsure what to say to the other witch they ll have to move him tonks continued probably to the shack she paused and took a deep ragged breath as ginny finished her task i wish sirius was here he needs the company and he cantbe left alone that if he even if he even survives the transformation ginny moved to the other side of the bed and crouched next to tonks gently placing her hand on tonks arm ginny tried her best to reassure the metamorphmagus remus is strong tonks he has a lot to live for he will fight this tonks looked down at the red headed witch and sent her a small smile of gratitude even if ginny new the odds were against remus she felt determined to install as much hope into tonks as she possibly could o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione clutched the map in her hand as she steadily made her way down the corridor lit wand held aloft in front of her to light the way draco fred and graham all followed behind not knowing exactly where hermione was leading them or what had happened earlier only trusting that she knew what she was doing hermione slowed as the floor beneath her feet began to shake the whole place is going to fall down around us fred murmured as a low rumbling sounded off to the right all the more reason to keep moving suggested graham from behind spurring the group forward again o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a low buzzing sound roused harry from his restless sleep cracking his good eye open he blinked a couple of times before focusing on sirius at the bars of the cell from the sounds of it he was making progress on getting out harry watched for a moment he could see the sag in sirius shoulders and the slight bend in his knees but his grip was firm and determination kept the animagus upright knowing the door wasntgoing to be opened anytime soon by sirius without some help harry slowly got to his feet and shakily made his way over to his godfather reaching out he gripped the bars next to sirius ignoring the pain flexing had on his raw knuckles closing his good eye he pictured what elizabeth had been through and felt his anger grow with a sharp electric like crack the door to the cell came loose and clattered to the floor breathing heavily sirius opened his eyes and glanced at harry beside him who sent him a crooked grin thought you could use some help he said before his eyes rolled back and his legs gave way moving quickly sirius caught harry before he hit the ground supporting his godsons weight sirius slowly made his was down the corridor conscious of every sound his steps made as they echoed lightly off the stone walls reaching the stairs that led out of the dungeons he hefted harry into a more manageable position before ascending the first step he didntmake it up the second before the two death eaters from earlier came around the corner o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione glanced once again at the map in her hands her heart picking up speed as they neared the hall skirting a large pile of stones hermione looked up into the darkness that was once the ceiling above a staircase spiraling deeper into the mountain brown eyes flickering back to the three men behind her hermione took one last glance down the stairs before continuing she had taken only a few steps before she slowed hermione draco asked from behind frowning hermione turned back around and again found herself staring into the darkness below let go this way she suggested as she began to clamber over the rubble to reach the first step but elizabeth is that way fred reasoned as they watched her progress hermione didntreply till she was safely over the pile yes but sirius is this way the three men watched hermione for a moment as she began to descend the staircase when the light of her wand began to dim as she rounded a corner they each began to work their way over the stones hermione fred called as he was the first to step onto the staircase slow down not waiting for the other two he quickly followed the witch and her dimming light the stairs continued to spiral downwards with the air and walls becoming increasingly moist as they neared the bowels of the fortress hermione could hear the others behind her as she rounded the last corner the sight at the bottom of the stairs made hermione skid to a stop her heart leaping to her throat at the base lay body face down long dark hair matted and dirty the ends floating in a small pool of water fred came to a stop beside an extremely pale hermione merlin he breathed as he followed her gaze fred voice beside her spurred hermione into action as she rushed down the remaining stairs and crouched beside sirius rolling him over so his head rested in her lap sirius hermione breathed as tears filled her eyes at the sight of her husbands bruise covered face her heart rate slowing slightly as she felt him breathing fred draco and graham watched as hermione sitting in a puddle holding sirius close picked up her discarded wand and whisper a quiet enervate hermione didnttake her eyes off sirius face as his grey eyes cracked open hey stranger hermione whispered as his eyes met hers shocked as they began to fill with tears it alright you re going to be ok she murmured as she pulled him closer his tired arms wrapping tightly around her as he buried his face in her curls and breathed in her scent hermione sirius breathed merlin i never thought i d see you again hermione chuckled you cantget rid of me that easily she said as sirius pulled back to look at her bugger he joked causing hermione grin to grow sirius matched her smile and leaned in for a kiss savouring the sweet taste of his wife lips pulling back hermione looked over sirius can you walk sirius nodded they only knocked me out i ll be ok hermione rolled her eyes as she helped sirius to his feet yeah only once sirius was on his feet his gaze traveled past the other three men to the staircase you came from up there he asked hermione nodded why that where they took harry hermione glanced down at the now wet map in her hands that where elizabeth is too sirius glanced down and met hermione eyes let go then disclaimer i donthave rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 35 dyin aint much of a livin o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius turned to graham as dust kicked up into the air his matted hair flying in his face as he spun get her out of here he shouted to the auror before climbing over the rubble to where he d last seen draco hermione looked confused for a moment before her eyes widened in realisation no she stated firmly trying to get out of graham grip let me go we have to get out of here graham reasoned trying to pull hermione in the direction of the door a deep rumbling could be heard from above and graham auror instincts kicked in he pulled hermione wand from her hand as he wound his arms around her waist physically lifting her from the floor as it shook beneath their feet no sirius hermione screamed as she fought against graham her head was pounding and her entire body ached but she was not leaving without her family sirius tried to ignore hermione cries as he began moving rocks with his bare hands magic forgotten as he desperately tried to reach his daughter let go of me hermione cries began to be drowned by the noise above as his hands began to bleed fingernails and palms scraping on the rough material in front of him as determined a woman as she was hermione was injured and was no use against a trained auror sirius sirius noted the pairs struggled exit as he felt a piece of rubble move against his leg moving down slightly he quickened his pace draco he called get this lot off me the young wizard responded from below clutching his wand sirius muttered a levitation charm and moved the pile of rubble off draco the wizard was curled in a ball his body encompassing the small one year old in his arms moving quickly sirius bent down to help draco up she okay the blond said answering the question forming on sirius lips sirius took a sobbing elizabeth from draco arms as the floor shifted violently beneath them once more lets get moving sirius suggested already making his way down the pile of rubble pausing he turned and eyed the dusty wizard behind him a line of blood was moving down the side of his face from his hairline and he swayed slightly on the spot my leg broken draco stated wincing as he moved slightly ok sirius reasoned before moving to draco and handing elizabeth back he stepped forward to support the wizard who d saved his daughters life we re going to have to move fast draco nodded as sirius helped him to flat ground sirius picked up the pace and draco leant more weight on the older wizard as the pain in his leg grew o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o graham grip tightened on the struggling hermione as the fortress shook around them cracks began to appear along the floors and walls as he retraced his steps as best he could towards the staircase that led the way out put me down the rumbling around them would have drowned hermione pleas had she not been so close to his ear nails dug into his arms and booted heels hit his shins as hermione tried to move desperately in the direction they had just come a sudden shake of the floor beneath his feet loosened his grip on the witch as he tried to maintain balance for them both turning towards him hermione ignored the crashing around them and looking pleadingly at him let me go she murmured her voice only just reaching his ears they re my life i cantleave them o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o fred had long since hoisted harry over his shoulders and opted to carry him rather than drag him along the dusty corridors unsure as to what harry had been subjected to the weasley twin was apprehensive about performing any magic on the boy who lived side stepping falling pieces of ceiling feet moving quickly to maintain a level of balance as the floors shook beneath him fred rounded a corner and sighted the staircase in front of him running unsteadily down the corridor avoiding gaping holes in the floor and piles of debris fred made it to the banister glancing up he saw large pieces of ceiling give way and fall hundreds of feet to the floor below shifting harry slightly fred started to quickly make his way down the stairs relying on blind luck not to be hit as deafening crashes sounded around him after a few flights down his luck ran out and a large slab landed meters away sending fred flying through the air with the resulting shockwave landing heavily against a wall and feeling a sharp pain through his wand arm fred groaned as the dust settled around them cracking open his eyes bright light surrounded him blinking fred realised he was leaning against a door frame and the light was coming from outside as the afternoon sun crept towards the horizon shaking himself into action fred spotted harry lying still a few meters away crawling over to his friend fred rolled him over and noted harry chest moving as he coughed dust from his lungs it ok harry fred assured as he hoisted the young wizard back into his arms i ve found the way out moving quickly outside onto the grass of the surrounding mountain slope fred stepped down a number of rocky terraces till he felt comfortable with the distance between them and the fortress gently laying harry against a bank fred tried to wake him harry he asked gently laying a hand on his shoulder one of harry green eyes cracked open in response i going back to help the others will you be okay here harry closed his eyes and nodded right then fred said standing and turning back to look up at the doorway they had recently exited dust was billowing out like smoke and crashes could be heard echoing down the valley see you soon he said to harry and with a grim look of determination set back up the slope towards the mountain o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o glancing back down the corridor as the fortress shook around them graham spotted sirius round the far corner struggling with draco hermione following his gaze broke free of the aurors slacked hold grabbed her wand and took off in the direction of her husband hermione wait she heard graham call out behind her sirius gaze shot up as he heard grahams voice hermione was running towards them round piles of rock her arms up over her head to protect herself as the ceiling began to cave the wall to the right of them started to disintegrate under the impounding weight from above go back sirius shouted over the roar surrounding them but his wife was stubborn and reached them moments later taking elizabeth from draco arms run sirius shouted over the noise as graham caught them and moved to the other side of draco ducking his head under the blond arm and taking the rest of his weight hermione spun cradling her daughter in her arms and began to move quickly down the long hall you keep running and do not look back sirius ordered his wife his words muffled even to his own ears the only response he received that hermione had heard them was her chocolate eyes turning to face him holding his eyes momentarily before turning again and moving ahead of the wizards behind her rounding the corner of the staircase fred spotted the group making their way down the hall as hermione reached him he placed a hand on her back and urged her forward leading the way down the stairs where harry hermione shouted to the redhead outside he yelled back come on this is the way out hermione resisted the urge to turn for sirius as fred led her to the tall doorway supporting the entrance rocks crashed around them and choking dust filled the air pulling elizabeth closer to her chest hermione tried her best to protect her daughter from flying debris behind them graham sirius and draco reached the landing and began to make their way down the stairs sirius felt magic fall around him and glanced at graham the wards he shouted through the dust o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione gulped in fresh air as fred urge her forward away from the falling fortress away from sirius moving to the left and throwing fred off balance hermione spun and watched in horror as the carved doorway collapsed and rubble piled out onto the mountainside dust billowing like smoke into the blood red evening sky hermione heard a guttural scream and realised it was her own voice producing the sound she moved back towards the entrance but fred held her back you cant fred said voice raised over hermione screams as she struggled against him noooooo he still alive let me go think of elizabeth fred reasoned drawing hermione attention to the girl in her arms hermione screams turned to a low moan as her legs turned to jelly and folded beneath her fred lowered her and elizabeth gently to the ground as he heard two soft pops behind him her face held no colour as she held her daughter close to her chest hermione clutched at fred robes her hands desperately seeking support as her mouth formed silent pleas her voice catching as she stared numbly at the collapsed entrance he barely registered footsteps passing behind him before sirius knelt down on the other side of hermione hermione love sirius murmured taking his wife and daughter into his arms as fred let go and stood it alright we re okay hermione looked up skin pale and eyes red with tear tracks through the layer of dust on her cheeks as she met sirius grey reassuring eyes sobbing hermione wrapped an arm around sirius neck and pulled him close breathing in his musky scent as she held on tight sirius wrapped his arms around his family and rocked hermione to calm her down gently laying a bloodied hand on his daughter head between them fred took a deep shaking breath shocked at the tears streaming down his own face turning he saw graham lower draco down beside harry immediately the pair began to quietly banter with each other you look like hell draco muttered as graham conjured a splint for his leg the corner of harry mouth lifted in an attempt to smile as he glanced to the wizard at his right if i had my wand i d conjure you a mirror draco glanced down at his own wand snapped in two and hanging by a fibre passing it to harry who d closed his eyes draco put it in his friends hand you can have mine he muttered before leaning back against the bank and closing his eyes elizabeth harry asked quietly i got her draco murmured she okay thank you you re welcome graham smiled at the two before turning to fred can you sort out a portkey to get these two back to the hospital wing when fred nodded graham turned to the still form of snape he d noticed down slope next to a watchtower i going to go sort out professor snape my team can deal with it well enough fred nodded again and bearing the pain in his wand arm set to work on a portkey o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks felt her eyes lose focus as she fought sleep she d barely rested since remus was brought in and was at a loose end as to what to do for her fianc bill was resting comfortable in the bed next to the lycan broken leg elevated and healing throughout the night a shrill sudden noise around her made tonk violet eyes fly open as the auror stood in panic madame pomfry and ginny ran into the room and straight to remus as he began to convulse on the bed his vitals are failing madame pomfry announced moving quickly with her wand to try and assist the wizard on the bed ginny beside her wand out and working with the medi witch tonks stepped back feeling helpless her eyes quickly filled with tears and her hands covered her mouth she felt her knees hit the bed behind her as her legs gave way unable to tear her eyes from remus as he shook in front of her o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a while later when the stars were out and the crescent moon offered a slither of light sirius led an exhausted hermione and a sleeping elizabeth down to the others graham was making his way back up the slope and met them as fred finished with the portkey it enough to get harry and draco plus another to the hospital wing fred said looking down at the branch in his hands alright sirius said quietly you take draco and harry we ll apparate to the edge of the grounds hermione lifted her head from sirius shoulder and looked him up and down his robes were torn the left side of his face was bruised and cuts and scrapes littered his skin his knuckles were raw and blood dripped from his hands sirius caught her look and shook his head we need at least one able bodied person with them i ll be fine he glanced at fred who nodded alright then sirius murmured let go home gently moving hermione to stand close to fred sirius stepped over to harry crouching between him and draco he gently shook his godson harry mate we have a portkey it going to be jarring but it will take you straight to the hospital wing harry good eye cracked open and he nodded sirius turned and repeated his actions to the blond resting next to harry draco he asked placing an hand on the young wizards arm and shaking gently disclaimer i donthave rights to harry potter or bon jovi o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 36 lie to me o o o o o o o o o o o o o o draco sirius repeated using slight more force as he shook the young wizard when hermione didnthear a response she lifted her head off fred shoulder and looked down at her friend his face was covered in a fine layer of dust save for a small trail of blood making its way down from his hairline ennervate sirius murmured as fred reached across and took elizabeth from hermione arms when the blond didntrespond to sirius spell hermione moved forward kneeling down on the soft grass on his other side shaking the wizard as she called out to him draco wake up his soft grey eyes remained closed hearing the concerned voices float down the small terrace graham quickly made his way back up the slope to find sirius and hermione desperately trying to wake draco moving over to where hermione knelt graham crouched down beside her let me he said softly hermione switched places with the auror and grasped draco hand watching as sirius and graham tried to revive him moving him from off the bank to lie flat on the ground her chocolate eyes followed sirius hand his knuckles red and raw he moved it down the smooth pale skin of draco arm leaving a trail of blood and dust as he gently took hold of his wrist she heard sirius sigh but refused to look up hermione sirius said gently hermione shook her head not looking up at her husband beside her she felt graham shift and step back hermione sirius repeated as he moved and knelt next to her no she whispered fighting the tears that threatened denying the truth she couldntgrieve if it wasnttrue he gone love sirius murmured gently no she whispered again clutching at the still warm hand she held in her own i dontunderstand you got him out you were okay she glanced up at sirius meeting his grey eyes he saved her hermione murmured as a single tear fell down her cheek sirius nodded i know he did but draco wouldntdo things any differently if he had the choice you know that hermione nodded numbly before moving forward and pulling draco into her lap and holding him close she rocked the young wizard in her arms as if comforting him not herself sirius sighed and stood turning to face the others graham face was void of any emotion he d been around death long enough to know it happened to anyone at any time fred was holding a sleeping elizabeth staring at the scene in shock tears running down his freckled face the portkey sirius asked quietly fred looked up at the older wizard um it it should be ready to go soon sirius nodded take harry and elizabeth back to the hospital wing he said quietly to fred fred glanced down at the sleeping child in his arms as sirius reached out and gently stroked her black hair but sirius looked up and met fred eyes just hold her tight he said quietly we ll apparate back to the grounds and meet you there he glanced at the two men in front of him and both nodded ok sirius said glancing down at hermione she d had her eyes closed with her cheek resting on top of draco head we ll see you soon fred nodded and crouched next to harry gently grasping the injured wizard hand and placing it on the portkey moments later sirius watched as fred disappeared with his daughter and godson faint pops down the slope brought sirius attention to three aurors apparating in graham caught the animagi gaze and nodded they re okay we ll sort out a cover story nothing will get traced back he tried to kill remus sirius said quietly graham shook his head as he began to make his way down the slope i dontknow what happened here sirius maybe its best it stays that way sirius frowned at the auror then nodded thank you he said quietly graham made to move down to his team uh what about malfoy he asked pausing in his descent sirius glanced behind him at the pair on the ground we ll take him back to hogwarts give me a few minutes i ll come back and help sirius nodded and turned back to hermione o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when fred landed in the hospital wing he landed in what he could only describe as chaos the private room the group often had a use for was bustling with activity a loud shrill noise piercing his ears bill was trying to hold remus down on the bed as he balanced on one leg a sobbing tonks stood opposite tying to help his brother tears streaming down her heart shaped face ginny and madame pomfry had their wands out trying desperately to stop the werewolf from seizing at the door four curious faces most likely students occupying the adjacent hospital wing watched on with wide eyes feeling his grip on harry slacken fred quickly made his way over to the bed bill had been resting in and laid harry down the young wizard was unconscious but breathing and fred stepped back transfiguring a chair into a cot he gently placed elizabeth down who was now awake and crying concentrating fred swiftly cast a silencing charm around the small cot he could still hear her crying but the sharp noise of the room no longer reached the child ears running to the door the four wizards eyes grew wide as the red head approached move he shouted dashing past them as they quickly dispersed rushing to an open window fred cast a patronus sending it to find sirius he watched as the fox rounded the corner of the darkened castle before making his way back into the seperate wing o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione sirius said crouching down beside her let go home hermione glanced up a silent question in her eyes as she glanced down at the aurors graham was now making his way back up the hill his eyes tired as ran a hand down his face we ll take him back with us okay hermione nodded and gently lay draco down on the grass a slight breeze picking up strands of his blonde hair that had come loose from their bindings graham reached the couple and crouched down beside draco lifting the wizard into his arms i ll take him he offered quietly and sirius nodded hermione didnttake her eyes off the pair until they departed with a soft pop ready sirius asked quietly he felt hermione nod and appareted them both back to hogwarts leaving the valley cloaked in darkness landing on the cool grass sirius felt his head spin and hermione hands clutch at him as he swayed on his feet sirius she asked concerned you shouldnthave done that sirius sent hermione a crooked grin her face blurry in front of him bit late now before hermione could respond sirius noticed a fuzzy bright light round the corner of the castle as graham entered the main doors with draco what that he asked as hermione wrapped her arms around his waist to help steady him following his gaze hermione saw the red fox leaving a trail of silver float towards them that fred patronus she answered as it neared the hospital wing sirius stated frowning and stepping forward out of hermione grasp trying to ignore the faint feeling in his bones sirius began to run hermione close on his heels o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius burst loudly into the hospital wing after racing past graham in the corridors to four shocked wide eyed faces staring back a sight to behold the animagus had torn robes and was wet muddy and covered in blood regaining his bearings after a moment he felt hermione slip her hand in his and lead him to the private wing to the right making a less dramatic entrance than sirius did moments before the pair entered the room to silence bill and fred sat wearily in chairs breathing heavily tonks sat on the chair closest to remus her black hair flowing down her back and around her face as she rested it on the bed beside her fianc her hand clasping his tightly madame pomfry and ginny were red faced and sweating as they fought to regain their breath striding swiftly over to remus sirius glanced down at his deathly pale friend before speaking up what happened he asked the group as he checked remus burnt and bleeding leg he stable now madame pomfry answered now sirius snapped turning to face the medi witch in shock hermione had moved over to the small cot she had spotted and gently lifted elizabeth into her arms sirius pointed at ginny you see to harry then hermione turning to madame pomfry sirius beckoned her to follow we need to talk sirius led the medi witch into the adjourning wing as graham made his way quietly inside with draco madame pomfry eyes widened as she noted the wizard in front of her failing to draw breath throwing a questioning glance at sirius she watched as he transfigured another of her chairs at the end of the room into a bed and curtains graham nodded as he stepped through the doorway and passed ginny working on harry and hermione and elizabeth before stepping behind the curtains sirius turned to the medi witch and caught her glance not now poppy he murmured she nodded and began to explain what had happened to remus and the extent of the injury to his leg i cantthink of what else to do she explained the spells arentworking i ve notified a colleague at st mungo who offered his service and will be here in the morning but to be honest i dontknow if he ll last another attack let alone the full moon sirius continued sighing and moving to stand in the doorway to the other room his gaze rested on remus as he leant wearily back against the doorframe madame pomfry moved a chair over to the wizard and made him sit down as she started to work on his injuries despite his initial protests i dontknow how you were even still standing she said quietly to him a short time later as he sat in thought we need to amputate sirius stated ignoring her previous statement as his gaze never failed to waver from the werewolf what madame pomfry replied stunned at the sudden suggestion it was a rare occurrence in the wizarding world to remove limbs she only knew of one case and alastor moody wasntthe most average of wizards sirius glanced up at the witch healing his injuries we need to stop the spread of the silver removing his leg is our best option sirius paused as she thought his suggestion over it the only option poppy you know i right uh she replied flustered i ll be back i need to check something she replied blinking and turning on her heel sirius nodded as she made her way down to her office to find the reference she sought looking back into the room sirius saw ginny finish on harry he was out of his wet robes and now in a hospital gown his godson was covered in bandages as the young healer shakily covered him in a soft sheet sighing wearily she turned to hermione only to find the witch curled on the small couch asleep with elizabeth in her arms sirius stood and made his way over to his wife as ginny stepped towards the curtains that graham had taken draco behind he watched as graham stood from his seat and intercept the young witch shaking his head and bending slightly to whisper in her ear sirius sat beside hermione as he watched ginny emphatically shake her head before moving quickly behind the curtain sirius glanced down at hermione who was breathing steadily elizabeth slept snuggled against her mother chest one hand holding onto hermione dusty robes the other resting near her small head looking around the room bill had fallen asleep where he sat his leg now propped on a stool in front of him fred was trying to mimic his older brother but uncomfortably shifted in his seat sirius reluctantly stood and stepped behind the curtain ginny had entered previously she was sitting on the chair next to the blond wand out after trying to revive him sirius stepped over to the small redhead and placed a hand on her shoulder no one could have done anything he murmured ginny nodded i know i checked him over she paused and looked up at sirius what hit him on the head she asked quietly a mountain sirius answered honestly without the customary humour in his voice ginny hazel eyes widened and he offered her a comforting smile he saved elizabeth he explained as he stood and took her hand come on your brother needs a look at ginny nodded and followed sirius out of the partition and walked over to fred kneeling beside him and asking where he was hurt sirius watched as she expertly healed the fracture in his wand arm before wrapping a bandage around his head still bandage free despite his injuries sirius sat back down beside hermione and closed his eyes for a moments rest o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o voices brought sirius out of his slumber and he woke to the sun streaming through the tall windows hermione had shifted in her sleep and her head now rested in sirius lap reaching down sirius brushed his hand over her cheek his fingers were still stained red and left light smudges on hermione face looking over to the sound of the voices sirius saw madame pomfry and an unfamiliar wizard standing next to remus and talking quietly to tonks harry was still asleep ginny resting on the chair next to his bed as she listened to the conversation across the room hermione shifted and sirius glanced down to find her looking over at remus bed they re going to remove his leg arentthey she asked quietly yes sirius answered taking elizabeth from her arms as his daughter opened her blue eyes hello my darling did you sleep well recent memories were forgotten as elizabeth blinked tiredly before her mouth formed a wide grin giggling as her dad smiled back hermione sat up and moved to harry bed to check on her friend he still asleep ginny said quietly as hermione approached and glanced down at harry does he know about her gaze flickering to the partitioned area hermione shook her head i dontthink so oh ginny paused do you want me to tell him hermione shook her head again no i ll do it when he wakes up ginny nodded glad to be relieved of the burden hermione glanced at the group surrounding remus will you help them she asked if they need it hermione made her way around to ginny side of the bed ginny hmm hermione crouched down next to her chair do you mind giving me a quick check up i just want to know if the baby is okay oh hermione i forgot you were asleep and then draco hermione smiled at ginny it okay i feel fine just for peace of mind please ginny nodded and led hermione out of the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione returned to the room with a small smile on her face and turned towards sirius her smile faltered as she gazed at her husband he held elizabeth close to his chest as tears made their way silently down his face elizabeth head was resting on his shoulder as her small fingers grasped a strand of sirius damp hair as he tried to hold back his sobs hermione slowly stepped towards them and sirius met her eyes kneeling down in front sirius hermione cocked her head and sent him a shaky smile he returned it and let out a deep shuddering breath loosening his hold on elizabeth as he gazed down at her small face hermione rested her hand on her daughter back daddy made you all dirty she was already dirty sirius answered sniffing slightly before clearing his throat and standing up handing elizabeth to hermione as she rose beside him maybe mummy will give you a bath i need to check on uncle moony sirius looked up from elizabeth to hermione who shook her head we ll wait sirius smiled and nodded as he made his way over to remus bed wiping his face as madame pomfry ushered tonks out and conjured partitions to surround the werewolf o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a few hours later hermione looked up from a sleeping elizabeth as harry stirred on his bed fred had taken a trip to the kitchens earlier and brought them back some breakfast satisfied elizabeth had promptly fallen asleep bill and fred were quietly discussing the events to their parents who had arrived in the morning tonks was sitting next to them staring at the curtains blocking her view of the procedure inside checking to make sure that elizabeth was comfortable hermione made her way to harry bed as he opened one of his eyes the other now covered in a bandage how are you feeling hermione asked taking his hand better harry replied wincing slightly as he propped himself up and glanced at the partitioned beds on either side of him what going on they re removing remus leg to stop the spread of the silver hermione explained harry eye widened as he looked back at the curtains a moment later he moved his gaze to the right where graham slept on a chair in front of the second partitioned area hermione saw where he was looking and sighed harry she murmured drawing his attention back to her she paused slightly before continuing draco didntmake it she said softly feeling her own eyes prick with tears what harry asked confused but he was sitting next to me talking to me he was fine hermione shook her head he fell asleep and didntwake up harry mouth opened and closed as he tried to find the words to match the chaos in his head but i sorry harry hermione murmured as she reached up and brushed a tear from his cheek why harry asked eyes pleading with hermione to answer the impossible question on his lips i always get people taken from me hermione sighed not everyone she whispered you have ginny sirius and i and the weasley s you re not alone harry harry nodded his face angry i know but i d rather keep everyone is that so selfish of me no harry that not selfish at all o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hours later hermione was watching tonks feed elizabeth the other witch grateful for the distraction as sirius ginny madame pomfry and the other medi wizard attempted to save her fianc movement out of the corner of her eye brought her gaze around as sirius stepped out from behind the curtain smiling at her he made his way over to tonks his hands were clean he d removed his dirty robes and had rolled his shirt sleeves up to his elbows tonks he asked quietly crouching down next to the couch she was on we ah we had to remove remus leg from just below his knee it went smoothly and the others are working on cleansing the rest of his blood tonks nodded fresh tears in her eyes will he be okay sirius nodded it might take him a while to wake up but he ll be okay you can go and see him tonks smiled and passed elizabeth to hermione as she hugged sirius thank you you re welcome tonks stood and moved to the partition and slipped inside sirius stood and turned to hermione with a smile how about that bath o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when the hospital wing had quietened and people left to their respective rooms for a much needed wash and rest harry eyes rested on draco broken wand that had been left on his bedside table sighing at draco sense of humour harry gingerly got out of his bed swaying slightly as he stood blood pounded in his ears and he paused momentarily before shuffling across the floor pushing back the curtains to where hermione had said draco was harry stepped forward his friend was lying still on the bed his dark fighting robes around him a stark contrast to the white sheets beneath him harry noticed the splint graham had conjured and allowed himself a bitter smile they thought draco broken leg was the worst of his injuries how wrong they were harry brought his gaze up to draco pale face someone most likely hermione harry surmised had brought a bowl of water in and cleaned his face the only evidence of his head injury was the deep gash slightly above his hairline harry felt ginny beside him as she slipped her hand into his hermione was right he wasntalone in the world but it didntmake the situation hurt any less o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a n i not entirely happy with this chatper it isntas good as i wanted it to be but it is

large mansion doors her white shoes sounding off the marble floors as she ran straight into the arms of sirius hello munchkin sirius said smiling at his daughter did you bring everything elizabeth held up her toy wolf and nodded sirius chuckled good girl he praised as hermione came into the entrance of malfoy manor with three year old alexander in her arms like his older sister alexander had sparkling blue eyes though had yet to learn the mischievousness that was often in elizabeths his hair however though straight like elizabeth was a deep chocolate brown sirius beamed welcome home hermione returned sirius smile after four years living and teaching at hogwarts they had both decided that elizabeth and alexander needed space away from the school passing on their teaching duties to an eager tonks and graham the pair had packed their belongings and began to shift into the centuries old manor draco had spent a year after graduating hogwarts restoring his family home gone was much of the unnecessary space the blond having settled on a home with two living wings a library and a formal entertaining area the long corridors that sirius and hermione had remembered following when they rescued her from the time trap were gone along with the trap land had been cleared of dark magic and evidence of the old manor had begun to be reclaimed by the woods over the last four years hermione turned as harry and ginny walked in harry was carrying numerous boxes as ginny watched him amusedly the redhead was a few weeks pregnant with the couples first child and harry had insisted she not lift a finger while they shifted into the second wing of the mansion you sure this place is safe to live in harry asked sirius and hermione as he placed the boxes against the wall hermione nodded refraining to remind harry he was a wizard i dontthink draco left much of the original mansion standing and sirius and i have checked and re checked he did a good job harry grinned brilliant daddy sirius looked at elizabeth in his arms yes sweetheart is uncle remus coming to live with us too no he and your auntie are staying at hogwarts with amaris dontworry munchkin he added as elizabeth frowned they ll visit all the time would you like that elizabeth nodded and hugged her wolf close to her chest bloody hell the group turned to fred as he walked in staring at the large front doors before taking in the entrance hall boxes and furniture ready for a new home piled against the walls this place is huge the burrow would fit in this room alone three times language fred hermione admonished as she moved to the left towards the wing her and sirius were living in you should have seen the size of it before draco began work she added as the others followed scooting up to his baby sister fred bent down to her stomach as the walked along hello little one how my favourite god baby ginny shoved her brother playfully aside we may have asked you to be godfather but please dontstart teaching him mischief before he born fred eyes brightened so you re having a boy then harry chuckled and shook his head we dontknow yet it could be a girl he argued staring pointedly at his wife sirius and hermione exchanged an amused glance it could always be twins sirius said chuckling as harry face paled twins o o o o o o o o o o o o o o twelve years later sitting alone in the train carriage seventeen year old elizabeth black smiled and waited she d spent the extra few minutes thinking before she was bombarded with the younger members of her extended family on their way home for christmas her father wasntgoing to be happy that she was sure of her blue eyes sparkled as she pictured his face he d be standing at the station a bunch of wild flowers in his hands he always had for her when she came home waiting patiently for her to step off the train she was always taller than when he d last seen her a few months earlier and even though she d stopped growing and was at a comfortable height between her parents he always made the same comment she loved her father but this christmas she was brining home a surprise one she d discussed with her mother but refrained from mentioning in her letters home to sirius elizabeth enjoyed the silence for a few minutes before her face lit up as said surprise entered the compartment moments before the excited shouts of her younger brother and their cousins followed lizzie fifth year alexander exclaimed as he spotted his sister slipping into the seat beside her as the tall wizard that had sparked her eyes sat opposite with a smile on his face her brother was the only one of two people she knew of that called her lizzie the other was her uncle draco her parents had sat her down before she left for her first year at hogwarts and explained what had happened when she was one shortly after her mother had given her draco wand repaired meticulously by ollivander previously she had been extremely excited about getting her own wand but was found speechless at the gift a fact her father still teased the talkative witch about her first year at hogwarts was hard for the young witch not only did she miss her parents terribly she was uncomfortable with the attention she received because of her name that coupled with reoccurring nightmares of memories long since lost had caused the witch to turn to her father sirius had come to hogwarts and spent a few weeks with remus and tonks while keeping a close eye on his daughter he was there when she woke at night using her uncles invisibility cloak to sneak down the long cold corridors and he there to help her with her school work though from those first few weeks sirius could tell that studies were not going to be a problem for his daughter in just a number of weeks the eleven year old was back to her playful self and sirius let her settle into what would be her home for the next seven years though she didntlike to admit it now as the independent witch she d become she was eternally grateful for those few weeks does dad know alexander asked elizabeth glanced at her brother though he was a couple of years younger he was steadily catching up to her height and they were often mistaken for twins elizabeth shook her head eyes dancing as she grinned back nope alexander looked across at the dark haired wizard across from the pair that was happily talking to his closest friend amaris lupin about a new book that was due out for christmas her parents were somewhere on the train leaving their daughter to spend time with her friends they d tried to keep a reasonable distance during her schooling but all three were grateful that they were close amaris was studious like her father but had developed a playful streak each of their generation seemed to possess the ability to change her appearance had helped on numerous pranks but the young witch would stick to the soft ash blonde she d inherited from her father for most of the year beside them the second year potter twins chatted and plotted between themselves their godfather had proudly taught the young pair mischief from an early age and thanks to fred nathan and annalise were slowly making themselves known around the school nathan had inherited his mothers fiery red hair and hazel eyes but his fathers quiet disposition while annalise was a splitting image of her father and was often known to have a temper that was well known amongst woman with weasley blood alexander broke into a wide grin you know he going to flip right elizabeth followed her brothers gaze maybe not she said smiling as the wizard across from her made eye contact does mum know elizabeth nodded good he said mum and uncle harry can hold him back before he tries to kill christian elizabeth looked back at her brother and smiled he cant protect me forever alexander scoffed this is dad we re talking about o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione smiled as she stood next to harry and ginny on platform nine and three quarters with a bunch of wildflowers sirius had handed to her to look after sirius was busy chasing madison the youngest potter and she giggled and weaved around waiting parents legs the five year old held a special place in his heart the youngest of the potter brood she had captured hermione sirius and remus right from the beginning she was growing to look exactly like her grandmother with deep red hair pale skin and emerald eyes and sirius couldnttake enough photos of the young witch not for the first time hermione found herself glad that magical folk aged slower than muggles sirius didntlook a day older than the day of their wedding a few added wrinkles around his eyes and mouth were the only indication any time had passed she grinned to herself thinking that there may be more wrinkles maybe even a grey hair or two by the end of the day she had wanted to tell sirius about the young wizard elizabeth was bringing home for christmas she didntlike keeping things from her husband but her daughter as eloquent as her mother with her words and as sly as her father had convinced hermione to keep quiet elizabeth wanted to tell her father in person and though she was well aware of his likely reaction had stubbornly stuck to her decision hermione hoped elizabeth had at least warned christian she watched as sirius swooped and picked up madison in his arms and smiled as he pointed the train out to her as it appeared in the distance struggling down from sirius arms madison came running back to her parents daddy daddy daddy she chanted as she ran up in her green dress and black shoes and wrapped her arms around harry legs the train i found the train harry smiled leaned over and picked her up where is it sweetheart madison spun in his arms her green eyes bright there she pointed to the train as sirius came up and stood beside hermione wrapping an arm around her waist and pulling her close hermione handed the flowers back to sirius and he grinned down at her giving elizabeth flowers had been his tradition since first greeting the small eleven year old on her first christmas home from hogwarts her brother had emphatically told both his parents not to embarrass him in such a manner a couple of years later as they sent him off to join his sister at school hermione and sirius watched as the train pulled in the first off the train were remus and tonks they watched as tonks turned and helped her husband as he navigated the steep narrow steps with his wooden leg the werewolf had grown adept quickly at having an artificial leg and only small obstacles hindered him the pair made their way over as nathan and annalise bounded off the train taking the quick route and leaping over the stairs completely sirius grinned as remus approached maybe you should try that instead he said with a grin pointing at the leaping twins remus rolled his eyes and smiled at his friend i too old for leaping off trains padfoot you re not old moony i swear i haventseen a new grey hair in years remus smiled as amaris walked down the steps his only child brought a smile to his face whenever he saw her and had loved teaching and watching her learn over the last few years behind her alexander hopped down and hermione slipped past remus and made her way towards her son careful not to break into a run and embarrass the teenager you ve grown hermione commented as she reached him and pulled him into a hug hey mum alexander greeted missed you he said so only she could hear hermione pulled back and smiled i missed you too she glanced behind him at the empty door as she felt sirius step up behind her before letting alexander greet his father she quietly asked where your sister alexander grinned coming he whispered as he stepped into sirius arms hermione moved and stood next to sirius as elizabeth looked out of the door her blue eyes searching out her parents finding sirius her eyes lit up and she stepped off the train quickly walking fast she slipped first into sirius arms you re taller sirius commented as he pulled back and handed elizabeth her flowers elizabeth fought the eye roll and accepted the flowers from her dad thanks dad she said as she stepped over to her mother sirius smiled as he watched hermione and elizabeth alexander was joking with amaris and remus and tonks were quietly talking to harry he watched harry cringe then laugh as he looked over and met sirius eyes sirius frowned confused as he turned back to hermione elizabeth was standing holding her mothers hand as she looked expectantly up at her father excitement and apprehension evident in her blue eyes what sirius asked curious dad there someone i want you to meet sirius grey eyes narrowed in suspicion as a tall dark hair wizard approached with two bags one the animagus recognised as elizabeth s sirius watched as the young wizard stood next to his daughter and elizabeth let go of hermione hand in exchange for the strangers next to her sirius stared icily at the wizard before his eyes fell back to elizabeth dad this is christian christian stepped forward his hand out to greet the older wizard sirius looked down at hermione who had moved beside him and slipped her hand in his be nice she whispered you knew he murmured back glancing at elizabeth who was looking nervously between her parents yes but i her mother i know these things sirius grunted ignoring his daughter and the young wizards outstretched hand as he processed the new information sirius hermione admonished quietly dontbe rude sirius glanced back at christian who was looking slightly unsure of himself mister black he started as sirius reached out and shook the outstretched hand it an honour to meet you sirius nodded as he released christians hand unsure of what to do next moving his gaze to elizabeth sirius was shocked at the broad smile she was sending his way i hermione hermione said to christian offering him a reassuring smile and stepping up and taking the young wizards hand before leading him towards the others i ll introduce you to the rest of the family christian smiled and with one last look at elizabeth was led away by her mother elizabeth stepped up to her father dad she asked quietly as sirius watched his wife lead the wizard away sirius looked down at elizabeth and she slipped her hand into his as they moved to follow hermione he really nice she reasoned as she watched her father grey eyes settle on christian sirius glanced back down at her a small smile tugging at his lips i sure he is but i only just met him elizabeth rolled her eyes you didntsay a word i was in shock what so shocking about a boy he not just any boy is he and a bit of warning would have been nice i told mum why did you tell your mum and not me sirius asked slightly hurt elizabeth smiled up at her father so she could hold you back sirius scoffed and because mum mum i had to tell her sirius glanced at elizabeth then hermione and allowed the corners of his lips to lift slightly you ll give christian a chance elizabeth asked quietly sirius nodded for you i d give anyone a chance elizabeth grinned and hugged sirius arm as they neared the group thanks dad she paused and eyed her brother besides alex is fawning over miriam zabini sirius grinned as hermione caught the tail end of the conversation and spun around to her son what alexander blushed then grinned smiling at his father she great dad she smart has beautiful brown eyes curly brown hair has a temper to boot and is a slytherin amaris added teasing her best friend she turned alexander hair purple last time he asked her out harry and ginny looked at each other and cracked up laughing the twins stepped away pulling madison along with them embarrassed by how un cool their parents looked at that moment in time alexander turned to his godparents what harry drew a deep breath and avoided hermione warning glare you just described your mother alexander face drained of colour before he glanced between sirius and christian the young wizard elizabeth had taken a fancy to was broad shouldered and had light blue eyes his hair wasntas long as sirius the ebony locks falling just over his ears but he held himself confidently and proudly and alexander picked up on the similarity he began pointing out the comparison as elizabeth released sirius hand handed her flowers back to her dad strode forward and started hitting her brother on the arm dontyou dare she ordered as he laughed and moved away from her swatting hands but alexander said laughing as he reached out to restrain his sister the rest of the group watched on amused he doesntlook at all like dad shut up sirius glanced at christian and raised an eyebrow apart from their black hair they didntlook at all alike yeah well alexander started as he managed to grasp hold of elizabeth hands miriam doesntlook like mum i said her hair was curly not bushy hey hermione said shocked sirius chuckled and pulled hermione close you re hair isntbushy love he promised running a hand over her long curls hermione smiled up at him thank you she made to turn to glare at her children when sirius suddenly dipped her and claimed her lips with his own ew came two simultaneous cries of horror we re in a public place sirius heard alexander exclaim as he grinned into the kiss do you mind harry chuckled as sirius pulled hermione up and the group began to make its way to the floo station sirius and hermione walked hand in hand behind smiling and talking quietly as their children walked together with christian following quietly behind the pair he could hear them discussing appropriate parental behaviour and ground rules they were going to be setting harry glanced back at the overly affectionate pair as sirius lent down and nuzzled hermione neck while they walked he turned back around and grinned some things never change disclaimer not mine sigh o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 3 back to bite him in the o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o snape strode briskly through the corridors in the dungeons the dripping of water sending his mind reeling back to his captivity suppressing a shudder he continued on his way his footfalls echoing off the silent corridor most of the students being in their common rooms on the dreary late january afternoon opening the door to his private office snape did a double take when he noticed black and lupin standing in front of his desk sirius set snape with a hard glare and the potions master returned the gesture may i ask what you are doing in my private quarters black he sneered as he neared the pair sirius smirked you can ask i not going to answer though snape frowned why do you plague me with your presence then because i going to show you instead snape cocked his greasy head show me what his hand was in his robes clasping his wand incase of an attack dontworry severus remus said placidly we are not here to duel again why are you here snape was getting impatient now he was too old for blacks little games hermione sirius stated simple snape rolled his eyes i should have known what does she need a potion directions to the door perhaps sirius growled low in the back of his throat why do you treat her like this snape what has she ever done to you you werentleft to rot in a prison cell were you oh wait yes you were snape smirked at the black haired wizard in front of him sirius ignored the jab and stepped aside revealing a pensive sitting on snapes large desk i thought that was the case he stated as snape stared curiously at the large basin like caldron why blame hermione though why not remus or i we were both there as he spoke he extracted silvery memories from his head and let the pool in the pensive the little know it all needs to be taken down a peg or two before snape could finish sirius had his collar bunched in his fists as he lifted the sickly man off the floor you selfish bastard do you know what hermione put herself through when we couldntget to you snape scoffed despite his current position i sure she did just like she couldntwait to jump at the chance of taking my job sirius growled and tightened his fists but remus placed a gently hand on his arm urging him to lower the sullen man to the floor snape straightened his robes and glared at the other two wizards anger seething through his veins now that you have entered my private chambers and proceeded to assault me i would like you to leave snape almost took an involuntary step backwards when he saw the look in sirius eyes oh we re not going anywhere right moony o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o snape stared apprehensively down at the pensive what makes you think i going to go ahead with this black sirius grinned a grin that though he would never admit shook snape to the core i can make your life miserable severus you know that if you give us this small moment of your oh so interesting time then i ll leave you alone snape pondered this for a moment before nodding i ll be coming with you remus will pull us out when we re done alright without waiting for snape to answer sirius pulled them both down into the swirling silver mist of sirius memories o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o snapes vision cleared and to his horror he gazed around at the long dark stone corridors beside him sirius gestured with his head to three dark clad figures making their way down the stone stairs a piercing scream through the stillness brought back a flood of unwanted memories to snape and he could feel his anger towards his colleague begin to rise somehow i dontthink we are alone snape turned to smirk at the sirius he was with really what made you think that shut up snivellus come on the group that had paused half way down the stairs began to move again and sirius and snape followed i dontsee why you brought me here snape started if anything you re just going to prove my point on how much of a failure your wife really is sirius controlled his anger as they neared snapes cell he heard the audible gasp of his companion as he looked down at his naked and bloody self alohormora they heard hermione cry out stupid witch did she really think they would put a simple locking charm on the door again sirius ignored snapes nasty comment he was trying to make a point and any minute now he would get it through snape watched as hermione lay down on the floor and attempted to reach his prone form a small frown line appearing between his eyes as he silently took in the scene she trying to get you close enough to portkey you back to hogwarts sirius murmured from beside him suddenly a deafening bell began to ring they re onto us you best hurry with that moony mate snape watched sirius raise his wand and send stunners down the corridor as hermione cried out in frustration at not being able to reach the wizard on the other side of the bars remus get the portkey ready i ll try to hold them off the observers watched as a loud explosion sent rubble into the air and snape noted the painful cry of hermione as she was hit by the debris before sirius covered her with his own body we need that portkey remus i getting there sirius help me snape watched in awe as his childhood foe got onto his own stomach and tried to reach him through a large pool of blood got it no hermione we have to go you cant do anymore it too late snape blinked as the scene changed confused as to why sirius was showing hermione in the hospital wing this is a few hours afterwards thought you d like to know how much hermione risked trying to save your neck in a moment but i have some news for the both of you i suggest sirius that you sit down if snape had been paying any attention to his neighbour he would have seen the anguish in sirius eyes at having to re live this particular memory were you aware my dear that you were two weeks pregnant snape shot sirius a look as the news sunk in for the couple on the bed i sincerely hope that what you mean by was two weeks pregnant is that we are now three weeks pregnant i sorry snape looked on his face hiding his emotions as hermione let out a loud sob and clung to sirius robes the scene once again faded and snape found himself in sirius and hermione chambers hermione was on the couch crookshanks on her lap as she stared blankly at the small table in front of her snape watched sirius walk into the scene and sit down beside her and hand her a cup of tea here you go love this will help we left his sirius we didntknow we shouldnthave just left him i know snape watched as sirius tenderly stroked hermione curls but we had no choice there always a choice o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o snape stood and stared at the two men in his office remus having just pulled him and sirius out of the pensive sirius was the first to speak as he headed for the door the old memories affecting him more than he thought possible hermione tried her best to save you she risked her life you have every right to hold grudges against remus and i but hermione has never done anything to you he murmured quietly purposely not mentioning the shampoo incident if you cause her anymore suffering i ll make sure you regret it sirius walked out of the room leaving the door wide open and remus in the room with snape snape met remus amber eyes for a moment and the werewolf smiled sadly at him i sugest an apology as being a good idea he said as he followed his friend out of the room leaving the potions master to his thoughts he had new memories to process never did he think ignorance would come to bite him in his ass disclaimer not mine well the plot line is the characters are not o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 4 a new beginning o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius stood leaning against the doorway of his and hermione bedroom watching her get ready for their appointment with madame pomfrey it was the end of february and at eight months hermione had in sirius eyes never looked so beautiful her smile was continuously contagious and she carried that glow that only expectant mothers could achieve hermione turned from her position on the settee and sent sirius a warm smile we re going to be late he pointed out you know how poppy gets when we re late hermione grinned yeah she tends to blame you sirius moved closer to hermione with a thoughtful expression odd that maybe it because it usually is your fault hey that wasntmy fault sirius said defending himself how was i supposed to know what that thing was your mother sent hermione didntbother to hide her grin remembering sirius almost breaking his neck falling head over heels over the fold up muggle pram anne granger had given them before he sent the helpless thing with wheels out to kill him up in flames sirius blushed un sirius like for a moment that was an accident my wand just reacted to my plight hermione grinned oh yeah more like accidentally on purpose sirius ignored the last comment and continued she cantblame me this time i was ready ten minutes ago unlike some people yes but you didnthelp some people up now did you sirius grin faded and he glared mockingly at hermione that is so mean hermione continued to grin and held out her hands well are you going to help me up or not sirius sighed begrudgingly i guess i have no choice in the matter hermione laughed as sirius pulled her to her feet oh my hard done by bugs sirius grinned and planted a kiss on hermione nose before taking her hand and leading her out of the room o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o as sirius and hermione wandered through the groups of students enjoying the weekend hermione heard someone call her name turning around all hermione saw was snape and a group of first year hufflepuffs neither of which would refer to her by her given name snape came and stood next to the couple if i may have a word hermione who was presently in a state of shock didntreply who are you and what have you done with snape she thought as she stared curiously at the potions master she sent a glance to sirius who had a small smile on his face planting a kiss on her temple he stepped back i ll meet you in the hospital wing hermione stared at his retreating back before turning back to snape who had just sent the first years scuttling away with a glance in their general direction severus hermione asked finally finding her voice slightly concerned at the uncertainty she could see in the dark eyes in front of her thank you hermione raised an eyebrow and felt a smile pull at her lips whatever for snape glanced down at hermione very pregnant stomach before meeting her chocolate eyes again for risking your life among other things to help me he answered as if it should have been the most obvious thing in the world hermione was stunned speechless once again you re you re welcome severus but why the change of heart snape smirked let just say your husband goes to great lengths for your general well being what did he do hermione asked growing suspicious of sirius actions he just showed me something that i needed to see now enough of this small talk the students will begin to think i ve gone soft snape nodded in farewell and strode off down the corridor in a billow of black robes o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o jade sarah annalise claire dominique madison hermione eyes lightened at remus suggestion what with all the girl names sirius complained we dontknow for sure what we are having he pointed out troy hermione and sirius looked at each other and shook their heads and ginny looked a little disappointed they were surrounded by friends and family who they had invited for dinner and were now into the naming game part of the evening i ve always liked elizabeth sirius suggested hermione smiled i thought you were confident of having a boy sirius grinned doesnthurt to cover all the bases what about eleanor remus recommended from the couch earning another appraising look from hermione moony boy names remus rolled his eyes at his friend how about james then he asked quietly well um we haventreally discussed that yet sirius said glancing uncertainly at hermione then to harry harry smiled i like james but if you get james i get lily sirius raised his eyebrows and looked between his godson and ginny who was presently a shade similar to her hair it not going to be a boy hermione pointed out resting comfortably in her rocking chair her hands lying softly on her stomach that what you think sirius returned that what i know it ll be a boy sirius said stubbornly i for one think you ll be great with a daughter sirius tonks said from across the room remus nodding in agreement sirius looked to harry and ginny ginny nodded but harry just shrugged and smiled i think you ll both be great parents no matter if it a boy or a girl sirius nodded and smiled down at his wife besides harry continued it could always be twins hermione paled slightly and sirius blanched sending the room into a fit of laughter o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione saw remus and tonks off later on in the evening before returning to the room and grinning at the sight that greeted her sirius had fallen asleep at the desk surrounded by baby books his head resting gently on his forearm hermione stood beside him and picked up a few of the books a wizards guide to parenting the how to for wizards raising witches the big book of wizarding names grinning hermione placed a small kiss on the side of sirius head before heading off to their bedroom not wanting to disturb his rest while she prepared for bed entering their large bathroom and closing the door behind her hermione felt a blinding pain hit her and she cried out before grabbing the basin for support o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry wandered back towards sirius and hermione chambers to floo back to their home after saying goodnight to ginny stepping quietly into the room he smirked at sirius sleeping form not seeing hermione anywhere he moved to gently wake his godfather before harry reached him however sirius bolted upright his soft grey eyes wide and alert sirius harry asked tentatively hermione sirius asked looking around before standing and running into the bedroom his black robes billowing out behind him harry growing more concerned by the second followed hermione sirius repeated calling out for his wife a muffled cry from the bathroom sent both black haired men off at a run o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer not mine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 5 miracle o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius paced backwards and forwards outside the hospital wing harry sitting on one of the chairs along the wall was beginning to grow dizzy as soon as they had seen hermione in pain her skin pale and clammy as she clutched her stomach they had rushed her to the hospital wing where madame pomfrey had taken one look at her and told the two men to wait outside shocked at being separated from his wife sirius was left speechless as the door closed in front of him since then he hadntbeen able to stand still growing continuously agitated that he couldntbe in the same room as hermione he had begun his dizzying pacing about to open the door himself sirius was stopped by remus running down the corridor with a tired looking tonks on his heels sirius remus called what happened sirius shook his head i dontknow he turned back to the door i have to go in there with no one daring to stop him sirius slipped back into the hospital wing where he was confronted with a piercing scream of pain the others didnteven bother to hesitate as they followed the animagus into the room hermione was lying on the bed covered with a thin blanket sweat beading on her forehead as madame pomfrey preformed diagnostic charms sirius hermione voice was barley a whisper but in an instant sirius was by her side he stole a glance at the medi witch who was finishing her charms she in labour but she not due for four more weeks sirius argued his eyes widening slightly madame pomfrey shook her head and smiled a little this baby wants out and it going to get it sirius turned to remus remus can you get hermione s i on it sirius remus said heading for the door i ll floo there now and bring them back sirius nodded absentmindedly as he smiled down encouragingly at hermione her hand clasped tightly in his as he wiped the moisture from her brow hermione face contorted in pain as she was hit by another contraction only three or four minutes between them now as the labour progressed gritting her teeth hermione moaned in pain and tightened her grip on sirius hand just breathe sweetie sirius murmured hermione closed her eyes and took a shuddering breath harry and tonks watched on from the side forgotten by sirius as his full attention now focused on hermione wellbeing hermione kept her eyes closed and concentrated her attention on sirius thumb presently running backwards and forwards across her hand the small gesture calming her nerves a fraction madame pomfrey came up beside the couple and hermione opened her eyes you re seven centimeters dilated just keep breathing steadily that all you can do for now hermione closed her eyes again and nodded sirius was practically sitting along the bed beside hermione her hand still tightly clasped in his as his other arm acted as a comforting pillow with hermione resting her head on his shoulder her body tensed again with another contraction and sirius saw movement out of the corner of his eye as dumbledore walked in with ginny in tow ginny walked up to harry and after sending sirius a reassuring smile led him out of the room tonks and dumbledore whose eyes held their customary sparkle followed sirius and hermione sat in silence for another hour before the contractions began to appear to mould together their frequency and pain increasing battering an already exhausted hermione ten centimeters madame pomfrey informed the couple quietly not long now before you have to start to push ok hermione hermione nodded her chocolate eyes remaining closed as sirius brushed a loose curl away from her hot and clammy jaw line before placing a soft kiss on her burning temple i love you he murmured hermione opened her eyes to meet sirius soft grey pair i love you too her voice was a barely audible whisper and sirius had never felt so helpless never before had he been able to hold her like this and not ease her pain as hermione was racked with contraction after contraction remus slipped into the room and crouched down next to sirius who tore his gaze away from his wife to meet remus amber eyes hermione parents are outside along with dumbledore tonks harry and ginny harry flooed draco he on his way sirius nodded i think its best they wait outside for now he turned to hermione honey your parents are here do you want to see them mum she whispered remus nodded and rose to his feet and walked to the other side of hermione bed and took her other hand you ll be ok hermione he murmured we re all here for you hermione sent a grateful smile to her friend as he gently placed her hand back down and went to get anne granger o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius gritted his teeth in frustration as hermione let out another agonizing cry of pain four hours into the labour and the contractions had become regular as her cervix fully dilated and they had begun to space apart allowing hermione to relax as best as she could between them ok madame pomfrey said from the end of the bed the baby crowning your going to need to push now hermione hermione features contorted as she gritted down and pushed that it hermione keep it up the mediwitch encouraged hermione cried out when she lost the energy to keep pushing it so hard she whispered cracking her eyes open to look up at sirius his stormy eyes filled to the brim with concern i know love but you ve come so far sirius sent a frantic look to hermione mum sitting on the other side of the bed you need to push hermione madame pomfrey called down from the bed with tears streaming down her face hermione pushed screaming at the pain searing through her body sirius ignored the tears flowing from his own eyes as he murmured words of encouragement half an hour after she had began to push madame pomfrey said three magical words one more hermione did you hear that love sirius whispered in her ear one more hermione took a deep breath and pushed her last scream mingling with the wails of an infant sirius smiled brightened up the whole room as madame pomfrey preformed the spells to cut the umbilical cord and clean the baby wrapping the child in a warm blanket the mediwitch handed the child over to its grandmother while she turned to tend to hermione no matter how much sirius wanted to hold his child it wasntover for his wife and he wasntgoing to leave her side twenty minutes later an exhausted hermione lay down as the last of the after birth was delivered you did it sirius whispered brushing hermione hair back from her face sirius felt someone behind him and turned to meet anne eyes before his grey ones fell to the quiet bundle in her arms anne handed said bundle over to sirius with a smile sirius stared down at his child in awe smiling as he looked back up at hermione tears stinging his eyes as he handed hermione her baby before slipping into the bed beside her she beautiful hermione whispered as she gazed down at her sleeping daughter before turning to sirius with a smile she has your hair she ll have your eyes sirius guessed big beautiful chocolate eyes and ebony hair going to be a looker this one hermione let out an exhausted laugh she wanted nothing more than to have sleep overtake her but she couldntbring herself to give up the miracle resting in her arms she going to need a name sirius murmured you think hermione replied quietly sirius chuckled lightly what do you think remus seems to be the king of great names and i know you liked some of his suggestions hermione turned her head slightly to meet sirius eyes i like elizabeth sirius smiled down at her and placed a soft kiss on her lips elizabeth it is o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o an hour later sirius left hermione side while she slept she d earned her rest ten times over and he didntwant to disturb her slumber cradling elizabeth in his arms sirius stepped out of the hospital wing and into the candle lit corridor at three in the morning the night was still and sirius was greeted by an array of sleeping faces the only pair of eyes trained on sirius and his daughter were amber ones matching the flickering candlelight surrounding them sirius wandered over and sat down in the chair next to remus and presented his daughter to his childhood friend remus meet elizabeth sirius murmured quietly so as to not wake the others remus smiled down at the sleeping form nestled comfortably in sirius arms she beautiful padfoot sirius smiled not taking his eyes off his sleeping child i have a daughter moony i a father can you believe it remus placed his arm around sirius shoulders for as much of a brotherly embrace that they could achieve with sirius arms full of course i do sirius there was never a doubt in anyone mind sirius smile didntwaver as he gently stroked the small tuff of black hair on elizabeth delicate crown glancing up sirius looked around at all the sleeping faces maybe we should make the introductions in the morning remus smiled probably a good idea you look like you could use the rest sirius smiled back first things first here he said as he handed elizabeth over to remus sirius i but elizabeth was already resting comfortable in remus arms she stirred slightly before falling back into her slumber sirius i haventheld a baby since harry sirius grinned neither had i i think its like riding a bike once you know what your doing you never forget remus raised an eyebrow i can not believe you just compared holding a baby to riding a bike actually no wait yes i can beside the werewolf tonks stirred slightly remus looked down at her and handed elizabeth back to sirius these lot are going to be a little stiff in the morning sirius whispered as he stood bring tonks in there a spare bed poppy wontmind remus gently lifted the sleeping auror into his arms and followed sirius into the hospital wing leaving harry ginny and draco in the corridor outside hermione parents having already been introduced to their granddaughter being given a bed in the hospital wing close to hermione o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o when she going to wake up potter be quiet sirius who had settled in close to hermione after laying elizabeth down in her crib cracked open his eyes as the morning sun lit up his godson ginny and draco standing over his daughter hermione stirred next to him and sirius swung his gaze to meet her chocolate eyes as she opened them good morning he whispered how are you feeling sore i bet where s sirius grinned and looked over at harry and ginny who still hadntnoticed that the parents of the object of their attention were awake draco on the opposite side of the crib however noticed and sent sirius and hermione a congratulatory smile sirius gently slipped from the bed and walked over the cold stone floor to bring elizabeth over to hermione thinking of the future mate harry jumped as sirius came up behind him ginny again blushing to the roots of her fiery red hair sirius scooped up elizabeth and she moved slightly in his arms grinning he looked up at hermione who was smiling at her husband and daughter propped comfortably up on a pile of pillows stepping back over to the bed sirius handed elizabeth to hermione before settling in beside her harry and ginny moved to sit on each side of the bed draco opting for a chair off to the side meet elizabeth hermione introduced she so small harry murmured would you like to hold her hermione offered sirius grinned at harry horrified expression err it ok i ll just look for now hey sirius murmured she waking up hermione gaze drifted down to her arms again and smiled as elizabeth let out a tiny yawn before opening her eyes sirius did a double take and looked at hermione who grinned as her daughter stared up at their faces hermione stroked the small head of her daughter gently my grandmother had blue eyes o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o oo o o o o disclaimer i along with billions of other people do not own harry potter o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 6 undivided o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o here sirius no harry but i you re going to have to at some stage please just while i grab hermione overnight bag before harry could protest sirius had gently transferred one week old elizabeth into his arms just watch her head she canthold it up herself yet sirius instructed as harry became accustomed to the new weight in his arms once harry was sure elizabeth was secure he sent sirius a glare you know i could have grabbed the bag sirius grinned i ll be right back he said heading into the bedroom to grab hermione overnight bag they were staying at their home for the weekend to get away from the bustle of the castle sirius and harry had been left to bring elizabeth and the rest of the gear as ginny and hermione went on ahead to the house harry wandered over to the mantle and grinned at the framed photo of hermione sirius and elizabeth the morning after she was born engraved on a small gold plaque at the base read elizabeth rosalyn black march 2nd 1999 she beautiful isntshe harry turned to see sirius standing beside him who hermione or elizabeth both you are so smitten sirius grinned and held up his hands guilty as charged come on best get going or mummy will start to worry sirius scooped elizabeth up in his arms and handed harry the overnight bag before placing elizabeth in the recently purchased baby carrier what are you going to do floo harry asked staring at sirius and elizabeth sirius shook his head i can apparate with her we ll walk out to the edge of the grounds sirius did a double take at harry small smile what oh if you re that lazy not to accompany your not so magically abled godfather apparate from here harry grinned nah i could use the fresh air o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the first thing hermione noticed when she arrived at the cottage was a muggle real estate magazine with a few secluded houses circled grinning she looked up at ginny looks like harry planning ahead ginny shot hermione a confused look before glancing down at the magazine on the table and despite small smile spreading across her face she dismissed the prospect of moving in with harry after graduation in a couple of months he hasntasked me yet or talked about it and i highly doubt that mum will let me move out at seventeen hermione shot a sly grin at the redhead you never know ginny couldntstop her smile growing as she gazed down at the magazine hermione picked up sirius bag hoping he remembered her slightly bigger one still sitting in their room at hogwarts i just going to take this upstairs ginny looked up suddenly and hermione missed the look of slight fear cross her face here i ll take it you just put your feet up you deserve the rest hermione shot ginny a curious look i fine i think i can handle the stairs i ll take it anyway before hermione could protest further ginny had grabbed the bad and started up the stairs ok hermione said to herself as she turned back around and headed into the lounge where she found that at least harry kept the place tidy o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o half an hour later hermione was discussing newts with ginny when sirius and harry arrived with elizabeth ahh sirius said stepping in home sweet home no teenagers no school no snape for a whole weekend sirius missed the confused looks the two teenagers in the room sent him as he took elizabeth over to hermione giving his wife a soft kiss as he transferred their daughter into her arms i ll take your stuff upstairs hermione sent sirius a serious look i dontknow honey i think those stairs are dangerous to anyone over the age of twenty sirius frowned and sent hermione a look that clearly said what the harry sent ginny a wink before leading the group upstairs dontjust think i ve been lazing about for the past few months hermione and sirius exchanged a curious look before following harry down the long hall at the top of the stairs next to the master bedroom he opened the door and sirius and hermione stepped in and gasped the walls had been painted in a soft yellow in one corner was a small bed complete with a small white duvet and pale yellow blanket folded at the bottom along the other wall was a white cot with a knitted yellow blanket courtesy of molly and a mobile swinging above it of snitches quaffles and bludgers the carpet was a soft cream and had a small rug in the middle that matched the yellow curtains hanging at the window a box lay at the base of the bed for all the soft toys that had accumulated in the past week a changing table next to the cot and another rocking chair in the corner next to the window i started it a couple of months ago and i didntknow if you were having a boy or a girl so i went with yellow harry said breaking the silence harry hermione started stepping into the room this is wow sirius stared gobsmaked into the room before glancing at harry back into the room and back to harry sirius if you keep doing that you re going to get a kink in your neck hermione said smiling from the middle of the room elizabeth sleeping soundly in her arms sirius grinned and stepped into the room after his wife leaving harry standing at the door with ginny his arm resting lightly on her waist sirius stepped past hermione and walked to the edge of the cot placing both of his hands gently on the edge before twirling the sparkling snitches on the mobile this is amazing harry sirius complemented i cant believe you did all of this harry shrugged i had a lot of spare time on my hands hermione lay elizabeth down gently in her new cot and walked across the room to give harry a warm embrace thank you she whispered softly in his ear you re welcome he whispered back when hermione stepped back sirius gave harry a warm pat on the back before thinking twice and mimicking hermione actions and giving his godson a hug well harry started stepping back and grinning at the pair in front of him if i d known you d be this emotional maybe i would have warned you first i not emotional sirius stared defensively his moist grey eyes stating the opposite sure sure harry returned grinning hermione had wandered over to the widows and gently pulled the curtains closed and after checking elizabeth was settled and the wizard baby monitor was on ushered the others out of the room gently pulling the door half closed behind her o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o later on in the evening as the group settled comfortably in the lounge sirius spotted the real estate magazine sitting open on the small table frowning slightly he reached forward picked it up and settled back down his eyes flicking to harry who hadntnoticed his godfathers actions before he started to flick through it tuning out the conversation around him sirius hermione glanced at the others when sirius didntreply and kept staring in front of him an unreadable expression on his face sirius sirius looked up hmm hermione smiled at him where were you thought we d lost you there for a moment sirius swung his grey eyes to harry who had finally noticed what sirius was holding in his hands sirius held harry green eyes as hermione and ginny exchanged concerned glances a small cry was heard through the baby monitor and sirius broke the eye contact and stood the magazine landing on the table i ll check on her he said quietly more to himself than the others as he left the room umm harry started staring at the empty doorway before glancing sheepishly at hermione i think that was my fault hermione shook her head and sent harry a comforting smile i ll go and talk to him she said standing and walking out of the room i was only looking harry said quietly ginny took his hand in hers and gave it a small squeeze which he returned i thought that maybe he d they would want their own space ginny smiled and nudged harry so he looked up at her maybe sirius just wanted a family o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione knocked softly on the nursery door sirius she said quietly as she entered sirius was sitting on the rocking chair with elizabeth in his lap staring into her blue eyes as she stared back poppy said she ll like eye contact he murmured quietly hermione moved and knelt down next to sirius and elizabeth are you ok she asked softly sirius nodded and sat still for a moment before bringing his spare hand up to his face and ran it from his forehead down to his chin was i wrong to assume that harry would stay here with us he asked turning to meet hermione chocolate eyes hermione shook her head and placed her hand over his maybe harry didntknow that what you wanted sirius expression remained impassive we have enough room here for him and ginny we even have enough room for remus and tonks if they wanted to stay i just dontunderstand why he wouldntwant to stay or did he grow up that fast and i didntnotice maybe you should talk to him hermione suggested a soft knock at the door brought hermione attention away from sirius to harry standing at the door a small cry from sirius lap and hermione was picking up elizabeth i think someone needs a feed she said smiling at her daughter while leaving sirius and harry to talk sirius harry started moving in closer and sitting at the window seat the still drawn curtains casting a soft glow around the room as the evening sun set in the west i didn t i mean umm i was only looking sirius smiled sadly at harry its ok mate if you want your own place i cantstop you harry shook his head i love it here i mean for most of the year i have the place to myself but i just thought that now you and hermione have elizabeth that i dontknow that maybe you d want your space harry just because we have elizabeth doesntmean you re any less wanted any less loved sirius stood from the rocking chair and sat next to harry you re more than welcome to stay here as well as ginny when she graduates harry didntsay anything just nodded sirius put his arm around harry shoulder and pulled him into a hug so you ll stay for now at least harry nodded again yeah ill stay o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a n big bag of cookies or chocolates or whatever you want if you can tell me the significance of march the 2nd but it has nothing to do with the harry potter universe who does elizabeth share her birthday with disclaimer not mine neither harry potter or bon jovi whom elizabeth just happens to share her birthday with o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 7 little bit of soul o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione and sirius chambers were a bustle of activity on the morning of graduation bags and suitcases for the summer where piled at the door sirius was searching for a clean shirt void of any baby badges that elizabeth had added to his clothing hermione was making sure they had everything for the summer while doing her hair checking off items on her mental checklist calming harry down who was fretting about the possibility of having to say something on the anniversary of the final battle heating a bottle for three month old elizabeth in preparation for the long day ahead while tending to elizabeth who felt this was a good time to start to cry from the bedroom where she had been laid down to sleep i ll go harry offered wait that not her i need a change cry is it hermione shook her head she just woke up she probably just wants some company ah ha sirius exclaimed from across the room holding up a relatively clean shirt damn it he swore when he noticed the lipstick stain on the collar courtesy of hermione sirius hermione scolded walking across to him and performing a cleaning charm on the garment in his hands hmm didntthink of that obviously from the bedroom elizabeth cries had stopped and small giggles could be heard through the room hermione and sirius exchanged warm smiles as harry brought elizabeth out in his arms her own two small arms swiping at his glasses as she attempted to grab them but couldntget her small fingers to wrap around the frames come here munchkin sirius said taking a giggling elizabeth from harry arms as hermione checked all the bags had been packed what was all that crying for hmm elizabeth just stared wide eyed at her dad listening to his voice breaking into a toothless grin when he finished you have everyone under your little finger dontyou sirius said as he gently picked up one of elizabeth small hands in his and turned it over pretending to do a thorough search while elizabeth giggled away a knock at the door ceased the small punctuated giggles and elizabeth turned a curious gaze to the door which her small blue eyes could only just make out come in sirius called causing elizabeth to turn back to the sound of his voice sirius smiled down at her earning himself another beaming grin remus entered the room and smiled at the sight harry and hermione were busy shrinking the luggage while sirius had the oh so difficult job of entertaining his daughter hey moony sirius greeted padfoot remus returned hello hermione harry sirius why arentyou helping it ok it all done hermione announced before sirius had a chance to defend himself we better get going dumbledore will begin to wonder where we are hermione paused where tonks she said she ll be here but she might have been caught up at work remus answered as sirius began to put a small pink cardigan on elizabeth who decided to declare war on the knitted pink thing and didntstop swinging her arms around remus stepped up to the end of the table to help catching elizabeth attention with his familiar amber eyes as she stared up at his upside down face hello little dumpling are you making things difficult for your daddy elizabeth stared wide eyed up at remus her arms ceasing their swinging allowing sirius to slip them through the tiny sleeves sirius grinned down at elizabeth who noticed the change and stared back at her father before rolling onto her side sirius hands steadying her so she didntroll off the table hermione came into view and elizabeth broke into another toothless grin and began to swing her arms around again hermione picked up her daughter and smiled at the two men time to go we ll come back for the stuff later o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks waved her wand to neatly pack up the piles of notes on her desk after the loss of kingsley in the final battle tonks had been promoted to his position and was now in charge of a staff of fifteen aurors working cases throughout the community now however she was late for ginny graduation and she rushed to pack up her stuff after a small stumble over her robes that got caught on her chair tonks made her way over to the elevator to take her up to the fireplaces to she could floo to hogwarts tonks had on a pair of relatively nice robes for the graduation and morphed so her hair was a deep auburn colour and fell just past her shoulders stepping into the elevator tonks moved to one of the back corners away from the hushed conversation in the other corner which she couldnthelp hearing snippets of are the aurors doing anything about it tonks ears picked up at this dontthink so i think it too high up at the moment they are looking for something though what dontknow i just know someone who works in the maternity ward at st mungos and said they ve been having officials come in every few days odd i know probably nothing the elevator dinged and the two wizards stepped out leaving a confused tonks behind o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o tonks raced up the steps towards the great hall dusting herself off at the same time her thoughts filled with the overheard conversation her brain clicking into investigative mode as she quietly pulled open the door relieved that the ceremony hadntstarted moving past all the guests she saw sirius hermione harry and remus near the front grinning when she saw elizabeth giggling happily in remus lap stumbling over a pair of in tonks opinion rudely placed feet she sat down in the spare seat next to remus elizabeth halting her giggles to stare curiously up at her with her bright blue eyes remus smiled warmly at her she doesntrecognize you your hair is too long oh tonks morphed her hair to short pink spikes to match elizabeth cardigan elizabeth stared at tonks for a moment before looking back up at remus who smiled down at her to which she mimicked back dumbledore stepped up to the platform and hermione took elizabeth out of remus hands to sit on her own lap facing forward her eyes focussing on the closest thing possible strands of black hair belonging to the owner of the seat in front of her hermione didntnotice anything out of the ordinary of elizabeth swiping hands as she listened to the headmaster speech before moving onto the graduating class honouring both the graduating students and those that would have graduated if they had not lost their lives in the battle the previous year elizabeth fingers curled around a strand of black hair and not knowing what else to do now that she had actually accomplished her goal she yanked snapes resounding ow echoed through the hall as he turned to glare at hermione who was attempting to untangle elizabeth fingers from his greasy locks on either side of her sirius and remus and most likely tonks and harry as well were trying to maintain their laughter as various shushs followed snapes exclamation elizabeth grinned up at snape the pale wizard wasnta stranger and she had yet to experience his temper so for now he was in the list of nice people not having anything to do with her hands now she went to put them in her mouth before sirius almost crying out stopped her it might be ok to pull snape hair but there was no way she was putting her fingers in her mouth afterwards while sirius attempted to amuse elizabeth so that she didntstart to fuss at not being able to put her fingers in her mouth dumbledore slowly made his way through the list of graduates till he reached ginny name near the end ginny weasley sirius looked up as the young redhead accepted her graduation certificate he was swept back to when lily received hers the light in her bright green eyes had been dull that day and her smile didntquite reach them after hermione had been taken the previous morning sirius eyes flickered to his wife and he hoped lily knew her friend had been found his attention was brought back to dumbledore when the last of the students had filed off the stage there will be a memorial ceremony held outside in an hour everyone is welcome the headmaster concluded stepping back off the platform as the audience starting the shuffling of an exit or beeline to their children the group waited in their seats sirius rummaging through their baby bag to find a wipe to clean elizabeth hands while hermione preformed a simple cleaning spell sirius looked up from his search to meet hermione grinning face didntthink of that obviously hermione grin disappeared as a concerned expression graced her features are you ok you re not really with it today i fine sirius answered sending hermione a reassuring smile afraid that i might be loosing it he asked with a grin hermione smiled back but sirius could still see the concern in her eyes i fine honey just my usual self not thinking which is hard to do around two beautiful ladies sirius turned his attention to elizabeth who was finally sucking contently on her fingers her eyes drooping slightly he picked her up and cradled her in his arms her new position causing her to fully close her eyes and almost immediately fall asleep ginny red hair could be seen as she was surrounded by other heads of red her entire remaining family including percy congratulating her harry stood and made his way over sweeping ginny into a hug when he reached her congratulations he whispered thanks ron would have been proud ginny eyes moistened slightly and she nodded smiling at harry and her family as the others joined them molly a little disappointed that elizabeth was asleep was that snape i heard earlier bill asked the group sirius grinned my daughter made me proud today only three months and she already embarrassing snape what did she do molly asked shocked she pulled his hair fred and bill looked at each other and burst out laughing while molly sent them a stern look over to the side remus noticed an unusually quiet metamorphmagus hey he murmured you ok tonks nodded just thinking about something i heard at work not to mention what today the anniversary is of remus shot her a sympathetic smile i should get outside dad said he ll meet me at two remus checked the large clock in the hall which read one thirty would you like me to come with you he asked softly tonks nodded thanks remus squeezed her hand and quietly informed sirius that they were heading outside sirius nodded and said they ll be following shortly o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o the day was bleak matching the general mood of the people gathered the skies were grey and the early summer wind whipped up sending hermione and sirius cloaks up around their legs sirius cloak that hermione had gifted him her first christmas back proudly showed the outlines of a wolf a dog and a stag hermione sheltered a sleeping elizabeth against her no one available to baby sit in the warm castle as everyone was at the memorial dumbledore spoke followed by the head of the auror division after this the new minister made his way to the small stage a tall light haired wizard whom sirius frowned at sirius hadntvoted for him he voted for the other guy harry tried to remain as inconspicuous as possible standing between sirius and remus with ginny wrapped in his arms in front of him dumbledore had thanked him obviously but left the grateful teenager out of the limelight the new minister however was not so lenient as he spoke to the croud most of all we need to thank one young man in particular mister potter i believe you are present why not come up and say a few words harry shrunk slightly attempting to hide behind the shorter redhead in front of him as the crowd began to look around for the boy who lived the new minister no one bar remus or hermione could remember his name gave a slight chuckle come on harry just a few words you did single handedly defeated you know who and yet you seem to not want anything out of it sirius felt harry tense beside him and straighten up before anyone knew what was happening harry was striding through the crowd that parted easily for him and mounted the stage at the front the minister grinned at him but faltered when harry didntreturn it harry muttered a quiet sonorus before turning to the silent crowd harry scanned the crowed until his gaze landed on his friends his expression warmed slightly and he sent them a smile it been a year since the final battle and this is my first official announcement and most likely my last harry met hermione eyes and she nodded encouragingly i would like everyone to know that i did not single handedly defeat voldemort harry ignored the audible gasp rippling through the crowd at the mention of he who must not be named name and continued four hundred and fifty six wizards and witches died in a span of a little over twenty years in the fight against voldemort and his death eaters including my mum my dad and my best friend harry paused to gather his thoughts there are not only the dead to honour but the survivors who fought the survivors who lost loved ones lost family and friends there are also five others who deserve as much thanks as i do the man who was as much of a brother that i could have ever asked for ronald weasley my mentor remus lupin the man i consider a father sirius black my best friend and sister hermione black and the love of my life ginny weasley without them without their presence in my life their unconditional support and love i would not have been able to defeat voldemort by myself before the final battle the six of us experienced a form of magic so natural that it channelled their magic through me what people saw that night was not only my magic but the magic of five others one who cannot be here today so this will be the last public announcement i make it may have been my wand my body but it was not me alone who defeated voldemort therefore i would appreciate it if it was not referred to in the future as a single handed defeat harry muttered the counter curse for the sonorous charm and quietly stepped off the stage a stunned silence surrounding him as he walked back up to ginny who welcomed him into open arms sirius sending his infamous black glare to curious onlookers a slightly confused minister a robert tompkinson hermione had informed sirius retook the stage and stammered through the rest of his planned speech when the speeches were finished the crowd began to dissipate leaving the small group that resided at hogwarts behind come on sirius murmured his arm guiding hermione inside let go home o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o disclaimer not mine o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o chapter 8 blaze of glory o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione lay awake smiling in the early hours of a late august morning as she listened to the nonsensical babblings of her daughter drift through the silence between them beside her sirius lay sleeping off in his own little dream world hermione knew he wouldntbe asleep much longer as he always seemed to know when she was awake sure enough not five minutes later pulled from his dream of james with antlers babbling at him nonsensically in a very childlike voice sirius grey eyes fluttered open to focus on hermione smiling face sirius opened his mouth to say something but hermione gently held a finger to his lips just listen she murmured sure enough when sirius tuned his ears the very dream james sounding babbles reached them she talking sirius said softly albeit not in english but she seems to be enjoying her conversation hermione grinned at him in the dark she sounds like you when you talk in your sleep i donttalk in my sleep how do you know that hermione asked raising an eyebrow and smiling when sirius didntanswer at least i dontsnore i dontsnore hermione could almost feel sirius grin i didntsay you did i just pointed out that i didn t hey hermione murmured she stopped sure enough elizabeth small voice now ceased to reach her parents ears sitting in silence for a moment both sirius and hermione waited to see if she would start again after a moment of silence a small giggle reached the room sirius grinned she was listening to us sure enough as soon as sirius began to talk elizabeth fell quiet again silently hermione slipped out of the bed and pulled on her bathrobe before making her way through the dark to the nursery sirius not wanting to miss out soon followed when a louder giggle erupted as elizabeth saw her mum walk into the room the light of the small child lamp in the corner shaped like a snitch spread a soft glow over hermione and elizabeth as sirius stopped in the doorway to watch hermione long loose curls caught the edge of the light as she bent over the crib to play with elizabeth sirius grinned as hermione reached down into the crib his daughter catching two of hermione fingers in her own and giggling like there was no tomorrow as hermione picked her up standing at the door sirius just stared at his wife and daughter interacting elizabeth toothless grin spread across her face as she tangled her small fingers in one of hermione curls over hermione shoulder elizabeth spotted her dad and started to bounce excitedly in hermione arms smiling sirius wandered over to his family as elizabeth reached out for him winking at hermione sirius scooped his daughter up in his arms hello munchkin what are you doing up so early not responding to sirius elizabeth immediately reached for a lock of his long ebony hair and proceeded to pull it towards her mouth ow sirius winced and you thought she just wanted you hermione said laughing as she made no attempt to rescue sirius from the clutches of elizabeth seeing hermione laughing elizabeth began to grin again bouncing in sirius arms the lock of hair still clutched in her hand pulling with each bounce sirius gently pried elizabeth fingers from his hair and looked into her shiny blue eyes not daddies hair ok sweetie if you dontpull mine i ll let you pull uncle harry and uncle moony s elizabeth stared up at sirius as if she was taking in what he was saying before she reached for another clump of his hair what going on came a sleepy voice from the door what time is it hermione and sirius turned to see harry standing at the door his hair messier than normal and his eyes still half closed in sleep go back to sleep harry it only four hermione said quietly sorry we woke you harry nodded absentmindedly and turned to head back to his and ginny room a few seconds later a string of expletives came down the hall sirius handed elizabeth back to hermione to poke his head out of the door just noticing harry limp into his room after a likely confrontation between the doorway and his little toe elizabeth mouth opened in a large yawn and hermione laid her down on the changing table to change her nappy before putting her back down to sleep when elizabeth was tucked in her parents waited till her blue eyes had closed before heading back to their own bed for a few more hours of sleep before a bungy jumping crazed auror arrived in the morning o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius was nursing a cup of tea while harry nursed an ice pack on his swollen little toe when tonks and remus turned up wotcher sirius wotcher harry tonks greeted her hair bright bubblegum pink where elizabeth sirius waggled a finger at his cousin anyone would believe you had ulterior motives for visiting me she does remus said taking a seat at the table tonks grinned as hermione walked into the room with ginny and a screaming elizabeth tonks face immediately fell as she approached the screaming child oh dear what the matter hermione shook her head i dontknow she not hungry she wontlet me put her down to sleep and ginny just changed her i thought brining her down here might help do you want to take her she might want to play tonks shrugged as sirius and remus exchanged amused looks sure why not hermione transferred the screaming child into the metamorphmagus arms and tonks carried her into the lounge and sat her on the floor with her toys hermione poured herself a cup of tea glad for the small break as the others watched tonks with elizabeth within minutes her wails had subsided to small sobs as tonks talked animatedly to the black haired baby as she played with her toys sirius stared at tonks how d you do that he asked whenever she like that with me she cries for hours she does not hermione argued hitting sirius upside the head it just seems like hours to you tonks had elizabeth sitting upright on the floor as she handed her a rattle with a snitch on the end sirius and harry hermione had decided had far to much influence on the toys her daughter played with elizabeth grabbed the rattle in her small hands her eyes and cheeks puffy and red from her tears as she began to shake it vigorously a small smile spreading across her face has she displayed any magic yet remus asked as he watched tonks play with elizabeth on the floor sirius shook his head not yet he answered warily eyeing the brochures on the table that tonks had brought with her on the floor a while later elizabeth had positioned herself on her stomach and was attempting to wiggle forward towards the table of adults who other than tonks no longer had their attention on her playtime but on the brochures now spread out among the five at the table how about this one sirius asked its remote means we can apparate without any hassles harry took the pamphlet out of sirius hands and laughed no way its only twenty meters that barely a jump sirius face fell slightly and grumbling he picked up another from the pile i think an inter city one might be better anyway hermione suggested it means we can apparate to an apparition point and not have to worry about turning up in the middle of nowhere without a car slowly the brochures were split into two piles ones that were too remote and others that were too high which without tonks at the table was beginning to form the biggest pile picking up another brochure somewhat begrudgingly sirius felt a small tug on his jeans and looked down under the table at a pair of bright blue eyes still rimmed slightly in red tonks still sitting on the floor was also now next to sirius sirius reached down and picked elizabeth up and sat her in his lap as tonks took the last remaining chair at the table her violet eyes immediately falling on the pile of brochures that had been deemed too high you can help daddy sweetheart sirius said facing elizabeth towards the center of the table immediately her hands went for the brightly coloured pieces of card in front of her what are these ones tonks asked those are the sirius is a wimp ones remus answered before elaborating further they re too high tonks face fell and she glared across at sirius fine what else have you got o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o sirius stared up at the bridge the day was beautiful the sky bright blue the sun shining and not even a hint of a breeze was on the air the bridge itself was an arch both sides on low ground as the muggle cars drove up then back down again over here sirius turned to see tonks practically skip up to the small building off to the side her short bright blue hair stood out against the yellow the small shed like building had been painted sirius looked over at the others harry and ginny were standing with remus and began to follow tonks as hermione stood beside him and looked up at the bridge with elizabeth in her arms it doesntseem too bad hermione said a slight hint of nervousness in her voice at least tonks let us pick right right sirius agreed as they made their way up the path inside tonks was talking to the muggle at the desk about every aspect of bungy jumping that she could remus watching on in amusement as the guy supplied all the answers happily so the muggle started looking around at the group who jumping tonks and hermione raised their hands sirius following after a jab in the side from his wife the muggle nodded ok then my name a j i ll run you through what we ll be doing today hermione handed elizabeth off to remus who stood back with harry and ginny as aj explained the next hour or so of events first up you need to be weighed so the guys up in the pod where you ll be jumping from aj explained after noticing the confused faces in front of him it under the bridge just a small pod like structure the guys in the pod will calibrate the cords to your weight for a safe jump after i weigh you you ll be harnessed up and i ll send you up the bridge any questions sirius shook his head along with hermione and tonks right then i ll get you to write your names down here and sign at the bottom it just a contract to state that you are willing to jump which if you change your mind at the top you can no one forces you to do anything hermione began to read through the form please indicate if you have any of the following conditions which may prevent participation pregnancy high blood pressure diabetes epilepsy neurological disorders heart conditions fragile skin bone disorders dislocations acute fear of heights hermione signed her name off at the bottom of the form and glanced over at sirius whose pen was hovering precariously over what looked like neurological disorders hermione poked him in the side sign it sirius glanced across at her and sighed signing the form like he was signing away his life after all three were done they handed them back to aj who glanced down at the forms right first up um nymphradora is it remus was surprised at the accurate pronunciation and grinned as tonks flinched slightly tonks is fine alright tonks if you could just step up on the scales there aj indicated to what looked like a square piece of silver lifted slightly off the floor with no worries whatsoever tonks hopped up on the scales and the small screen digitally read out her weight which aj recorded down great her mi o nee he said attempting to sound out hermione name hermione nodded hermione she replied sounding it out at normal speed so he d know who to pronounce it stepping up on the scales aj recorded her weight and flicked to sirius form well you guys sure like the unique names sirius sirius stepped up on the scales for aj to complete the weights which he typed into a computer to be sent up to the pod ok time to harness you up aj handed hermione a harness and she stepped into the holes for her legs and quickly fastened it around her upper thighs and waist she d done a little abseiling with her dad when she was younger and knew her way around a harness sirius on the other hand was getting some help from harry who d never worn a harness in his life but understood the basics hermione wandered over and helped sirius finish who as soon as the harness was secure began to complain at how uncomfortable it was ten minutes later the three jumpers were standing at the bottom of the bridge as cars zoomed across overhead harry ginny and remus stood off to the side waiting at the bottom with elizabeth to see the others jump clipping safety lines to their harnesses from the bridge with tonks in the lead and sirius at the rear aj instructed the group just to walk up the steel pathway under the bridge then up the stairs at the top and into the pod the jump itself was fifty five meters high but the bridge was long meaning that it wasntoverly steep which meant as sirius pointed out it seemed to take forever to get to the top the whole way up sirius and hermione argued on who was jumping first ignoring tonks who said she d happily be the first to jump when they reached the stairs they climbed into the pod which was exactly that a pod a steel and glass pod split into two half was filled with the jumping gear and two muggles the other empty with a glass bottom for viewing two odd looking chairs sat between the two halves where hermione assumed was where they strapped you in g day one of the muggles greeted my name is mike and this is steve today we ll be throwing you off a bridge sirius paled slightly as mike went through safety procedures right lets get started sirius he called reading from a piece of white paper would you like to take a seat sirius paled further i think tonks wanted to jump first sorry mate we work with weights each group jumps in weight order heaviest to lightest sirius with a stomach full of butterflies sat in the seat and glanced at hermione who stood next to him and patted him on the arm you ll be fine just remember what you ve been through this will be a walk in the park unusually quiet sirius watched at the straps were attached around his ankles a large padded weight sitting next to the rubber bungy cord mike clipped an extra line from sirius ankles to the harness around his waist that had another red strap of cord attached ok sirius once you ve bounced three times reach up and pull this cord it ll release your feet so you ll be hanging upright from your harness rather than us pulling you back up upside down sirius nodded bounce three times pull little red cord you ve got it off we go mike lead sirius who shuffled along his feet joined at the ankles and was lead out on a concrete platform that resembled that of a plank on a pirate ship i want you to step up here and just put your toes over the edge sirius did what he was told as mike dropped the weight over the side so it dangled in front of sirius looking down sirius saw the green blue of the water below fifty meters sure looked high when standing under a bridge attached only by a giant rubber band dontlook down mike instructed see that line over there mike pointed to a line on one of the steel beams of the bridge about five meters out from the ledge sirius nodded keep your eye on that there also a camera just over there give that a little wave and a smile sirius forced a grin onto his face and gave a half of a wave to the muggle camera and wondered if it was one of their still ones or a movie one i going to count down from five and then you just jump ok if you dontjump that alright we ll calm down a little then try again sirius nodded subconsciously glancing down at the water again keep your eyes up mate mike instructed causing sirius grey eyes to dart back up ready five four three two one bungy o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o harry looked around and pulled out his omnioculars and glanced up under the bridge who jumping first ginny asked wishing she d brought a pair of omnioculars herself looks like sirius harry replied zooming in slightly yep looks nervous as hell too remus chuckled and glanced up at the pod before handing elizabeth off to ginny and pulling out his camera they were quite a distance from where the jump was but he would capture what he could nonetheless sighting the bridge through the lens remus waited for his fellow marauder to jump o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o bungy right up until the word bungy sirius had convinced himself his feet wouldntleave the ground but when that word reached his ears sirius felt his body reacting and he jumped the wind rushed past his face and his stomach felt like it was in his feet as the water rushed up to meet him after what seemed like forever sirius hands touched the water and he was pulled back up until gravity took over and he was falling again slightly slower this time and not as close to the waters surface two sirius counted in his head as he felt himself rise again then begin to fall the total range of up and down motion decreasing with each bounce three sirius reached up and yanked on the red cord immediately his feet were free and he felt himself spin rapidly one hundred and eighty degrees where he took the time to breathe again merlin i cannot believe i just did that he thought looking around as he felt himself slow rise back up towards the pod well done steve called down from the edge as sirius was pulled back in sirius just nodded his hands shaking with adrenaline looking over he saw hermione sitting in the chair grinning nervously at him as mike strapped her feet in sirius stood still and waited for steve to take the bungy gear off from around his ankles tonks was itching to come over to talk to sirius but stayed with hermione while she was strapped in once he was free sirius climbed over the barrier between each side of the pod and walked shakily up to hermione who was being told about the little red cord hermione attention was fixed on mike her student psyche kicking in as she listened to the instructions as soon as he was finished she turned to sirius how was it she asked sirius could see her hands shaking and smiled at her its fine come on then mike instructed leading a shuffling hermione over to the edge how is it really tonks asked sirius bloody scary sirius replied muggles are crazy tonks grinned that why i love em sirius rolled his eyes then switched his attention to hermione who had reached the end of the plank hermione hands were shaking and she kept bringing them up to her face an act of nervousness she was unaccustomed to in the background she could here encouraging words from sirius and focused her attention on his voice looking over the edge as sirius had done hermione felt her stomach fall to her feet before she d even jumped it best not to look down look up at that line mike pointed out the line which hermione spotted before her eyes fell down again mike noticed this and pointed at the line again smile and wave at the camera hermione forced a smile and waved before her eyes drifted down to the green blue waters below up at the line hermione mike reminded hermione eyes flickered up then down again mike chuckled that ok some people cantcontrol where they look i going to count down then you jump on bungy if you dontwant to jump that alright you re in control of the whole thing hermione nodded her chocolate eyes still fixed on the waters below five four three two one bungy o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o who next harry asked ginny after she d with the help of elizabeth grabbing harry glasses managed to procure the omnioculars off harry looks like hermione elizabeth started to bounce in harry arms as she spotted a flock of seagulls flying nearby causing remus to bring his camera up and snap a few pictures of his goddaughter with harry she getting ready to jump ginny announced and remus readied his camera again o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o bungy hermione didnthesitate before she leapt off the platform unlike sirius she didntfeel her stomach drop as it had already done so beforehand the cool air flowed past her face as gravity pulled her down to the water her fingers brushed the liquid before she bounced back up from the glass bottomed pod sirius grinned as he saw hermione bounce three times before pulling the cord glancing at tonks sirius noticed she was preoccupied watching hermione and quickly turned to mike to ask a small favour tonks you re up mike called as sirius stepped back a mischevious glint in his eyes tonks practically leapt into the seat strap me in mike mike laughed it ll be my pleasure sirius looked over at steve who was helping hermione over the ledge knowing tonks would be fine he patted her on the shoulder before heading over to hermione alright he asked over the small barrier as steve unfastened the braces around her ankles hermione nodded i am so pumped right now the adrenaline is just sirius grinned so you liked it it was bearable she sent sirius a glare i know you fibbed to me sirius grinned and turned his face into an innocent mask he d perfected at hogwarts that doesntwork with me sirius held out a hand to help hermione climb the barrier and swept her into a big hug can we make a deal he asked what kind of deal let never make a bet like that again hermione chuckled against his chest deal o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o there tonks ginny called still in possession of harry omnioculars a pair of amber eyes and a pair of emerald eyes looked up from a pair of sapphire eyes to the figure with bright blue hair on the edge of the pod o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ready mike asked i was born ready tonks replied a large grin on her face ok then five four three two one bungy tonks bent her knees and leapt off the bridge as far as she could unlike sirius and hermione who because of their inability to breathe on the way down tonks let out a loud cry of ecstasy as she hurtled down to the water unlike sirius and hermione however when her hands reached the water she kept going and felt herself fully submerge taking a mouthful at the same time coughing and spluttering tonks was pulled back up into the air letting out a loud whoop as soon as she got her breath back up in the pod hermione gasped as tonks disappeared under the water sirius beside her burst out laughing and high fived mike across the barrier a dripping wet auror came into view over the edge alright dora sirius asked grinning at the blue haired witch that was bloody brilliant tonks replied grinning sirius and hermione could tell she was itching to get out of the restraints around her ankles once free she leapt over the barrier into sirius arms soaking him in the process thank you sirius chuckled what for for being two of the most stubborn people i have ever met o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o after being given a video and photos of their jumps sirius hermione and tonks walked back down the bridge and after being unclasped by aj at the bottom tonks leapt into remus arms that was awesome she laughed as he spun her around before placing her back on her feet i sure it was remus replied grinning ignoring the fact that he was also now wet and he d never left the safety of the ground alright there padfoot he asked sirius sirius his heart rate back at a manageable rate nodded and harry passed him his daughter hello munchkin he said smiling at her did you have fun looking at the boats birds harry corrected she was looking at the birds sirius turned back to elizabeth were you now wanna show daddy elizabeth just grinned up at sirius come on lets go o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o a little over a week later tonks stifled a yawn as she signed off another completed assignment from her team she d spent most of the previous weekend moving a pile of her stuff from her flat to hogwarts so she could stay with remus throughout the year she was leasing her flat to a fellow auror on her team for the time being so she could decide whether or not she wanted to sell it realistically it was too small for her and remus but that was something she needed to discuss further with the lycan looking up at her assignment basket tonks noticed it was empty oh joy she muttered to herself we are just so swamped is that sarcasm coming from that innocent mouth of yours tonks spun in her chair to see graham a fellow auror in charge of another team based at the other end of the hall my team has no work to do tonks complained we have a few active cases down my end wouldnthurt if you sent someone down to help if you can spare them tonks nodded thanks i ll keep that in mind graham nodded and turned down the hall to the group of cubicles through the door at the far end sighing tonks leaned back in her chair and placed her feet up on her desk smiling at the framed photos that littered it the one of hermione sirius and elizabeth a copy of the one on their own mantelpiece had pride and place next to one taken of herself and remus craning her head back tonks looked through the open door of the office willing a paper plane note to come through with a new assignment she almost upended herself when one did come flying through the door this was different though this note was bright red and carried the ministers seal tonks leapt from her chair being the only team with no assignments tonks was sure this was going to be for her her face fell however when the note carried on down the hall and into grahams office confused tonks sank back into her chair glancing up a few minutes later when a shadow fell over her desk so she said to graham what does the minister want she asked knowing full well he wasntpermitted to tell her graham didntanswer her only reached out and picked up the framed photo of sirius hermione and elizabeth family graham asked tonks frowned and nodded my mums cousin and his wife and daughter she just turned six months graham grinned and placed the frame back down before turning serious you know tonks sometimes it not a good idea to display pictures like this you never know who will look at them confused tonks frowned again as graham headed out of the office leaning forward she picked up the frame and turned it over in her hands on the back was a folded up piece of parchment looking around to make sure no one was watching tonks unfolded the parchment lunch just like old times about time we caught up on current events and family tonks knew graham had left her the note and knew exactly where to go for lunch after having going to the same place with her old auror partner for years when they d first graduated from the academy gently pulling the photo from the frame and slipping it into her pocket tonks grabbed her wand and headed out the door o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hermione and sirius jumps were a combination of my own experience bungy jumping it is an amazing accomplishment and i would reccomend it to anyone
