made with this fanfiction and no copyright infringement is intended chapter ten blood ashes and dreams no no uncle remmy the pleas began as a whimper too quiet to do anything but make harry dreams slightly detached as if they were plagued by static there was the rustle of someone rolling over in their sleeping bag a few more moments of silence and then louder no no leave him alone remus it was now that harry was dredged up from his sleep still not fully aware of why his dream was fading out until the moaning turned into a shout remus no you canttake him give him back remus harry eyes snapped open and he sat up immediately allowing his vision to adjust to the darkness kaykay was curled into a tiny ball tangled up in her sleeping bag and she cried out come back uncle remmy remus please leave him alone you kaykay harry exclaimed crawling over to where she was beginning to thrash about with her arms hugged tightly about her torso he grabbed her by both arms and shook her kaykay wake up her hands shot out and grabbed his right arm so tightly that he had to bite back an exclamation she was clinging to it as if he was simply an anchor to keep her from falling too deep into her own nightmares wake up it just a dream kaykay kaykay her body jerked and her eyes popped open filled with terror and confusion she was breathing hard and her gaze darted about rapidly until she finally seemed to understand at which point her death grip on his arm loosened and her entire body relaxed as she pushed herself into a sitting position harry he was she began in a frightened whisper remus is it there so much blood shhh it was all just a nightmare kaykay he murmured putting his free arm around her and gently stroking her hair you re okay it fine he didntknow which blood she was referring to blood in her dream or all of the bloody wounds they d seen that day things had only gotten worse after the twin boys had been brought in kaykay was recovering from her bad dream quickly if her slowed breathing was any indication she closed her eyes for such a long period that harry almost thought she d fallen back asleep but he was just barely considering helping her lie back down when they opened again she fixed him with a rather odd look that was very much like her normal self he wondered why for the briefest moment then suddenly realized and sprung away pulling his arm back sheepishly er you should probably go back to sleep can t nightmares have some of the dreamless sleep potion he suggested can t victims she said in that same tone speaking of whom i going to go check on them she pushed herself into a standing position and harry followed suit immediately they walked out of the office and down among the cots as medical staff they were the only ones who slept in the medical building as opposed to small tents in the field the full moon was shining bright and silver and kaykay halted by a window to stare at it i hate the moon she whispered so quietly that harry was sure that he wasntmeant to hear why did you have to take him there was cough from among the beds and kaykay left the window to continue checking up on patients she stopped by annisele bed and gazed down at her poor girl she murmured leaning over and smoothing out some wrinkles in the blanket some death eater words seemed to fail her and harry felt sick to his stomach when he thought about it it almost happened to madison and i you remember those two death eaters she looked over her shoulder at harry boys really i bet it was one of them sometimes i still think what would have happened if voldemort had let them thank god that they didn t harry said placing a hand on her shoulder she was shuddering that my greatest fear you know she confided the way she said it made it clear to harry that he was the first person she d ever told this to either that or or madison dying if i lost the last piece of my family kaykay didntfinish the sentence maybe it was because she didntneed to or maybe it was because she d heard just like harry someone stirring a few cots over the moment of reflection was over kaykay seemed to become suddenly aware of harry hand for she shrugged away from his touch he shoved his hands into his pockets and looked towards the source of the sound it the boy who was unconscious harry told her recognizing where it was coming from immediately i ll get him some potion he left her side to assist the young child they hadntbeen able to give him a dreamless sleep potion while he was unconscious it could have made him go into a coma but they d already tended to all of his wounds and used strengthening charms where the potion wouldntsuffice hey how are you feeling harry asked the boy quietly kneeling down by the bed so he wouldntlook so menacing the boy stared up at him and didntrespond i harry i ve come from hogwarts we re here to help here drink this he said offering the boy a cup it will help you sleep the boy took the cup with weak hands and harry helped him raise it to his mouth he drank quickly and harry took back the empty cup and tucked the covers neatly around the boy as he fell asleep serenely brushing his hair out of his eyes harry stood back up and felt a small jolt of surprise when he looked at kaykay she was touching the shoulder he d had his hand on and fixing him with a shrewd and suspicious look that was far from inviting kaykay watched over victims for another twenty minutes before sitting down hard in a chair with her head in her hands harry helped her up and walked her back to her sleeping bag in the office he didntgo back to sleep a few hours later at about five in the morning one of the twin boys again began calling for his mother mommy mommy harry heard immediately and hurried to his bedside where my mommy the little boy dylan according to his chart asked harry sadly she she not here harry said with some difficulty how are you feeling are you hungry dylan nodded emphatically and harry went to a pantry next to the potion cabinet and retrieved a few slices of bread here you should probably start by just eating this if you re still hungry after that maybe you can have something else would you like some water uh huh harry handed him a slice of bread and turned to fill his cup with water from the sink when he looked back he noticed annisele sitting up and observing him unblinkingly slow down dylan eat it slow harry said almost laughing in spite of himself when he saw his voracious appetite you ll make yourself sick otherwise he handed dylan the other slice of bread and the water just let me know if you need anything else alright my name is harry dylan nodded again with wide bambi eyes harry ruffled the child hair almost instinctively then left his bedside and approached annisele being careful to stop several cots away good morning annisele do you mind if i come closer she studied him then looked at dylan i promise i wonthurt you harry continued softly i only want to help you she stared at him once more okay the corner of harry mouth twitched with a miniature smile he hadntbeen expecting such progress with annisele trauma so soon how are you feeling he asked as he sat down on the edge of the cot next to hers he was very attentive to keeping his voice gentle i dontknow a bit hungry i suppose and i just i how can i face up to anyone after after what happened she trembled like a leaf in the fall winds and a tear rolled down her cheek i a h horrible person i i a h horrible horrible p person shhh harry whispered instinctively taking one of her hands and placing his other hand on her shoulder annisele you know that not true she flinched from his touch at first recoiling a bit but her body became less tense as he murmured assurances this is no one fault but his annisele you must always remember that you re pure and innocent and clean the same you that you ve always been he knew the important thing was to keep talking he didntknow how he knew he just did the blood was draining from the hand on her shoulder making it tingle but he left it there just as with kaykay annisele seemed to regard it as an anchor harry wasntsure how he knew this either kaykay had been clinging to his arm but annisele was simply allowing his hand to rest on her however he was certain of it dontallow it to define you annisele it isntwho you are and it isntwho you will be unless you let it annisele wiped a tear from her face thank you she said finally harry let his hands slip away from her would you like something to eat yes p please harry nodded and stood up for the first time he noticed kaykay standing by the door of the office watching them and wiping a tear from her face with the back of her hand and she was smiling halloween was cold and frosty and devoid of its usual celebratory glimmer the only bright side as kaykay was always determined to find one was that the arctic chill that cut through uniforms like steely knives seemed to also quell some of the stench on the breeze so even though the wind free medical tent still retained an odor of death rescue teams carried out their work with a lessened assault of stagnant blood and charred flesh harry and kaykay regularly performed body heat retainer charms on rescuers bringing cargo to the medical tent it was one of the many useful spells kaykay had found in the spell book she d packed and it saved search teams the energy needed for an ordinary warming spell however with the staggering amount of new bodies being brought in the frantic to and fro of healing patient after patient and the pouring of magic into their fellow students was wearing on kaykay and harry come on you re going to lie down for a bit kaykay ordered sternly hauling harry up by his elbow and helping him to the office no no i fine i have to help with nothing doing you ve been at this since we woke up at two this morning you wontdo anyone any good if you push yourself too far but potter i not asking you i telling you kaykay exclaimed unknowingly using the same words he had when she d gotten injured about a month earlier you re always complaining about me being so independent remember how you told me that if i wasntdependent on other people once and a while i d kill myself well it the same thing here you have to trust me to hold my own for an hour or so until you can regain your strength but that my final word potter we re a team okay if you keep working without rest at this pace you ll crash and crash hard it better for all of us you me and all of those people out there if you just rest now now lie down and get some rest harry huffed moodily and flopped down on his sleeping bag shooting her an angry look good boy hey you ll thank me later kaykay said dimming the light and shutting the door with a gentle click she surveyed the ward with a silent sigh now where had they left off oh right harry had been tending to an elderly man who was in for massive cuts and one large stiletto like splinter that had pierced his shoulder when his antique shop exploded kaykay went back to his bedside resisting the urge to take a sip of the strengthening potion that was so temptingly nestled in a flask on her supply belt potions were for the victims no matter how badly she or harry needed them she pulled a chair up to the man bedside once more and carefully began removing small fragments of splinters from his shoulder with a pair of tweezers some things were done best the muggle way about fifteen minutes later having removed all fragments she could kaykay stood stretching slightly to get rid of a cramp in her back she moved her attention to removing the rather large bit of wood from deep in his flesh concentrating strongly she held the protruding shaft with one hand whilst touching the wood with her wand it had been at this point that harry had fallen he d put so much of himself into helping patients that it was only a matter of time before he stretched himself over his limit kaykay heard no noises from the office so she could only assume that he d obeyed however grudgingly and gone to sleep the wood finally slid out after kaykay recommitted her energies to warding away alien matter from the man body several other small splinters came to the surface of his skin as well the sinister fragment was nearly the full length of her forearm and three fingers thick kaykay set it to the side with a shudder and cleansed the man wounds quickly and efficiently she d just barely finished applying a salve to heal torn muscles and bandaging the man shoulder when the tent flap whipped open and a new wave of victims poured in how critical are they kaykay asked sharply washing her hands hastily the child needs immediate attention the woman seems stable for now at least ginny replied thank you have you received a body heat retainer charm yet yes kaykay where harry ginny asked her eyes sweeping the ward he regaining his strength under my orders he was pushing himself too far the work load is so high kaykay trailed off looking around at the cots since the morning many more had been filled still quite a few are ready for relocation to hogwarts tomorrow some maybe even tonight ginny nodded that should help not very much though if what we ve encountered so far is any indication kaykay nodded sadly and continued softly true still i d never wish for there to be less survivors brought in a victim in a cot is far better than a victim in the grave no matter how heavy the workload ginny murmured her agreement and left shortly after with her partner to continue the search kaykay glanced out the window where the haze of a moon glowed in the twilight remus give me strength kaykay murmured moving in to tend to the child as ginny had indicated there was still no sound from the office which suited her let harry rest for just a dream more that suited her just fine where harry annisele asked looking around quickly over the crowd he inside sleeping i think kaykay answered it the second time i ve had to force him to get some rest he pushes himself so far he really helps people you both do it like you chase away the pain or fear and he refills the empty spaces with goodness i i cantreally explain it annisele used excessive hand gestures when she spoke but now her hands dropped to her side i just wanted to tell him thanks before i left she finished quietly kaykay felt sorry for annisele since two mornings ago when she d let harry sit by her bedside and talk to her she d made incredible progress kaykay was beginning to notice the spectacular progress all patients had after talking to him annisele hermione asked gently from behind the girl she turned and nodded you ll need to get in the carriages now it time to go hermione continued putting a checkmark by annisele name on her clipboard annisele looked slightly hesitant so kaykay stepped in annisele this is hermione she and ron they re two of my closest friends will be in charge of things back at hogwarts nice to meet you annisele hermione said shifting her clipboard under her arm and shaking annisele hand annisele nodded a hello then turned and gave kaykay a hug thank you so much one day you ll be truly blessed for your kindness kaykay was startled only for a moment but soon hugged her in return it was good she was quick about it because a moment later annisele exclaimed harry kaykay turned to see harry several yards away just emerging from the medical tent annisele hurried over and to kaykay great surprise held her arms out to him he caught her in a hug a large grin on his face i thought you wouldntshow up kaykay could hear her saying are you kidding i wouldntmiss it harry replied a laugh escaping with his words i uh annisele said stepping back i wanted to thank you for all you ve done for me you really helped me out you know honestly it was my pleasure i so proud of how far you ve come in such a small amount of time okay everybody time to get into the carriages ron called cupping his hands around his mouth so his voice would project farther next stop hogwarts castle that ron harry grinned nodding towards the redhead donthesitate to pull a few pranks on him he my best mate and he comes from a big family of jokesters annisele nodded saluted then finished on a serious note i telling you the same as kaykay you ll be blessed greatly for your good heart someday last call for carriages ron shouted once more annisele hurried away touching kaykay lightly on the shoulder on the way by and climbed into an open carriage as harry walked up to join kaykay a few small children wove around them in their rush to reach a carriage one of the twin boys dylan kaykay thought ran back when he saw them harry harry he yelled happily jumping up as harry caught him in his arms hey dylan the carriages are this way harry laughed carrying him away to a carriage that looked like it still had some room left if she leaned a bit to the left kaykay could see harry tousle dylan hair before shutting the carriage door hard to believe that he was an only child that grew up with a bully of a cousin kaykay commented to hermione who nodded yes one would think that he had a whole clan of younger siblings she said consulting her clipboard a final time to make certain that everyone who was going to hogwarts was in a carriage he really good with little kids m hmmm hermione replied absentmindedly ron is that everyone she called yes according to my sheet he shouted back me too alright let get going bye kaykay good luck hermione hurried with ron to the front carriage and got in as all three carriages set into motion harry stepped back and waved goodbye to dylan and annisele however when he turned back and rejoined kaykay his face was grave i feel so bad for him he still thinks his mum is just away for a while on holiday or something harry said shoving his hands deep into his pockets when kaykay didntreply he looked over at her what you re really good with them you know i not sure you really know how much your involvement helps them she said looking at him with mingled curiosity and admiration well what about you me kaykay asked taken aback yeah you haventyou seen how quickly the wounds you treat heal harry that silly it just depends on the potions and what kind of wound it is i canttalk to the patients like you can harry looked over at her as a gust of icy wind blew his hair into his eyes it not silly and you cantpretend you didntnotice i ve seen how much effort you pour into strenuous healings and i ve seen how quickly patients recover from injuries that you handle the image of helping the old man with the large imbedded splinter flashed before kaykay eyes and she shivered in the wind well perhaps harry kaykay there you are i should have known the pair turned quickly as dumbledore approached them oh the victims no one is there with them kaykay exclaimed feeling ashamed at forgetting about her duties she was about to run back to the tent when dumbledore held up a hand to halt her all of your patients are being well taken care of i want the two of you to take a rest from treating them and apply your energies to something else what else exactly harry asked slowly kaykay could tell what he was thinking and she agreed she didntwant to work somewhere else all those people they needed her and harry dumbledore looked them both in the eyes before beckoning to them follow me this evening i d like for you to resume working on developing your powers it not working kaykay exclaimed dropping harry hands and flopping into a chair with an irritable sigh we just arenttrying hard enough why dontwe do like we did that one time you mean when i went flying across the room and broke a few ribs that didntwork yes it did it just didntwork the way we wanted let try it but keep a sharper control of the magic only releasing a bit until we can handle more of it safely harry suggested kaykay looked hesitant i promise i wontlet you get hurt and if you do i know how to heal it this time he joked kaykay yawned then stood up and stretched her arms high above her head oh fine she said finally shall i initiate it harry asked sensing her apprehension er yeah i think that a good idea she said heading to the center of the room they d been given a wizard tent to practice in that was a single room on the inside about the size of a classroom but without any desks okay now we breathe harry prompted taking kaykay hands and closing his eyes as they settled into a synchronized breathing pattern again he saw his magic as green light he willed it to pull itself thin like a spool of thread before commanding it to travel through his hands to kaykay kaykay magic crept into his vision and it wasntnearly as shaky as it had been the last time they d attempted such a connection his magic leapt forward as if to wind itself around hers but harry restrained it that was what they d done last time and it was as if their powers had become strangled breathing carefully harry imagined tying a knot with two strings while he did so he also tried to keep a grasp of the feeling he had whenever he was talking to one of the victims their powers had connected not winding themselves together but instead knotting themselves delicately the colors in the knot and a bit each way blended to make an aquamarine hue glowing brighter and brighter until becoming a brilliant white kaykay flinched harry could feel her desire to recoil he pulled at her hands forcing her to keep focused and committed to the progress the white light was to the point of being blinding when it became suddenly subdued fading to a warm gold warmth like fire spread through harry hands up his arms and throughout his body soothing away the pain he had from laborious hours of tending to patients the heat was immediately followed by a cold that felt like a refreshing spring washing away the weariness of unyielding hours kaykay was shaking his hands harry harry open your eyes he blinked then gaped at what greeted his eyes whoa he breathed letting go of kaykay hands and looking around appreciatively the dull room had taken on a brilliant light that sparkled of warmth and cleanliness the ceiling shimmered with blue green aqua white and gold sparkles lighting it up like stars this is amazing harry thought to himself you can say that again kaykay said with a laugh that suggested that she didntquite believe her eyes i didntsay anything harry replied turning to look at her he jumped slightly at the emerald glow that graced her outline yes you did you said that it was amazing i didnt say it they both looked at each other incredulously you mean to say that you thought something and i heard you kaykay asked finally her voice was shaky if you heard this is amazing then yes kaykay blinked so does this mean that we ll always know what the other person is thinking harry felt a sudden pang of worry i hope not er here think of something but dontdirect it at me kaykay nodded a long silence ensued harry was about to ask if she was even thinking of something when she asked did you hear anything harry shook his head no now try to let me hear okay testing one two three testing harry is a stupid head hey kaykay laughed sorry you didntsay anything she paused then so does this mean that that we have telepathy i dontknow harry shrugged helplessly for all we know it may be a temporary thing having to due with our power connection it could wear off after a bit speaking of which what were you thinking of while we were doing that anyhow kaykay asked curiously about talking to patients why because i feel i dunno happier now fuller she grinned you were thinking of healing werentyou yes actually how did you know kaykay asked indicating for him to follow her out of the room and back to the medical tent because he replied i feel healthier now than i have for a long time so that means that our skills with different kinds of healing are part of our traits yeah but why are emotional and physical healing separated harry pointed out kaykay grew silent and looked up at the sky i not sure she said finally but if my powers are offensive but on the side of good well that would be more of a physical battle than an emotional one defense can be physical or emotional but since the powers have to split am i making sense she asked looking at him quizzically sort of harry said slowly since battle powers are physical you have a knack for healing physically and defense comes in both physical and emotional forms but since physical is your aptitude i get emotional healing powers exactly you know i think we re starting to get the hang of this harry said gee sherlock what a brilliant deduction kaykay said sarcastically come on i want to get back to the medical tent icy winds grew even more chilling and by mid november kaykay and harry were constantly helping warm search teams even to the point of going out onto the streets in shifts to cast body heat retainer charms their classmates speculated as to how they managed so much with little rest and even asked them as much they d shrugged it off harry saying that he had no idea and kaykay adding the comment that she d once read that adrenaline and necessity could give a person inconceivable strength these were both lies of course well mostly lies kaykay had read the bit about adrenaline but she in no way thought that it was connected to their stamina they frequently lent each other spare powers since kaykay had plenty of health and vitality to share and harry had ample inspiration it made quite a fair arrangement when one was feeling drained the other would tie up whatever the current task was and then they d go to the office and connect their powers again it was as simple as breathing now that they knew they could do it after these connections their telepathy would linger for a bit the length depended on the power issued kaykay found it hard at first to remember to close off her thoughts so professor kingstaff is a good dancer dontworry i sure he d be more than happy to teach you the tango harry commented with an impish grin one afternoon as he breezed by her holding a tray of potion flasks kaykay was careful of how she daydreamed afterwards as if one could concentrate on such a thing and still daydream and besides as she justified to herself to avoid turning red whenever harry smirked at her for the next hour it wasntas if she constantly dreamed of dancing one of their patients had woken up and started babbling in spanish just the day before yes yes that was certainly it looking back on the memory now half a week later kaykay still felt slightly annoyed that harry had listened in watched in on kaykay daydreams still she couldntblame him completely perhaps he couldnthave helped it that was actually an interesting thought could they block themselves from hearing thoughts as well as sharing them another time kaykay thought to herself thank you very much i can mention it later tonight we might actually sleep well kaykay thought to herself thank you very much she moved towards the carriages wiping a few fluffy snowflakes off of her eyelashes that everyone she told hermione who was just finishing off her checklist confirmed she agreed tucking the clipboard under her arm and her pencil behind her ear so as far as we know this is the last of the survivors yes kaykay said feeling a bit sad as she looked out at the destroyed village i cantbelieve we ve finished finding everyone she felt a warmth on her shoulder and she looked at the gloved hand then hermione there were more survivors than you know she told kaykay softly you simply may not realize because they were always coming and going there are many more than you believe still there arentenough of them kaykay replied wistfully hermione patted her shoulder then removed the hand and gave kaykay a hug we ll be bringing some of the fully recovered adults in a few days you d be surprised at how anxious many people are to help rebuild the town she added as she consulted her checklist once more is there anybody you d like to say goodbye to kaykay nodded then set off towards the second carriage ah young kayleigh i had hoped you d come see us off this jovial greeting came from the elderly man who d been pierced with splinters when his antique shop had been destroyed he was one of the survivors that had taken longer to heal i wouldnthave missed it for the world she replied with a smile as she poked her head into the carriage and i wanted to assure you that harry and i will personally rebuild your shop ah harry where is the lad he asked distractedly ummm kaykay leaned back out of the carriage and looked down the line he starting at the other end he ll be here to say goodbye before you leave i promise bless you he said taking kaykay hand in his and patting it like an affectionate but distant grandfather bless you kaykay smiled at him again best of luck we ll see each other again he nodded to her and she stepped away from the carriage the next one down the line was occupied by two children and the spanish woman who appeared to be in her mid twenties goodbye janie goodbye tyler dontworry she added quickly seeing the looks on their faces she opened the carriage door and took one of each child hands you will love hogwarts she said sincerely and there will be plenty of kids your age to run around with plus did you see that guy with the red hair at the children nods she leaned forward as if sharing a very exciting secret he very funny he ll know how to make you feel right at home confident that the children looked more at ease she hugged them both before turning to the spanish woman francisca adi s francisca she said kissing her on the cheek in the familiar custom of the lady home country adi s no kaykay hasta luego ver t otra vez she took kaykay hands in her own and looked straight into her eyes t eres un ngel verdadero dios bendecir t kaykay thought rapidly as francisca spoke pulling together the bit of spanish she already knew the few words she d learned recently from helping francisca and any words that resembled english ones no soy ngel kaykay laughed soy s lo una chica que trata de ayudar t eres un ngel francisca insisted stubbornly y harry es un pr ncipe noble kaykay stopped herself from laughing outright but she only managed by insisting to herself that it would be rude to do so still francisca obviously saw the mirth in kaykay eyes for the corner of her mouth twitched up in a small grin tell him por favor francisca said in broken english i no think he understand espa ol s l no comprende una palabra de espa ol kaykay felt no shame in laughing this time and francisca joined her just then harry poked his head into the carriage buenos d as francisca he said kaykay bit her lip to hide a smirk and francisca looked pointedly out the window at the setting sun buenas noches harry she corrected s s harry said looking both embarrassed and confused er adi s francisca he said holding out a hand he blushed as she laughed and kissed him on the cheek hasta luego harry ver t otra vez she said with a grin oh he said nodding but looking more lost than ever lo explicar todo a harry kaykay reassured francisca hasta luego hasta luego francisca replied with a twinkle in her eye she waved a farewell as harry continued forward in the line and kaykay continued backward the rest of their farewells didnttake nearly as long soon the carriages were rumbling off down the road towards hogwarts okay you can laugh now harry muttered as the carriages went around a bend and out of sight why would i laugh she asked being careful to keep her voice steady she was managing to stay in control quite well until she made the mistake of looking at him and burst into riotous laughter he looked slightly insulted but open to the criticism he was receiving okay what was my first mistake he asked with a sigh of resignation as they turned and headed back to the first aid tent well for starters you said good morning instead of good evening or even good afternoon oh he held open the tent flap for her well where did i go wrong with adi s i know i had that word right well kaykay said slowly as she thought about it you were half right half wrong i made the same mistake at first what do you mean harry asked as he flopped down on a clean cot it a small thing more of a cultural difference than anything else kaykay explained as she grabbed two cups and filled them with cold water from the sink are you ever going to actually come out and tell me what it is harry asked he sounded impatient but the gleam in his eye proved that it was just in jest in many spanish speaking countries kaykay began as she handed harry a cup of water and seated herself on the bed next to him adi s means a lot more than just goodbye it often a bit more of a she searched for the right word permanent statement what do you mean kaykay bit her lip in thought well it like you know how in english farewell and see you later are the same but different harry nodded it like that adi s is used usually when you wontsee the other person ever again or at least for a very long time hasta luego means until later or see you later and it used much more frequently what do you know we re finally off of medical duty and we re on to learning foreign languages harry joked however the look in his eyes as he glanced around the empty room didntescape kaykay notice it feels strange doesntit she said quietly he nodded in agreement and sighed deeply now that we re done working in here our next step will be working out there kaykay finished for him nodding at the entrance to the tent rebuilding i told mr archer that you and i would be the ones to rebuild his shop why am i not surprised harry asked with a knowledgeable smirk still we ve wandered away from the subject we were on oh yes how is it that you can understand francisca so quickly well first of all kaykay began ticking off the reasons on her fingers you must remember that escondito is in california and many students from southern california speak spanish and english secondly francisca had been awake for a while now and i couldntvery well go about helping her without knowing some spanish and third a lot of spanish and english words are similar such as angel and ngel so just like that you can understand everything she says harry asked raising an eyebrow skeptically well not everything you need to look at it in context pick out the important things and then you get the gist of it oh so what did she say to you kaykay settled more comfortably into her seat let see she said i was a true angel and that god would bless me i argued that i wasntan angel just a girl trying to help out but she insisted that i was an angel harry snorted and kaykay swatted him shut up or i wonttell you what she said about you as if she said anything about me harry argued swatting her back indeed she did oh noble prince kaykay laughed causing harry to halt she didntcall me that hmmm you re right she couldnthave been referring to you harry hit her with a pillow and she responded by throwing her cupful of water into his face no fair i unarmed she protested besides do you want to hear the rest or not fine fine what else did she say well she asked me to tell you that she said so and i told her that i would since you cantunderstand a word of spanish he hit her with the pillow again and kaykay jumped up and grabbed a pillow from the next bed over and you should have seen how red your face was when she kissed you kaykay teased hitting him with her own pillow shut up he snapped swinging wildly at her she ducked and his pillow passed harmlessly above her head make me she teased harry dropped his pillow and caught her wrist before she could land another blow hey she protested trying in vain to pull away she glanced up from his hand to look him in the eyes and jumped back startled by his expression she faltered only a moment then swung the pillow with her left hand before twisting her wrist out of his grasp with a handy little self defense move they d learned over the summer oh so is that how we want to play harry asked a glint of challenge in his eye yes potter kaykay said condescendingly that how we want to play harry grinned then lashed out with a sweeping kick kaykay tossed her pillow aside as she jumped to avoid being tripped colloportus kaykay shouted flicking her wand at the tent entrance to bar outsiders from entering she then took harry distraction as an opportunity to trip him from behind you know i d have to say that your one weakness in self defense kaykay commented with a smirk she didnthave long to gloat for it was less than a moment later that they were at it again ishy i cantbelieve i actually putting an author note right in the middle of the story ugh but i figured that those of you who dont do spanish might want to get a translated version the words in bold were previously spanish confident that the children looked more at ease she hugged them both before turning to the spanish woman francisca farewell francisca she said kissing her on the cheek in the familiar custom of the lady home country farewell no kaykay until later i will see you again she took kaykay hands in her own and looked straight into her eyes you are a true angel god will bless you kaykay thought rapidly as francisca spoke pulling together the bit of spanish she already knew the few words she d learned recently from helping francisca and any words that resembled english ones i no angel kaykay laughed i am only a girl trying to help you are an angel francisca insisted stubbornly and harry is a noble prince kaykay stopped herself from laughing outright but she only managed by insisting to herself that it would be rude to do so still francisca obviously saw the mirth in kaykay eyes for the corner of her mouth twitched up in a small grin tell him por favor francisca said in broken english i no think he understand espa ol yes he doesntunderstand a word of spanish kaykay felt no shame in laughing this time and francisca joined her just then harry poked his head into the carriage good morning francisca he said kaykay bit her lip to hide a smirk and francisca looked pointedly out the window at the setting sun good evening harry she corrected yes yes harry said looking both embarrassed and confused er farewell francisca he said holding out a hand he blushed as she laughed and kissed him on the cheek until later harry i will see you again she said with a grin oh he said nodding but looking more lost than ever i ll explain everything to harry kaykay reassured francisca until later until later francisca replied with a twinkle in her eye she waved a farewell as harry continued forward in the line and kaykay continued backward kaykay glanced around the dark room desperately all too aware of the hopelessness of the situation her wrists ached from their shackles and the stone wall against her back was cold and damp how shall me honor our little guest a cold voice asked casually addressing the question to the ranks of robed death eaters kaykay tugged fruitlessly at her chains as chilling and inhumane suggestions were offered she tried to block the words and concentrate only on escaping however she d gotten lucky before what were the chances of that luck remaining with her now no one could keep luck all the time and her time sounded like it was almost up alone but for murderers crucio a voice shouted effectively cutting through her concentration the wand responsible had been wielded by a death eater that kaykay didntknow now it was another turn then another s then another s crucio crucio crucio in waves they came leaving kaykay disoriented and making their own images blurry in her eyes enough the onslaught ceased and a single image was left in her immediate sight perhaps you are willing to reconsider voldemort suggested silkily she spat at his face and he lashed out and gripped her chin hard making a pain more horrific than any cruciatus curse tear through her body and center on a single point of her forehead kaykay jerked her face away from the spider like hand and kicked out with her feet you ve had your chance mudblood my patience with you is finished avada kedavra the green light lashed out nooo kaykay screamed and sat bolt upright in her bed quite suddenly very wide awake hers was not the only voice that had yelled at that moment h harry she ventured after taking several deep breaths yeah he sounded winded too did you did you just have a nightmare too there was a long silence then he finally admitted yes kaykay eyes were adjusting to the dim light of pre dawn and she could see that right across the aisle from her harry was sitting up stiffly in a very similar fashion voldemort she asked as he wasntvolunteering information yes he confirmed again she nodded and sighed quietly closing her eyes and leaning her head against the wall as her racing heart still tried to settle the quiet was unbroken for nearly a minute before kaykay thoughts reminded her of another detail of the nightmare she d forgotten and you were if she d startled him he didntshow any signs of it sunrise was approaching fast and the room was gradually getting lighter his silence stretched even longer this time than his first answer but finally he said no it was you he d surprised her and she didntmanage to hide it it was rather fortunate that at that moment madison entered to wake them to start their third day of reconstruction without saying a word they stumbled out of bed and to their respective bathrooms to get dressed and prepared for the day they d made a good start on mr archer antique shop the frame was up already with the assistance of their wands and a magical blue print that warned them if they were about to do something wrong kaykay and harry quickly gave each other a power boost before grabbing energy bars performing body heat retainer charms on themselves and stepping out into the icy november air it looking great you guys madison commented as she looked up at the nearly finished structure harry glanced over his shoulder at kaykay and madison as he held up another board against the framework of the home they were working on aw what can i say kaykay said in a would be modest voice she flicked her wand in harry direction making nails shoot over and wedge themselves deeply in the wood at all proper anchor points madison smirked at kaykay while harry let out an exclamation of annoyance at her carelessness i certain the effort is grueling well it is quite a strain on the wrist you know kaykay sighed theatrically i sure madison deadpanned well i ll see you later i need to go meet the villagers and assign them to jobs she waved and left as harry came stomping over would you mind being a bit more careful of how you nail those boards to the wall he demanded peevishly oh dontbe such a baby kaykay said brushing him off as she bent to grab the next board he thrust his palm in her face like i can see anything when you re that close she said grabbing his wrist and moving his hand to a more observable distance oh there was a perfect spot of blood on the skin between his thumb and index finger a spot that was repeated on the back of his hand a drop of blood was oozing slowly towards his wrist oh give it here kaykay said pinching the wound between two of her fingers and pouring some magic into it just like threading a needle there all better she said thrusting his hand back at him with a roll of her eyes and a slight chuckle child play honestly well i d appreciate it if it didnthappen again easily healed or not it still careless his voice was laced with a growl that kaykay dismissed quickly i can handle it really but someday you might find a wound too tough to handle can we please just focus on the house now we ve been making a ton of progress in the past week let not stop yet harry said nothing in reply but simply grabbed another board and nailed it into place with his own wand let see we donthave much left according to this model kaykay said observing the magical three dimensional blueprint they d made of the building simple stairs simple rooms nothing a few more hours canttake care of by now harry was on a third board energy bar kaykay offered pulling hers out of her supply belt and holding it out to him as he finished the board harry bent down got a fourth board and climbed a few steps on the ladder to nail it to the frame oh seriously potter now you arenteven talking to me kaykay demanded crossing to the ladder harry finally acknowledged her but not in a positive way no stop he exclaimed as she ducked underneath the tall ladder to get closer to the house it bad he never finished because kaykay straightened too soon and made the ladder tip with a clatter that sent both of them sprawling at least harry was only two steps up ah that going to hurt in the morning kaykay winced rubbing her head as stars danced before her eyes i told you harry groaned sitting up and dusting snow out of his black hair snow had first started falling on november 12th and hadntvanished for the 15 days since now and then they got some snowfall but all of the teenagers from hogwarts kept working diligently oh seriously potter ladders arentbad luck you just bring out the worst in them that all kaykay replied blinking rapidly here she tossed the energy bar at him now eat it unless of course i have to walk under a few more ladders first no that alright he said tearing open the wrapper kaykay repositioned the ladder and a grabbed a board to work on while harry ate she d just finished putting it up and was coming back down when the tip of a wand was pressed to her back what dontmove kaykay froze allowing harry to perform the incantation for yet another body heat retainer charm your breath was starting to cloud he told her once he d finished and she d gotten off the ladder to get another board he climbed up to the third rung taking the board kaykay handed up to him kaykay checked quickly and was relieved to see that his breath still wasntcoming out in white puffs while such was normal in cold weather it was a sign that the body heat retainer charm was wearing off ginny stopped by not long after with a second ladder for them to use and kaykay refreshed her charm before thanking her and sending her on her way with two ladders the work went much faster they were both able to work at the same time levitating the boards to themselves instead of climbing down in between each nailing the outside of the home was finished just as large flakes of fluffy snow began to fall kaykay blinked against them as she finished laying the last row of shingles be careful coming down the ladders are getting slippery harry cautioned as she walked back to the edge of the roof she was well she at least was more careful than usual and she lost her footing only once on the way down kaykay and harry looked proudly at the finished home sure the inside was still bare but that wasnttheir task to fulfill everyone of the rescue team contributed to the houses in some way kaykay harry come on back to the main tent this snow is getting worse madison shouted over a wind that had begun to noisily announce its presence it was true the flakes were whipping now and falling thicker together the three made the journey back to camp lookin out the window i can see the sun is shining softly through the trees i think about the world it seems so very beautiful to me i think about the air that we all breathe what does the future hold i close my eyes and wish that i could see things differently maybe there still time to change together we can do it together we can try together we can learn to make a difference in our lives cause if the world is dyin it up to you and i together we can do it if we try sometimes when i watching the tv i see a hungry child look out at me i think about the world and i know that when i fast asleep all the homeless people are on the streets what does the future hold i close my eyes and wish that i could see things differently maybe there still time to change together we can do it together we can try together we can learn to give to someone else life why should there be hunger it up to you and i together we can do it if we try the pictures in the paper show the world can not be free hear the children voices they are calling out the pleas i wonder if we will ever be united in love and harmony together we can do it we ll help to save out world together we call out for peace every boy and girl we ll stop the trees from fallin and let the eagle fly together we can do it if we try okay one quick note about the spanish hopefully that wasnttoo annoying the way i put the translation right in there but i thought it was only fair to those people which are probably the majority that are in the same boat as harry i spent longer on that post than any other this whole chapter i wrote what spanish i could on my own then kept translating the rest back and forth from english to spanish and kept adjusting until it made sense in both languages unlike some people who plug it into the translator and slap it into the story foreign language dialogue can really come back to bite you in the butt sometimes you ll also note that i didntuse spanish punctuation and i did so since this is an english story if i were writing it in spanish it would have been punctuated in spanish even if there was english dialogue okay last night i spent at least 45 minutes answering reviews and then it all got deleted sighs so here we go again siriusfanatic you know i ve developed a theory i not the crazy one it the voices inside my head that have the problems not me and i ll add that i have every right to joke about this issue because i know where to draw the

fanfiction and no copyright infringement is intended chapter eleven to be continued i so excited i cantbelieve the villagers are all coming home today kaykay said happily stepping into a freshly laundered sky blue uniform and zipping it up over her clean jeans and tee shirt i know isntit crazy when you think of the fact that we ve been here for nearly two months harry agreed adjusting the armband that marked him as a member of the relief team it was true they d begun working on october 30 and it was already december 19 kaykay nodded fastening her supply belt around her waist for what was hopefully the last time with completely clean clothing and the promise of happy faces that evening the day seemed far more bearable than any day had for a long long time even days before the relief project had started well either way that wontbe until tonight we have work to do before then like adding the finishing touches to mr archer shop kaykay said securing her hair in a ponytail and grabbing a tool kit from one of the many empty bedside tables harry laughed you d never let us forget that would you kaykay grinned but her reply was evasive of the question quick let get down there before somebody else tries to finish the sign harry rolled his eyes but looked amused all the same alright alright let go kaykay danced lightly out the door and skirted around a rather large snowdrift as she glanced up at the sky it was nice and clear which meant that it was cold but that they didntneed to worry about another blizzard they d certainly had plenty lately so harry said catching up to her with his own tool kit in tow you re going to finish the sign and i going to mount the posts by the front door that the sign will hang from kaykay finished for him not once breaking her stride sounds good how much do you have left a bit more shaping on the edges then i need to finish up the small details of the letters oh i cantwait for him to see it you dontsay harry muttered not quietly enough to evade kaykay hearing she promptly punched him in the shoulder hey what was that for he demanded rubbing his arm for being your impeccably annoying self harry dear she replied sticking her tongue out at him he responded by packing a snowball quickly and throwing it at her potter she gasped in indignation he laughed and took off running down the street as she scooped up some snow but he wasntfast enough to escape her pitch it caught him in the back and made him trip and fall scattering the tools from his box kaykay walked towards him at a leisurely pace smirking down at him once she reached the place where he sat he scowled i know i know he sighed as she opened her mouth to speak constant vigilance they said at the same time kaykay chuckled and a few moments later harry joined in her laughter together they gathered the fallen tools and continued to mr archer new shop nice day isntit kaykay doesntlook like we ll be getting a blizzard today does it guys big day today comments came flying to harry and kaykay as their fellow students passed by on their way to do this or that the pair would glance up briefly from their work offer an appropriate response and then continue with their tasks kaykay had just finished carving out the area behind the letters that marked the store as archer antiques and was starting on finishing the edges of the sign when harry got off of his stepladder done he announced looking up proudly at the rod from which the sign would hang how the sign coming along kaykay growled in frustration at her wand which she was gripping between both hands like a staff and using to carve away the edges i cantget it to cut smooth she said not bothering to hide her annoyance the blade keeps digging to far into the wood and it gets caught the blade she referred to was magical and invisible it was simply a means of her moving her wand and the blade following the motion harry watched for a few moments then crossed behind the stack of wood she was using as a seat here try it like this he suggested guiding her hands immediately kaykay blade was being pressed against the wood much more lightly and it was taking far less of the wood on each pass kaykay furrowed her eyebrow trying to concentrate exactly on how to do it tap brush lift no that wasntright that took out blocks of wood see nice and gentle imagine that it a soft breeze rippling over a lake he said softly his whisper tickling her ear how very poetic she deadpanned however his low volume took the edge off of her sarcasm kaykay arms were just beginning to adjust to the rhythm of the work when an elderly voice behind them commented my my my this looks cozy the movement stopped and kaykay became suddenly aware of harry warmth and bulk against her and his arms the surrounded her down to where his hands covered hers as immediately as if she was on fire kaykay sprang away almost falling over in her haste mr archer you re just in time we were just finishing up your sign kaykay said hastily to the old man throwing a glance at harry as she did so he seemed unperturbed and was brushing imaginary sawdust off of his jumpsuit as if sensing her gaze he looked at her levelly then arched a single eyebrow as if to ask why she was acting bizarre what he didntknow or at least what kaykay thought he didntknow was that she saw the grin that was tucked inside the corner of his mouth when she looked again at mr archer would you do the honors of hanging it up sir she asked the old man eyes roamed across the front of the building slowly a world of memories expressed in each tiny detail they took in finally he looked back down at kaykay and harry what would be an honor he replied with joyful smile would be if two very extraordinary young people with hearts of gold were to hang it up for me the night passed happily for everyone student and villager alike every volunteer was moved by the looks on everyone faces to harry it made all of the hard long hours worth it there wasnta single person who wasntin high spirits hermione and ron came over from hogwarts along with all of the victims and students interacted with all of the members of the community some helped children build snowmen others talked with adults or joked with people close to their age amidst the celebration francisca appeared and tapped harry on the shoulder yo dijo que ver a t otra vez she exclaimed smiling brightly harry must have looked utterly confused because she laughed a friendly musical sound i say we meet again and i was right she clarified she d obviously noticed that kaykay was nowhere nearby to translate actually harry hadntseen kaykay all night which relieved him the moment she d realized that he was touching her was an awkward one even if he d pretended it wasn t he d noticed how uncomfortable she d looked when she was no longer paying attention to her work and became aware of him that wasntwhat made it awkward to see her however what made it awkward was that it hadntmade him uncomfortable buenas noches francisca harry said carefully remembering his previous mistake buenas noches muy bueno harry francisca said looking genuinely happy she paused almost as if trying to decide whether or not to repeat her words in english but harry spoke up before she could gracias hablo un poco de espa ol ahora just a bit though he added in english laughing along with her as her giggles subsided francisca asked d nde est kaykay harry shrugged hopelessly his meager grasp of spanish didntexpand to whatever francisca had just asked where kaykay i dontknow no s ah gracias harry she said looking around distractedly hasta luego she turned then and headed down the street hasta luego he called after her harry glanced around wondering where to go next when dumbledore voice magically amplified called over the noise students students to the meeting square please harry joined the people walking down the street towards dumbledore villagers were gathering to hear the headmaster announcement as well oy harry someone shouted harry scanned the crowd for the source of the voice then saw ron waving at him grinning harry wove through the crowd to join his red haired friend hey what do you think dumbledore has to say ron asked i dunno harry said looking over the crowd at the doorstep of the three broomsticks where dumbledore was positioned some sort of speech dumbledore a speech never ron chuckled sarcastically so what have you ron stopped his question immediately as dumbledore began to speak over the crowd and conversation died out greetings witches wizards and students he said jovially i wish to take this opportunity to welcome all villagers back to hogsmeade he paused gracefully as applause broke out punctuated by cheers from some of the students and i also wish to thank all students that worked to help this town and the people in it the noise that rose now from the villagers was much louder than the acclaim that had greeted dumbledore previous comment students all around the square were having their hands shaken or shoulders patted as men smiled and women cried a small girl dashed over to ron hugged him about the knees then hurried back and hid her face shyly in her mother skirts as the hubbub died down dumbledore continued in these times more than ever before we need to show the kind of love and sacrifice for friends and strangers alike that these fine young people showed here sacrifice that very little of our world shall recognize them for you see fear shall not repel voldemort nor will fame nor fortune donated to a cause it is only incontestable sacrifice and love that will drive him back a love demonstrated by these young people who spent hard hours days weeks and months to fight the evil of voldemort they did so for the greatest prize peoples lives everyone was silent even the young children who seemed to be able to tell that this was a solemn moment dumbledore surveyed the crowd a moment in the stillness a fire may destroy the wood but in its wake new flowers grow harry paused and turned this over in his mind for a few moments leave it to dumbledore to say something both the same and totally different every time he talked the headmaster stepped away from the doorway of the three broomsticks and madame rosmerta took his place on behalf of all of hogsmeade i d like to thank all the volunteers from hogwarts who helped us by rebuilding our homes and lives it my pleasure to announce that the adult members of the village along with dumbledore have decided to give you a bit of respite after all you ve done for us harry and ron looked at each other curiously then back at madame rosmerta so we have arranged for all of you to spend christmas eve in diagon alley followed by a yule ball at starlight arbor everyone would then spend the night at the leaky cauldron whispers broke out among the students diagon alley why diagon alley ron asked probably because we dontgo there as a school and we cantvery well spend a day here can we none of the stores have anything yet harry replied but why isntthe ball at hogwarts think about it ron a new voice piped up suddenly only a couple dozen students were involved in this imagine trying to keep other students away from the dance and trying to rearrange their meals and trying to decorate the great hall for such a small affair kaykay propped her arm on ron shoulder and leaned against it leisurely actually i think it exciting that it ll be someplace besides hogwarts and i ve only been to diagon alley once poor deprived child madison deadpanned hermione simply rolled her eyes and what have you three been up to ron asked cocking an eyebrow up to why ronald you say that as if you doubt the veracity of our innocence kaykay said batting her eyes sweetly harry snorted and what isntto doubt hermione may be head girl but the two of you cant be a good influence on her harold james potter i am insulted are you insinuating that kaykay and myself are not faultless madison gasped putting a hand to her chest gee why ever would i think that harry replied sarcastically and dontcall me harold whatever you say harrison madison said with a smirk kaykay burst out in laughter doubling over and clutching her stomach hermione merely sighed and rolled her eyes again let s kaykay gasped between bouts of giggles let s go to the three more laughter three broomsticks m madam madame rosmerta is giving free butterbeer to everyone hermione finished for her with a slight grin yeah that kaykay said breathlessly starting recover come on harrison madison said impishly kaykay began laughing again hermione sighed impatiently and stood up crossing to look out the window for the umpteenth time before straightening an already perfect stack of book s and flopping down again she rose again immediately and re perfected the books then sat down in a chair crossing and uncrossing her legs and sighing intermittently bored hermione harry asked the corner of him mouth quirking up in a grin there nothing to do she burst out as if she d been waiting for him or ron to ask this question all along get a book ron suggested sleepily opening one eye to observe her from where he was sprawled in an armchair the library is closed read one of your own harry said i ve read all of them at least five times each even the ones you got just three days ago ron asked both of his eyes popping open in surprise yes even the ones i got just three days ago she fidgeted a bit more then stood up yet again she pushed the window open wide and leaned out breathing deeply of the cool air we have no christmas shopping to do kaykay has already gone off to send in the paperwork for the mail order gifts we re sending people there are no rambunctious children to keep track of no people to take care of no lessons to catch up on no homework to do i ll still never understand why you complain about not having homework ron interrupted ron it not that she sighed turning away from the window i just wish that something interesting would happen as if anticipating her very words an owl came barreling through the open window nearly knocking hermione over as it tumbled head over talons in an attempt to break its momentum it knocked over the perfected pile of books and shuffled around on the table for a few moments looking disoriented hermione set a hand on her chest breathing deeply to recover from her shock what on oh no ron groaned looking at the owl harry had a pretty good idea of why ron seemed dismayed the owl might have had white or brown feathers originally but now it was colored with a conjugation of feathers none of them natural fuschia neon orange bright green violent purple and vivid blue if its coloring left any room for debate the band around its leg that had an emblem bearing www clearly marked it as a delivery owl for weasley wizard wheezes i almost afraid to open it ron said glancing at harry then at the owl fred and george have an uncanny ability to test their products on me even if i not around hermione sighed yet again and lowered herself into a chair i sure that if it is something bad you not opening it wontstop fred and george harry laughed that right it ll probably only make it worse heaven knows they ve received enough howlers to get a good idea of how they work ron paled at the thought and hastily took the package from the owl it ruffled its feathers pompously and harry would have sworn that it stuck its tongue out at them too before wheeling out the window well here it goes pink hair soap bubble hiccups flower sprouting ears who knows what else it could be harry i leave all of my quidditch stuff for you hermione eh you can have all of my schoolbooks just open it and stop being dramatic she said right er yeah still holding the package as if it was a grenade he untied the twine that held it closed he jumped about three inches off his seat when fred voice sounded from the box allo ron didntthink we d forget our baby brother for christmas now did you george chimed in good thing you opened this early of course that why we sent it to you wanted you to get as much use from it as you could merlin knows you need all the help you can get fred muttered so here our gift to you good luck their voices faded and harry ron and hermione could finally get a good look at the box which had been glowing as fred and george had spoken it was made of wood and decorated with holly around the edges it looked harmless enough good luck what that supposed to mean ron wondered aloud harry shrugged and ron slowly opened the box holding it far away from his body as if he was still terrified of it therefore hermione got the first glimpse of what was in the box and it was her confused voice that questioned the contents mistletoe ron eyes went wide and he tried to slam the lid shut but the sprig of mistletoe popped out of the box with a triumphant giggle and lodged itself to the ceiling right above the couch where harry was sitting if anyone sits by me they re dead harry said quickly looking specifically at ron who d gone quite white that not a very nice attitude harry fred voice suddenly chimed in from the vicinity of the mistletoe all the help you can get hermione asked raising an eyebrow despite her cheeks turning slightly rosy ron went if possible paler but was saved from any reply because at that moment the portrait hole opened ad closed you would not believe how long it takes to do anything when peeves is lurking around every corner and you re the only student in the corridors i dontthink anyone stayed around besides the hogsmeade volunteers kaykay said shaking wet hair out of her face her christmassy mood was surprisingly not dampened by peeves antics at least i got all of our mail orders sent out she continued not leaving any room for interruption in her chatter and i always promised myself i wouldntbe the type to shop from catalogs she snorted depositing a stack of magazines and her bookbag on the couch next to harry so she said finally looking up from wringing her wet hair out and seeing their gaping faces what up ron harry and hermione stared back at kaykay with wide eyes saying nothing uh guys is something wrong kaykay asked putting her hands on her hips and surveying them with exasperation the three of them stared at her for a moment looked simultaneously at the ceiling above her head then back at her hermione and ron eyes flicked towards harry for a moment with a sense of foreboding kaykay slowly tore her gaze away from them and looked up she yelped when she saw mistletoe on the ceiling right between herself and harry and she tried and failed to step away the magical prank mistletoe held her fast what bloody idiot put up prank mistletoe she growled trying to pull away again harry looked surprisingly calm and resigned ron hermione said blandly hey it wasntme it fred and george fault they sent the package and you opened it ergo say what ron interrupted kaykay chimed in ergo an adverb latin literally meaning therefore ron looked between the two girls then cried in mock terror the madness is spreading yeah no thanks to you kaykay muttered jabbing a thumb towards the ceiling hermione isntthere some way to break the charm now kaykay be sport eh a voice said from above her she yelped and ducked covering her head with her arms a second voice almost identical chuckled be afraid be very afraid cantblame her though look who she stuck with hey harry said sounding quite insulted kaykay who finally recognized the voices returned to a normal upright position they have a point there harry fred laughed it doesntmatter whether you want to or not although everyone knows that our bachelor here does want to george added you wontbe able to move until you follow the rules harry pushed himself to his feet and kaykay covered her eyes and began shaking her head no no no no no no no yes yes yes yes yes yes yes fred and george voices replied kaykay sighed in exasperation and put a hand to her forehead harry went down on one knee and took one of her hands fair maiden and comrade forgiveth me for doing as these audacious jesters command he said in a gallant voice bending over in a bow and brushing his lips across her knuckles good sir do not let it happen again or mayhap thou shalt find thyself at the mercy of my wrath kaykay replied rolling her eyes i believe it he said quietly now now harry george said that will never do said fred this is no time to be a gentleman and you wontget away with something as small as that kaykay moaned and harry shook his head laughing softly he turned his face up towards hers then got to his feet slowly come on fred said impatiently harry smiled slightly then placed his hands on kaykay shoulders and bent down slightly so his mouth would meet hers the moment their lips touched his right hand moved to her chin to tilt it up but she used one hand to shove it away and the other to push him away that more than enough she said fred george if you dont mind but we do mind very very much tough she snapped looking up at the mistletoe where the voices were coming from you know how this works fine fine fred sighed dontget your knickers in a bunch sorry mate we tried george added to harry the mistletoe moved to another corner of the common room with a pop and kaykay walked towards the staircase to the girl dormitory feeling that she couldntmove quickly enough she was almost there when she realized she forgot her bag but the smile she saw on harry face when she turned back to grab it was enough for her to abandon all thoughts of it and flee as soon as she was in her dormitory kaykay flopped onto her bed and began hitting herself repeatedly with a pillow as if it would vicariously pound some sense into harry through their power connection just what did he think he was doing friends couldntkiss friends they way he d just tried to it just wasntnatural there was the click of the dormitory door opening and closing again and hermione sat down on her own bed well that was certainly an unpleasant moment kaykay said pausing her pillow bashing mistletoe and friends do not mix unpleasant for you maybe hermione replied what that supposed to mean kaykay demanded sitting up oh settle down i know as well as you do that you regard harry as nothing more than a friend however he may beg to differ what exactly are you trying to say kaykay asked fearing that she already knew the answer hermione sighed i saying that i ve noticed and this isntthe first time i realized it and i not the only person who sees it that he still likes you and he the only one who doesntknow it aurgh kaykay growled throwing her pillow at the door that dolt why cantmy life ever be normal hermione left her bed and sat down by kaykay if it helps any i dontthink that it ever was in the first place so is that what you d call an awkward moment ron asked with a smirk as soon as kaykay was out of earshot no that what you d call a negative reaction hermione replied grabbing kaykay things and following in her wake fraid hermione right mate george said yeah not much you can do with a reaction like that except trap her again ron your brothers are mad harry muttered flopping back down on the couch the grin on your face begs to differ ron commented wryly oh sure everyone gang up on harry eh harry said trying to establish a straight face and what smile the one you are finding oh so much difficulty hiding ron said lazily propping his feet on the coffee table i mean let face it it was bound to happen sooner or later what was bound to happen come on harry everyone knows you fancy her fred said even sirius george added we ve all simply been waiting for you to realize it harry glared up at the ceiling in the corner where the mistletoe was hanging we re friends yeah friends with perks george muttered no just friends end of story harry snapped beginning of story fred corrected shut it she doesntthink about me like that and you know it harry exclaimed tossing a throw pillow in the mistletoes general direction ron snorted oh you think all of this is funny harry asked his friend peevishly actually yes he began laughing again it funny because it true and i quote my dear friend harry she doesntthink about me like that hmmm funny and in the summer it seemed to go both ways my my my george said of course that was merely a slip of the tongue right harry fred said seriously harry crossed his arms over his chest as all three weasley brothers laughed what are you boys doing now hermione asked suddenly appearing from the doorway to the girl dormitory trying to knock some sense into our good friend here fred said and trying to get ickle harry to realize what everyone else already knows said george good hermione said crisply crossing to the pile of messy books and straightening them once more all i can say is that it about time really harry sometimes the tension you radiate when you re around her is thick enough to cut with a chainsaw that i radiate harry asked arching an eyebrow well naturally she doesntfeel the same way now does she way to be encouraging hermione ron deadpanned hermione opened her mouth to reply when george cut in oh nonsense we guys like a challenge that why percy is such a prat dontyou know makes it difficult for him to attract the ladies he snorted george and i took a shortcut seems that some people do like class clowns so we simply became the best of the best not that we needed much work they said together so harry what are you going to do hermione asked do about what about kaykay fred george ron and hermione exclaimed simultaneously we can tell her for you if you like fred and george offered merlin help us harry groaned covering his face with his hands how long are you two going to be hanging around well wouldnt you like to know harry warrykins all of the hogsmeade volunteers woke early the next morning in order to go to diagon alley those in gryffindor tower glanced cautiously in every direction before sprinting across the common room much to fred and george amusement their riotous laughter still echoed in harry ears diagon alley looks so nice at christmastime hermione said appreciatively as she gazed up at the garlands hung between shops and the icicle fairies floating about ron shook a bit of soot out of his hair as he stepped out of the fireplace i cantwait until we know how to apparate floo may be easy but it not the fastest way to travel ooof kaykay stumbled out of the fireplace sending up clouds of ashes and barreling right into ron who had yet to step away from the hearth as the dust settled she clutched her head and shook it vigorously i hate flooing she muttered darkly trying to dust off her robes scourgify hermione said pointing her wand to instantly tidy up kaykay appearance thanks mione i ll have to remember that one she said gratefully you d better you have a tendency to make a mess of yourself madison said as she stepped gracefully out of the fireplace and gave kaykay a hand up ha ha ha that so funny that i forgot to laugh kaykay deadpanned well see you later boys we have to go do some serious damage to our wallets she added grabbing madison and hermione hands and pulling them out the door with her the three girls disappeared into the thick crowd laughing and smiling i ll never understand girls and shopping ron commented me neither harry said shaking his head slowly so what do we do now we could get what we need for the masquerade ball tonight or we could go to quality quidditch supplies the two boys glanced at each other before coming to a silent agreement and simultaneously setting off down the road to look at broomsticks well shall we contact your parents and warn them in advance that their savings accounts will be considerably lower this winter harry asked madison as she hermione and kaykay sat down at their table in the leaky cauldron my parents wontbe concerned in the least in case you ve forgotten madison sniffed and kaykay and hermione came out even oh and why is it that i think you were responsible for that harry asked madison smiled innocently and fanned herself with something that looked quite a bit like a credit card during their exchange ron had been studying a menu and hermione had been reviewing her purchases and checking her receipts kaykay had done barely anything since she d been glancing over her shoulder at the doorway every five seconds oh cool it kaykay madison said yeah why all the paranoia harry asked oh she just waiting for matt kaykay cried nearly knocking her chair over as she jumped up and hurried across the room matt madison finished blandly the person in question had swept kaykay up off her feet into a hug so tight it was a wonder to harry that either of them could breathe he forced himself to look at his menu and not think of the couple as they finished their greeting with a kiss it their business he thought not yours she s he thought hi harry matt said as he sat down across the table right next to kaykay harry glance up gave a small smile in return to matt grin and replied hi matt you remember hermione and ron right kaykay asked of course how can i forget matt laughed we had some crazy memories from your birthday party hermione you wound up with purple hair right hermione paused for a moment then nodded and laughed i d almost forgotten about that wow fred and george will never change will they i still disappointed that all of the pink washed out of harry hair before school started kaykay said impishly harry must have laughed or responded in a similar way because no one looked at him oddly while they laughed but he couldntremember it for the life of him he felt like he d gone into auto pilot and didnthave a close grasp of his reactions eventually someone must have taken their sandwich orders and harry must have said something because ten minutes later the six of them were talking and eating so what has law school been like kaykay asked curiously in between bites of what looked like a blt not bad but not exceptionally good either to tell you the truth escondito was loads better o connor included ugh kaykay exclaimed this obviously was a negative comparison yeah i know but he shrugged three and a half years to go i think i can stand that much latin ugh kaykay restated yeah but enough about law school how have you guys been how did the work at hogsmeade go you mean you haventheard madison asked corrupt ministry remember matt said i think the most that was said was a five line paragraph on the tenth page of the prophet fudge is still trying to downplay you know who i just glad that there will be elections this spring everyone was silent for a few moments until matt prompted so what was it like it s it not something that exactly light conversation matt kaykay said quietly matt looked surprised oh no i sorry i didntmean it just that i want to be out there doing something i dontmean for you to tell me all the details i just mean something good something positive oh kaykay said well ron and hermione were in charge of survivors once they were healed they d be transported to hogwarts to fully recouperate madison was on the search and rescue team harry and i were in charge of the hospital tent you wouldntbelieve some of the things that had happened to the people who came in she said her eyes looking somewhat haunted but you also wouldntbelieve the people who came out hermione added kaykay and harry made a great team kaykay was amazing at healing people and harry has a gift for helping them recover emotionally i was surprised at the state of survivors who came in to hogwarts kaykay glanced at harry and grinned startling a smile out of him something that didntgo unnoticed by matt it felt so good being able to help out and then we also rebuilt all the homes and shops we just finished less than a week ago she said the only problem is that now there isntenough to do hermione said we re back at hogwarts it holiday break and nothing interesting is going on careful hermione remember yesterday when you complained about nothing interesting happening ron smirked you ll never let me forget that will you she said rolling her eyes forget what matt asked looking between them with an expression of eager anticipation oh yesterday hermione was going on and on about being bored and wanting something to happen when when fred and george decided to send some prank mail madison interrupted realizing better than ron did the thin ice they were treading on by getting into this particular subject better than prank mail prank mistletoe ron said obviously not getting the hint kaykay immediately began to make slashing motions with her hand in front of her neck ah prank mistletoe i have fond memories of it matt said glancing at kaykay who immediately changed the motion to scratching the back of her neck innocently so what happened well nothing at first ron said obviously pleased at the interest matt showed kaykay started up again with her hand motions hermione cleared her throat significantly and shot ron a look but he plowed on but then well you see kaykay had been gone sending off some christmas gifts ron harry said warningly quietly enough that matt wouldnthear so when she came back she had no idea he continued kaykay throat slashing motions were getting larger hermione cleared her throat again and madison was fiddling with her drink straw a bit more violently than was normal now what did she do of course but walk right in and plop her bags down on the couch right next to where harry was sitting well you can imagine ron harry said more loudly this time ron finally glanced over at him but harry it was hilarious the looks on your faces when you realized you were stuck and then the way you smiled after madison had obviously decided that enough was enough and kicked him hard in the shins owww he whined you brute what was she kicked him again and he stopped in sudden realization matt no longer grinning turned to look at kaykay catching her mid hand swipe she smiled nervously and lowered her hand slowly to her lap as she virtually shrunk down in her seat kaykay would you care to take a walk with me and talk for a bit he asked levelly kaykay gulped and nodded and matt tossed a few coins onto the table before standing up and leading her out the moment the door closed behind them madison rounded on ron you idiot what were you thinking i i ll tell you what you were thinking you werent thinking not one single measly thought runs through that head of yours does it weasley she demanded standing and rapping her knuckles against his forehead lay off madison hermione said rubbing her face as she sighed excuse me for a moment while i dontcare about a thing you say hermione madison said venomously if he stopped one moment to think i wouldnthave had to damn near shatter every bone in his leg he human madison you re not perfect either hermione snapped getting to her feet are you saying that he was right to say that kind of thing when it concerns someone else relationship madison asked resting her hands on the table and leaning across it to face hermione are you saying he was wrong to hermione countered leaning in as well it wasnthis place to tell madison exclaimed angrily harry growled and kicked a chair snapping them both out of their heated argument realizing they were three inches from each other faces they both sat back down i sorry mate ron said quietly she going to hate me for this harry said by way of reply raking his hands through his hair they were lucky that the pub was almost empty and that they were in a less visible corner i knew it madison said triumphantly jumping to her feet you care you like her ha yes you re a genius now shut up harry said madison flopped back into her chair in a sulky manner so the damage is done hermione sighed now the question is how do we make it work to our advantage madison finished with a grin as she looked over at hermione they nodded to each other then grabbed their bags simultaneously and rushed out of the pub women harry exclaimed in astonishment unable to fathom how females could tear each other hair out one moment then be best friends the next all without speaking you re telling me ron said they left us with the bill kaykay you left your things in the pub madison said holding out kaykay bags the moment she walked in the door of their room oh thank you i was wondering where they were kaykay replied distractedly dropping a wrapped package carelessly onto the bed and then turning to take her bags hermione at that moment came out of the bathroom kaykay perfect timing the shower free she said patting her wet hair with a towel oh no thanks she replied shaking her head and glancing around in search of something if i get my hair wet now there no way i ll be able to make it cooperate for tonight when do we leave for starlight arbor in about two hours madison said checking her watch kaykay i sorry i didntthink to kick ron sooner i thought he d shut up before he caused any serious damage but well i forgot that this is ron we re talking about what did matt say hermione asked as she dug around in her overnight bag oh he started off with this i consider myself to be a pretty reasonable guy stuff he said that he thought that the unspoken rules between couples should remain constant even long distance et cetera et cetera kaykay huffed pulling a hairbrush out of her bag and starting to yank it mercilessly through her hair kaykay calm down madison said gently taking the brush away and ushering her cousin to a seat so what did you say she prompted as she began to brush kaykay hair for her i told him that for someone who considers himself reasonable he wasntbeing reasonable at all i reminded him that the exact opposite situation took place last christmas at my party and that it was perfectly fine with everyone then if i couldnthelp it why should it be a crime now she sighed and slumped lower in the chair crossing her arms moodily and hermione urged he said that now that i put it that way it brought a whole new perspective to light she paused and took a deep breath both to maintain her composure and build a little suspense and he said i was what was it again oh yes an excessive flirt she screeched angrily jumping to her feet what hermione and madison exclaimed simultaneously yeah charming isntit kaykay said with feigned sweetness then she kicked the door why hermione wanted to know well apparently if i can say that i so deeply involved with a new guy after less than a year i suddenly a bad person lacking sincerity oh but never mind that he was the one who was interested in me for so long she fumed as she paced the room madison and hermione wisely chose to stay out of her path well then what for a while i did about the same as you two i gaped at him for a bit then finally said excuse me and he went into the whole two guys in two years thing by the time he was done i was starting to recover from my shock and i asked what that made him seeing how he d chased after me for almost a year while i was dating and then asked me to date him the first time he saw me after my previous relationship had ended kaykay fuming anger was slowly simmering down as she cut a path across the floor and she found herself slowing down as she tried to take deep breaths to calm herself the moment she saw hermione open her mouth kaykay sat on the edge of the bed with a plop and continued he went into some gibberish and said that that was completely beyond the point and that i wasnteven trying to understand what he was saying to me so i said then what is the point that i got trapped under prank mistletoe that i was totally unaware of and that harry might like me both of which arentmy fault kaykay sighed and then he just kinda tossed my gift to me and muttered merry christmas in the most insincere way you ve ever heard before heading down some residential street to go home she sighed and flopped back grabbing a pillow and covering her face with it she had only a moment of muffled darkness before a hand pulled away the pillow gently kaykay dontyou dare go blaming yourself madison said quietly sitting down beside her on the bed and pulling the pillow onto her lap matt was being completely unreasonable he doesntseem to trust you very much oh gosh that must be hard hermione said sitting on kaykay other side i cantimagine what it would be like to date someone who wouldnttrust me you and harry got into fights was it about stupid things like this no trust no he and i would mostly fight about hold it kaykay exclaimed in sudden realization sitting up with a jerk no absolutely not donteven try it try what madison asked blinking donttry to play matchmaker between me and harry kaykay exclaimed angrily yanking the pillow out of madison hands and standing up been there done that remember we never said we were no you didnt say you were trying to but that doesntmean you weren t kaykay said throwing the pillow back at her cousin and turning to look out the window you know how they say we ll cross that bridge when we come to it yeah madison asked well i ve already come to it crossed it burned it and kept walking you think i havent noticed him acting different huh i have and while i trying to make it clear to him that we re only friends you re encouraging him so madison asked obviously not caring so so i ll show you so kaykay exclaimed bouncing onto the bed and tackling her cousin into the tangle of blankets they both began laughing as kaykay began tickling her and hermione joined in mere moments later after much pillow hitting and hair tousling the three girls finally flopped back exhausted and out of breath hermione was the first to move aurgh look at my hair she jumped up and bustled back to the bathroom madison smirked and rolled off the edge of the bed standing once she d hit the floor we should probably start getting ready as well she said pulling out her shopping bags and sorting through them kaykay resigned herself to getting dressed and was just about to sit up when an owl swooped in the window dropped a package on her stomach and swooped back out what is it madison asked craning her neck to see better i dontknow kaykay replied in bewilderment studying the silver wrapping the box was quite small what what hermione asked coming out of the bathroom she d pulled her hair up and it was piled atop her head in curls oh matt sent kaykay a concealed howler madison said seriously oh shut up it isnta howler kaykay said carefully she slit the tape with a fingernail and unwrapped the small box inside there was a note kaykay when i heard that you liked the necklace i decided you needed something to match happy christmas to my favorite dance partner your friend brian kaykay handed the note to madison nearly certain that she knew what the box held her suspicions were confirmed when she lifted the cover to reveal a pair of dangling crystal shaped earrings that matched her pendant perfectly oh they re gorgeous hermione exclaimed as kaykay took them out of the box i ll wear them tonight they ll match my outfit perfectly she said appreciatively oh quite a conspiracy you have going on here madison said dramatically how deliciously scandalous a little over an hour later the girls looked themselves over one last time in front of the mirror in their room are we good or are we good madison said with a grin adjusting the swallow tailed sleeves of her gauzy crimson dress robes oh we re good hermione agreed she picked some imaginary lint off of her own dress robes of glittering violet kaykay laughed and pulled her final accessory from her bag okay mask time she pulled her own on as hermione and madison did the same and she smiled at the result she was wearing dress robes that were a gorgeous shimmering black the neckline was square and the tight sleeves flared out just below the elbows and trailed a few inches past her wrists with a jagged hem the bottom which also featured a jagged hem was full making it appear like she was dancing on light feet kaykay rather liked the uneven zigzag of the hem it gave the robes the animal like appearance of fur which of course was the point do you think they ll recognize us hermione asked they wontright away at least kaykay replied beaming they looked at each other grinned and headed down to where they d catch carriages to starlight arbor if ron or harry was in the crowd of people that hermione madison and kaykay passed on their way down they didntrecognize the girls and with good reason too madison had chosen to go the masquerade ball as a phoenix she d added scarlet streaks to her golden hair and had donned a mask to help her look the part the large sleeves of her dress robes looked almost like wings when she raised her arms the light fabric didnthurt the image either hermione had actually found wings to enhance her appearance as a butterfly and she d found a whimsical mask and a magical accessory to make it look like antennae were poking out between her curls kaykay was most proud of her costume she d found furry black wolf ears that attached magically to her head she d used a spell to make her hair black and she d pinned it up to look shorter best of all her wolf mask which of course was also black had small totem beads and crystals hanging on blacks ribbons on the sides that matched her crystal jewelry exactly if their costumes werentenough the girls found a rather fantastic magical item in of all places a vision store they were special eye drops intended to change to color of the user eyes for six hours at a time that meant that madison now had golden honey eyes hermione had amethyst eyes and kaykay sported icy blue eyes yes figuring out who they really were would definitely be a challenge for everyone at the masquerade everybody out madison said excitedly as they pulled up to their destination she was the first to hop out next stop boogie fever she did a cheesy disco move and kaykay giggled and gave her a gentle shove to make her keep moving save your moves for the dance floor hermione joked as they walked up the stairway and through the majestic entrance wow kaykay said appreciatively the moment they d entered the ballroom the floors were made of a deep rich wood and the ceiling glittered with brilliant stars a renaissance waltz was playing softly and a few people were dancing while others ate delicate snacks that circulated the room on floating platters across the way was a winding staircase with a small sign that read balcony oh it so beautiful kaykay murmured hermione and madison nodded do you see ron or harry hermione asked craning her neck no but then again i do recognize a fairytale princess a wood sprite and robin hood kaykay said sarcastically i see a rather dashing renaissance hero making his way toward us however madison said raising her eyebrows suggestively or more appropriately towards you kaykay madison if you say one more word about potter a thousand pardons ladies for infringing upon thy council the aforementioned renaissance man said falling to one knee and bowing his head before rising again but i do so desperately wish to inquire something of this fair wolf maiden milady is this dance already taken or might i request thy company in this number good sir i may do nothing but comply kaykay replied mirroring his accent as she curtsied she couldntrecognize the voice right offhand but then again it seemed like all the people were masking their voices at least a bit he extended a hand to her and she took it sweeping out to the dance floor before beginning a spirited waltz maiden fair forgiveth me for mine unwavering gaze if it makes thee uncomfortable in truth i cannot help but gaze upon thy loveliness he said after they d been dancing for a bit kind sir i do fear that thou speakest much flattery kaykay said her cheeks turning slightly pink as she smiled however the night is young and promising and thy words are hardly inconceivable since i too reciprocate them her dance partner smiled and swept her into a turn along with the swelling of the music again in truth milady thou art a magnificent dancer lighter then the laughter of children a line of music or the sweeping of a midsummer wind kaykay smile slowly grew bigger and her eyes twinkled behind her mask mine ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of thy tongue uttering and yet i know the sound art thou not romeo and a montague neither fair saint if either thee dislike he grinned back milord knows shakespeare kaykay said feeling delighted as she looked at him and she was pretty certain that she now knew who he was but pray thee tell truthfully sir didst thou know whom i was before thou invited me to dance truthfully i did milady he said looking down in what would be called shame were he not acting thine earrings gave thee away kaykay beamed and laughed brian i knew it was you alas i am discovered he said dramatically before slipping into a grin you look wonderful thank you she smiled you look very dashing indeed quite the renaissance man thank you he said giving her a twirl as they continued to dance but i dontunderstand why are you here she asked curiously like i d miss a dance like this one he said incredulously besides i was one of the teacher volunteers for the project you guys arentthe only ones who got out of classes got out kaykay asked raising an eyebrow you mean to say that teaching defense against the dark arts isntyour cup of tea oh i love the subject dontget me wrong it just that i feel really out of my element when i teaching the older classes it still awkward to teach people who were my classmates and friends just last year it hard for me to remember that as a teacher there are new rules to follow the music was slowly ending and brian stepped back and bowed and now fair maiden i must take my leave of thee it is time for mine head to recall that we are scholarly opposites before my heart recalls that we are friends as society sees us as my head does not my heart he turned to leave and kaykay grabbed him by the hand milord brian stopped and faced her again i wish thou to remember this and remember it always thou art always my friend before thou art mine instructor dost thou mean thy words truthfully milady he asked looking her in the eye with all mine heart i do she said honesty meeting his gaze he smiled widely and lifted her hand to his lips kissing it softly before asking her then fair lady wouldst thou care to join me in another dance it would be my pleasure she said happily falling back in step with brian do you see them anywhere ron asked harry probably but i wouldntknow it if i did now would i harry said feeling only slightly better than he had before they d come to the masquerade at least we re not out of place it was true they d felt quite foolish dressed up silly but now that they were around other people in costume it didntseem quite so bad there were people dressed as princes princesses and mythical creatures there was even a wolf funny and i thought i was being original harry commented looking at the wolf girl and then at his own silver costume hey i think i see hermione and madison ron said oblivious to harry musings where harry looked around i dontsee them ron pointed to a couple of girls a few yards to their left right there that phoenix and that butterfly that doesntlook anything like them harry exclaimed besides where kaykay then i dontknow and it is them how do you know harry asked shrewdly still unable to see any resemblance between their friends and the two girls ron was indicating because because i heard madison say hermione name alright ron said his ears turned pink beneath his robin hood hat do you believe me now i suppose that proof enough harry said with a shrug ron led the way and stopped right in front of the butterfly would would you like to dance he said blushing furiously the butterfly and phoenix exchanged a look that was adorned with dangerous smiles and the butterfly closed the fan she was holding with a snap all right then she said coolly but for all her aloofness she too was blushing they went out onto the dance floor and the butterfly hermione as harry was finally certain when she spoke guided ron in how to waltz the phoenix made a small noise of disapproval and harry looked at her in confusion so she said loftily not waiting for him to ask what was wrong i see how it is there positively no chivalry left in the world a man looks right at a girl left without a dance partner and doesnteven blink she sniffed dramatically and looked away er forgive me dear lady may i have this dance harry asked feeling slightly confused madison looked back at him quickly with what may have been surprise but she recovered so quickly that harry couldntbe sure well i suppose she said still acting like the insulted maiden harry offered her his hand and they went out to the dance floor where kaykay harry asked once they d settled into the dance steps well arent you just full of decorum humph simply incorrigible madison said seriously before breaking down and laughing actually we thought she was well what where harry asked impatiently well harry if this is you then who is that she asked nodding to indicate somebody else on the dance floor as the song they d just begun dancing to ended who the wolf with the renaissance man she said as a new song began nodding again harry located the couple just as the renaissance man kissed the wolf girls hand and they began dancing again i wouldntknow he said starting to dance again madison laughed what so funny you she exclaimed grinning you re so pompous about it for the love of merlin just find a convenient time to cut in that how these things work it not that simple of course it is no it not i doubt that she been extremely anxious to speak to me or haventyou noticed how she been avoiding me since the mistletoe incident harry said harry you re her friend at the very least and she wontknow who you are until you let her know or haventyou noticed that people are slightly harder to identify tonight she asked sarcastically but oh you big baby you just get us closer to them and then tap whoever it is on the shoulder he ll step back probably dance with me and then you can start dancing with kaykay it easy she exclaimed sounding impatient but i go now now now madison hissed turning him around and poking him in the back he hesitated and madison sighed and tapped the other man quickly on the shoulder before darting behind harry another jab in harry back once kaykay and the man looked at him reminded him that he needed to say something may i the man looked slightly unhappy but nodded and stepped back bowing to kaykay maiden fair wilt thou save a dance for me indeed i shall milord she replied curtsying the man turned and saw madison standing alone so he bowed to her and they began dancing harry stood frozen for a moment until a polite cough reminded him that kaykay was without a partner he hastily bowed and she responded with a curtsy before they began dancing after a long awkward silence kaykay finally spoke i must say your attire is wonderful quite original harry laughed i had thought so up until this point you look nothing like you usually do oh she said sounding somewhat confused i mean you look great he quickly amended er thanks i mean not that you usually look bad he said hastily feeling rather trapped in a corner i just mean er oh it all right just calm down harry she laughed i get it thanks you dontlook to shabby either thanks he said feeling like he d just survived a great ordeal change the subject change the subject he thought to himself hastily er so did you see who finally dancing together he said quickly kaykay raised and eyebrow and looked around the room is that robin hood actually ron she asked yeah yeah it is finally kaykay exclaimed looking quite relieved it about time that all i can say their dance became much more relaxed as they kept talking yeah i think the mask finally gave ron some confidence not that he the most difficult person to pick out of a crowd costume and all well at least he doesntseem to know that kaykay grinned first thing when we get back to hogwarts we re trapping them under the mistletoe dontyou think that with fred and george that sort of plan might backfire harry asked no you and i wont be standing together and fred and george want them to get trapped i see harry said slowly but what do you mean first thing arentyou coming to sirius for the rest of the holiday kaykay looked confused what do you mean didntyou hear dumbledore if we want to we can go home tomorrow morning and stay there until classes begin again kaykay smiled that sounds nice with sirius around there i always i something interesting to do harry nodded and they lapsed into a comfortable silence as they continued dancing after a long moment harry said can i try again i beg your pardon kaykay asked your compliment may i try again oh i suppose so she said slowly taken aback okay harry closed his eyes cleared his throat and began dramatically beautiful kaykay you look positively ravishing your attire is so convincing that were it not for your grace and surpassing beauty i would never have picked you from the crowd kaykay laughed potter you re too much she grinned and i suppose madison had nothing to do with finding me no he said she raised an eyebrow well okay maybe a little oh fine maybe a lot kaykay shook her head you are without a doubt the wackiest kid i know except me of course she said amusedly from you i ll take that as a compliment he responded and they resumed dancing in silence the song ended soon after but instead of releasing kaykay he leaned forward and whispered in her ear walk with me kaykay hesitated then she relented he d used the same words before they d broken up but they werentdating now what was the worst he could do she nodded and he took her hand and drew her through the crowd she wasted only a moment unlacing her fingers from his and they resumed with their hands cupped as he led her towards the staircase to the balcony the snow was falling lightly outside but magical wards kept kaykay warm despite the flakes that gathered on her clothes and in her hair isntit lovely out kaykay asked looking at the haze of the moonlight that was slightly visible through the clouds yes it is harry said quietly kaykay groaned inwardly quite certain that no good could come of this walk kaykay i i need to talk to you she tried to keep her voice light and unconcerned oh what about she asked looking over the edge of the balcony at the snow covered gardens kaykay this is serious he said gripping her chin and turning her face so she d look at him i will you take off that mask he said distractedly kaykay grudgingly untied the ribbon holding her mask in place and harry did the same she leaned back against the balcony rail and he studied her face for only a moment before speaking this well this may seem a bit abrupt but i ve really been thinking about it for a long time probably since this summer he began immediately beginning to pace and then i simply thought it was nothing but i know now that it isn t and what pray tell is it kaykay asked please dontsay what i think you will please dontsay what i think you will i dontwant to hurt your feelings she thought desperately to herself this this thing that between us maybe it looks different from your side but from over here it been getting clearer and clearer what has kaykay asked bracing herself you know what harry said stopping his pacing and looking at her you know otherwise you wouldntbe avoiding me lately and you wouldntbe distancing yourself from me right now i kaykay said slowly trying to buy herself some time i dontknow what you kaykay you might be fine with labeling me as a friend and leaving it at that who knows maybe you think that despite everything we ve both been through friend is a fair assessment but he trailed off and raked his hands through his hair in frustration but kaykay prompted but friends isntenough for me kaykay there i said it he exclaimed managing to sound frustrated and relieved at the same time harry i sorry but i kaykay right now i need to talk and you need to listen do you have any idea how many time in the past half a year you ve terrified me first there was the morning after my birthday when sirius and i came home and saw your front door hanging open and a bloody sword tossed on the sidewalk kaykay almost interrupted but thought better of it when she saw the look on harry face and then the day in hogsmeade when you were bound and determined to run straight into one of voldemort attacks and that night at the movies when that man almost killed you kaykay i was scared half to death that his gun was going to go off and i knew that there was nothing i could do to stop it kaykay turned her head away from his intense gaze feeling sympathetic would only make things harder that thug almost took this harry said kaykay looked back at him in his hand was the promise ring he d given her exactly a year before the ring she thought she d gotten rid of ages ago where did you get that she asked sharply i found it in a corner of the common room he confessed i it belongs to you he said holding it out to her it belongs to no one she corrected closing his fingers around it and pushing his hand back to him a promise is like the circle a ring makes it has no end the promise that ring stands for did end she shifted her weight back to her feet and shook the snow off of her robes ready to leave kaykay he said and he said it in such a pleading way that she sat back down kaykay this belongs to you my my promise to you still stands even if yours to me doesn t your promise kaykay asked in a small voice yes my promise my promise to to always love you he said placing the ring in her hand and closing her fingers on it kaykay buried her face in her hands oh damn it potter she whispered i dontwant your charity is that what you think this is charity he snapped no yes it just yes it is she exclaimed and how is that he asked his eyes locked with hers charity it it when you give more than you receive she said and that

anything besides a friend now i ll always care about you in that sense but i cantbe in love with you anymore it just impossible for me harry finally backed down shoving his hands into his pockets with a sigh the air behind him rippled like someone taking off an invisibility cloak and two dark figures appeared kaykay comprehended what she was seeing just a moment too late harry behind you she pointed as the death eaters raised their wands she plunged a hand into her robes but was unable to do anything as the intruders cast their spells stupefy the world went black this might come as quite

money is being made with this fanfiction and no copyright infringement is intended chapter twelve the last laugh ugh harry heard a soft moan from the stone chamber adjoining his kaykay he asked scrambling onto the bench to peer through the window bars into her cell oh merlin please tell me this is a dream she mumbled shoving some hair out of her face and gripping her forehead as she propped herself up on one elbow and surveyed the room i should ve known better the headache potion did say unusual side effects may occur but this really wasntwhat i had in mind kaykay snap out of it harry said anxiously she seemed to finally notice him harry she crawled over to the window and pulled herself up by the edge have you seen anyone yet has anyone come by shhh keep your voice down there are a couple of death eaters just around the corner but if we try now we can make a way out of here with our powers he whispered sticking a hand through the bars kaykay looked at his hand in an odd way for a moment kaykay we dontexactly have time in abundance if you hadntnoticed he hissed shaking his hand to emphasize his point harry i dontthink i can i can barely feel them right now then let me help you he said shaking his hand again she swallowed then took his hand in her own shaky clammy one he d just barely begun to delve into their connection when a blast forced him backwards crucio the pain was very brief a jolt merely intended to separate them he could feel however that kaykay had suffered more from the curse than he had well well well if it isntthe dynamic duo milady i am ever so pleased to see that you ve finally awakened a tall death eater said bowing mockingly to kaykay after entering her cell malfoy she snarled harry moved back to the window to watch and we meet again ten years after our first encounter well this night certainly will end on a finer note than that evening for me i mean of course it only a pity that the dark lord wants the honor of killing you for himself but just think he said tauntingly you will get to see your mummy and daddy and that old werewolf friend of yours again kaykay who d been getting visibly angrier throughout lucius speech launched at him at the last statement he d obviously been prepared crucio kaykay dropped back to the floor screaming a few more death eaters congregated by the door to her cell as her cries faded out go tell the dark lord that the girl is awake malfoy barked at one of them and you he said to another give me the potions and clear out the first man dashed away and a woman fumbled in her robes almost dropping two bottles before getting them safely into malfoy hands she quickly left after that now he said uncorking a blood red vial hold still this wonthurt yet kaykay still recovering from the effects of the cruciatus curse tried to push herself back against the wall but malfoy gripped her hard by the chin and dumped the contents of the vial into her mouth before plugging her nose and holding her jaw shut to force her to swallow she tried to jerk away but his grip was too strong harry watched as she fought for air then finally gave up and swallowed that a good girl malfoy smirked sounding quite satisfied indeed he left her coughing and choking in her cell and he locked the door now entering harry s immobulus he said flicking his wand and freezing harry before he even got a chance to act he poured the contents of a black vial down his throat and used the same means as he had on kaykay to force harry to swallow it immediately felt like something hard was sliding down his throat and through his veins almost like a blockade of some sort that will keep the two of you from trying to do any hocus pocus and dontworry the dark lord will be with you and your little pack mate shortly he sneered sweeping out of harry cell and flicking his wand lazily over his shoulder to end the spell kaykay he exclaimed scrambling to the window once more kaykay are you okay kaykay shook her head distractedly still coughing into her hands her whole body shook with the force of her attempts to get air finally her coughing died down slightly pack mates she said quietly to herself what harry asked confused by this irrelevant statement kaykay are harr she started coughing again harry she said breathlessly as she pulled herself up to the window she appeared quite frightened kaykay it s kaykay you re bleeding he said pointing to the corner of her mouth harry listen to me she exclaimed hoarsely wiping her mouth with the back of her hand i should have told you last year but i didntthink there a prophecy a what a prophecy professor trelawney made a real prophecy she continued hastily it said the wolves of the pack must run together and er they ll only succeed through each other and our world will only succeed through them and and she continued looking like she was having great difficulty trying to remember so quickly and what kaykay is it something about tonight harry asked fear racing through his veins i m one of us is going to she broke off with a small yelp as a pair of hands grabbed her from behind and yanked her away from the window before harry could say anything someone grabbed him as well and forced him out of his cell and up a stairway kaykay had been trying to tell him something important about a prophecy and whatever it was frightened her harry only hoped that it wasntwhat he feared it was the death eaters holding him suddenly steered him left while those gripping kaykay turned right down a different hall she gave him one last terrified look from behind her mask before the corridor was too plagued by shadows for him to see her kaykay fell forward throwing her hands out to catch herself against the hard stone floor as she began coughing again speckling the flagstones with blood the captor who had shoved her into the dark room grabbed her by the crook of her elbow and heaved her up again come on he growled prodding her in the small of the back with his wand and burning her with the tip still coughing kaykay got to her feet and stumbled onward no one else was in the room yet here he said shoving her up against a wall with another jolt that sent pain through her body he hunched over and secured a shackle to one of her ankles attaching her to the wall with a length of iron chain kaykay wouldnthave been able to struggle even if she had wanted to all she was able to do was fall to her hands and knees once the death eater had moved away and cough relentlessly at the floor the sound echoed harshly throughout the room what happening to me kaykay thought helplessly what was that potion meant to do just kill me here alone but no malfoy said that voldemort would be killing me kaykay placed a hand on her throat the source of most of her pain and closed her eyes we had a short connection maybe i ll be strong enough she thought hopefully experimentally she tried sending thoughts of healing through her hand and into her throat she felt nothing no respite from her pain no warmth spreading through her fingers in fact they d grown colder trying to ignore a wave of panic she tried again she imagined soothing potions healing herbs refreshing water but she only began coughing harder kaykay yanked her hand away from her throat what wrong with me she thought wildly i could heal things like this in my sleep during our hogsmeade project why is it getting worse kaykay studied her hand it didntlook any different just pale and weak in the moonlight shining through the high windows the totem beads on her mask clicked together as she shifted her weight back a bit wait that was it she could transform a wolf leg was much more slender than hers was she d be able to slip right out of her chains and then well she d come back to step two later i haventtransformed for months kaykay thought wearily but i can do it i have to do it she really did realize before she even began that it was a lost cause she was much too weak the potion they d forced her to drink was much too potent still she tried and failed she could feel her wolf heart trying to pull her into the transformation but her human body was simply unable to muster the strength necessary even if she d managed to it wouldnthave done any good for at that moment the doors straight across the room from her were shoved open and harry was led in by two death eaters he didntstop thrashing and trying to escape until they had the shackle around his ankle it was then that he noticed her kaykay he cried out in alarm upon seeing her on all fours and coughing still anything further that he might have said was lost as a death eater hit him with the cruciatus curse keep quiet he growled the second death eater crossed the room to kaykay who was still struggling to suppress her coughs he kicked her sharply in the ribs get up he ordered when she did not comply immediately he kicked her again earning an outraged cry from harry and a groan from kaykay get up he shouted now now avery that sort of behavior will never do a high cold voice announced kaykay felt a sharp burning pain on her forehead and when she looked up harry had a hand on his scar after all voldemort continued stepping further into the room his red eyes never leaving kaykay s miss determan and mister potter are our guests and then he smiled a very icy smile indeed inform malfoy that he has my leave to lead the next purge voldemort instructed the death eaters dontcome back in once you re finished but remain close they complied quickly bowing deeply to voldemort before scurrying away he watched them leave as did harry kaykay was still bursting into frequent coughing fits her face to the ground the tall double doors shut with an ominous thud that echoed through the large room harry looked back to kaykay anxiously fully aware by the burning of his scar that voldemort was watching him she looked weak and horribly pale in the small square of moonlight she was bathed in she still wearing her mask he realized with a start in fact so am i had she tried transforming kaykay began coughing again the sound ringing harshly in the silence this alerted him to something new voldemort had yet to say anything harry let his eyes leave kaykay for a moment to observe voldemort the man was studying kaykay probably noting as harry had the way her arms shook beneath her robes as she coughed and the smeared blood that she d tried to wipe off of her lips with the back of her hand voldemort attention traveled slowly from kaykay to the door at first harry assumed he was waiting for someone to enter then he heard the sound of many footsteps approaching and then passing before ending abruptly with intermittent cracks as death eaters disapparated their next purge is in a small area voldemort said almost conversationally a village and the surrounding area i certain you ve heard of it a little place called ottery st catchpole something triggered in the back of harry mind but kaykay head shot up so quickly that he promptly forgot it he wasnteven aware that she could hear amid her struggle apparently though she had heard and was frightened ah so you do know of it voldemort said silkily with a satisfied smile now let see you ve never visited it i most certain but i do believe our dear mister potter has now haventyou he asked turning his attention to harry a quaint house lies on its outskirts they like to call it the burrow harry jaw dropped no yes voldemort replied appearing very smug ah but dontworry i sure that your little redheaded schoolmates will arrive home to a warm welcome all the same harry was struck dumb there was no way that he and kaykay would be able to get away in time to do anything to help the weasleys unless voldemort suddenly decided to simply let them go dumbledore kaykay choked out suddenly making harry jump she coughed then tried again dumbledore will that muggle loving old fool can try whatever he wants by the time he knows what has happened it ll be too late voldemort said his harsh red gaze fixed on kaykay blue one harry put a hand to his scar it burned even though he wasntthe one voldemort was staring at it must have had something to do with their powers i d offer to let the two of you see for yourselves voldemort said waving his wand to make a large mirror appear with an image of a small town but i afraid we have other plans for this evening he waved his wand again making the mirror crumble to dust seven years bad luck kaykay said clearing her throat voldemort looked over at her quickly why miss determan i surprised voldemort said calmly bathed in your life blood and you still manage to be as witty as ever not even sparing energy to be frightened actually i slightly disappointed and duly impressed crucio he barely flicked his wand at kaykay giving her a blast insufficient to rouse a scream but strong enough to make her fall to her side slowly she pushed herself back up this time sitting back on her heels instead of going to all fours voldemort studied her for a long moment and slowly approached her making harry increasingly nervous when he reached her voldemort bent down and grabbed her chin forcing her head up harry bit his lip and pressed a hand to his scar against the pain and kaykay squeezed her eyes shut and whimpered slowly voldemort wiped away some blood from the corner of her mouth then released her and straightened studying the red against his spidery white fingers actually the potions you were given were of my own work quite a lot of time and meticulous care went into them and of course by now you ve discovered their function they hadntand voldemort knew it kaykay wiped her mouth yet again observing voldemort with apparent disgust and harry glanced at her only long enough to verify that she was alright before glaring at voldemort as well the silence stretched and voldemort lip curled with an arrogant smile that was horribly chilling that what i thought he said walking at a leisurely pace across the room closer to harry well i wonttry to deny that i expected as much alas even the world heroes arentso perfect as everyone thinks are they mister potter he asked stopping in front of harry voldemort paused to glance at kaykay blood on his fingers then slowly raised his hand and dragged one red stained finger down harry cheek harry closed his eyes and bit his cheek against the scorching pain the flooded his scar but it ended abruptly when he opened his eyes again voldemort was looking at kaykay with an indistinguishable expression on his face and she d somehow gotten to her feet and was glaring stonily at the dark wizard i afraid you ll have to repeat that my dear voldemort said his finger still hovering near harry face i told you to stop you half blooded coward she said darkly but clearly voldemort straightened to his full height and said with a deadly calm i beg your pardon he wanted her to cower all three of them knew it but harry knew that kaykay wouldntand would pay because of it all right she said her voice loud but raspy from all of her coughing you have it crucio the blast voldemort shot at kaykay knocked her back and off of her feet and she crumpled to the floor screaming she began to choke and cough between her cries and when voldemort finally lifted the curse she settled to harsh coughing as she tried to lift a shaky hand to her mouth harry burned with hot anger but there was nothing he could do he knew it trying would only make voldemort hurt kaykay more voldemort resumed his calm saunter face it miss determan you re weak it the one thing you ve always fought in your life the one thing you ve always battled in your dreams you could have made your entire life different you know kaykay had pushed herself into a sitting position leaning back against the stone wall behind her but was still coughing feel free to continue acting like you cannot hear me my dear it doesntmatter in the least because i know you can voldemort said there are several witches and wizards counting on your triumph did you know that more than several in fact over hundreds of thousands he paused for a moment then snorted distastefully every last one of them is weak diluted by beliefs in false ideals such as love prosperity and fraternity and look at their heroes now just as helpless as they are he paused his pacing glancing at kaykay one of them wallowing in her own blood and still insisting on making things worse for herself through her own defiance the other left powerless to do anything but look on as it happens harry glared at voldemort all too aware of the iron clamped around his ankle and the wand voldemort was calmly twirling in his fingers now where were we before your little distraction voldemort asked glancing at kaykay ah yes i remember i was about to tell you about the potion that is slowly killing you but dontworry he said when kaykay eyes grew wide behind her mask startling her into unusual silence i will be happy to put you out of your misery long before that happens he laughed and the sound of it sent shivers up harry spine it didnthelp when kaykay looked straight at him with a fear and helplessness in her eyes that harry had never seen demonstrated by her before as i said already the potions that were administered to the both of you have been a long time in the making developed specifically for you and no one else i was quite passionate about potion making in my youth and it has served me well he smiled coldly and stared at harry with burning red eyes yours took quite a bit of research and practice to get it just right i knew after our encounter in your fifth year that if you could engage your powers before you were aware that you had them it would be all too easy to use them after practice harry met voldemort gaze levelly though it was not easy especially with kaykay coughing in the background quite a few of my death eaters very kindly volunteered to test each version of the potion with some persuasion that is after all it had to be perfect for the boy who lived he added mockingly harry almost opened his mouth for a sharp reply but then he saw kaykay and thought better of it this did not go unnoticed by voldemort his smile in fact grew larger it funny you dontreally notice a thing until it gone isntthat right mister potter voldemort asked philosophically pressing the tips of his pale fingers together as he stepped closer to harry what you feel right now inside of you is nothing a complete absence of your special little magic voldemort stopped his advance just a few inches away from harry who glared at him voldemort leaned in close as if to share a secret now you re just harry an ordinary wizard boy just like you ve always wanted isntit enjoyable he said in a silky manner that was even worse than the cruel laughter that followed it as he stepped back again harry blinked several times in spite of himself he d wished forever that he wasnt the boy who lived but simply harry it was this wish that would be his undoing voldemort eyes were shining with smug mirth and harry knew that he was perfectly aware of whet was going through harry head at that moment however the sound of kaykay choking made the dark wizard turn his attention away from harry miss determan your potion is a source of much pride for me i suppose quite a bit of my pleasure with the potion is that it was so simple to make that it sheer brilliance he moved towards her for you i didntwant a simple power blocking potion oh my no i had something much better in mind she looked up at him from her coughing fit with narrowed eyes she appeared as if she wanted to say something but was unable to voldemort studied her with near amusement i didntrequire my death eaters to create your potion it was guaranteed to work the key ingredient the smallest yes but still the most important was blood from my own veins there was a sharp intake of breath from harry that made him start coughing and kaykay gave voldemort a look that would ve sent many others running then she did the bravest thing she probably could ve done something harry probably wouldnt have done and spat at the ground by his feet voldemort wand flew out with a flash that slammed kaykay against the stone wall before she could get up he crossed the space between them in three strides and gripped her hard by the chin to tilt her head up for the second time that night he wiped blood from her mouth and looked at it against his fingers this time he smiled slowly as he looked at the smear of red my reasons for using my own blood were simple he said to harry as if there had been no pause and kaykay was not even there you cannot tolerate my touch because of my blood miss determan cannot because of your shared powers it was child play to fill in the rest of the gaps of the potion he rubbed the blood on his fingers together then held them out to harry tell me mister potter what do you see harry didntlook at voldemort red smudged fingers but instead glared into his red eyes blood voldemort malicious smile grew but what kind mister potter harry narrowed his eyes and didntreply voldemort held his gaze for a moment before turning and moving to the center of the room again what you see is not just kaykay blood it is also my blood and it is also yours is it not your blood is in mine dontforget there was a loud clank from the chain around kaykay ankle as she tried to push herself up while leaning against the wall for support and coughing the whole time by now her whole right hand and part of her left were red voldemort studied her for only a moment before walking over and gripping her by her right wrist look at her while you can mister potter the potion wonttake long to render her so weak that it ll be more merciful of me to simply kill her he pulled her to a standing position while she alternately coughed into her left fist and tried to pry his hand off of her harry had no doubt that she would have been screaming if her coughing had permitted it as it was she let out a strangled cry once or twice and watching it made harry feel as sick and horrible as he would have if he were in her place voldemort noticed harry and laughed softly there is one thing that will save her mister potter he put his free hand into his robes and produced a blue flask there is only one antidote brewing another would take more time than she has left harry looked shrewdly at voldemort then his eyes flickered to kaykay she was still struggling to get out of voldemort grip but her legs looked far shakier now and the whole top half of her body convulsed with her coughs voldemort was actually telling the truth she was dying harry looked back at voldemort who smirked i ll give it to you on one simple condition and what would that be harry asked slowly and voldemort smile grew triumphant oh it quite easy in exchange for her life and freedom you stay here and become my second in command nev harry stopped before the instinctive word was even out he swallowed hard and looked at kaykay as she struggled to breathe between coughing and increasingly weaker attempts to get away from voldemort he could never look her in the eye again if he joined the dark side but moreover how could he look straight at her and dismiss her life if he had a chance to save her he looked back at voldemort swallowed again and opened his mouth to answer kaykay glanced at harry and was somehow able to miraculously find her voice in time to interrupt him potter she cried in shock both harry and voldemort looked at her in obvious surprise and kaykay felt a burning anger rise up inside of her stronger than the blood in her mouth potter if you even dare agree to it i ll become an auror and kill you myself harry blinked at her and she glared back with burning eyes as she breathed heavily against the odd sensation in her chest it felt like drowning except far more slowly but for something like this kaykay could ignore the pain at least for a moment you ll kill him will you that a bit dark for you wouldntyou say voldemort asked still retaining a powerful air of superiority he tightened his grip on kaykay wrist i d kill him just like i ll kill you and any of your other death eaters kaykay replied through gritted teeth glancing sidelong at voldemort he however merely laughed coldly could you really do that could you really kill harry potter your best friend and comrade he asked silkily kaykay swallowed past a lump in her throat then coughed again i i could i would kaykay insisted along with hundreds of others you re capable of that sort of slaughter forgive me if i tell you right now that you re not my dear dontlisten to him dontlisten kaykay commanded herself forcing images of herself performing avada kedavra out of her mind instead she addressed harry potter if you join the dark side for my sake you wontbe receiving any gratitude of mine i swear on remus soul on my own blood that i ll kill you for it she growled but kaykay you re dying maybe you cantunderstand it but i not going to watch you die when i know there something i can do to save you he replied more forcefully that kaykay had expected what will it be potter spare my life and kill hundreds of others or forget about me and destroy voldemort she demanded harry opened and closed his mouth a few times but no sound came out kaykay closed her eyes and took a deep breath that triggered another bout of coughing would you be able to live with yourself mister potter if you knew that you could have saved her and didn t voldemort asked slowly and smoothly tracing his wand down kaykay cheek the line he traced burned like white fire and kaykay jerked her head as far away as she could harry looked utterly lost and the sight left kaykay in despair as she recovered and wiped more blood from her lips i he began uncertainly harry kaykay exclaimed incredulously but kaykay he started well mister potter voldemort asked raising an eyebrow as he swished the blue bottle of antidote back and forth harry kaykay said pleadingly this is a limited time offer voldemort spoke up over kaykay ever cool and calm after all she only has a little time left he added suggestively kaykay i cantjust look you in the eye and decide to dismiss your life no matter who keeps theirs in return he said his eyes begging her to forgive him then i ll decide for you she finally exclaimed in frustration lifting her leg and kicking the hand voldemort held the antidote in with all of her strength the bottle flew out of voldemort fingers marking a tumbling arc through the air and down to the floor about fifteen feet away where it shattered and the spilled potion seeped away into cracks between the flagstones her heart thudded in her ears as she watched it disappear harry stared at her eyes wide in disbelief and voldemort grew if possible even more spiteful have it your way he spat shoving her away with more force than she knew existed or maybe she was simply growing weaker her back hit the stone wall roughly knocking all the air from her lungs at voldemort sneered well mister potter isntthis scene familiar he asked walking away from kaykay do you happen to recall your first year when you fought quirrell for the philosopher stone you were too weak and cowardly to take the power i offered you then too kaykay panted massaging her wrist that voldemort had held for so long it had gone numb at the same time all of her other body parts seemed to recall the kind of pain they were in something which they d forgotten in light of the pain that voldemort touch had been inflicting upon her she burst into another bout of coughing and now another loved one will die for you voldemort continued he was now in front of harry so mister potter shall i let her die slowly and give the two of you a few more moments of existence together or shall i put her out of her misery now harry didntreply from what kaykay could see he seemed utterly lost very well i ll split the difference then voldemort said do you have any last words miss determan kaykay knew he was humoring her but she spoke anyway potter harry she corrected herself someday you ll thank me and well thank you for lovely sentiments miss determan voldemort interrupted mister potter harry looked hopeless as he tugged fruitlessly at his chains kaykay i you avada kedavra no harry screamed as kaykay gaze snapped over to voldemort wand at that moment everything stopped even as the accursed green light flew towards her kaykay felt suspended in time and space in that brief moment hundreds of images a blur of sound and color flashed through her head at an alarming rate there she was again in her dormitory shoving the piece of parchment with trelawney prophecy deep into her trunk casting it aside without a second thought the words replayed in her head in trelawney harsh tones the time draws near the burst of green light had escaped voldemort wand just like a hissing and screaming monster it was now slowly barreling towards her the heir of he the dark lord the master is no longer dormant she saw herself in the hospital wing face to face with madison the girl she d thought was the heir all along kaykay dumbledore said turning to look at her meet your cousin no not even the heir knew their destiny but it has already begun then she was lying on a pile of splintered desks and harry was chastising her for trying to stand up on her own in spite of her broken ribs and injured ankle you know your independence is one of your best qualities i think but you know what if you dontlearn to be a bit dependent you re going to get yourself killed indeed in these times the danger is greater than ever before then kaykay was in a chair in the gryffindor common room while megan the true heir went into a frenzy as she tried to fight voldemort control why why why us why must it be on our hands we re just children the time draws near but no we are only children that all only children why does it fall to us they re always there watching from the sidelines but do the qualified ones help huh nooo they sit in their plush office chairs in their ministry of magic offices and bar out the outside world never mind them they re just children the heir shall not die no matter what attempts are made another image she was in the riddle mansion pleading with megan as the girl advanced on her sword in hand megan we ve shared so much and i know that you the real you can hear me and doesntwant to do this we ve always been there to give each other a hand and that made us as close as as sisters megan stop doing this to yourself you have to fight him fight voldemort his power can be nearly as strong as our love and friendship in these times more than ever before the wolves of the pack must run together she was suddenly with her friends in the dormitory as they secretively discovered their animagi identities a black wolf kaykay repeated blankly i didntknow there was such a thing hermione replied there is such a thing but they re strictly magical the animals themselves normally have some sort of um posthumous powers if not for themselves then regarding others they must help one another through the mountains and valleys then there was remus dear sweet uncle remmy dying on their living room floor as she clung desperately to his hand keep loving life kayleigh his hand slipped from hers and fell to the floor with a small thud that all but froze time the obstacles and impediments kaykay was back in the parking lot at the drive in movies nearly frozen with fear due to the cold gun against her temple as she watched harry hand over his wallet then his watch then anything else he could find in order to keep her safe why why did you do that for me i mean you could ve done something besides hand over everything you had i didntwant to risk it harry answered quietly she looked back at him gratefully thank you she whispered hey that what friends are for that block their way and the way of the wizarding world the green light that carried death on its wings was getting closer to kaykay but the image of it was replaced by another memory voldemort taunting smirking leering at her as he spoke every last one of them is weak diluted by beliefs in false ideals such as love prosperity and fraternity and look at their heroes now only through one another will they succeed and only through they shall our world succeed another memory flew by and she was on the hogwarts express at the end of sixth year laughing and talking with all of her friends you know hermione said i think that life is a book at least philosophically we all hold the pen to write the chapter that our life but if it werentfor everyone else around us it wouldntturn out the same way even the slightest comment affects our lives our story like the comments a reader makes could affect a real story yeah let slap on a little end page that says and they all lived happily ever after the end madison said happily ever after harry said come on that a cinderella thing life is never perfect which is okay because it doesnthave to be it would be pretty boring actually should one fall the battle shall be lost and not regained a moment later and she was walking down a hogwarts hallway with harry both of them feeling slightly eerie as they discussed godric gryffindor written plans to venture into death he finishes the passage by deciding to go despite the dangers that where it ends oh kaykay said quietly a bit awed and somewhat fearful despite herself so did he i dontknow harry said quickly looking a bit uncomfortable at the idea himself i hope we donthave to find out ourselves indeed on the very day that they pledge love eternal then kaykay was back on the balcony with harry it seemed like it happened years ago instead of hours she heard harry abrupt confession and her attempts to make him understand her feelings your promise kaykay asked in a small voice yes my promise my promise to to always love you listen harry i sorry i really am but i ve moved on i cant see you as anything besides a friend now i ll always care about you in that sense but i cantbe in love with you anymore it just impossible for me the wolves of the pack shall face the dark lord again in a battle of dark against light again she saw voldemort calculating smirk and the tapping of his long spidery fingers oh it quite easy in exchange for her life and freedom you stay here and become my second in command on this fateful evening the wolf with the knowledge will fall and succumb to the eternal sleep and there was the contemplation the temptation on harry face it was too much for her to bear too evil for her to imagine she wanted to tell harry that there were no fair accords to be reached with darkness and if her only accomplishment was that she d die at the voldemort hands rather than kill harry with her own so be it the bottle flew out of voldemort fingers marking a tumbling arc through the air and down to the floor about fifteen feet away where it shattered and the spilled potion seeped away into cracks between the flagstones the world depends on the pack then her old friend chad her big brother was looking earnestly at her if it wasntfor you this world wouldntstand a chance kaykay as long as you and harry are still alive voldemort hasntwon the heir has come then she was watching dumbledore old and wise simple and strong as he addressed the crowd at hogsmeade in these times more than ever before we need to show the kind of love and sacrifice for friends and strangers alike that these fine young people showed here sacrifice that very little of our world shall recognize them for you see fear shall not repel voldemort nor will fame nor fortune donated to a cause it is only incontestable sacrifice and love that will drive him back a love demonstrated by these young people who spent hard hours days weeks and months to fight the evil of voldemort they did so for the greatest prize peoples lives the world depends then the majestic headmaster was standing in the great hall and speaking to the students it is my distinct opinion that such selfless care for others is part of the mystery of being human one good deed merits another and that another and if we all help one another that love will be returned to us in unexpected ways the wolves and yet another image annisele complete faith shining in her eyes one day you ll be truly blessed for your kindness the one with the knowledge then her final memory the curse was almost touching her now she was in the common room staring restlessly into the fire as she talked with harry long into the night even when we are having fun or someplace that we think is safe or even sleeping part of us is still awake still sober still keeping a lookout for the next trial we ll have to face only when we die or know we ll die will we be free free abruptly the only thing kaykay felt was unfathomable pain as the curse tore through her body it was thousands of times worse than anything she d ever experienced blood turning to ice and piercing her veins her breath freezing in her chest if she d been a rag doll kaykay had no doubt that she would ve been ripped apart at the seams the last thing she heard was voldemort triumphant maniacal laughter and something faint at the edge of her consciousness something she vaguely recognized as a wolf anguished howl of utmost misery and then she knew nothing kaykay worn and beaten fell limply to the floor finally defeated it was over they had lost but she was free looking back on the memory of the dance we shared neath the stars above for a moment all the world was right how could i have known that you d ever say goodbye and now i glad i didntknow the way it all would end the way it all would go our lives are better left to chance i could have missed the pain but i d have had to miss the dance holding you i held everything for a moment wasnti the king but if i d only known how the king would fall hey who to say you know i might have changed it all and now i glad i didntknow the way it all would end the way it all would go our lives are better left to chance i could have missed the pain but i d have had to miss the dance yes my life is better left to chance i could have missed the pain but i d have had to miss the dance first let me say that this was difficult i ve known for about two years that i d have to type this scene for the plot to procede and i knew all the details it would entail i didnttake this chapter lightly at all i had several people check this last scene and edit it in order to see if i did it justice this was particularly hard part of the reason being because kaykay was the first original character i wrote in she not me those of you who ve known me for a bit know that kaykay personality is nothing like mine and she shouldnt be me she her own character and i hope she retained a personal flavor throughout the story i d especially like all of you to read through this song carefully it called the dance by garth brooks and it must be my favorite of his if you ve heard it before and you love the tragic romance of it stop and listen or shall i say read again to me this song isntabout love this is a song about life look at it from that angle hopefully you ll see what i see and feel what kaykay feels icyprncss

the sole intellectual property of jk rowling warner bros and various others who all arentconnected to me in any way no money is being made with this fanfiction and no copyright infringement is intended chapter thirteen confessions nooo harry howled in desperation without even realizing what he was doing he transformed into a wolf and raced towards kaykay hoping that something anything would happen some sort of miracle but this wasntlike in his fifth year when their powers had first taken root and made harry capable of moving at an extraordinary speed to shield kaykay from voldemort curse the potion he d been forced to drink made him incapable of practically any magic he was surprised that he could even transform harry reached kaykay body just as it fell to the ground his lupine cry died away in his throat as he transformed back to himself just moments too late to catch her his heart stopped in his chest as he looked down at her abandoned body and he fell numbly to his knees shaking his head in silent disbelief in the back of his mind he knew that voldemort was watching probably feeling highly amused but he ignored the fact kaykay he whispered quietly surprised at the tremble in his voice and the shakiness of his arms as he reached out and pulled her body closer to himself she looked the same as ever to him despite her colored hair and masked disguise there was still blood on her lips he wiped it away with the sleeve of his robe still paralyzed with disbelief kaykay dead impossible she was too stubborn too full of life to die she was like a beacon of all things good even when she had mischief planned she was unyielding in her determination to help others even harry realized with a start unto the point of her own death she alone had the courage to destroy her last chance of survival in order to stop harry and save people that she probably didnteven know the numbness drained away from harry to be replaced by remorse stronger than he d ever felt tears prickled his eyes as he pulled kaykay body closer hugging her to his chest as he cradled her head with his trembling hand i sorry he whispered hoarsely his vision beginning to blur i so sorry and then his voice caught in his throat and the tears that he d held at bay through shock alone began to fall dropping silently onto kaykay face i so sorry he repeated choking back a sob as all of his guilt poured out of him i so sorry for not trying to save you while i could for not just taking the antidote from voldemort for pulling you away from the crowd at the ball for not waiting until later to tell you how i felt for not telling you sooner for being so cruel last year for ever dragging you into this whole mess voldemort was watching laughing but it was distant to harry i sorry that this ever had to happen to you i sorry for those last moments that you had to face he d seen them too the last moments of kaykay life the way she knew them a blur of images had raced through his mind and they were surely hers for he didntrecognize more than half of them free he whispered quietly to her his face bent low over hers as he wept bitterly you said you d be free and her words echoed as plainly in his mind as if she were right there speaking them only when we die or know we ll die will we be free some detached part of harry senses noted that voldemort had stopped laughing with amusement at harry plight and was now approaching with measured steps but something else distracted him something that was stated in wolf growls and yips but still amazingly clear to harry they floated through his mind in the same manner as his telepathy conversations with kaykay had i am free harry blinked away tears and looked over kaykay body quickly no she was still cold and silent dead i am free the wolf voice repeated something about it clearly belonging to her the rest of harry became suddenly aware of voldemort footsteps he almost turned around when the wolf next words stopped him and now you will be free too before he could even ponder the meaning of the statement he was filled with the sensation of dancing sparks of electricity and a blue glow seemed to emanate from him in the places that he was clutching kaykay body he disappeared harry somebody gasped somebody familiar somebody female madison please inform mister weasley and miss granger that harry is back then fetch madame pomfrey this was dumbledore voice concerned and efficient i must go speak with sirius brian please stay here yes headmaster harry never looked up he was still on his knees but kaykay body was gone he was clutching thin air he lowered his hands and dug them into the plush rug that carpeted the stone floor of dumbledore office he saw the hem of madison scarlet dress robes swish past and felt her hand touch his shoulder briefly in a way that was meant to be encouraging as she passed by she was followed shortly by dumbledore his violet robes dragging slightly on the floor the door clicked shut quietly behind the pair as another tear fell from harry eyes and hit his hand he clenched fistfuls of the rug and squeezed his eyes shut in an attempt to ward off any more tears brian remained mercifully silent the stillness was abruptly shattered as green flames shot up in the fireplace and somebody stumbled out harry looked up out of sheer shock but quickly looked away at the sight of matt harry are you two all right what happened dumbledore said he broke off suddenly and harry looked back up at him matt was breathing heavily and looking around the office with a detached sense of disbelief where kaykay he asked quietly then without waiting for an answer he repeated where kaykay this time with a bit more urgency harry looked back down at his hands he tried to speak but he only managed to make a small strangled noise deep in his throat what happened where is she is she in the hospital wing is she hurt matt asked quickly harry shook his head just once left and right a tiny movement and managed to croak gone what matt and brian spoke simultaneously she gone harry rasped voldemort he stopped not wanting to say more but matt understood anyhow he matt prompted obviously unwilling to elaborate further harry nodded and clenched the rug once more matt sat down hard in a chair his hands folded together and his head hanging brian appeared altogether unable to comprehend the idea harry turned his face away from the others clenched his eyes shut once more his eyes watered but no teardrops fell this time the three of them remained silent for how long harry had no idea until matt spoke up suddenly how could you he asked slowly harry looked up and brian glanced over at matt sharply what brian asked matt ignored him and fixed his eyes on harry s how could you how could you just watch voldemort kill her and not even do anything about it why should she die and you go free he demanded harry was on his feet without even realizing it you donteven know what happened how is it that you were able to get away and she wasn t matt demanded springing to his feet as well why is it that you didnttake her with you how do you manage to scrape out of every confrontation you ve had with voldemort but you werenteven able to help kaykay do you think i didnttry harry exclaimed angrily do you think i didntwish it was me instead of her do you think that i wouldnt die for her oh yes we all know matt drawled sarcastically the great harry potter would never harm kaykay would never do anything to hurt her you tore her apart i ve paid for my mistakes unlike you unlike me i ve been there for her in times that you ve abandoned her and i would have done a hell of a lot more than you probably did to protect her matt spat you ve been there for her harry scoffed i suppose that explains this afternoon then doesntit i would have done something to save her anything i doubt that you can make the same claim i would then why didntyou matt demanded harry faltered for a moment and matt saw it there was something wasntthere stop pretending that you were helpless and admit it harry seized a fistful of matt shirt i would have done anything for her he hissed brian who d been watching the exchange with confusion suddenly jumped in using the tone he normally reserved for the classroom as he placed an authoritative hand on matt shoulder boys this isntanybody fault but voldemort s please calm down and matt shoved the hand away with disgust you may not have cared about her dontyou dare tell me i dontcare about her brian demanded very much the teenage boy again as he grabbed matt by the arm and yanked him away from harry both harry and matt were stunned into silence they both looked at each other suddenly on the same team again then they looked back at brian you loved her matt accused brian seemed shocked at such an idea and opened his mouth to reply but seemed to suddenly change his mind opting instead to look the other direction matt shook brian hand off of his arm and resumed his dejected position in his chair brian appeared to be fascinated with the falling snow outside harry sat down in an unclaimed chair and did his best to keep his mind void of his last image of kaykay silent still cold the door to the office opened only a second later and all three boys looked over to see who it was madison blinked back at them still bedecked in her costume and mask before coming in and turning to close the door behind her matt and brian went back to their original positions harry watched madison in a downcast way as she crossed the room and took the chair right next to him the four teenagers sat that way in silence for several tense minutes until madison broke the silence she s madison paused and harry looked over to meet her gaze she not coming back is she he closed his eyes and shook his head slowly madison took a small sharp breath but remained silent it wasntuntil a fell thirty seconds had passed and something small and wet hit harry hand that he glanced back at her she was crying for all harry could remember she d never cried before tears rolled out from behind her mask and streaked down her face leaving thin wet trails before falling just watching her made harry vision blur again as he held his own tears in check he fumbled for madison hand and squeezed it gently as a single tear escaped him brian crossed the room and placed a reassuring hand on madison shoulder matt finally becoming aware of the unfolding sorrow produced a tissue from one of his pockets and handed it to her she held it loosely almost as if she had no idea what it was for harry finally took it from her and used it to wipe stray tears from her face madison looked over at him in what could only be described as surprise before unexpectedly reaching out and hugging him oh harry she whispered between tears as she buried her face in his shoulder i so sorry i know how much she meant to you harry closed his eyes again and hugged her back she meant a lot to all of us he replied quietly she she was my first real friend madison confessed no one else ever cared about me the person at this moment the door opened yet again harry thank merlin you re alright we should have expected something like this to happen after those attacks in hogsmeade madison let go of harry standing up and removing her mask to wipe her face using her sleeve sirius took the now empty seat and put his hands firmly on harry shoulders studying his godson face what happened what did he do to you sirius asked anxiously his gaze swept the room quickly where kaykay his query was greeted with resounding silence until brian finally spoke up she gone he said softly unintentionally using the same words that harry had not long before sirius sighed silently his shoulders falling with the action and then he pulled harry into a paternal embrace harry for his part still felt somewhat lost throughout all the proceedings and it was almost a relief when dumbledore finally entered the room mister siempre i afraid that i must ask you to leave the room if you wish to remain at hogwarts you may wait in the hospital wing along with hermione granger and ron weasley he said as he circled behind his stately desk matt nodded and left without a word and without making eye contact with harry sirius stood back up and offered madison her chair back but something was tugging at harry mind something important he knew it was important inform malfoy that he has my leave to lead the next purge the weasleys professor he exclaimed standing up so suddenly that madison jumped voldemort said the weasleys are in danger the death eaters please harry sit down dumbledore said calmly harry almost protested but dumbledore raised his hand to silence him sighing in resignation harry took his seat once again if dumbledore wasntworried well he d trust the headmaster aurors are already in ottery st catchpole after being alerted to the presence of death eaters all members of the weasley family are either right here at hogwarts or safely located someplace else according to current auror reports the situation is under control mostly due to voldemort lack of presence during the attack harry nodded distractedly as he silently sighed in relief if aurors hadntalready been taking care of it who knew what kind of damage would ve been done in the time it took for harry to tell dumbledore kaykay would ve remembered kaykay would ve remembered right away harry dumbledore asked softly harry looked up at the headmaster who then said it seems that we find ourselves in a familiar place and if you would i need to know what has happened harry glanced over at brian and then at madison who despite having tears still shining in her eyes gave him a reassuring smile and put her hand comfortingly on his shoulder ah said dumbledore understandingly no doubt you are wondering at professor kingstaff and miss jacobs presence they were the last people to see you and kaykay before your disappearance we madison faltered then cleared her throat and continued in a less shaky voice we can leave if you d prefer to be alone with sirius and professor dumbledore she told harry quietly harry simply shook his head you can stay he croaked dumbledore leaned forward harry are you ready he nodded then haltingly relived what had happened after he and kaykay had disappeared harry hermione exclaimed strangling him in a hug the moment he stepped into the hospital wing we were so worried you ve got to stop doing this mate every time you decide to run off and have a row with you know who hermione here nearly dies of a heart attack ron sounded like he was joking but one look at his face betrayed the fact that he too was greatly relieved harry hermione said slowly in realization finally releasing him from her grip where kaykay harry looked away he couldntbring himself to say it again he d already had to talk about it too many times i can explain if you d like me to madison said hoarsely no madison brian said gently you just sit down and stay here with harry i ll talk with hermione and ron out in the corridor ron and hermione glanced over at harry who gave them a small nod they looked back at him as they hesitantly followed brian into the hallway harry sighed yet again as the doors swung shut behind them and sat down on the edge of the nearest bed madison abruptly sat down in the chair beside it with a small thump neither of them spoke even if they had felt up to talking they wouldnthave had a chance for madame pomfrey hurried over at that moment she went through her normal fussing and comments about reckless behavior dreadful security and an inept ministry to harry her rambling seemed like fuzzy detached background noise as haunting images replayed in his mind he wasntreally aware of her as the poked him in the ribs checking for broken bones as it was it took madison to make him realize that he was being asked a question harry she called quietly shaking his shoulder gently harry what he asked slightly surprised as the hospital wing sprung up around him madame pomfrey repeated did you receive any specific injuries were you given anything no i don t wait they gave me a potion harry said slowly having trouble getting through his own memories a potion she exclaimed by her reaction it would seem that this was a matter of dire emergency which on reflection harry realized that it probably was what kind of potion something to make me make me lose my powers vold er you know who invented it he felt vaguely calm about it all madame pomfrey on the other hand nearly ran from the room taking only enough time to point at harry and command you stay right there the double doors swung silently shut behind her just before opening again to admit ron hermione and brian ron appeared to be in a state of shock hermione was crying harry she gasped i we we re so sorry her voice caught in her throat and ron immediately put his arm around her shoulders where was madame pomfrey running off to brian asked madison quietly i dontknow to find dumbledore i expect she just found out about the potion ah he said knowingly oh harry hermione said sitting down on the edge of the bed beside him i know this must be so terrible for you you were such close er friends ron supplied quietly such close friends hermione continued and and i know she was very special to you we re here for you harry ron said clapping harry on the shoulder now harry hermione said hesitantly you you mustntstart blaming yourself i know that for the longest time you felt horrible about cedric diggory and that wasntyour fault either never ron added quickly right hermione nodded and we all know that you would ve would ve done anything for her you guys just stop harry said suddenly finding his voice and speaking up for the first time just stop i i dontwant to talk about it anymore just now okay he looked away focusing his attention on the floor instead of on his friends he could feel their stunned silence the uncomfortable state of quiet that had fallen over the room as if on cue dumbledore entered the hospital wing madame pomfrey on his heels sirius followed several feet behind them you should have sent him to me straight away she was saying peevishly things like this need to be treated immediately before permanent repercussions occur poppy dumbledore said raising a hand to silence her i am sure that harry is fine and that the effects of the potion were merely temporary hermione and ron exchanged confused and worried looks but said nothing how can you say so with such certainty albus madame pomfrey replied starting to examine harry in the exact same manner as she already had as if she expected him to have suddenly sprouted strange new symptoms i am able to tell dumbledore said calmly however if you wish for proof let us ask harry himself harry the headmaster said peering at him over the top of his half moon glasses would you care to perform some sort of spell for us i i donthave my wand professor harry said just realizing this new fact for himself is that so dumbledore asked with surprise he added in a quieter tone then i would suggest checking your pockets harry harry although certain that such a search would be futile obliged and reached a hand into the inside pocket of his silver dress robes he was conveniently taken aback as his fingers connected with wood er i he said uncertainly pulling it out it was indeed his even before he d seen it he could tell by touch that it was his a simple charm will do harry dumbledore said kindly um wingardium leviosa he said pointing his wand at the pillow on a nearby bed it rose several feet into the air before plopping back down gently as harry lowered his wand you see poppy no harm done madame pomfrey snorted as if harry current condition was far from no harm done well no lasting harm then dumbledore corrected himself ron hermione will the two of you be alright ron nodded silently and hermione sniffed and said i think so then perhaps it would be best if the two of you returned to gryffindor tower he said gently they both nodded and hermione reached out and hugged harry whispering i sorry before backing away ron clapped harry softly on the shoulder and said quietly sorry mate but we re still here for you got it harry nodded and they both turned and left the hospital wing though not without looking back at him several times before finally passing through the doors madison how are you feeling this question came not from dumbledore but from sirius i okay i think she said thickly wiping here eyes on the sleeve of her dress robes perhaps it would be best if you were to spend a night in here as well i daresay a dreamless sleep potion is in order after you heard firsthand all the details of what has happened dumbledore said nodding pointedly to madame pomfrey who took his hint and hurried back to her office harry looked quizzically at brian if he had told ron and hermione what had happened why werentthey staying as well as if sensing what harry was thinking brian said quietly i didnttell ron and hermione everything i wasntsure how much you wanted me to say and i he paused checking to make sure that madame pomfrey was still rummaging in her office i didnttell them about the the antidote harry wasntsure if this news made him glad specifically but it didntdisappoint him in the least the thought still haunted him that he should ve done something anything here we are madame pomfrey said carrying two goblets over to their tightly knit cluster here jacobs you can take this bed she said indicating the cot right next to harry madison nodded and madame pomfrey gave them both a stern look i want both of you sleeping she said not chatting until all hours of the night understood harry and madison nodded and madame pomfrey swept away without another word well i suppose that is our signal that we are to leave dumbledore said to sirius he nodded in agreement then stepped over and pulled harry into a tight hug it okay to feel bad about what happened he whispered into his godson ear but not about the choices that the two of you made tonight i know how hard it is but imagine how she would ve felt if she was here and you were back there somehow coming from sirius the words of consolation were more sincere and practical than they were when his friends spoke them thanks he said quietly as sirius released him goodnight dumbledore said nodding to harry and madison sirius professor harry said quickly before he could leave may i have a word dumbledore didntlook surprised in the least certainly harry it just how do you know that my powers are actually back voldemort didnttake my normal powers he took the power that kaykay and i shared he d been meaning to ask dumbledore this earlier but madame pomfrey had been nearby they d already had to shortly explain harry and kaykay powers to brain back when harry was telling dumbledore what had happened madison had already been told by kaykay i that explains quite a bit brian had said he d then proceeded to explain himself by telling them about one morning when he d run into kaykay at the hospital wing she d said that she d broken a few ribs while dueling with harry it seemed odd to me at the time that they would ve made a clumsy mistake think for yourself dumbledore said you remember i sure how it had felt when your powers had seeped away harry nodded do you still feel that way harry had to think a moment before shaking his head but professor i doubt that voldemort would ve made a temporary potion how could they have come back how did you get back here how did your wand reappear in your pocket dumbledore countered raising an eyebrow harry paused sir do you mean that kaykay i dontmean anything harry nobody really knows the details of the second great adventure except for those who are in no condition to tell us all we can do is speculate and take comfort from the fact that the people we say farewell to never truly leave us and with these philosophic words dumbledore left brian stood looking uncomfortable well goodnight if you need me i well you know where to find me if you do he left as well following in dumbledore and sirius wake madison sighed softly moving from her chair to her assigned cot do you think it true what harry asked looking over at her in surprise that that the people we love are never really gone she asked timidly harry sighed and rubbed his scar absentmindedly i hope so he said finally nobody celebrated that christmas none of them even exchanged or opened gifts harry ron hermione and madison dumbledore had given his permission for her to spend the rest of the school break in gryffindor tower sat glumly in the common room every once and a while one of them would try to start a conversation but it would fall flat and the group would lapse into silence again eventually ron and hermione played a halfhearted game of wizard chess when ron won they simply rearranged their pieces and started a new game harry watched them from the couch without really seeing or comprehending their actions madison who was curled up on the other end of the couch had a book open on her lap but she wasntperusing it she instead stared into the fireplace reminding harry eerily of his late night conversations with kaykay in which she d do the same even fred and george prank mistletoe was subdued it had returned to it decorated box of it own accord and hadntuttered a single comment the whole time that the four friends were there harry potter sir a small voice squeaked suddenly at about half past six that evening harry shook himself out of his reverie surprised to see that it was dark outside he looked around to find the source of the voice it was dobby oh dobby what are you doing here harry asked taken slightly aback his voice sounded strange to his own ears harry potter and his friends did not come down for lunch he said as if this much was obvious when harry potter did not come down for dinner dobby and winky decided to bring dinner to harry potter and indeed winky whom harry hadntseen initially was standing behind dobby carrying a large platter over her head oh er thanks dobby harry said awkwardly as winky set the food laden platter down on one of the tables you too winky it is dobby pleasure harry potter sir dobby said his large eyes wide dobby heard about harry potter friend he added more quietly harry didntknow what to say to this so he simply nodded this must ve been all that dobby had intended to say on the subject for the next thing harry knew dobby was leaving dobby is always in the kitchens if harry potter needs him sir he said and he and winky disappeared with a loud crack there was a long silence then hermione finally said well i suppose we should probably eat something she then proceeded to put food onto each of the four plates provided to them ron took his without argument but didnteat with nearly as much relish as he normally did harry looked blankly at the plate that hermione put into his hand on it was a wide assortment of all his favorite holiday foods but for some reason they seemed about as appetizing to him as hagrid rock cakes i not hungry madison said stubbornly harry looked over at her hermione was trying to get her to accept one of the plates hermione i dontwant anything just leave me alone she snapped you have to eat something hermione argued albeit in a softer tone than madison was using no i told you already i not hungry starving yourself wontbring her back hermione exclaimed sounding quite exasperated indeed i know that i just dontfeel like eating alright madison no madison shouted interrupting whatever it was that hermione had been trying to say she quite abruptly got to her feet and stormed away stomping up the steps to the girl dormitory hermione watched after her looking dazed and uncertain of what had just happened harry quietly set aside his plate he wouldntadmit it to hermione but he felt quite the same as madison sit down he told hermione gently i ll go talk to her he walked up the staircase slowly pushing open the door at the top it swung open the un oiled hinges emitting a small squeak madison was sitting on kaykay bed next to casey gently stroking her golden fur both of them looked over at harry as he entered and sat on the bed opposite them poor casey madison said as conversationally as if none of the argument downstairs had transpired she knows i can tell that she knows but she cantunderstand why but harry thought as he looked at the glum dog and preoccupied teenage girl that it wasntactually casey to whom madison was referring the memorial service held for kaykay was a small one only a small amount of people attended as there was no body to bury the entire thing took place in the great hall which had undergone minor changes for the sad event gone were the house tables they were replaced by a few rows of chairs the walls were draped in black and there was a picture of kaykay hovering along with some candles up near the front where a small podium had been raised in place of the head table all of the teachers that had remained at hogwarts over the holiday were in attendance excluding snape harry was sure that snape didntcare either way and that kaykay probably didntcare either if she even knew the entire weasley family came molly dabbing at the corners of her eyes with a handkerchief every now and then harry wasntquite sure how well kaykay knew the elder members of the weasley family it occurred to him that they must have met at some point but when and for how long he had no idea most of the students that had helped in hogsmeade came and a few gryffindors from their year came back as well also scattered among them were francisca and the elderly mr archer from hogsmeade village the most tragic pair of guests was megan and chad they d been planning to visit kaykay during holiday break to exchange gifts it would have been their first time to see her since her birthday half a year prior and instead they were coming to a memorial service for her naturally sirius matt ron hermione madison and harry were there oddly brian sat with them rather than with the rest of the professors dumbledore was the first to stand at the podium and speak kaykay was a bright witch who can be most highly commended for her heart her heart was always in the right place even if she did have a slight knack for trouble in her brief time at hogwarts too brief i fear she touched many lives he said looking at kaykay picture she was a good friend to people that other students might not have given a chance he continued now looking back at those who were seated she was the first student to volunteer to help after hogsmeade village was destroyed by voldemort and his followers despite having a difficult and crippling life one that showed her much sorrow kaykay took that pain and turned it into a love that she could give to others dumbledore sighed softly glancing at the picture once more his final words almost seemed to be spoken to himself if we could all follow the example of this young woman who impacted so many lives in her short time on earth this would be a much better place indeed he bowed his head and stepped down taking his seat once more there was a slight pause during which no one moved then madison stood up bravely and walked to the front kaykay was my cousin she stated without preamble though neither of us knew it until about a year after we d met i am ashamed now when i think about the way i was back then i acted like a snooty pureblood in the worst possible way rarely letting a chance to insult her pass me by but then under that strangest of circumstances her gaze flickered towards harry we became friends more quickly than i thought possible and it was all because i d seen how honest she was and i decided to do the same once madison swallowed visibly then continued she was the first true friend i ever had she was the first person who liked me for me through her kindness i ve changed i a better person now than i ever was she halted abruptly took a shaky breath then finished and hopefully i can show her the gratitude that i never expressed to her when i had the chance by continuing to change for the better she hurried back to her seat wiping her eyes with the back of her hand as she did so harry was so busy rummaging in his pockets for a tissue for her that he didnteven notice when sirius stood up and walked to the front kaykay harry looked up in surprise was a girl brimming with life i met her when she was fifteen as my godson friend and i ve known her very well since last winter she moved in with her uncle in the home next door to harry and mine every time i saw her she radiated a joy and enthusiasm about life that i ve rarely seen in anybody let alone a teenage girl who had so many hardships in her life kaykay could find a bright side to almost anything and she loved nothing more than having plain old fun whether it was a pillow fight a messy competition with her friends or simply teaching this hopeless case sirius indicated himself how to cook she always did so with smiles and laughter she could bring light to any gray or cloudy day he glanced over at the portrait of kaykay and actually smiled it that kind of light that we all need that kind of life and spirit cantdie along with her merely be relocated i for one will try to keep shining that light in her honor sirius bowed his head and stepped down from the podium there was a long moment of stillness and silence save for the sound of a few people crying after several seconds went by and nobody stood up hermione leaned across madison and whispered to harry arentyou going up her voice snapped harry back to the real world so far he d been watching people speak as if in a dream or viewing a movie he looked up at the empty podium then at kaykay picture he bit his lip and shook his head silently he couldntexplain it didnt want to explain it but he couldntget up and talk about kaykay not yet maybe not ever hermione looked surprised to say the least what why i thought that hey he doesnthave to if he doesntwant to hermione madison hissed she then looked harry in the eye and whispered more gently kaykay would understand i was talking to harry not you madison hermione whispered sounding slightly annoyed the two girls had been at odds for several days now well i dontsee you going up there madison hissed more angrily this time before hermione could respond someone spoke up from the front and the two girls sprang back to their original positions looking raptly at the speaker as if they d never spoken to each other in the first place harry looked up then blinked it was brian kaykay is he paused then took a deep breath she is a wonderful friend in my years at hogwarts as a student and now a teacher i ve noticed it she overlooks transgressions that most people would be unable to forgive she sees the good in many people and forges friendships with them undaunted by ridicule she may be subjected to in return brian looked down at the podium as if looking for comfort from the polished oak he gripped the edges tightly his knuckles white and looked back up quite suddenly even me he sounded almost surprised to admit it we met towards the end of my seventh year but we became close in the fall her kindness has helped me through the awkward transition from being a student to teaching my former peers as i began to adjust i realized what other students even other teachers must think of our friendship i told her straight out what others might perceive of us and urged her for the sake of her own image to forget about me she refused point blank brian wasntmaking eye contact with any of the teachers harry could understand why it obviously wasnteasy to say what he was saying especially in front of a group of people some of which he didnteven know kaykay never forgets her friends brain said slowly his voice shaking slightly and we we can never forget her with this he walked back to his seat and sat down slowly madison was watching him quizzically but she smiled reassuringly at harry when she noticed that he was watching her what he began to ask her but she simply shook her head and mouthed the word later harry looked down the row of chairs at brian who now had his eyes closed and was holding a fist to his mouth as if he was concentrating deeply on something harry then glanced back at madison remembering what she d said to him a few minutes earlier kaykay would understand her eyes had told the truth and harry was startled to realize that he knew it was true kaykay understood more about him and what he d say than he could say yes yes kaykay would understand and that was why he had to say it harry stood up without even realizing that he was doing it and made his way to the front of the great hall he paused at kaykay picture then mounted the steps and took his place behind the podium he cleared his throat unnecessarily and looked at the rows of people without really seeing them kaykay was and is a lot of things to a lot of people harry began he felt detached from his own self as if he wasntreally speaking but that instead he was listening as someone else inside of him rose up and addressed the room i didntplan on speaking this afternoon he confessed i didntthink that i had it in me i still dontthink that i do but someone told me not to feel bad about it that kaykay would understand and well she was right kaykay would know anything that i needed to say before i even had to say it she was interesting that way i ve never met anyone who was more likely to know something about me thati didntrealize myself harry paused and that that why i decided that i had to speak not for her memory but for our memories of her did that even make sense somewhere in the recesses of harry mind it did it would have to do then kaykay was ready i dontknow what for but i know that she was ready she was always determined to give anything and everything she could to this world she everything that everyone has said this afternoon harry indicated the headmaster she had a wonderful heart he then nodded towards madison she was honest and looked at the good in people she gave second chances to people who maybe didntdeserve them he paused then added like me he shook his head slightly clearing away the fog of reflection that had begun to settle around it and indicated sirius she was full of life she had a passion for life she lived every day the way she wanted to live it not the way society told her to whether this meant that she walked backwards down the halls or ate cold pizza and cookies for breakfast she had fun being herself and and what is probably the most important thing of all she was a wonderful friend she was a better friend than i know i deserved she a chair suddenly scraped against the floor and everyone in the hall looked over at matt who d just gotten to his feet harry blinked in surprise at the look that matt gave him it wasntone of anger spite or loathinglike he d given him in dumbledore office it was unreadable and barely a moment later matt turned and simply left the great hall there was a stretch of uncomfortable silence finally broken by harry i i mean she kaykay forgave me when i didntdeserve forgiving and her mercy made me a better friend to others that i think is the epitome of who kaykay was she was a person whose light could inspire anything it touched and make it even better even though she knew volumes about everyone else i dontthink she knew that about herself so harry voice caught in his throat and he suddenly found himself blinking to clear a faint mistiness from his eyes so wherever she is now i hope she can realize and i hope we all can realize just how much she touched each and every one of us harry swallowed hard and took his glasses off savagely wiping his eyes before a tear could fall the first person he saw when he put them back on was dumbledore who nodded at him and motioned for him to stay where he was as he came up to join him very well said harry dumbledore said quietly enough so no one else could hear very well said he waved his wand and a goblet appeared at everyone elbow harry would you please dumbledore said a bit more loudly now harry nodded then raised his glass to kaykay determan he said loudly aware that his voice was shaking to kaykay determan everyone else chorused raising their goblets and drinking to her the wine was bitter in harry mouth and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly against the roaring inside of him that told him that this was really it she was truly truly gone he set his goblet down with a small thump that was inaudible over the sound of many people murmuring to one another or making their way out of the great hall harry hoped he could make it out without being spoken to he doubted he could speak another word and maintain his composure at this moment by slipping around and walking along the wall he managed to avoid everyone in the great hall it was only once he d gone out to the hallway and was about to mount the staircase that somebody called after him harry it was one of the last people he d expected matt was hurrying over to him with that same strange expression on his face harry i i just he sighed and raked his fingers through his hair listen i sorry about what happened up in dumbledore office i know that you wouldnthave just forsaken her really i do i just i wanted to be able to blame someone make someone feel bad instead of me harry blinked instead of you he echoed yeah i i couldntstop thinking about the fact that the last time i spoke to her ever was when we were fighting and i was accusing her of well of being something she not he finished quietly not meeting harry eyes i know you liked her i don t i know that you liked her matt spoke over harry holding up a hand to silence him there was no anger in his eyes so i tried to convince myself that it was somehow your fault so that i wouldntfeel guilty about our fight but really i know that it wasn t like brian said it was voldemort fault not anybody else s he shoved his hands into his pockets looking uncomfortable and they both stood like that in silence for a moment or two so why are you telling me all of this harry asked finally matt looked up in surprise well i like i said i wanted to apologize even if i hadnt already known that it wasntyour fault anyone who listened to you up there could have been able to tell that you were willing to do anything for her harry nodded silently looking at the floor and trying to hide his surprise at this sudden confession well i i d better get going matt said suddenly right harry said quickly er goodbye goodbye matt replied he d already gone a few steps when he turned back harry yeah harry replied pausing with his foot on the first step of the staircase i do still mean what i said last summer you know about you guys all being my friends so if you guys ever want to meet up at hogsmeade or something you know just let me know if you re free sometime okay he turned and left quickly pulling his cloak around him before stepping outside into the snow free the word echoed in harry head free it said almost tauntingly harry shook his head at nothing and went quickly up the stairs the bitterness from the wine still lingering in his mouth mingling with that word i will remember you will you remember me dontlet your life pass you by weep not for the memories remember the good times that we had i let them slip away from us when things got bad how clearly i first saw you smilin in the sun wanna feel your warmth upon me i wanna be the one i will remember you will you remember me dontlet your life pass you by weep not for the memories i so tired but i

at hermione pushing his untouched breakfast around with a fork he was getting rather tired of this conversation by now they d had it several times already hermione right mate ron said quietly you ve eaten barely anything these past two weeks harry didntanswer or even look up at them he d tried explaining himself already and knew that it wouldntwork they didntunderstand how could they and how could they even stand eating after kaykay had died harry hermione ventured softly i know that you feel horrible but harry sighed having heard the same speech several times already by now but starving yourself wontbring kaykay back i know hermione he snapped slamming down his fork and nearly knocking over a glass of orange juice then please just you dontget it do you harry interjected neither of you do so just give it a rest we re just trying to help mate ron spoke up defensively so if you want to help me leave me alone harry interrupted he got to his feet before either of them could protest and left the great hall ignoring the whispers that followed him it had been this way since classes had started hushed conversations in the corridors clusters of students with their heads bent together at mealtimes surreptitious glances towards harry madison hermione and ron it was starting to drive him mad watching all the other students regard kaykay death as a topic for gossip or in the case of some of the slytherins an amusing tale five days of classes hadntreally been enough for the reality of kaykay absence to fully sink in the seat she normally occupied in many classes still remained empty and a few of the teachers still called her name during roll call only to stop partway through the task and look either slightly confused in professor flitwick case or abashed in professor mcgonagall case harry was quite frankly grateful for the arrival of saturday for two days he could avoid the awkward pauses and uncomfortable moments of silence that occurred whenever kaykay was mentioned by accident turning through a doorway and mounting the steps towards the owlery harry felt his momentary anger at ron and hermione slowly subsiding he knew that they really did mean well but they just didntseem to understand him and why he couldntmove past kaykay death harry pushed open the heavy wooden door and sighed to himself for no particular reason he felt like he was trying to walk up an escalator that was going down he kept moving but he wasntgoing anywhere he was simply trapped in the same spot a flutter of wings interrupted his thoughts as hedwig flew down from the rafters hooting softly harry held out his arm for her to perch on i sorry hedwig he said quietly as he stroked her i haventgot anything for you to deliver hedwig hooted again then flew away landing on the floor a few yards away and looking back at him beckoningly harry was slightly taken aback hedwig had never acted in this fashion before he took a few steps closer and she fluttered away again leading him towards the farthest corner of the owlery several clusters of owls blocked his view of whatever it was that she was so intent on showing him harry skirted the desk set up against the wall and it was then that he heard it there was a soft sniffling noise somebody was crying someone else was in the room someone that was most definitely not an owl and he had a pretty good idea of who it was madison he asked softly ducking under a particularly low beam supporting several sleeping owls she looked up quickly then seeing him looked back down casey was with her with her head in madison lap hi harry she said glumly petting casey what are you doing up here i could ask you the same question he said sitting down across from her i sure haventseen much of you this week do you plan on joining us during mealtimes again right and get the third degree from hermione again madison scoffed besides arentyou being a bit hypocritical she added raising an eyebrow harry sighed and stroked hedwig they dontget it i know madison agreed quietly at leas you re not with the slytherins though it been horrible since i had to go back to the dormitory and i afraid to leave casey there alone they d do something to casey harry asked with slight surprise where have you been harry they d do anything they could get away with to hurt a muggle born or blood traitor you know that you ve seen how they ve been this week harry shook his head as he recalled some of the snide comments he d overheard i still say that dumbledore should have let you stay in gryffindor tower harry madison said sounding exasperated do you honestly think that any of the other gryffindors would even consider letting a slytherin stay in their dormitory even staying during christmas break was pushing it harry opened his mouth to reply when an owl soared through the window and landed on his knee extending its leg that strange harry said untying a letter from the owl leg the owl post already arrived this morning the owl flew back out the window and harry slit the letter open he immediately recognized the fine writing to be dumbledore s hey he said after he d scanned it quickly startling madison listen to this harry he read please meet me in my office as soon as possible along with madison jacobs i have something that i must discuss with the both of you sincerely albus dumbledore harry lowered the letter madison looked puzzled with me why with me i dontknow harry said honestly turning the page over to see if there was anything else written there wasn t you you dontthink hermione no she wouldntgo to dumbledore just because of breakfast harry said with much more confidence than he felt would she then what madison asked i dontknow harry confessed shoving the letter into his pocket but there one way to find out let go he stood up brushing off his jeans coming he asked madison holding out a hand to help her up she sighed and then took it tugging on casey leash come on girl she said to the forlorn dog let go for a walk the small brigade left the owlery descending the stairs and turning in the direction of the headmaster office chocolate frog madison said to the stone gargoyle that blocked the door it sprang into action jumping aside to grant them entry to the moving staircase it took a bit of coaxing to convince casey to follow them but soon enough they were facing the door to dumbledore office before harry could knock a voice from within called come in come in harry and madison exchanged one final look of apprehension then harry pushed the door open dumbledore was sitting at his desk looking at a book there were two empty seats in front of him which he indicated with a nod of his head harry and madison sat down and casey curled up on the floor between the two chairs i sure you re both wondering why i ve asked you here today dumbledore started closing the book both teenagers nodded looking down at their hands first of all i wish again to tell you both how very sorry i am i know that the past two weeks have been hard on you since you lost kaykay neither of them protested this fact still dumbledore paused before continuing i also wish to apologize for the precarious position that this places you in madison harry and madison both looked up quickly what madison asked harry however was beyond asking what dumbledore was holding out his book for madison to take and harry finally recognized it it was godric gryffindor journal professor you can t harry exclaimed jumping to his feet madison looked at him bewilderedly cantwhat she asked clutching the journal he didntanswer her kaykay died he said angrily kaykay died and now you expect madison to take on that same burden and get killed too what madison asked is that what you want harry demanded do you want madison to be next do you think voldemort wouldntnotice sit down dumbledore said evenly there was a commanding force in his words and before harry could stop himself he was back in his seat of course i dontwant madison to die he said looking harry in the eye furthermore i dont expect her to take kaykay place i asking her to and no i do not think voldemort would notice for the simple reason that voldemort has no inkling that madison is related to kaykay and how long will that last harry said dontyou think that voldemort might begin to wonder why i still able to use my powers harry this choice is not yours to make dumbledore said patiently well why not harry snapped why is it always harry you were marked at birth as a changing force a backbone for our world with that power comes certain obligations none of which you asked for but one which asks whether you will take the path that right or the path that easy what would you say he paused to give harry an opportunity to answer when he said nothing dumbledore continued what did kaykay say harry crossed his arms over his chest and didntlook at the headmaster kaykay had done what was right by her and he knew it but if he d taken voldemort offer it wouldnthave been easy for him or right kaykay had to make the decision for him to resolve the paradox but dumbledore obviously wouldntallow harry to make madison choice for her she d say yes he knew she would and he couldntstand to see another person that was close to him die ah excuse me professor madison said quietly breaking the silence but what exactly is it that you re asking me to do harry looked back again and dumbledore sighed you do know about the powers that harry and kaykay shared a a little madison stammered not much though then i suppose i should start from the beginning dumbledore said harry settled back into his chair sensing a long story which he of course had already heard long ago dumbledore began when magic was new and there were many less who obtained it there was one great power this power was invincible one could say whoever possessed it had any and every power at their immediate disposal without even having the use of a wand and if their heart was pure they could not be killed but naturally with such power available for their use people with a kind heart were few and far between in fact the most recent was godric gryffindor himself most others became power hungry and ruthless and therefore met their end rather quickly when they died their powers would pass to the child of theirs that was most worthy if they had no children it would pass to a sibling if there was no sibling or child alive i assume the powers would have gone either to someone of random unless of course somebody had the blood of the deceased power owner it would transfer to them if that were the case he leaned closer to madison that where you come in you and kaykay shared the same grandparents so in essence you share the same blood this matter of blood is another piece of evidence that suggests that voldemort is unaware of your relation to kaykay harry told me himself that voldemort examined kaykay blood several times during their confrontation which suggests that he was working to possess her blood sitting back in his chair dumbledore continued it so happens that godric gryffindor was not only the last good wizard to wield these powers but that he was the last to ever use them his wife gave birth to twins these twins were identical in almost every way the only exception being that one of them was a squib now you should be informed that the powers seem to have independent thought rather than go to one twin over the other the powers split in a rather curious way all power is made mainly of two things defense and attack while the magical twin obtained the defense powers the twin void of magic obtained the attack powers ever since the powers have been passed in the same fashion as before but never have they been used since they were not complete it was impossible this is where the two of you come in you are both descended from godric gryffindor however distantly the twin who had become the defender is related to harry he received his powers from his father madison your family was a bit different uncomfortable with not being able to do magic the second twin married into a muggle family no descendants since have had any magic until of course remus kaykay and yourself kaykay and you are descended from the squib twin the fighter he folded his hands clearly finished madison stared at him for a long moment before asking where do you learn all this stuff dumbledore chuckled when you ve been alive as long as me you learn a great deal professor she said slowly you said that the pure of heart cantbe killed when they have these powers why is godric gryffindor dead then harry blinked in surprise and kaykay he added angrily dumbledore sighed yet again harry have you forgotten all that you ve learned with kaykay the powers only function when joined harry slumped in his seat and as for godric gryffindor he said tapping the book in madison hands the answer is in here madison held up the leather bound tome what is it his journal dumbledore answered i would like you to read it that is if you feel that you re ready for such a burden professor harry started madison interrupted i ll do it harry will you please just stop it madison snapped after hearing harry huff angrily for the umpteenth time stop what you know perfectly well what you ve been in a mood since we talked to dumbledore last saturday and i getting sick of it she said shutting gryffindor journal with a snap and slamming it down on the library table do you expect me to be glad that you re about to do the same thing that got kaykay killed harry burst out savagely dumbledore is mad expecting so much since when is it up to us to die because everyone else is too scared to go up against voldemort madison leaned in across the table to close the distance between them do you expect me to say that it right for us to be the ones who have to do this do you expect me to say that it right that kaykay died do you someone cleared her throat loudly madison and harry both looked up to see madam pince scowling down at them out she ordered pointing at the door madison gathered up her papers and books and shoved them in her bag as quickly as possible slipping out of the library just behind harry she waited until they were halfway down the hall before continuing on her rant has it occurred to you that maybe just maybe you could be a little more helpful with this she said you and kaykay are were used to this sort of thing you were used to having things happen to you you ve both always been strong and brave and she stopped not wanting to admit that this entire fiasco that these powers of light and darkness frightened her kaykay and harry had always emanated an air of destiny of something meant to be and madison couldntfeel anything like that inside of her whether she had these powers or not strength bravery where did they get kaykay harry asked angrily they got her killed that what and maybe if i if i d had them too she wouldntbe dead right now without a word madison grabbed harry by the back of his robes and dragged him into a secret passageway behind a tapestry hey he exclaimed in shock what are you what are you trying to say harry madison growled shoving him around to face her are you saying that you would ve accepted voldemort offer if kaykay hadntsmashed the antidote yes no i dontknow harry said quickly madison made a noise of exasperated disbelief and leaned back against the wall behind her raking her hands through her hair but now i have to do something he has to pay for what he did and i am not going to let one of my friends get killed in the process as noble as that is has it ever occurred to you harry that you re not the only one who wants to avenge kaykay death madison exclaimed i can help you but only if you help me listen i agreed to do this for a reason not for me not for you but for kaykay so that her death wouldntbe in vain how does this have anything to do with she died for you harry madison shouted she could tell by harry shocked expression that he d never even considered this concept she could have lived she added quietly she knew there was an antidote and that you were willing to get it for her but she chose instead to save you from voldemort from yourself harry was opening and closing his mouth noiselessly as if trying to grasp this deep idea if i didnt try to help if we just quit then what was her sacrifice for madison asked gently swallowing hard to keep herself from crying what will it have accomplished harry blinked several times she i never sh she shouldnthave oh harry madison sighed pulling him into a tight hug for his sake as much as her own i sorry i shouldnthave said it like that a single tear escaped her but she brushed it away quickly and no more fell harry shuddered as he sighed and madison thought she felt a tear hit her shoulder but she couldntbe sure harry i going to need you to help me if we re going to do this i canthandle it all by myself you wonthave to handle it all by yourself he replied i promise madison released him and stepped back bending to pick up her abandoned bag it was altogether bizarre in less than a year she d changed from an independent and cruel girl with no companions to a girl who not only had friends but had friends who she mourned over mourned with and would die for being so involved with life was still somewhat new to her she was still hesitant to throw herself into it and allow it to drag her along like a strong river but she was slowly easing herself in one step at a time and it was the most painful awful wonderful feeling she d ever experienced now the revealing charm though a simple spell you learned it in fifth year charms right there was a murmur of assent from the defense against the dark arts students yes i thought so is a powerful tool against dark wizards or dark magic brian no professor kingstaff as madison reminded herself wandered the aisles as he spoke this spell can be used to reveal secret passageways or hideouts if the charm is performed strongly enough it can even shatter a glamour or other magical disguise i d like you to split into pairs and practice using concealing charms on some of your school items to make them look like different objects then let your partner cast the revealing charm to bewitch them back once you have the hang of it let me know and i ll see if you re ready to tackle glamours chatter broke out around the room as students found partners and moved to new seats around the room ron and hermione immediately formed a pair which quite frankly was perfectly all right with madison hermione had become unbearable since christmas she couldntseem to see things exactly the way she and harry did but then again madison had no idea how much harry had told her and ron about the night that it happened beside her harry was pulling items out of his bookbag broken quills scraps of parchment textbooks and bewitching them with only slight difficulty sighing and deciding that she d better get on with it madison began rifling through her bag considering that she was a bit tidier than harry and a lot less prepared than hermione there wasntmuch to choose from a bottle of ink and a quill a spare piece of parchment meant to be a letter to her mom all it had so far was the date in the top corner january 23 that she d begun the night before and godric gryffindor journal sighing at this meager grouping madison began to bewitch them hopefully harry would get it right on his first or second try hey she exclaimed suddenly after turning her quill into a tube of lipstick harry who d been concentrating on quidditch through the ages looked at her quickly what doesntit seem a bit quiet to you she asked he looked at her incredulously no surprise seeing how the room was filled with noisy chatter and popping noises accompanied by frequent explosions as students cast their charms some with more success than others i mean she amended doesntit seem like something missing they both glanced around the room madison saw many of the same situations as was normal for defense against the dark arts whatever neville was try to bewitch was smoking and emitting a high pitched whine so nothing was amiss there hermione was hastily lecturing ron on how he was waving his wand that was perfectly normal the radio she said pointing to where it was half buried beneath student essays on brian desk during practical lessons brian usually left the radio playing some sort of fun music swing jazz dark classical come to think of it has he played the radio at all since since classes started up again harry asked no madison said in slight surprise looking over at brian who was attempting to fix whatever neville had done to his book he brian of course not neville must have been having a hard time coping with kaykay absence as well sighing to herself madison turned her attention back to her last item and bewitched it with a twirl of her wand making it appear that the only things she had on her desk were a dungbomb a sickle a tube of lipstick and a which broomstick catalogue after you she said to harry indicating her items harry straightened a bit in his seat and performed the wand motion for the nonverbal charm a violent slashing motion with a soft crack the sickle let out a great plume of violet smoke looking slightly alarmed harry tried again quickly this time it worked and the blank letter appeared in its place though it was tinged purple from the smoke nice madison said sincerely impressed the dungbomb ink bottle was next and the tube of lipstick quill quickly followed after strangely though when harry reached the which broomstick catalogue he had more trouble the magazine didntstart issuing smoke it just stubbornly refused to change madison raised a quizzical eyebrow at it and harry scowled in concentration his wand movements became sharper and more agitated problems harry brian asked apparently he d noticed the difficulty he d been having i got all of the others harry said still focusing on the catalogue but this one is just different both he and brian looked at madison who raised her hands defensively hey i didntdo it i used the same charm for all of them she exclaimed do you mind if i give it a try brian asked harry and madison no go ahead harry said gesturing to the catalogue unknowingly madison could do nothing but nod helplessly she was beginning to get the feeling that it wasntsuch a good idea to bewitch godric gryffindor journal brian pulled out his wand and performed the revealing charm yielding no greater results than harry had he looked perplexed hmmm he said almost to himself then well whatever you did it a very strong concealing charm and you re right harry it seems almost archaic ten points for gryffindor he said there was another explosion from neville vicinity and brian turned to go sort out whatever catastrophe had occurred oh and out of curiosity he said turning back briefly what was it that you bewitched a journal she said awkwardly seeing no way around it harry turned and looked at her sharply and brian merely nodded turning his attention to the small fire that had erupted on neville desk come on put it out you are a wizard after all he said encouragingly as he hurried away harry opened his mouth to say something but at that moment the bell rang giving harry no opportunity to speak madison swept all of the items on her desk into her bag and swung it over her shoulder hurrying out of the room while staring dismally at the which broomstick she clutched in her hands oh boy she muttered to herself flipping through the pages with anxiety nothing remotely pertaining to godric gryffindor was contained within it unless of course you counted the special instructions on how to order an item to be delivered at hogwarts what did you do harry hissed in her ear hey look free shipping on apparel orders that total ten galleons or more she said pointing to the bold headline on a page of quidditch gloves in a final attempt to distract him harry snatched away the catalogue you transfigured godric gryffindor journal he exclaimed quietly so no one else would hear it not like i meant to she argued what your wand slipped and just happened to bewitch the only link we have to the last guy that ever possessed our powers he asked shaking it in her face listen harry she snapped grabbing the catalogue back and batting his hand away we have to go see dumbledore after dinner and start practicing why worry about it now we ll just bring the journal with and tell dumbledore what happened he ll fix it harry made a noise somewhere between fury and exasperation but said nothing further they entered the great hall and sat towards the end of the gryffindor table the other gryffindors though not pleased with madison unrelenting presence were at least resigned to it this was probably only because she and harry were seventh years and because she was a less than typical slytherin but it suited her all the same harry spooned some spaghetti onto his plate then handed the bowl to madison who did the same after setting the bowl aside madison stared at her plate for a long time still lacking any appetite harry was surveying his food in the same manner she sighed we did have a deal she said i ll eat if you ll eat harry finished for her madison began her meal meekly it was in this same manner that they d been forcing themselves to take meals for the past few days now though their reluctance didntquite please hermione the fact that they were eating seemed to placate her though it still didntdo anything to reconcile her relationship with madison when they d eaten what they could which barely fulfilled hermione standards harry said should we go then madison nodded and was about to stand when an owl swooped down to the table and dropped off a letter harry read it quickly then handed it wordlessly to madison harry madison please accept my apologies urgent business concerning the ministry of magic has come up and i will be unable to make our meeting this evening please proceed with your practice sincerely albus dumbledore urgent business concerning the ministry of magic since when has the ministry been urgent about anything madison asked incredulously dontknow harry said shrugging helplessly as he took the paper and scanned it once more his lips silently formed the words urgent business as he glanced over it well he said abruptly folding the paper and putting it in his pocket let get to it then madison dropped harry hands and flopped into an empty desk is something supposed to be happening she asked peevishly harry stared at his hands in slight confusion well yeah i dontget it it was sunday afternoon and they still hadntmade any progress in developing their powers harry wasntsure whether this frustrated madison or him more madison didnteven have any idea what she was supposed to be doing or what she was waiting for but harry knew what he was looking for and consistently couldntfind it on their first few attempts this didntbother him in the least but it was now their third day of practicing and they were both getting increasingly frustrated i would think that at least you d know what was going on madison snapped as harry sat down hey i doing the best i can here he argued well do better this isntexactly a one person job you know you could try a bit harder harry said defensively oh right suddenly i supposed to know everything that you already know about this stuff madison crossed her arms over her chest and muttered darkly no wonder kaykay was always so mad at you you re impossible harry who d already opened his mouth for a sharp retort closed it quickly turning his head away from madison and glaring at a desk a few yards away he tried to ignore the sharp sting that her words made the same way he d tried and failed to ignore the pain a week earlier when she d told him that kaykay had died for him i ll see you tomorrow in class harry mumbled getting to his feet without meeting madison gaze oh so that it then you re just going to quit trying madison said so much for the rest of the wizarding world harry potter isntin the mood to give it another shot she mocked shut up harry snapped turning to face her as he felt his anger flare just now you listen to me potter madison said suddenly right in front of him harry had barely even seen her get up you feel betrayed sure i can understand that you feel lost makes sense you even feel abandoned of course but there is no reason she forced him into a desk chair with a hand on his shoulder no reason to give up and let it dominate you harry started to stand up but madison shoved him back into his seat dontyou get it by giving up and turning your back on all of this it doesntmake you any less betrayed or lost or abandoned it just means you re hiding your face and ignoring the fact instead of finding your way back and confronting your problems harry tried to stand up again get out of my way no she said firmly not removing her hand from his shoulder not until you listen to me i dontneed to you know you re just like hermione i thought you understood what it feels like having lost kaykay but i guess you re just as prepared as she is to say that i stupid for not being able to just move on as if it never he cut off abruptly unconsciously bringing a hand to his cheek madison had just slapped him dontsay that dontyou ever say that she exclaimed furiously yanking her wand out of her robes do you honestly think that i that callous that i could say something like that i not calling you a wimp for feeling horrible about kaykay death oh yeah harry countered pulling out his wand as well yeah i calling you a wimp for giving up so fast she exclaimed glaring at him without even stopping and considering what he was doing harry raised his wand stupefy madison was quick protego the spell bounced off of her shield and ricocheted to the ceiling expelliarmus harry shouted this time madison wasntso fast the spell knocked her from her feet and sent her flying backwards where she crashed into a cluster of desks before harry could even consider what to say or do next the door to the abandoned classroom they were using flew open with a bang to reveal professor mcgonagall what going on here she demanded the point of her hat quivering dangerously as she scowled at both of them harry glanced over at madison expecting her to come up with one of her convincing excuses she however said nothing wiping her mouth with the back of her hand while glaring at harry from her new position on the floor we were just talking harry said lamely painfully aware of the fact that his wand was in plain view oh really and does talking always involve sending somebody across an unused classroom ten points from gryffindor potter what but i she she started it he pointed accusingly at madison mcgonagall looked sharply at her jacobs did you send a curse at potter no but that not my fault if i d had more time she trailed off threateningly not yielding in her harsh gaze back to your common room jacobs professor mcgonagall instructed madison got to her feet and marched out of the classroom pausing only to snatch her wand away from harry he sighed watching her retreating back what had just happened mcgonagall was glowering at him potter gryffindor tower now he stuffed his wand back into his pocket and hurried out of the classroom trying to figure out exactly why he and madison had gone from working together to jinxing each other and if the reason was the same as the one that had made kaykay despise him for so long madison purposely avoided harry the whole week following their argument oh she still sat next to him in class and partnered with him during activities but it was only because she had no one lese to partner with that she did so it was on the last day of the month a friday that madison sat in history of magic with her chin propped in her hand a few seats ahead of her hermione was scribbling notes furiously as professor binns droned on in his ancient monotone voice next to hermione ron fiddled with a quill alternately peeking at her notes and staring into space two seats to madison left harry was doodling on a piece of paper and tapping his foot in concentration whatever he was doing he was intent on it which meant it most certainly wasnt the merlin knows which goblin war the seat between madison and harry was still empty a tribute to kaykay that they really hadntmade on purpose madison sighed inwardly and imagined what this class would ve been like had kaykay been there they probably would ve been passing a paper back and forth to each other as a running conversation i cantbelieve he tried to stun you kaykay would write tried being the operative word she d scribble in reply kaykay would read it probably laugh quietly and jot down another comment good point but i think he deserves a little lesson anyhow madison would grin wickedly at this do you have any ideas madison a voice interrupted she shook her head quickly glancing down at her paper in surprise she d actually written down some of what she d been thinking she messily tore the paper out of her notebook and crumpled it before looking up what oh it you she said upon seeing harry around her people were chattering and shoving books into their bags class is over he said unnecessarily so i see madison replied closing her notebook he shoved a letter under her nose this just came during class madison asked curiously forgetting to be rude yeah dobby brought it actually madison took the piece of paper out of the open envelope and unfolded it harry madison please meet in my office at 8 00 it would be wise to practice some more before coming sincerely albus dumbledore not exactly a superfluous writer is he madison asked turning the letter over in her hand to look at the blank side you do know what this means harry said it wasnta question that poker night will have to be moved to saturday madison suggested stuffing the letter away i know i know she said as harry opened his mouth to say something it means we have to acknowledge each other presence again that would be helpful yes he admitted and we have to work really hard tonight before that meeting madison sighed and swung her bag over her shoulder as she stood you re absolutely impossible what harry asked incredulously following her out into the hall what now oh relax i ll help you out repeat after me madison madison he echoed quizzically i apologize for comparing you to hermione i er apologize for comparing you to hermione because i know that you would never chastise me for being unable to forget someone who was very close to both of us and never again will i accuse you of being coldhearted when you re trying to make me face my problems because i know that you would never even think of saying that i should just drop the past and move on with my life we both know that doing so isntright or easy i will never send a curse at you again without a legitimate reason harry blinked and madison grinned in satisfaction uh because i know that you d never um something something uh legitimate reason so help me merlin so help me merlin he finished with a grateful sigh good enough madison shrugged in acceptance she was to a point where she really couldntafford to be picky about how the apology sounded or who it really came from should we jus grab something from the kitchens and start working harry suggested hitching his bag higher on his shoulder madison looked at her watch i suppose so she said shrugging we have a lot of progress to make and very little time to make it in despite skipping dinner and going straight to an abandoned room to start practicing two hours came and went without any noticeable change in madison and harry attempts to tap into their powers it wasntfor lack of trying and harry was careful not to voice his frustrations since he knew madison was really struggling but something should have happened by now why isntanything working madison said desperately sitting down on an overturned cauldron and looking at her watch we re due to meet dumbledore any minute and we have nothing to show for all these weeks when we were supposed to be getting better harry sighed removing his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose you cantfeel any change nothing at all i sorry harry no she looked at her hands with an expression akin to disgust no special strength no shimmering power nothing i didntthink it d be this hard neither did i harry confessed shoving his glasses back onto his face kaykay and i well we had problems but not this early on we could always feel our powers and each other madison moaned and rubbed her face before glancing at her watch again maybe maybe dumbledore can help she said hesitantly harry secretly doubted it but he opted for saying well we can ask him at least we need to head up to his office now anyhow he opened the door to the classroom and ushered madison out ahead of him come on the walk to the stone gargoyle was made in silence madison had pulled out the infamous which broomstick catalogue and harry was too caught up in his own thoughts for conversation now that they were finally seeing dumbledore again a myriad of questions that had been tumbling about in his head for the past few weeks were resurfacing should he confront the headmaster about some of them tonight chocolate frog he muttered when they reached the gargoyle it sprang to life leaping aside to reveal the spiral staircase behind it before they d even reached the top dumbledore was opening the door good evening please come in and have a seat harry entered the office and sat down in one of the chairs dumbledore indicated madison followed suit twisting the transfigured catalogue in her hands as she watched dumbledore close and lock his office door harry frowned and reached over to touch her hand in an attempt to calm her down and keep her from damaging the catalogue which only made her gasp loudly and drop it to the ground before she or harry could bend over to grab it dumbledore snapped his fingers making it zoom up into his hand ah which broomstick excellent selection are you looking for a new broom madison the firebolts are a bit expensive but i hear that the nimbus series has come out with their 2002 model madison opened and closed her mouth wordlessly a few times leaving harry a bit bewildered in all the time he d known her she d never been at a loss for words actually professor he spoke up er that one of the things we need to talk to you about you see there was this mishap in defense against the dark arts oh dumbledore prompted with a knowing twinkle in his eye yeah well that catalogue is actually godric journal he finished uncomfortably ah practicing concealing and revealing charms were you excellent to know in the auror field they often come in handy as you noticed there was no anger in his eyes just an amused smile so which of you had a concealing charm strong enough to transfigure such a magical object there was a long moment of silence and then madison muttered me dontworry it shouldntbe too difficult to fix and it no surprise that you couldntchange it back godric gryffindor undoubtedly put heavy charms on this little book he said turning the catalogue over in his hands and rubbing his fingers across the glossy cover absentmindedly dumbledore then laid it neatly on his desk and laid his palm on its center his brow furrowed in concentration harry glanced over at madison and was pleased to see that she looked a bit calmer now that it was obvious that dumbledore thought the damage done to the journal could be amended he offered her a small smile and was rewarded with a grin in return that clearly voiced her relief a small flare of light from dumbledore desk drew both of their attention back to the headmaster activities he was mouthing words as he sketched some sort of design on the cover of the catalogue and it was slowly turning back into gryffindor journal one detail at a time first the color of the cover changed then it grew smaller and then thicker yes i believe that it back to its original state now dumbledore said confidently he opened it and flicked through the pages his piercing eyes quickly scanning over each one oh thank you professor i really sorry i tried to fix it myself madison said and i would have been astounded if you had i would have been surprised if even professors kingstaff or mcgonagall would have managed to put it right the fact that you managed to bewitch it at all he stopped suddenly at a page near the back harry thought he saw a strange expression cross dumbledore face but he must have imagined it for the headmaster was already closing the journal and continuing well it quite impressive thank you madison said quietly it would seem she was unaccustomed to modesty but she was doing a good job of it in harry opinion he decided to bring up the next problem as well professor dumbledore there s ah another thing we re having trouble with go on harry dumbledore said invitingly folding his hands and leaning forward slightly in his chair to listen well our powers wont that is madison powers arent he struggled to try to describe exactly how it felt without insulting madison they arent there madison interrupted much to harry relief please explain dumbledore said well i cantfeel anything inside of me that harry described and he cantfind anything to connect his powers to there was always something there harry explained even when we werenttrying to tap into our powers i could always feel kaykay magic lingering around i could even tell if she was nearby but with madison there well nothing ah dumbledore said apparently understanding he didntlook at all surprised i was afraid we d have to come back to this i d hoped we wouldn t since harry powers are already developed i thought that perhaps contact with him would be enough but i afraid madison that your powers need to be awoken within you and harry magic alone isntquite enough to do it harry and madison exchanged looks what they asked simultaneously remember harry that your powers didntappear immediately upon meeting kaykay they had to first be aroused now i dontsuppose you recall how dumbledore suggested but harry did remember in one blurry flourish his mind whipped through images surrounding their amazed discovery you mean he struggled his mouth suddenly dry a yes harry a kiss i ve told you time and again that love is the strongest of all magic dumbledore said unsympathetically you two may not hold the same feelings for each other as you and kaykay shared but whether you realize it or not you are united in friendship and a love for kaykay and that love is exactly why you have to awaken madison powers united by a love for kaykay but that was the reason that harry couldnt do what dumbledore was asking of him it would be almost like a betrayal like replacing her dumbledore and madison may have convinced him that continuing work with his powers was respectful to kaykay memory but they would never convince him that this was he glanced at madison out of the corner of his eye to gauge her reaction but her face was expressionless as she looked back at dumbledore no help from her then harry thought bitterly you two may go now i believe that all we can cover for tonight dumbledore said cutting into harry thoughts thank you professor madison said standing up and habitually smoothing her shirt hem she met harry cross gaze and looked startled i ah goodnight she said quickly breaking eye contact with him and heading for the door harry didnteven wait until she was gone to speak up professor isntthere a different way i mean i know there must be what about some sort of blood exchange he almost regretted his words when he saw the disappointment in the headmaster face almost harry harry harry dumbledore sighed do you really want your powers to be based on the necessity for someone else blood rather than on love instinctively harry almost grabbed the spot on his arm that wormtail had taken blood from him at voldemort resurrection but he stopped himself just in time dumbledore however watched his movements knowingly now will that be all harry yeah harry muttered turning and heading for the door his hand was already on the knob when he turned back around no dumbledore eyebrows went up in mild surprise but it may have just been an act yes harry i want to know why we cantbring kaykay back his left hand curled into a fist as he voiced the question that had been tumbling around in his head since the fateful night that they d faced voldemort no spell can no spell can reawaken the dead i know harry exclaimed angrily but who said anything about a spell i mean gryffindor went into death kaykay sent me back here even though she was gone if i have these amazing powers why canti put them to any use he pounded the back of the chair he d been sitting in with his fist in frustration why cantwe bring kaykay back why and donttry to tell me that she wouldntwant to be back because i know she would she was she was but exactly what kaykay was harry couldntsay because even he didntknow how to explain it he felt a gentle pressure on his shoulder dumbledore had stood up and was steering harry back into his chair it is true gryffindor journeyed into death but he had his full powers and what is more they were in prime condition plus harry you must know what he found while he was there but we don t harry protested who is to say you re wrong harry he said it with such soft finality that harry actually fell silent after a long pause dumbledore continued madison transfiguration incident was both a blessing and a curse and and how is that harry asked dumbledore picked up the journal it revealed something that godric gryffindor had concealed something that he wrote in a later entry he held it out to harry who eagerly grabbed it and flipped towards the back finally he found the spot where the journal entries left off except now there was more text on the next blank page blood for blood the debt repaid one soul life to take death place harry looked back up at dumbledore it means it means that if we were to bring kaykay back someone would have to stay in her place right blood for blood dumbledore nodded gravely i ll do it i dontcare what it takes she didntdeserve to die harry she has so much more she can do for people harry listen to me i have the powers so i can go into death i dontcare that i d have to take her place i d do anything for her harry it blood for blood dumbledore spoke over him gently i know i dontcare i willing to die for her harry protested defiantly i know you are dumbledore said quietly but yours is not the blood that would have to be paid cold so cold so cold and so dark a dense heavy dark that filled the lungs flowed through the veins and pressed in from all sides like an invisible burning swirling swallowing fog like like oh i was just about to quote mark twain when i realized that it all in vain a twist of fate a twisted look of pain to defeat the wheat go against the grain i know i know i know what you ve been through but there only so

afraid this would happen with senior year and all on the plus side i in three choirs i got lead in the fall play and i survived my college english class and i made it into my first choice college and they offered me over 8 000 a year in financial aid and for the first time in known history i swooning over somebody who isnta book or fanfiction character he so ah getting off topic sorry but besides that much thanks to relient k for this great song even though i cut a lot of repeated parts and shortened the end siriusfanatic but happy endings are sooo boring however just to be nice i ll try to put something besides teen angst in chapter 15 even if it only minor siriuslivesinme i refuse to feel guilty over making you cry two chapters in a row i simply refuse it actually a compliment to me so thanks her royal evilness aka me wow was i really that bored that i reviewd my own story sad siriusfanatic as to your response to the hint in my review no and no it more of a quick glimpse into a deeper part of brian soul siriusfanatic yes it did thanks ilovecoldplay3 i haventheard the song but i am well not happy per se but pleased that i made you cry offers gianna a tissue thanks for reading dianastar bribe me with what grins slyly well anybody who stuck with me all this time thanks my own response to the last chapter ponderance is well i think that harry loved kaykay most since well everything they did seem better off as friends but i can tell that he never stopped caring about her there lots more but icy covered it all thoughroughly enough for you me to get the point matt comes in last this is not just because i not fond of the little man wench because i supposed to answer my ponderance unbiased ly but because he almost pushed kaykay into a relationship and if they had one good fight i dontthink anything would be left for them to salvage brian is second i know i swoon over him along with any sane female reader who read chapter eleven but really i have a good reason you have to believe me especially since not believeing me would be scary since i am me er or you are me wait anyhow he was always there for kaykay and loved her dearly as a friend he may have wanted more but never pushed anything in fact he suggested that she not hang out with him in order to preserve her own dignity image only when she refused did he continue as her friend also if they were to fight they d still be close friends that the beauty of loving a friend and if anybody has any theories regarding the ficcy know one of the kats does i always love hearing them i sorry this update took so long quickedit wasntworking well on to the story disclaimer i dontown anything except the plot harry potter is the sole intellectual property of jk rowling warner bros and various others who all arentconnected to me in any way no money is being made with this fanfiction and no copyright infringement is intended chapter two wishing on a star on july fourth harry was greeted most unfavorably in the morning wake up wake up wake up an all too familiar voice yelled excitedly in his ear it my birthday harry groaned and put his pillow over his head it didntwork though wake up lazy sirius is waiting for you kaykay said grabbing the pillow and whacking him with it why are you even in here harry asked crankily i told you sirius wanted me to come and get you well then why didnt sirius come harry said taking the pillow back oh he said something about annoying you and special birthday girl privileges yeah yeah go away harry mumbled covering his head again and trying to go back to sleep suddenly the pillow beneath his head was yanked away and he was being pummeled with it now some people know the less secretive secrets of life and some don t but the fact that being hit by pillows not only makes it hard to sleep but also makes it hard to resist retaliating is a pretty well known one so it should come as no surprise that harry responded in the only logical way by getting a good hold of his pillow and swinging it mightily at his opponent she simply pranced out of his reach and hit him again provoking him to jump out of bed quite suddenly very awake and chase her around the room into the hall and down the stairs he d made it to the kitchen before suddenly realizing that he was only wearing shorts and running back up to his room pillow abandoned and kaykay laughing hysterically when he returned five minutes later fully clothed kaykay was sitting on a stool at the counter eating a chocolate chip muffin while sirius talked to her but really when the two of you are fighting he seems to be having a lot more fun than you well hi harry sirius said brightly as he noticed harry muffin i didntknow you could bake muffins harry said taking a blueberry one and sitting down neither did i but kaykay helped well so did my wand it nice to see that tarzan abandoned his loincloth and joined civilization kaykay snorted almost dropping her milk glass in her hurry to grab napkins and press them to her nose ha ha very funny ow kaykay commented still laughing but trying to get milk out of her nose and that just sick harry informed kaykay who turned and punched him hard in the shoulder shut up she said as he rubbed his arm it my birthday ah yes seventeen going on eight he decided to idiotically comment kaykay punched him again when will you stop doing that he demanded whining somewhat whenever you stop saying stupid things that provoke me kaykay answered calmly finishing off her muffin thanks sirius i d better be going now though sirius turned and looked at the clock okay i guess we ll see you later today then wontwe yup kaykay grinned jumping off of the stool and heading towards the door happy birthday sirius called after her she yelled a thanks back and the front door snapped shut earning a grin from sirius eleven thirty he commented yup they should all be there by now uncle remmy kaykay shouted bouncing in the door i back she was greeted with silence remus she asked cautiously a bit less enthusiastically where are you she pushed open the door to the kitchen hellooo ooo hi there someone replied from behind her kaykay froze it didnt sound like remus she turned slowly to see who it was and then quite suddenly squealed with delight chad she cried throwing her arms around his neck and hugging him tightly chad was a year older than she was and he had attended escondito school of witchcraft and wizardry in california the same wizarding school kaykay had attended until her cousins died and she was adopted by remus chad had stepped into the role of older brother for kaykay not long after she d started at escondito and his guidance had helped her greatly hey how are you kiddo chad laughed in reply excuse me kiddo may i point out that i now just as tall as you are are not are too look kaykay used her hand to mark an imaginary line from the top of her head to the top of chad s he laughed again and pulled her into another hug man i missed you escondito is too weird when you arentaround it been two years in a row now well you ll have megan now wait you wontwill you you ve graduated megan was kaykay best friend from america and she and chad had a kind of there kind of not there relationship but i ll still visit him of course a new voice piped up from behind kaykay megan kaykay squealed as if she hadntjust seen the girl a week prior at hogwarts hey dontforget about me hermione said strolling into the kitchen kaykay rushed forward and hugged both of the girls at once hey what about me donti get a squeal of delight and a hug too yet another voice asked matt kaykay felt an odd sort of elation as she hugged matt giggling and as he spun her around it was utter pandemonium everyone greeting everyone and in the middle of it all casey barking and jumping around trying to get in on the action somewhere in the confusion ron ginny and the weasley twins showed up adding their voices to the ruckus but kaykay felt that the best entrance by far was made by sirius kaykay he yelled in an oddly high voice he must have been pretending to be a teenage girl throwing his arms out as if for a hug sirius she cried in reply like oh my gosh kaykay like totally wow sirius he ran towards her in a funny spirited skip arms wide not noticing the can of whipped cream that fred or was it george had shoved into kaykay hand just as he drew near kaykay raised the can and well you can just guess at what happened after most of the ruckus had died down in other words once kaykay dragged casey outside and a towel was located to wipe of sirius face kaykay was finally able to voice her question really though what are you all doing here i thought you guys werentcoming until five or so surprise remus said pushing his way into the kitchen in honor of your birthday the party is open for extended hours eat drink be merry and all that good stuff he winked oooh thank you remus kaykay exclaimed happily giving him an elated hug sorry i late a new voice said kaykay looked over remus shoulder at the doorway and saw brian she let go of remus and gave the new arrival a hug happy birthday kaykay he said hugging her back i sorry i cantstay new job you know but i just had to pop in and say hello oh and drop off your birthday present he added pulling a small box wrapped in blue paper out of his robe pocket oh kaykay said taking it and walking a few steps over to place it on the table you didnthave to do that of course i did i have to go now but happy birthday i hope you have a fun time by the looks of this crowd you will and fred and george weasley he turned to the pair and gave a mock bow an honor oh lords of the prank goodbye he said turning back to kaykay have a great summer and a good school year too i ll try to stay in touch he gave her a hug goodbye and looking over his shoulder kaykay noticed two odd things happen at the same time the first was that matt was looking at brian with some sort of anger or displeasure well that may not have been too odd the second strange thing was harry giving brian a similar look what was that supposed to mean what reason did either of them have to hold a grudge against him eh forget it it my birthday she thought stepping out of the hug and waving goodbye as brian left the house and disapparated the day passed with much laughter and shouting not to mention many funny moments of course what could one expect when the weasley twins were around they succeeded in making megan unable to do anything but hiccup bubbles for half an hour enchanted sirius to have to walk on all fours and chase his tail like a dog and they caused three people to end up with wacky colored hair change it back harry demanded you re kidding right fred asked change it back come on harry george said be a sport yeah harry kaykay laughed pink is such an adorable color on you shut up madame blue hair you you you infinity kaykay retorted sticking her tongue out at him hermione tugged at her hair which was tipped with purple and simply said i just wondering what my parents will say it is a good idea really megan said later once her bubbles had cleared away i sure the hair coloring will be very popular for quidditch games kaykay was about to agree when a cry of frustration distracted her casey she looked just in time to see sirius trip over her dog knocking into remus who stumbled backwards and fell into the table they d set up on the lawn what next happened is best described as the seesaw effect the punch bowl and cake at the other end flew high in the air and landed on sirius and remus respectively there was stunned silence for a few moments afterward and the only soul daring enough to make the first move was the culprit who d caused it all casey the dog bounded up to remus tail wagging happily as she tried to lick the frosting off of his face the first one to laugh was sirius as he lifted the punch bowl off of his head and spat out a mouthful of juice chad and kaykay werenttoo far behind and after that everyone started laughing remus being the last to join in it was a rather good thing indeed that they werentmuggles for if they had been fixing the mess would have been rather difficult but it was mended soon enough and as soon as the sun set the candles on the cake were lit and everyone sang happy birthday after eating everyone flopped back onto the grass and watched an array of fireworks courtesy of fred and george kaykay was very thankful for the fireworks because it incorporated a part of her birthday that she d thought she was giving up upon moving to england see her birthday being on the fourth of july america independence day there were always fireworks in the evening despite how packed the day was when it was time for everyone to leave it seemed to be much too soon the noisy rambunctious weasleys were the first to leave followed soon by hermione and megan then chad as everyone left kaykay shouted another thanks after them for the box of prankster items from the weasleys the book how to make your own jinxes from hermione and quidditch through the ages from chad no surprise there sirius and harry must have thought that she needed enough sugar to keep her awake for five years they certainly gave her enough sweets to do so she thanked them as they waved goodbye walking across the lawn i wonder what harry is going to do about that hair kaykay said to matt as they stood at the end of the driveway the apparating point i really dontknow but he d better come up with something soon i wouldntput it past fred and george to let him go back to school like that yes terrible blow to his macho ego kaykay snorted here i haventgiven you your gift yet matt said digging in his jeans pocket for something ah here he handed kaykay a laminated identification card on a lanyard wow matt a picture of me ummm thanks it a pass he said as if that would explain everything er kaykay still wasntsure how to respond for next week he continued this picture of you will be your ticket into my dad recording studio and to meet garth brooks what kaykay shrieked looking at the card with new interest yeah and if you arenttoo shy you can do some work in the recording studio and get a soundtrack of your own i mean it not like it would be released for the public but it may be something you d like to keep it rocks kaykay exclaimed hugging so tightly that it was a wonder that he still could breathe thank you thank you thank you anytime matt gasped giving her a hug back and sighing in relief as she let go and he was able to breathe regularly i want you to sing with me kaykay said she must have said it quite abruptly because it took matt a few moments to react what oh come on you re a good singer we could sing a few songs together it would be a great reminder of who made the recording possible in the first place well if that what you want it is she said with a finality that left no room for argument even if it had she changed the subject quite easily hey look she pointed at the diamond scattered sky where a star shot across fading towards the horizon make a wish matt instructed closing his eyes kaykay was quick to follow unconsciously grabbing his hand after standing in silence for a few moments the pair opened their eyes what did you wish for matt asked canttell otherwise it wontcome true what about you can you tell of course mine probably wontcome true unless i do matt said well what is it what did you wish for kaykay looked at matt curiously as he took a deep breath courage he confessed courage kaykay echoed confused what for matt looked at her and she knew even before he answered for this he said tilting kaykay chin up and giving her a short simple but sweet kiss kaykay looked at her feet a blush rising to her cheeks well then she said finally looking up at him it looks like we both got what we wished for tonight at this matt face broke out into a huge grin kaykay could hear the joy in his voice as he said yeah well happy birthday i ll pick you up next saturday at nine for your recording thing then happy birthday he repeated kaykay laughed then boldly gave him a quick kiss goodbye matt she smiled waving he waved back before disappearing sighing happily kaykay turned to head back up to the house and was surprised as she saw the shadow of someone standing outside the house next door goodnight harry she said waving unnaturally friendly harry didnteven respond just opened his front door and disappeared inside glancing back at kaykay once more before letting the door swing shut harry felt funny not funny like a good joke funny like a strange smell not to say that he smelled it was just to say that he felt weird off it had started at kaykay birthday party the week prior he didntknow why but some part of him insisted that it was alright for him to start dating other girls after he and kaykay broke up but it was not alright for her to date other guys that was not girls well actually it wasntokay for her to date girls either but that wasntthe point why did it matter anyhow he hated her didnthe but that wasntthe point either the point was yah harry felt a foot connect with his stomach and unprepared he doubled over trying to catch a breath what wrong with you kaykay asked exasperated it like you re not even trying oh so you want me to kick you is that it harry asked rubbing his stomach i d like you to at least try what you dont want to kick me now is that it listen potter i know i better than you in everything but quidditch but that no reason to give up kaykay said angrily wiping her brow for the uninformed harry and kaykay were practicing martial arts having graduated past sword fighting kaykay still beating harry easily it was still early morning the coolest part of the day for practicing it was a good thing they were both morning people by ten o clock or so the day began to heat up and it would ve been far too hot for pants and long sleeved shirts even if they were loose and airy come on potter kaykay said shoving his shoulders give it your best shot hit me kick me something if you can she added glaring at her harry grabbed her arm and shoulder so she couldntescape and tipped her to make her fall easily she toppled to the grass so easily that harry had to wonder if she was just letting him win oh good boy kaykay said clapping as she looked up from where she was laying on the ground our wittle hawwy knows how to fight kaykay remus interrupted poking his head out the front door it eight thirty isntmatt picking you up at nine it eight thirty already kaykay exclaimed in horror rolling over and pushing herself up ignoring the hand harry offered well perhaps she just didntsee it i not even ready yet augh what am i going to wear as kaykay hurried into the house harry looked up at the sun shielding his eyes he was so distracted he didnthear her sneak up behind him which would explain why she easily tripped him with a leg sweep constant vigilance potter she chastised in a singsong voice looking down at him i hate you he said by way of reply narrowing his eyes at her and i love you too she rolled her eyes beat you tomorrow she called running into her house dontyou mean see harry asked rolling onto his stomach kaykay poked her head back out of her door no i mean beat toodles harry watched kaykay door a long time after she disappeared yes he hated her he hated her so much it hurt not too long after her panicked rush to get ready matt arrived and was knocking on kaykay door hi she answered it smiling as she tried to do three things at once i ll be just a minute alarm clock didntgo off matt asked stepping inside and closing the door while kaykay ran around looking for shoes while she put on a mismatched pair of earrings no it went off judo practice went long is all she said hastily not bothering to explain ah there they are she d finally located her sandals and hastily tried to shove her feet into them matt laughed as she tried to unlock the mystery of slip on shoes and switched them around so she was putting them on the right feet he also handed kaykay the matching earring to the one she had on already hey that looks just like she felt her ears then rolled her eyes at herself and took the left one out thanks she said blushing as she looked for her watch is what i wearing okay she began babbling i had no idea what to put on i mean after all how many times do you meet your favorite singer and then i realized i didnteven know what state it ll be in but of course i assuming it minnesota because that where you live but then again i never know and what it like there right now will i need a sweatshirt maybe i shouldntwear shorts am i being too offhand about how i look maybe i should change into something nicer kaykay matt laughed grabbing her hand and stopping her from darting about the room you look great dontworry about it you d be surprised how little some famous people worry about how they look when they re not at a concert he ll probably be in jeans and a tee shirt right right right kaykay muttered breathing slowly eyes closed they popped back open suddenly oh my gosh the pass where did i put it she began running around again and she heard matt sigh i know i had it right before you got here but where she turned back and saw matt swinging the lanyard on his finger looking very much amused oh thanks matt where was it on your table right next to the hairbrush he said with a grin slipping it over her neck now breathe with me now inhale exhale in with mr good air out with mr bad air thank you sir yoga kaykay sighed smiling all the same all in a day work he said shall we yeah oh should i bring my guitar maybe i there are guitars at the recording studio matt said putting his hands on her shoulders and steering her towards the fireplace anyhow you ll probably be singing with back tracks that have drums guitar backup singers and all that good stuff right kaykay said suddenly feeling quite foolish indeed are we flooing just to the station in saliente from there we ll be driving he lit a fire with his wand then took a pinch of powder and threw it into the dancing flames making them burn green after you he bowed low and gestured towards the fire thanks i oh wait kaykay said suddenly causing matt to straighten eyes disbelieving as kaykay ran to the front door and opened it kaykay was probably more disbelieving when she found herself face to face with harry on the other side potter what are you nevermind remus we re leaving now i ll see you i dunno later bye she called stepping down the walk a bit to make sure remus who was talking to sirius over the fence had heard he waved saying have fun kayleigh kaykay turned to go back in finding herself once again face to face with harry she made a noise of irritation walking around him to get into the house i swear potter you re absolutely crazy shut up he retorted oooh ouch kaykay said sarcastically want a bit of bite to go with that bark shut up he said again glaring this time kaykay looked at him in disbelief you are such a dork she responded before slamming the door in his face with a frustrated sigh after taking a moment to regain her composure she turned and smiled brightly at matt who was looking at the door strangely dontmind him he just weird she said not really knowing the right word to describe harry random nature well let go kaykay stumbled out of the fireplace holding her head and weaving around trying to get even footing she tripped suddenly and matt caught her what happened kaykay asked lazily closing her eyes and shaking her head to try to make the world come into focus just a bit of jet lag he replied helping her steady herself it ll wear off soon we just had to adjust to the new time zone time zone kaykay said slowly as they left the floo station and stepped out into the bright sunlight wait shouldntit be the middle of the night here no well yes it should be but we used the time adjustment fireplace see he handed her a receipt from the station then proceeded to scan the area for his truck two travelers time change fireplace she murmured reading it out loud so how does that work honestly matt said shrugging i have no idea i just accept that it does come on this way he nodded to the left and took kaykay hand as he began walking kaykay breathed deeply the air was different here she wasntsure if it was good or bad she just could tell that it was different matt was laughing what kaykay asked incredulously nothing you just look so enthralled oh stop it she said purposely bumping into him this if anything only made him laugh more hey where your truck kaykay asked suddenly when she realized that none of the cars around them looked like the red truck she d seen him driving the previous summer truck he asked raising an eyebrow i ve never owned a truck yes you have you were driving it last year when i met oh that truck matt said in one of those well why didn t you say so voices that wasntmine it was for hauling sound equipment instruments all that good stuff for garth brooks concert driving it was part of the job he let go of kaykay hand to rummage through his pocket no the car i ve always driven is this one he said gesturing to a jeep wrangler with the keys looking around surreptitiously the tapped the door handle with his wand then unlocked it with the keys seeing kaykay curious look he explained protecting a car with just a normal lock is a bit pointless when there are wizards who can unlock it with the tap of a wand it always a good idea to put a charm on the car as well i ll remember that kaykay said sliding into the passenger side the seats were warm and soft from the sun and she was feeling a thrill of excitement that she knew wasntabout to go away do you mind having the ragtop down matt asked as he got in and started the car me heck no make it as windy as you want kaykay said happily i didntget a chance to dry my hair anyhow matt grinned at her looking just as excited and flipped on the radio it was playing what else country now kaykay dontforget to breathe matt joked as they entered his father recording studio who breathing kaykay said softly matt sighed obviously not you come on and i promise it wontbe as embarrassing as last year better not be or you re dead meat kaykay muttered matt looked at her in what she recognized as a somewhat frightened manner so she immediately put on one of her best innocent smiles matt snorted as if i buying that he said kaykay immediately switched to a pout successfully breaking matt poker face he laughed putting an arm over her shoulder and drawing her next to him she smiled happily as he kissed the top of her head come on let go meet your country star as they continued walking kaykay realized that she wasntquite so nervous as she d thought she was she really didnthang out with many people who were laid back and who simply wanted to goof around and laugh okay sure harry had been great really great but he was definitely lacking in the fun ness area it wasntlike he never had fun they d shared plenty of laughs but he was usually uptight and worried about the whole an evil wizard wants to kill me thing no that really wasnta ridiculous thing to worry about but it was always there he never really cut loose well someday he ll meet the perfect uptight girl and they ll live in a perfect uptight house and they ll have perfect uptight kids and have an all around perfectly uptight life kaykay thought smiling to herself it was a funny picture matt pushed open a door and kaykay nearly froze it was garth brooks hi there matt he said shaking his hand good naturedly hi garth this is kaykay he indicated her and all she could manage to do was smile and hold out her hand for him to shake the first thought that came to her mind and it was a positively ridiculous one was wow matt was right he is just wearing a tee shirt and jeans you have to forgive me for forgetting but i know you donti at least the name is familiar oh yeah you publicly embarrassed me at your fourth of july concert last year the words popped out before kaykay could stop them and she clapped a hand to her mouth garth however simply laughed it alright i suppose it is public humiliation whether we enjoy it or not i remember now kaykay saw him notice matt hand on her shoulder and he asked matt the exact same question he d asked the year before is she your girlfriend kaykay at matt immediately looked at each other matt looked lost as if he wasntsure how he should answer so kaykay answered for him yes garth was smiling knowingly probably thinking something like ah young love or now aintthat special matt was smiling wider than kaykay could ever remember he looked like he d just won the lottery kaykay could feel herself blushing as she too grinned a recent development i take it the country star asked at this kaykay couldnthelp but laugh as she nodded a door opened and a man who bore quite a resemblance to matt walked in matt immediately led her over to him dad i d like to meet kaykay determan kaykay this is my dad matt said and his father gave her hand a friendly shake it nice to meet you well shall we get started matt tells me that your forte is country music well obviously what song would you like to record first i have nearly any backtrack you can name ummm was all kaykay managed i dontknow do have any songs from lee ann womack he grinned at me do i have any songs from lee ann womack he chuckled which one are you thinking well two actually i hope you dance and forever everyday ah first one in the file forever everyday are you ready he asked looking at me from the computer ummm may i practice once first of course here let me show you how this works he grabbed a set of headphones and motioned for kaykay to follow him into a sound room with fancy microphones a wooden floor and lots of wiring you just put on the headphones stand right here not too close to the mike now and sing it as simple as that just dontlet the harmony confuse you oh i won t trust me she smiled mr siempre nodded then left the room closing the door behind him he matt and garth popped back into vision in what must have been the sound booth matt gave her two thumbs up and the song introduction began to play in the headphones kaykay was horribly nervous while she waited to come in but as she began singing she felt her anxiety ebb away until she felt just like she would singing along with the radio she loved this song especially the chorus remember waiting all year for december thought god was cryin when it rained and that the stars were fireflies dreams were real and big as life it was forever everyday she was smiling when she finished the song she looked at the booth and matt was smiling too his dad and garth were talking she jumped when she heard mr siempre voice before realizing he was speaking over an intercom i know you wanted to do a practice run but if you dontmind my opinion and i ve been doing this for quite a while now we should probably just stick with that one are you ready for another kaykay nodded and then proceeded to sing i hope you dance one day closer to you carolyn dawn johnson and wild angels martina mcbride it was then that she asked matt to join her in singing one please please please pleeease she begged but it your gift so then the other part of my gift can be that you sing on it too kaykay insisted i dontthink she going to give up until you sing with her garth brooks advised matt oh okay what song well do you know a bad goodbye kaykay asked with clint black and wynonna who doesn t he asked grabbing a headset for himself and heading into the room one duet coming right up mr siempre said over the intercom as matt switched on another microphone kaykay had never sung a duet before and she was somewhat surprised at how well it went halfway through she looked through the glass window to the sound room and noticed something odd garth brooks was talking animatedly to mr siempre who nodded garth responded by pulling out a cellular phone and dialing a number quickly and talking to someone he was still talking when the song ended when the question what next came over the intercom kaykay responded quickly with the dance but that isnta duet matt said of course not that why i wontbe singing kaykay said turning off her microphone and sitting on a stool but oh please it my favoritest song kaykay said in a childlike voice matt chuckled then nodded alright but only because it for you matt said giving his dad the thumbs up kaykay listened on her own headset as he sang the song by garth brooks that she loved so much the man himself looked up again and smiled before going back to his telephone conversation he was getting off of the phone just as the song was ending rather than coming over the intercom he walked around and came into the room matt kaykay do you know the song squeeze me in he asked both of them nodded the one that you and trisha yearwood sang of course kaykay added would you two be kind enough to sing it matt and kaykay exchanged a confused look but agreed all the same okay sure garth smiled gave them a nod then went back to the sound booth what was that about kaykay mouthed to matt no idea he mouthed back just then the introduction came on and kaykay hurried to turn on her microphone it was a bit hard to concentrate when she was thinking what going on but she managed well enough garth motioned them to come out and mr siempre disappeared to his computer dad matt asked him cautiously what going on can you hold that question for just a moment in the meantime i need you to find my photo equipment then go to the costume closet and find something for yourself and kaykay kaykay and matt exchanged another look but nonetheless went to do as instructed why on earth do we need to be in costume kaykay asked as matt led her down a hall with doors that said things such as janitor closet office supplies and boiler room i really not sure he admitted perhaps he wants to make a nice cd jacket for you i mean that the only logical thing isntit i suppose kaykay agreed as he came to a door that said photo and lighting and unlocked it i dontthink he wants anything fancy probably just a 35 millimeter camera and a tripod matt said to himself looking through a shelf he finally selected a large red bag grabbed a tripod and switched off the light on to costumes kaykay asked taking the tripod from him yep just this way matt said leading her further down the hall the room they needed wasntlocked this time but it was big it like a personal shopping mall kaykay exclaimed looking at all the racks of clothing matt laughed and directed her to a point halfway through the room you ll need something from this area nothing fancy i d say there a bathroom just across the hall where you can change aye aye cap n she said saluting he returned the gesture then turned and went to a different area presumably to get his own clothing kaykay turned and began to wander through the racks humming to herself as she flipped through decidedly western clothing some of it was definitely a bit over the top like leather chaps and boots with spurs but some other things werenttoo bad finally kaykay grabbed some simple blue jeans a denim jacket to match and a loose cottony white blouse on her way out she grabbed a brown pair of cowgirl boots that looked like they d be about the right size i cantbelieve i actually met garth brooks she thought to herself as she entered the bathroom and latched a stall door behind her this is just too unbelievably cool changing was made a bit difficult because of the small space but she managed well enough when she came out and looked in the mirror she thought she d done a pretty good job the shade of the jacket exactly matched the jeans and the billowy ends of the blouse sleeves just poked out past the jacket cuffs all in all she looked pretty good now if only the boots fit kaykay wrestled with them for a while but they were simply too small odd really they were her size she shrugged it off and walked back out across the hall and into the room barefoot returning the boots to their shelf and beginning her search for some in a size larger she couldntfind any on the lower shelves of the rack but she saw some just out of her reach that looked about right well what would anyone else have done she placed her foot on the first shelf and pulled herself up starting to climb well alright most people would ve found a chair but that was for people who were unoriginal finally reaching the shelf with no problems kaykay grabbed the boots with a triumphant gotcha from below matt replied why yes it seems that you do oh matt she said climbing down as quickly as she could and turning to face him i um i just had to dontworry about it it no problem but there is a stepladder right next to it for that specific purpose oh kaykay not for the first time in her life or even that day felt very foolish well now i know i guess she pulled the boots on well at least that was a good thing perfect fit weird she said to herself looking from her feet to the original pair of boots they were the same size and yet oh wait she thought feeling dumb i sure hope i didnt she checked the bottom of the boots oh yes she did memo to self when looking at shoes make sure the 9 isntactually an upside down 6 she rolled her eyes at herself then looked back to matt well shall we hey she finally took note of his attire great outfit matt did a complimentary twirl his clothing was simple but still country ish blue jeans a western style plaid shirt again blue and a brown cowboy hat that matched his boots and you look quite lovely yourself if i may say so matt replied sweeping his hat off as he bowed low kaykay giggled that right giggled she couldntbelieve herself either and tapped him on the shoulder we d better be getting back she said to which he nodded they picked up the camera equipment and began the short walk to the recording studio perfect mr siempre said as soon as he saw them i couldnthave picked better outfits myself now mr brooks kaykay found it hard to think of garth as mister brooks has something he wants to talk to you about i ll go set up the photo equipment matt kaykay let me say first of all that the two of you have a tremendous amount of talent you could prove to be very successful in the music industry he paused as if waiting for verification so kaykay gave it well i do love singing but actually i planning on becoming an aur ouch i mean joining law enforcement you know police force swat team fbi that sort of thing she looked at matt and rubbed her foot where he d stepped on it he looked at her apologetically before replying himself and i going into law lots of schooling yes but well it always fascinated me a pity garth said but that a bit beside the point at the moment i talking to you because i was so impressed with your vocal skills that i well i got on the phone and talked to trisha and mr siempre sent her the song via computer and she has agreed to what i want to do and what is that kaykay asked slowly anticipation mounting inside of her well we were planning on only if the two of you approve of course adding your version of squeeze me in as a bonus track to the end of the album we ll be releasing in a little less than a month kaykay wanted to start jumping up and down and hug everything that breathed but for some reason she asked instead a month that seems like awfully short notice are you really able to do it in time with today technology you bet still we d appreciate being able to put in a few pictures of you two i sorry that they wontbe anything fancy but i sure that they ll look nice enough there was a long moment of silence then kaykay said slowly we re going to be on a cd she turned to matt and grabbed him by the shoulders we are going to be on a cd she gave a squeal of excitement and hugged him happily before turning and giving garth brooks a hug oh thank you thank you thank you she exclaimed he chuckled i ll take that as a yes then that is of course if you agree matt kaykay froze and turned to look at matt she knew he wasntvery fond of singing when it was a public ordeal and he still hadntmade a move or said a word please matt please she asked slowly this is i mean i ve always dreamed oh please he stared at her for a long time and kaykay was certain he was going to say no when his face suddenly cracked into a huge grin and he said we re going to be on a cd kaykay flew into his arms hugging him happily and laughing of course he did the thing where he spun her around making her laugh even harder the rest of the day passed quickly the photo shoot was if possible even more fun mr siempre wanted a few shots of them looking natural as if they were singing but then garth asked for a few fun ones kaykay and matt had looked at each other in deliberation for a few moments before matt quite suddenly plunked his hat onto her head and scooped her up in his arms spinning her around as she clung to his neck for dear life and everyone laughed they also got a few more fun pictures which included one of kaykay getting a piggyback ride from matt one of both of them leaning back to back lazily and then a few pictures of them having a water fight using a metal bucket and a hose guess which of all the types of pictures was taken outdoors the day of fun came to a close with signed contracts quite a few free cds dinner with matt as a fast food restaurant then the quick floo trip back to england again using the time adjustment floo it ended with a goodnight kiss a smile and dreams of the crazy fun kaykay had experienced being with matt was a little fast paced yes a little crazy but a bit of craziness now and then was fun little hula girls on the shot glass all we need a little salt and lime we can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend that we re livin on key west time i can run to the store an get some charcoal buy a tikki torch an fire up the

eight if it aintgot that swing good so it settled then kaykay will remain a beater and dawn will move to the position of chaser ron said looking around at the gryffindor quidditch team after practice thursday evening everyone nodded their agreement and then got up from the benches to go change out of their practice robes well i glad that all sorted out kaykay said to harry and ron as they headed up to the school ten minutes later yeah dawn is a good chaser especially with jesse and andrew ron agreed and you have such an uncontrollable temper you re perfect at bashing bludgers towards the other team harry said with a smirk earning him a shove from kaykay they were just entering the main door when dumbledore reached the foot of the staircase harry kaykay perfect timing i d like to speak to you in my office if you have a moment harry and kaykay shared a puzzled look then broke away from ron and followed the headmaster back up the staircase and to the stone gargoyle blocking the entrance to his office sugar quill he said making the gargoyle leap aside and open the way to the rotating stairway sit down please dumbledore said indicating the two chairs in front of his desk and sitting down himself behind it studying them over his half moon spectacles they shared another confused look then sank into the chairs looking back at dumbledore now i am certain that you both recall our attempts at exploring how to use your powers last year he said without preamble and obviously we didntmake much progress harry and kaykay nodded remembering some of their sorry attempts to harness their inherited powers well dumbledore continued i spent quite some time searching this summer and i think i ve finally found something to help what kaykay asked unable to contain her curiosity any longer the ancient headmaster smiled lightly then turned in his chair to take something off of the bookshelf behind his desk when he turned back around and set it at the far edge of the desk near kaykay and harry they both leaned in to take a closer look it was a book or it at least seemed like one it could ve been something else she supposed it looked quite old it had a leather bound cover and as she saw when harry took it gingerly in his hands and flipped through it contained thick yellowed paper elegant spider like writing covered the pages what is it kaykay asked looking away from the book at dumbledore the journal of godric gryffindor he said a grin playing on his lips it is my hope that with this the two of you will be able to look at your powers from the point of view of someone who has them completely not split he sat back in his chair i d like both of you to read it i aware that you re busy with the start of term and quidditch but i d like to see the both of you again in a couple of weeks perhaps by then you ll be better prepared to work on your magic this was quite obviously his dismissal kaykay stood and harry followed a few seconds later we will professor dumbledore thanks he nodded once in reply and the two teenagers left the office well i suppose one of us should have the journal for one week and the other should have it the second we can both finish it by then dontyou think harry she got no reply looking over her shoulder she saw harry following at a more leisurely pace his firebolt in one hand and the open journal in the other his eyes glued to the pages kaykay sighed well that solves the problem of who gets it first she said to no one in particular she pulled back a tapestry and took a shortcut to gryffindor tower harry wasntbehind her she assumed that he was heading up to the dormitory on autopilot letting his feet guide him she wondered if he d forget about the vanishing step kaykay walked into the great hall a bit late but thankfully not too late to get breakfast before it was time for lessons morning all she said dropping her bookbag and sitting down on the bench there were a few greetings in return except for from harry who was preoccupied with the mail kaykay grabbed a piece of toast and poured herself some apple juice before helping herself to some fresh fruit however she quite suddenly stopped something was not right she looked back up and across the table from her madison raised an eyebrow at her as if in challenge what are you doing here kaykay blurted out true madison did oftentimes sit near them or partner with her in classes but never before had she eaten at gryffindor table the other slytherins are getting to be a bit too much y know they re on my case constantly about hanging around you guys so i decided that today i d eat with people who didntjudge others by where the sorting hat placed them however she continued looking pointedly down the table i guess that it true with both houses several gryffindors who d been staring at madison quickly looked away and continued with their breakfast madison glared at them for a moment even though they didntsee then looked back at kaykay and smiled before taking another bite of cereal oh okay kaykay said slowly beside her harry sighed in irritation and kaykay looked over at him quickly wondering why on earth he was annoyed to have madison at their table but it seemed that harry was angered not by their slytherin friend but by the daily prophet his knuckles were quite white where he dripped it by the edges and after a few more moments in which he seemed to become even more irritated he folded it together abruptly and threw it down on the table in a messy pile kaykay having seen this happen several times since she d begun living in the same home as harry and even more frequently since school started didnteven have to ask she knew that whatever he d read had to do with voldemort per usual it was the same reason that she d quit reading the daily prophet herself hearing in detail the horrors that voldemort had inflicted was enough to make any decent person blood boil kaykay being a generally the glass is half full person hated starting the day off with a pessimistic article still no matter how great her dread it didntquell her curiosity harry she asked tentatively as he took a drink from his glass of orange juice what he snapped slamming the glass down and making her jump at least three inches off of her seat not to mention several people looked at them again until madison thinking they were staring at her gave them a death glare he propped his elbow on the table and rested his head in his hand sorry he sighed i didntmean to yell he rubbed his face with the hand then raised his head back up now what it that bad kaykay asked quietly another sigh yeah he heading north you know every attack is closer than the last you dontthink he making his way here do you hermione asked in a hushed tone i dontknow i wouldnthave thought so but he trailed off looking at his watch we should head to class care of magical creatures this morning harry turned to kaykay as they got up oh and here i finished it last night he was holding out godric journal thanks she said slipping it into her bag right on time too i try he said with a grin so the group headed to class none of them so much as glancing back at the daily prophet marked 20th september that lay in a jumbled mess on the table reaching the area near hagrid hut harry noticed that there was no sign of the fizzlepinks monkeylike creatures that acted as traveling guides to magical folk that they d been studying so far instead there was a wooden crate on the lawn that quivered occasionally and emitted small squeaks harry looked at it apprehensively not sure whether or not he wished to know what it contained you dontthink it another blast ended skrewt do you ron said in a hushed tone no hagrid wouldnttry that again hermione said however she didntsound very confident just about then hagrid appeared near the front of the cluster of students all righ there he asked loudly ending the chatter as yeh can see we re done with the fizzlepinks thought yeh d had enough time with em we ave a new creature today he clapped his hands together appearing quite excited as he picked up a crowbar from on top of the crate arrived just this mornin he said happily of course the others won arrive til later this week but we can talk some abou them before yeh haf ter take care of yer own hagrid enthusiasm didntreassure harry in the slightest he tended to take great pleasure in what any other person would call a life threatening creature hagrid had turned and was prying the door of the box off with a sharp crack it fell open and the creature bounced out harry at first thought it was a piece of very fluffy cloud but a closer look proved it to be a rather round animal with fuzzy white fur large blue eyes and a mouth that looked like a tiny platypus bill can everyone see hagrid asked all righ this is a meteosnill beside harry hermione made a small noise that could ve meant that this was something either good or bad aw it so cute pavarti squealed leaning over a bit to see better she and lavender both leapt back with a shriek however when the animal bounced in their direction and made a small sneezing noise that resulted in a bolt of lighting being shot at the ground right by their feet the rest of the class jerked back a few inches caught off guard by this new development don get too close hagrid exclaimed sounding a bit worried by the close call meteosnill are weather creatures normally float up in the sky see how he got no feet they blend right in with the clouds can mimic nearly any kind of weather they can if they re provoked snow hail lightnin wind yeh name it a big herd of em is even more dangerous they can make cyclones and hurricanes kaykay raised a hand er hagrid what exactly would you define as provoked anythin that frightens em annoys em takes em by surprise why kaykay didntreply but shifted back a bit stepping on harry toes sorry she whispered still watching the meteosnill carefully dontworry about it he joked quietly i still have the other foot hagrid had resumed talking can anyone tell me somethin else bout meteosnills hermione was unsurprisingly the first to reply they ve been linked to many malfunctions and crashes of muggle aircraft oftentimes the cause for the crash is never uncovered by muggle investigators or a wizard posing as an investigator will say that it was something else such as a mechanical failure good hermione five points fer gryffindor now can someone tell me another thing he insane kaykay exclaimed angrily wringing her hair out honestly a creature like that hey at least you werenthere for the blast ended skrewts ron said that what you d call a monster but really kaykay insisted looking back at them over her shoulder as she heaved open the front door an animal that can shoot lightning hail rain sleet snow and create hurricanes and tornadoes her shoes made a slight squelching sound on the flagstones and water dripped from her robes at least from what was left of them well honestly kaykay hagrid said not to provoke them hermione said sounding disapproving kaykay stopped and turned all the way around staring at hermione incredulously all i did was sneeze hermione simply stared back with an expression usually reserved for ron ron on his part was trying not to laugh as was harry madison wasntso reserved she chuckled at kaykay who glanced at her sighed then kept walking why is it always me kaykay wondered aloud because you re just so easy to pick on madison said in a tone commonly used for small children kaykay heaved another sigh this one sounding irritated i going up to change she announced turning down an adjacent hall harry really couldntblame her as she d already stated she d sneezed and the meteosnill being either germaphobic or startled had promptly blasted her with a barrage of rain and sleet then ignited the hem of her robes with a bolt of lightning not too unusual of an occurrence knowing the common genre of hagrid classes still it was good that ron was close enough to put out the flames with water from his wand as hagrid ushered the creature back into its cage of course what would hogwarts be without crazy life threatening situations ron commented sarcastically watching kaykay wearily climb a staircase harry snorted yeah she breaking tradition though not going to the hospital wing do you two realize that hagrid hasnthad a single lesson in which someone has had to go to see madame pomfrey so far this year give him some credit hermione said looking impatiently at ron and harry so that either means that we re getting better harry said slowly or that hagrid losing his touch ron finished feigning awe hermione looked quite frustrated with the both of them but madison was laughing hermione gave one final honestly and broke away from the small group walking ahead to gryffindor table in a huff what gotten into her lately ron asked staring after their friend no idea harry said shaking his head it like she digressing back to how she was in second or third year madison snorted and rolled her eyes muttering something about boys being so stupid sometimes then she continued forward and sat by hermione ron and harry looked at one another shrugged and joined the girls by the time kaykay showed up her robes fresh and clean but her hair still drenched she only had time to grab a roll to eat on the way to their next class this led ron to give her a speech about having a good dinner since they d be having a rough quidditch practice that night oh goodie kaykay muttered sarcastically only loud enough for harry to hear as ron finally left her alone and mcgonagall began the day lesson and upon this i reflected for hitherto none had dared attempt plunging into the far realms of death as tis a most incurable source of fears and innate awe and should i thus defy these truths in the name of my personage alas tis a cold fearful thing shrouded in veils and clouded with the transcendence of a thousand thousand eons then who be i to infringe upon this cloak of ostracized mortality who would guarantee that i would not too join the extinct certainly the horrors of the realm thralks and nikovs manduloomis and groads would not vindicate my intrusion and yet the multitudes of benefits if i succeed are as immeasurable as the sands of the beach or the stars of the sky boo aurgh kaykay jumped at least three inches off of the couch dropping gryffindor journal as she patted her chest with her hand trying to settle her racing heart she turned moodily to see whom it was that had whispered in her ear harry she scolded dont do that are you trying to give me a heart attack or something for the past three pages gryffindor had been describing the horrifying creatures that plagued the realm of the dead and the world of the living and being all alone in the gryffindor common room while everyone else was at dinner made it easy to get lost in the world he d depicted harry was grinning mischievously how he d managed to get through the portrait hole and sit down right next to her on the couch without her noticing was a mystery to kaykay what did i scare you harry asked attempting and failing to sound innocent ya think kaykay asked before sighing and closing her eyes will that be all or did you come here to actually tell me something yeah we meet with dumbledore tonight remember we should head down there soon he said finally acting serious oh right kaykay said quickly she d nearly forgotten harry pushed himself off of the couch let go he said offering kaykay a hand up i can stand fine thanks but if you see my nervous system floating around here somewhere please let me know she was just starting to get fully calmed harry laughed shoving his hands into his pockets as the left the common room i ll keep an eye out he promised they walked in silence for a few minutes until kaykay felt a need to say something anything to fill the gap so what happens after the passage i was reading it didntseem like there was much left there isn t harry said looking at her in what could have been described as surprise that she didntknow the answer already but he finishes the passage by deciding to go despite the dangers that where it ends oh kaykay said quietly a bit awed and somewhat fearful despite herself so did he i dontknow harry said quickly looking a bit uncomfortable at the idea himself i hope we donthave to find out ourselves they both shuddered involuntarily shaking such concepts from their heads but kaykay said breaking the icy tension and making harry look at her in surprise if we are capable of necromancy she let the statement go unfinished as they both looked at each other conceiving what this could mean necromancy was the darkest of arts in both life and fable however thus far it proved to be only of fable because after all no spell could awaken the dead they didntreally do much at their meeting with dumbledore kaykay and harry had discussed the book with dumbledore asking for clarification in some places but mostly just bouncing ideas off of each other in fact it seemed to kaykay that she and harry would ve gotten as much if not more done without the headmaster assistance this puzzled her and it played close to the front of her mind as she scribbled out her charms homework paying little attention to what she wrote it was only after realizing she d written the bobblehead charms is useful in in many stipulations that she yanked her mind away from the mucky thoughts that plagued it after rewriting the sentence the bubble head charm is useful in many situations and finishing up the essay kaykay looked at her watch then put all of her books away and headed up for her dormitory thank goodness it was a friday she would definitely appreciate being able to sleep in again this was doubly good since it took a very long time for sleep to claim her with the end of homework came the return of her confusing thoughts what she had the most questions about was this realm of death gryffindor was talking about was it a physical place or a place of spirit after life ended was there just the one dark dreary and dangerous but most of all what had happened to gryffindor had he actually gone into death or was the entire passage a series of metaphors as she wouldntdoubt neither she nor harry had so much as hinted at this in their discussion with dumbledore it seemed as though they d reached a mutual agreement not to bring it up without even having to speak to each other kaykay had no idea why but withholding the knowledge seemed like the proper thing to do somewhere amidst her pondering kaykay drifted away from thoughts and towards dreams they were not pleasant she was walking through the forbidden forest on the darkest of dark nights all the while the area around her becoming denser the air feeling heavier there were rustlings around her every now and then and she d turn suddenly only to find that she could see nothing the temperature was dropping rapidly the wind merciless and cruel was whipping around her silently yanking at her clothing with invisible claws she sensed a gaze on her she looked quickly to the left and right not certain whether the gleam of red she saw was real or not there was a conspicuous creak from behind her and she whipped around quickly kaykay sat up straight with an inaudible gasp as her stomach gave the lurch of one falling headlong down a staircase breathing hard she surveyed the dormitory all of the other girls were in place sleeping soundly but something felt amiss unlike all of the other sensations in her dream the one of being watched hadntgone away it was then that she noticed that the door was ajar harry she said in a whisper harry is that you there wasnta reply for a few moments then the air at the foot of kaykay bed rippled and harry seeming out of thin air appeared holding a silvery cloak his invisibility cloak you used to be such a deep sleeper he said as if that explained his presence not since remus you know she said quietly what are you doing here anyhow i hungry he said simply kaykay blinked at him and this is relevant because it no fun to sneak out of the tower alone and waking ron is harder the waking the living dead why would you want to wake the living dead kaykay asked incredulously shivering as the remnants of her dream still hung about her harry shrugged so how about it he asked what about hermione kaykay replied she looked at harry seriously for a moment before they both broke into silent laughter yeah right now that she head girl harry laughed come on you skipped dinner tonight and i know you dontturn down ice cream kaykay barely had a moment longer to think before her stomach growled as if agreeing on her behalf oh fine count me in she said tossing aside her covers she shivered a moment as the cold air wrapped around her seeping right through her tee shirt and pajama pants not to mention her bare feet only a few moments later however harry was throwing the still warm cloak over them and they were descending the stairs awkwardly you know this was a lot easier when i was in first year harry said as they both crouched trying desperately to avoid having any part of them poke out hey you re the one who insisted on having a friend come with potter kaykay said as they stumbled out of the portrait hole i could ve just said forget it it three in the morning nah you wouldnthave you never could say no to chocolate or to sweets in general that blackmail that strategy he corrected i used your weaknesses to my advantage turning them into my strengths like i said blackmail kaykay insisted stubbornly as they ducked behind a tapestry that would get them to the kitchens faster call it what you want i still won kaykay rammed her shoulder against his making him stumble sideways and halfway out from under the cloak bumping her back he hastily readjusted the cloak you re lucky we re in a passage and not the halls he told her grinning nonetheless correction you re lucky we re in a passage and not the halls she replied as they emerged at the other end of the shortcut and crossed the empty hall to the picture with the bowl of fruit harry tickled it and when it had changed into a handle pulled it open silently the floor was strewn with house elves all of them sleeping soundly under miniature blankets harry and kaykay had to step carefully to avoid stepping on one of them luckily though they d taken the invisibility cloak off harry went one way presumably to find cake pie or cookies and kaykay headed straight for the refrigerator only a few minutes later they were both seated on stools at the counter now see harry said handing a cookie to kaykay and stealing a bite of her ice cream isntthis a lot more fun than sleeping she considered a moment dipping her cookie in her milk glass thoughtfully yes she admitted finally i was joking harry said giving her a surprised look i wasn t kaykay replied seriously before taking a bite of the soggy cookie harry didntappear to know what to say so kaykay explained it just that i cantstop thinking about death he laughed what you planning on dying sometime soon he was grinning but the smile didntquite meet his eyes not death the thing death the place kaykay explained oh dont you ever think about it she asked him honestly after reading that book yeah i do he confided stealing another bite of ice cream kaykay hit his spoon away with her own he only grinned mischievously at her and popped the spoon into his mouth i actually had nightmares about it a few times he added swallowing the mouthful of ice cream he d still managed to steal yeah me too kaykay gave an involuntary shudder i was dreaming about it when you sneaked into the room speaking of that how d you know it was me harry asked kaykay shrugged who else all the girls were asleep and none of the boys would dare to come in there except me yes except poor little you with no friends to sneak down to the kitchens with kaykay laughed harry gave a dramatic sigh and pouted indeed woe is me hey kaykay hit him in the shoulder with the back of her hand you still have me harry looked over at her yes kaykay he said seriously i still have you they finished up their midnight snacks at last then shuffled their way back up to gryffindor tower under the invisibility cloak harry had boundless energy and kaykay didntseem to have any immediate desire to return to her nightmare so they sat up in the common room talking harry in the armchair and kaykay on the couch no really if you knew you were going to die tomorrow what would you do harry is there something you re not telling me kaykay asked suspiciously propping herself up on her elbow hey it just a question if i hear any plotting of your assassination i ll let you know harry promised with a grin shifting a bit to make his sprawled position in the chair more comfortable come on kaykay looked pensive for a moment the dancing fire reflected in her eyes as she stared into it biting her lip finally she replied slowly i i suppose i d try to find my old house not my cousin s but the one i grew up in i d see if the family there now knew that there was a way to the attic and i d go up and try to find our old things that we always kept there as kaykay spoke she seemed to be no longer staring at the fire but through it the flickering flames cast jumpy shadows around the edges of the room but she was bathed in a hungered reddish glow that animated her every word even as her voice grew more wistful and i d go to escondito again for a visit i d catch up with megan again and meet her new parents she sighed i d take one more run as a wolf i d have one last snowball fight even if i had to conjure the snow myself and she faltered for a moment still staring past the fire but looking a bit puzzled i d relax really relax for the first time in years her gaze suddenly snapped to harry the intensity and regret in her eyes nearly made him jump but when her recovered and tried to see if in fact that was what her eyes did hold they were masked one again by the fire dontyou feel that way too she asked him again he tried to decode her feelings by the sound of her voice but it too was concealed very level that how it become even when we are having fun or someplace that we think is safe or even sleeping part of us is still awake still sober still keeping a lookout for the next trial we ll have to face before harry could begin to digest this kaykay was again staring into the fire only when we die or know we ll die will we be free this last statement struck harry and he tried to find a proper response he hadntmeant for his question to leave them depressed and i suppose i d dance one more dance sing one more song kaykay continued suddenly her voice sounding far more light her head was tilted ever so slightly and the flames no longer danced in her eyes she turned again to look at harry a small grin on her face what about you i not sure he admitted probably some of the things i missed out on parts of being a kid like playing kickball going on family vacations that kind of thing you d have time for a family vacation in one day kaykay joked okay we ll say that this is a if you ll die in a few days question harry rolled his eyes then added mischievously and i d pull a real prank on the slytherins hear hear kaykay said raising an imaginary glass in approval okay now i get to ask a question hmmm she tapped a finger on her lips looking thoughtful suddenly she smiled what the craziest dream you ve ever had harry thought for a moment the craziest dream he d had recently was the one he d had at the beginning of the school year okay he said sitting forward in his chair a bit this is going to sound a bit crazy that the point kaykay interrupted looking quite eager harry almost laughed at the expression of anticipation on her face alright but you cantlaugh i dreamt once that you madison matt brian er professor kingstaff and these two random girls and i all went swimming it was at some weird tropical place with a tikki bar and disco lights what so weird about that kaykay asked i mean yeah it a bit odd but she looked at him shrewdly what arentyou telling me nothing she raised an eyebrow at him okay okay in my dream i was gay kaykay stared at harry for a long silent moment then collapsed in a fit of laughter rolling over onto her back on the couch and giggling at the ceiling hey it not funny harry protested feeling irked at her reaction yes it is she insisted rolling back to her stomach and grinning at harry her hair falling into her face as she shook with suppressed laughter come on tell me honestly that it isntfunny well harry tried and failed to keep a smile off of his lips i suppose so i personally would ve loved to have been there to see it for myself kaykay said tucking a lock of hair behind her ear her eyes were glimmering with amusement and a smile was stretched across her face harry found himself laughing too for no reason at all which of course got kaykay going again when they d finally calmed down and kaykay was wiping tears of merriment from the corners of her eyes harry said okay now it your turn and it better be good okay this is a fun one i had it a bit after we ah had that fight last spring you mean after i broke up with you kaykay looked at him seeming slightly taken aback at his sincerity you can say it i know i was a jerk well yeah she admitted anyhow i actually dreamt that i was out playing quidditch except everyone had different positions and matt was wearing a cowboy hat and riding a hobbyhorse she added looking slightly confused at her own dream she shook her head and i was chaser and when i asked them if you d be annoyed that ginny took your position they were all saying stuff like harry who harry and then she continued i got a foul because the snitch flew under my knee and i didnthit it with the quaffle harry snorted and kaykay grinned sheepishly shrugging the movement was interrupted by a wide yawn as she grabbed a pillow and propped her chin on her hand it was then that harry realized that he wasntnearly as awake as he had been a few hours ago so it was as the earliest rays of sunlight filtered through the windows that the pair fell asleep harry sprawled out in the chair and kaykay nestled comfortably on the couch serpensortia harry waved his wand with a crack and a snake shot out of the end he immediately began giving it instructions his voice hissing quietly as if someone would overhear them kaykay was slightly taken aback at this new development but no matter she d come up with something lamnivigra she shouted making a sword blade sprout from her wand the advancing snake was gone with a single slash hissing angrily before bursting into smoke now harry looked like the startled one but to kaykay disappointment he recovered quickly making his wand into a sword too the moment their swords clashed together everyone else in the class paused from their own wizard duels to watch give it up potter kaykay said with a grin easily blocking a blow from harry and retaliating you know i better than you he had to hastily duck to avoid a rather nasty swipe but he used it to his advantage dodging around and swinging his leg so quickly that kaykay didntrealize she d been tripped until she was on her back she gave a cry of surprise and lifted her sword quickly bracing the tip with her hand to block a downward blow from harry not fair she protested kicking him sharply in the knee he stumbled you think an opponent will play fair constant vigilance he taunted and she rolled over and pushed herself up she was just turning to get him again when the bell signaling the end of lessons rang kaykay sighed it looks like i ll have to beat you another time harry verusformo she added waving her sword slightly as it changed back into a wand well seems we attracted an audience harry laughed making kaykay look up she nearly jumped nearly everyone still in the room was staring at them professor kingstaff cleared his throat i do believe that that was the bell he said in a tone that made it obvious that he was telling the students to leave the noise in the room immediately doubled as students began talking to each other as they gathered their things many of them throwing frequent glances in kaykay or harry direction where d you learn to do that madison asked as they left the room over summer holiday harry said shrugging modestly i loads better than him kaykay commented candidly tucking her wand into her robe pocket yeah but i can wallop you in hand to hand combat he retorted well huzzah for you then i starving i wonder what for dinner ron said as they approached the great hall ugh this bag is killing me madison commented hitching it up higher on her shoulder how much homework do they think we need just because it a friday kaykay began to nod then stopped suddenly oh no she groaned i left my bag in the classroom do you want one of us to go back up there with you hermione asked no no she sighed you guys go on to dinner i ll catch up in a few minutes dontforget it a friday quidditch tonight ron said kaykay nodded then broke away from the group glancing back over her shoulder once before running back up to the defense against the dark arts classroom when she tested the doorknob she expected it to be locked like most doors outside of classes she was rather surprised then as it swung open easily at her touch but not as surprised as she would be in a few moments the room was not as she d previously thought unoccupied professor kingstaff was still inside at his chair however his back was to the door he had his feet propped up on a cabinet and he was correcting what kaykay assumed was a student essay he was nodding his head and tapping his red pen against the paper to the beat of the upbeat swing music coming from the radio next to him kaykay hesitated why wasnthe at dinner like all of the other professors maybe i should just leave now she thought he probably hasntnoticed me she thought however before she could even move professor kingstaff lowered his legs and spun the chair around setting the scored essay onto his desk he d just grabbed another when he glanced up and gave a small jump as he saw her i i sorry kaykay said quickly i didntmean to interrupt professor brian started to glance over his shoulder who oh that right me sort of he grinned sheepishly and set the essay back down the corner of kaykay mouth twitched trying to leap in a respondent smile why are you up here anyhow he asked curiously why arentyou at dinner i ah she walked closer and grabbed her bag from under her usual seat i forgot my bag professor ugh please dontcall me professor it makes me feel all old and stuffy a few months ago i was brian he grinned again and this time kaykay let herself return the expression i like your necklace he said significantly nodding at the crystal pendant she was wearing kaykay hand instinctively flew up to touch it maybe even to hide it she d been so careful about tucking it inside her shirt during class it must have come out during the duel however she found herself responding without the hesitation she would ve expected thanks i actually didntget a chance to open it until the train here but i really like it thank you i hoped you would he said suddenly he didntseem like her professor but like the friend she d known the year prior he must have thought the same thing too because an awkward silence settled on them so kaykay said finally why arent you at dinner brian looked down at the papers on his desk and took plenty of time before answering it just too strange sitting up there next to my teachers looking down at my classmates that why i haventbeen at a lot of the meals brian they re not your teachers anymore just like they arentyour classmates they re your colleagues and students kaykay said setting her bag back down and stepping onto the podium so she and brian would be eye to eye i know but you understand right he asked well yeah kaykay said i suppose brian sighed then walked out from behind his desk he pushed the chair in a little too hard and the radio perched precariously upon a stack of books toppled off kaykay lunged forward and caught it automatically thanks brian said holding out his hands was he blushing no problem kaykay handed it off then self consciously wiped her hands on her robes i didntknow you specialized in other music besides disco at this he grinned me i love this kind of music my cousin actually taught me some swing dancing and i have to take back what i said last spring disco isntthe most fun dance style ever known this is kaykay laughed at his enthusiasm then laughed harder as he tried to demonstrate some swing steps he finally gave up laughing along with her it easier with a partner he said shrugging sorry kaykay replied with a grin i canthelp you there i ve never learned how to swing dance brian gasped dramatically with an expression of mock horror never kaykay shook her head never do you want to learn his face was so full of boyish expectancy and it did sound like fun sure why not kaykay replied with a grin okay brian said you take my hand that right and put your left arm on my shoulder step right left back front like that rock a bit brian guided her through the first few steps then sped it up so it was in time with the music good now you lift your arms up and around and spin good you re a natural oh please stop i flattered really dontmake me blush kaykay deadpanned in a girlish tone making both of them laugh she began to get the hang of it soon brian didnthave to explain most steps but she simply responded to a nudge of his hand or his shifted weight okay now here you want to go all the way out brian said as they reached the end of the song they stood side by side arms stretched out to their full length now spin in she did and he dipped her quite low actually it was at that moment that the classroom door opened what on earth is going on kaykay caught a brief glimpse of madison from an upside down perspective before brian hastily brought her back to her feet and whirled around prepared to speak up in their defense when he saw that it was madison he visibly relaxed excuse me professor brian became rigid again and kaykay nearly recoiled at the cold emphasis madison put on the name but ron asked me to find kaykay before she was late for quidditch practice she threw a look at kaykay who humbly but quickly grabbed her bag and swung it onto her shoulder she left without saying a word or glancing back when the classroom door was shut behind them madison immediately rounded on kaykay what wrong with you what do you think you re doing kaykay didntanswer she walked purposefully keeping her gaze focused straight ahead really do you have any idea how much trouble you would ve been in if it had been mcgonagall who walked into that classroom or snape madison continued accio firebolt kaykay said as if madison werenteven speaking kaykay you cantjust ignore me her cousin chastised i serious just because you re in seventh year doesntmean you can toss away the rulebook you need to snap some sense into that head of yours because if something like that happens again oh what do you care kaykay snapped turning her head sharply to look madison in the eye dancing isntexactly living on the edge he your professor madison exclaimed he my friend kaykay corrected you donttake any of this seriously do you dontyou understand what that looks like what that is people have been sent to prison for student teacher relations like that it happening all the time with muggles i not a muggle so that doesntmake the two of you less vulnerable to the law kaykay grabbed her firebolt as it flew up next to her we were just dancing and besides that madison plowed on as they walked down the grassy slope towards the quidditch pitch you have a boyfriend so what kaykay demanded angrily stopping and whirling around to face her cousin madison looked surprised to say the least so what so what kaykay what gotten into you dancing with a friend doesntmake me a bad girlfriend i not talking about the dance i talking about the principle of the thing madison why dontyou meddle in someone else life and stop making mine a soap opera kaykay snapped just let me be normal for once will you without waiting for madison response kaykay jumped onto her broom and kicked off flying the rest of the way down to the pitch when she reached the locker room she slammed the door shut behind her and didntworry about suppressing her anger as she banged around the lockers pulling out her practice uniform no comments were made by the team save for a questioning look from harry when kaykay finally sat down on the bench fuming after all as ron always said an angry beater is a dangerous one and that just what we need i ve wined and dined on mulligan stew and never wished for turkey i ve hitched and hiked and grifted too from maine to albuquerque alas i missed the beaux arts

across from him kaykay licked her lips nervously and tightened her grip on his hands let try that meditative breathing dumbledore told us about harry suggested kaykay nodded alright she immediately began breathing deeply in for a count of seven hold for seven out for seven wait for seven then start all over again harry joined in with her noticing something before he closed his eyes kaykay didntshut her eyes as he did or as most people would but instead she stared straight ahead her gaze concentrated and powerful yet it seemed to go right through him to something invisible beyond the confines of the empty classroom he felt a slight twinge in his power like a subconscious something knocking on a door curious he pinpointed the feeling it was odd foreign almost blue in his sight it was a small haze thin like a cord and it quivered as if nervous or strained had he been paying attention to anything but this magical intruder he would have felt kaykay nails digging into his palms as she wavered in her breathing pattern harry could feel his own magic reaching out to join the new magic stretching itself thin to match it in shape and taking on a green color carefully he exhaled allowing it to follow it instinct the two threads of magic hovered near each other for a moment as if hesitating then they slowly twisted around each other tighter and tighter until the colors blended their glow faded until they were as black as shadow in his vision this aroused harry curiosity he was about to force some more of his magic into to blackness to see if it would rekindle whatever had been happening when the fused magic erupted with a blinding white flash as hot as fire as suddenly as a gust of wind harry was yanked away from kaykay by an invisible force and tossed against the wall as if he was simply a pillow from the other side of the room there was the crash of splintering wood a loud clatter a thud and then a groan harry opened his eyes slowly dust was settling around the classroom and all of the desks were set askew as if shoved away from where they d stood there seemed to be two of everything he clutched his head and shook it back and forth a few times before rubbing his eyes when opened them for a second time the world had righted itself oy are you okay there was the sound of slight movement then kaykay dazed voice oh yes fine and ow dandy there was another sound this one sounding a bit more like something heavy being dropped harry pushed himself to his feet stumbling a bit as he crossed the room to where he d heard kaykay he found her sprawled on a pile of splintered wood surrounded by tipped desks and to think i actually imagined that that was a good idea she said she tried to give a feeble chuckle but stopped suddenly clutching her side hey at least something happened oh yeah this sure is a picnic isntit kaykay started to push herself up winced in pain then collapsed onto the rubble again ow not cool what wrong oh this is insane here let me help you harry said crouching down next to her and putting one arm behind her shoulders while using the other hand to help pull her up harry i can get up on my own thank you very much kaykay snapped i just need a moment to breathe kaykay batted his hands away then proceeded to push herself into a sitting position faltering slightly before crying out and falling back once more catching herself with her hands harry was immediately ready again supporting her behind the shoulders before she got injured any further you re just going to hurt yourself more damn it why do you have to be so independent harry asked quietly as he began pushing fragments of wood aside with his free hand i have to be he looked at her in surprise but quickly regained his composure and why is that he asked continuing to clear an area of floor i just do if i dependent on people i setting myself up for well i dontknow what something something bad harry gave a single dry laugh you know your independence is one of your best qualities i think last spring i made myself think that it was a fault but you know what he looked at her if you dontlearn to be a bit dependent you re going to get yourself killed here supporting her shoulders and legs he slid her away from the remaining bits of wood and to the empty floor kaykay smiled thanks see depending on someone isnt that hard now is it well as long as it isntall the time i agree with you there now i dontknow how to heal and i dontknow how to conjure a stretcher it looks like i going to be carrying you what no kaykay expression immediately turned to one of horror i not asking you i telling you but but harry no no harry looked down at her i not giving you a choice here you re coming but harry bent down and scooped her up which forced her to put her arms around his neck so she wouldntfall she tried to kick her legs and wriggle probably trying to make him put her down but it seemed to hurt her too much and she became still there we go that a good girl harry said picking his way carefully between desks it not like i a dog kaykay snapped he looked over at her eyes wide oh i know believe me i know he used his foot to open the door as they emerged into the hallway kaykay sighed and let her head drop against harry arm why is it always me harry bit back laughter and ducked through a holographic piece of wall that would serve as a shortcut to the hospital wing the corridor they passed through was dark but wide so harry was able to navigate without fear of running into something they emerged through a portrait just a few yards away from their destination almost there he told kaykay goodie she said sarcastically rolling her eyes as he backed through the doors oh what have you done now potter harry looked over his shoulder at madame pomfrey not me kaykay the witch clucked disapprovingly and bustled over as harry set kaykay down on one of the nearby beds well you made it to the first week of october before having to come down here i should be impressed she said waving her wand to make the area around kaykay bed brighter what happened harry faltered looking over at kaykay they really couldntexplain the real story to madame pomfrey he neednthave worried kaykay answered with a convincing excuse immediately we were practicing magic for defense against the dark arts something just went wrong and i was sent flying across the room she shrugged madame pomfrey raised an eyebrow but said nothing where does it hurt ummm here mostly kaykay said indicating her torso and lower back where i landed on the desk i see she turned and went into her office emerging a few moments later with a towel goblet and small vial kaykay groaned oh none of that now take this she handed kaykay the towel and drink all of this it barely a mouthful kaykay took the goblet and drank it only to begin coughing immediately after she clamped the hand with the towel in it over her mouth and fumbled to give the goblet in her other hand to harry as abruptly as the coughing had started it stopped and kaykay let her hand flop back down to her side as she breathed deeply she shakily wiped the back of her hand across her mouth and madame pomfrey took the white towel back i was afraid that this was the case kaykay had been studying her hand with an unreadable expression but now she let it fall into her lap as she looked at madame pomfrey she wiped it off on the sheets but not before harry saw the blood what he began you probably have a few broken ribs i can repair them easily enough but you ll have to stay overnight now i need to examine you to see which ribs are injured kaykay nodded madame pomfrey was staring pointedly at harry what you ll need to leave potter she said as if this was the most obvious thing in the world why madame pomfrey sighed irritably i ll need to examine her to see what her injuries are she repeated but why he began he glanced at kaykay who was blushing furiously oh he immediately felt his cheeks get hot but he turned and hurried away before either of them could see madame pomfrey closed the curtains around kaykay bed to begin her examination harry sat down in a chair a few beds away and waited kaykay woke with a start to a loud clatter and someone swearing softly under their breath she blinked once twice and the third time she sat up abruptly where was her four poster where was casey where were the other gryffindor girls she looked down at her hospital pajamas and the crisp white linens and finally remembered the events of the previous night she d had three cracked ribs one had nicked her right lung madame pomfrey had said she also said that kaykay had a twisted ankle but how she d managed to get one by landing on a desk was beyond kaykay she looked down at her hand again it had frightened her beyond words when she began coughing and found blood on her lips it was horrifically similar to her last few memories of remus and she didntwant to die even though she knew that she felt too alright to have to worry she didntwant to die kaykay shivered then yawned and stretched her arms high over her head as she did so the bandages knotted tightly around her torso tugged in protest to the movement just sit there i ll be back in one moment kaykay looked around at the sound of madame pomfrey voice across the way brian was sitting on the edge of a bed pressing a towel against his obviously bleeding arm brian er professor he looked up in surprise then noticed her and grinned brian right kaykay nodded what happened hagrid asked me for help with some creatures for his class i being the fool of all time thought that being learned in defense against the dark arts would be protection enough i ll let you fill in the details for yourself kaykay cringed great hagrid creatures and i generally dontget along yeah he told me about the meteosnills brian said with a knowing wink all i did was sneeze kaykay insisted not for the first time brian laughed well what about you what are you in for oh i got hurt practicing magic with harry i dunno something just went wrong next thing i know she pantomimed flying through the air with her hand i was on the other side of the room brian was studying her pensively what i ve seen you and harry duel you re not ones to make foolish mistakes kaykay thought frantically well you see we were sort of experimenting a bit not exactly a lie uh huh brian said skeptically he was about to say something else when madame pomfrey reappeared ah you re up she said to kaykay well just let me attend to professor kingstaff and i shall be right with you she turned to brian and took the towel away from him how bad the wound was kaykay couldnttell pretty serious though she assumed by what was on the towel the nurse cleaned it with a simple scourgify then applied bright purple ointment to it and bandaged it up it should be better in no time just reapply this every six hours she handed brian the jar of ointment thank you poppy goodbye kaykay he said turning to look at her hope you re better soon i was hoping to use you and harry as an example monday when i go over dueling a bit more thanks bri professor she corrected herself at the last minute he nodded a farewell to madame pomfrey waved to kaykay then turned and left the hospital wing madame pomfrey shook her head sighing then quickly pulled the curtains around kaykay bed closed honestly she said more to herself than to kaykay employing a student fresh out of hogwarts let me see your bandages dear kaykay complied without a word and madame pomfrey began her examination heads would roll at the ministry that is they would if the ministry even gave a flying thought in space anymore who to say what this would is coming to with you know who and all as she spoke madame pomfrey poked different parts of kaykay ribcage before finally giving her wand a small twirl to make the bandages unravel who knows perhaps a young person with good leadership is just the role model students need dumbledore knows what he doing i sure she continued feeling the ribs that had been broken still she sighed straightening and twirling her wand once more to make the bandages bind themselves around kaykay torso once more before crouching and feeling kaykay ankle things get messy when you bring alumni back straight away old friends romances a tangled mess between students and professors she stood it hard to overlook but hard to condone she fell silent and kaykay stared at her for a long moment before clearing her throat ummm madame pomfrey may i go well you seem to be healed still i d like you to keep those bandages around your ribs for another three days and i want you to put that brace back onto your ankle if it begins to hurt again yes ma am very well you may go kaykay grinned and as soon as madame pomfrey had left her curtained bedside she jumped up and changed back into her normal clothes eager to get back to gryffindor tower wake up time for quidditch kaykay heard the voice in the foggy edges of her mind only a moment before she felt the blow to her head come on the voice repeated a bit clearer this time get up she was again hit in the head wake up kaykay come on time to trounce slytherin the voice belonged to harry she could discern that much by the third time he spoke he hit her once more and she responded by yanking the pillow out from under her head and whacking him with it full force he laughed and she scrambled out from under her blankets the adrenaline racing through her veins waking her up more effectively than any amount of cold water to the face potter she shouted hitting him with her pillow why are you up here quidditch game harry responded enthusiastically returning the blow kaykay laughed and dodged his next swing scrambling over her bed and around the other side he followed after her trying to hit her while avoiding being hit give it up potter you ll never get me no sooner had kaykay said it than harry caught up with her seizing her around the middle and tossing her back onto her bed if her ribs hadntbeen fully healed a week and a half prior she would have killed him for this he stole this opportunity to attack her mercilessly with his pillow kaykay shrieked and rolled backwards over her shoulder in order to fall off the bed and escape she misjudged the distance however and ended up hitting her head on the next bed over and her foot on the nightstand as a result almost before she could get up harry jumped onto her bed and began attacking her from above ergo kaykay felt completely justified in her next action one hard swing of her pillow made harry stumble and jump off the bed it took a second then a third for him to retaliate the chase began again however it was to be short lived for at that moment hermione walked into the dormitory and cleared her throat when they both stopped and got a glimpse of her the glare she was fixing them with was a close rival to one they d get from mcgonagall harry is there a reason specifically that you re in the girl dormitory she asked crisply i was getting kaykay up we have a quidditch match this morning he said looking bewildered at hermione seriousness well looks like she awake now doesntit er yeah he looked at kaykay you d better go get some breakfast soon you know what ron would say if you didnteat hey maybe you can even find a slytherin to get mad at an angry beater is a dangerous one and that just what we need kaykay finished with a smirk see you at breakfast harry saluted then turned and left the dormitory presumably headed towards the great hall hermione what wrong kaykay asked as she turned to rummage clothes out from her trunk who said anything was wrong she asked crossing the room and sitting on the end of kaykay bed no one but it doesntreally require a private detective to realize that something is up hermione sighed it that obvious kaykay pulled a pair of jeans from her trunk hermione look at yourself at the end of last year you were as loose and carefree well maybe not carefree but you get my point as she paused neither she nor harry had been particularly loose or carefree as ron she looked up just in time to see a strange look cross hermione face oh for crying out loud kaykay muttered grabbing her tee shirt just ask him to go to hogsmeade with you and get it over with she exclaimed inadvertently shaking the shirt in hermione face what hermione you can quit pretending both of you are crazy about each other and you re the only ones too blind to notice i i never listen i not about to tell anyone but you re ruining your last year of hogwarts kaykay began changing out of her pajamas i bet you ve liked him since you started your first year i sure it been easy to put off facing up to it but now you re in your seventh year and you know that if something doesnthappen you may not see him often or at all once you ve graduated but i and that why you ve been so snappish this year kaykay plowed on you may pass it off as your position as head girl but you know that a simple badge and some fresh responsibilities wouldntchange you this much hermione sighed and fidgeted looking down at her lap kaykay checked her watch then grabbed her broomstick come on let go down to breakfast i ve got a game to win but if he feels the same way why doesnt he ever act different hermione blurted kaykay sighed in exasperation hermione he a guy everyone knows that guys are only capable of doing one thing at a time if they had to do everything we do they d explode gryffindor did trounce slytherin at their match 210 to 40 harry was surprised that the slytherin captain kept malfoy on the team as he obviously was a failure at seeking oh well it wasntlike harry was about to complain as he and his fellow seventh years got further into the term they became further and further buried in assignments for the first time that harry could recall it wasntsurprising to see ron in a secluded part of the common room surrounded by books hermione obviously managed fine quite probably due to her dedication to her schoolwork for six years prior somehow she d established her own time efficient system harry and kaykay had a few problems they still were having regular magic lessons sometimes with dumbledore but often on their own no one had been tossed across the room again but no real progress had been made either meanwhile as students studied and went to classes dreaming longingly of weekends the weather grew cold leaves began to fall from trees and the skies changed from a clear blue to an overcast gray icy winds found their ways into hallways classrooms and dormitories heralding with their very presence the fast approaching halloween and corresponding trip to hogsmeade on october 25th a piece of paper declared halloween as the date for the hogsmeade trip despite the fact that the 31st fell on a thursday this as well as the fact that voldemort attacks had slowed down on their way back south cheered harry a bit just two more days until hogsmeade kaykay said as she harry and the rest of the group left defense against the dark arts she hugged her arms around her chest and did a little spin before continuing to walk in her own merry way ron laughed just a bit excited are we of course kaykay exclaimed i cantwait to get out and get some fresh air i ve nearly forgotten what the real world looks like as if to punctuate this outrageous statement the group at the moment passed a window outside it was already pitch dark save for the feeble light of the moon struggling to shine through the clouds harry noticed kaykay grin falter as she saw the moon but the moment passed and she tore her gaze away anyhow it loads better than n e w t potions no one argued with her on that point harry was very thankful indeed that this would be his last year of having to put up with snape hey kaykay harry said quietly into her ear as they all sat down for dinner do you think we should practice some tonight instead of just once or twice a week she seemed to consider it casually as she served herself some mashed potatoes yeah sure she said finally in just as quiet of an undertone if we don t we ll probably be dead before we figure it out harry laughed let hope not and pass the potatoes will you what do you say harry hufflepuff or ravenclaw who going to come out on top in the next match harry took the bowl from kaykay hands i dunno hufflepuff has always had a pushover team but ravenclaw is adjusting with a new seeker now you cantforget that they had cho chang for so long and now they have to get used to new blood kaykay pointed out but still hufflepuff isnt that good they ve been getting better over the past few years though you have to admit that hermione stated everyone stopped to stare at her what she asked looking around in confusion at the incredulous looks she was receiving you mean to tell me that you pay that much attention to quidditch ron asked as a matter of fact ronald weasley i do why is that so surprising i ll remind you that last year the two of you begged me to try out for quidditch yeah but you said no so what your point kaykay was shaking her head wearily and rolling her eyes as hermione and ron began bickering harry could hear her muttering under her breath honestly just date and get it over with harry stifled a laugh then glanced down the table and hesitated professor kingstaff was walking between the student tables up to the head table instead of going to his seat he went to professor dumbledore and whispered urgently in his ear dumbledore face became quite grave and he nodded once shhh harry admonished glancing only briefly at the noisy ron and hermione before looking again at the head table dumbledore was asking professor kingstaff something and beckoning for mcgonagall honestly just because i dont play the sport doesntmean will you guys shut up stop flirting for two minutes madison snapped obviously noticing what harry was looking at harry smirked from the corner of his eye he could see hermione mouth opening and closing noiselessly as she struggled for words and ron ears going bright red what do you think it is has something happened kaykay asked i dontknow he began let hope he trailed off as dumbledore stood and general hush fell over the great hall forgive for interrupting dumbledore said the twinkle in his eye gone but i fear i have some bad news a few murmurs swept the hall but most students remained silent staring at the headmaster curiously unnoticed by most professors mcgonagall and kingstaff were leaving the great hall via the door behind the dais and snape was sweeping out the main doorway harry looked back at professor dumbledore grave face he had the distinct inexplicable feeling of foreboding by her rapid uneven breathing beside him harry could tell kaykay hosted the same thought i sorry to announce dumbledore continued that the hogsmeade trip this thursday has been cancelled and i am even more sorry to announce that hogsmeade village has been he paused as if trying to decide the best words to use attacked voldemort and his death eaters half of the student population flinched raided the area just a short time ago precautions are already being taken you all are to spend the night in here he stopped even his charisma unable to suppress the anxious mutterings between students but he was making his way south again hermione said obviously shocked south so now you know who is right here ron asked his eyes darting around as if one of the uniformed students was actually voldemort in disguise and death eaters would spring out from beneath the tables at any moment well not here obviously madison said but only a mile or so away her tone was cool but harry could hear the worry in it he looked at kaykay but she was simply biting her lip her eyes dark she appeared to be deep in thought as you all know there are great dangers in our world today we can only fight voldemort darkness with an equal response of care and love therefore dumbledore paused again as if considering something for a final time i am asking students seventeen or older to if they desire assist in helping victims of tonight attacks i wish to impress upon you that this will not be fun he said his gaze slowly swept across the great hall as if he was looking at each student in turn you will sleep outdoors you will get up early and go to bed late you will work long and hard nursing wounds searching for survivors comforting children and adults alike repairing buildings and roads knitting lives back together however it is my distinct opinion that such selfless care for others is part of the mystery of being human one good deed merits another and that another and if we all help one another that love will be returned to us in unexpected ways if a pin had been dropped at that moment everyone in the room would have heard it after a long silence dumbledore asked are there any volunteers the quiet was left unbroken but barely a moment passed before kaykay extracted her long legs from under the table and stood harry followed suit immediately soon after a boy from ravenclaw stood then madison and then several people at once from ravenclaw hufflepuff and gryffindor including ron and hermione a single person from the slytherin table stood a few of his housemates muttered at him but he paid them no heed he must have been in his sixth year because harry recognized him but didntknow who he was very well dumbledore said nodding solemnly those standing please come with me chatter broke out once more and the collection of sixth and seventh years followed professor dumbledore out all of them sporting grave but determined faces please be seated dumbledore said to the assembled teenagers as they filed into an empty classroom there was the clamor of scraping chairs as everyone complied but no words were spoken once everyone had found a spot and was gazing expectantly at the wizened headmaster he cleared his throat i thank you he said looking at each student in turn for agreeing to this sacrifice he allowed these words to settle heavily upon them and kaykay held back a shiver shoving frivolous hesitations to the back of her mind if she was to be an auror this was a good way to begin besides that she wouldntbe able to stand herself if she d refused to help kaykay felt or at least believed she felt dumbledore gaze linger on her and harry i will assure you all now that this service will be replacing your regular lessons for as long as it lasts you needntcompensate for missed curriculum i shall ensure that your n e w t exams do not cover the subjects you miss kaykay blinked in surprise the thought hadnteven occurred to her glancing out of the corner of her eyes at a few other people she could see that few besides hermione had considered it we shall leave early tomorrow morning this gives officials a chance to certify that any immediate danger is over dumbledore continued kaykay got the sneaking suspicion that if pomfrey was correct and the ministry indeed was doing next to nothing about voldemort the officials he spoke of were teachers i wish at this time to know what areas if any you feel you d be best attributed to or any areas of work you feel unable to be part of you will also be placed with a partner always stay in your groups of two as you ll be responsible not only for your tasks but also for each other safety mr potter do you have any preferences to your position anywhere is fine harry said kaykay looked at him and was struck by how his disposition found a way to emanate from him his face was grim and as set as stone his eyes were hard yet determined he seemed as ready for this upcoming challenge as kaykay wished she did miss determan dumbledore continued a quill and piece of parchment had appeared from nowhere and were taking notes on the discussion of their own accord i ll help wherever i needed very well you shall be paired with mr potter dumbledore looked next at hermione miss granger you are needed here but but i want to help her voice was not whiny nor meek but professional and assured you misunderstand me he told her orphaned or separated families will be housed here temporarily it is my request that you apply your leadership skills to helping children and adults alike adjust to their situation you still will be working for the recovery project instead of taking your classes and mr boot will take over all of your head girl duties hermione obviously content enough with this arrangement nodded you ll depart with us tomorrow morning and once we begin finding survivors they shall accompany you back to hogwarts if their health permits you will repeat this process each day for as long as necessary she nodded again and dumbledore continued on to the next seat mr weasley i request that you do the same then before ron who looked rather surprised could ask why he continued as you have grown up with a large family you are better equipped to know how to handle some situations that may arise ron nodded and dumbledore indicated that he and hermione would be partners he continued through the rest altogether there was bit less than two dozen students some he paired up immediately others he needed to wait until finding someone with similar traits madison was a bit squeamish at blood although she didntsay so in those precise words so it was a while until she was paired up with a boy from sixth year the only other slytherin to volunteer when positions had been noted and partners assigned the headmaster gave each of them a duffel bag scarcely larger than their book bags he advised them to pack their things wisely and asked that they do so immediately everyone left in the same silence that they d maintained throughout the meeting subconsciously dividing into the pairs they d been assigned to ron and hermione lingered to find out more about their job since theirs had been the only one assigned thus far harry and kaykay walked in silence as they made their way up to gryffindor tower without immediate conversation to occupy her kaykay felt her detached numbness ebb away as her anger mounted what gave anyone the right to take the life of another especially someone innocent it was one thing for voldemort to attack someone like harry or herself to usurp their born powers but to kill away mothers fathers brothers sisters whole families by making it unrelated voldemort had in his cruel way made it personal kaykay growled and kicked a suit of armor with all the force she could muster the suit jumped slightly and cringed glancing down at the dent in his leg while kaykay huffed irritably hey harry said softly take it easy it not fair kaykay found herself shouting they didntdo anything why does he have to hurt them i dontknow he said quietly but evenly being the patient one for once he put a hand on her shoulder but shouting about it i dontcare she yelled jerking away from his hand and aiming another kick at a suit of armor this one wisely jumped out of the way why how can anyone feel that they can do that he has no right why does he she broke off crying as abruptly as she d begun yelling somehow during her brief ranting she d grabbed hold of harry shirt in her fists and not even realized it i hate him she whispered oh god i hate him so much harry pulled her into a comforting hug i know he assured her i hate him too come on let get our things packed so we can help fix things kaykay nodded stepping back and digging the heels of her hands into her eyes to wipe away her tears crying would help nothing the walk again fell into silence password the fat lady asked with exercised caution the portraits must have already been informed to be on their guard vita orbis harry offered repeating the new password dumbledore had instructed them to use the portrait hole swung open and kaykay and harry entered the abandoned common room harry proceeded straight to the winding staircase but kaykay paused drinking in the state of the common room as though she d never quite seen it before gone were the students that always lingered in one corner or another gone were the chessboards quills and scattered papers her eyes slid over the whole scene curiously she felt like a stranger seeing this empty lifeless place for the first time however if she closed her eyes and listened she thought she could hear the echoes of excited conversation and laughter behind it though there was sorrow she opened her eyes with a snap shaking away the moment as quickly as she d embraced it the first thing her gaze fell upon was the window she scowled at it and walked over to shut the curtains against the night sky when she turned around she was startled to see harry still at the foot of the staircase studying her with an expression she couldntquite pair up with a meaning saying nothing not even looking him in the eye she walked past him then once she was out of sight around the first spiral of the staircase to the girl dormitory she ran the rest of the way up upon reaching the dormitory she again pulled the heavy curtains over the windows shut kaykay was quite certain by this point that she hated memories hated the pain that they brought hated feelings in general sighing in a disconsolate way she set down her duffel bag and opened her trunk after studying the contents for a bit she chose function over form a sweatshirt rather than a cloak a single pair of jeans and a few tee shirts she made certain she had room for a book she d salvaged from remus home practical survival charms she was certain it would be helpful as she took out the book from the bottom of her trunk she spied a piece of folded parchment underneath it curious she picked it up and unfolded it it was a hasty scrawl in her own handwriting the time draws near the heir of he the dark lord the master is no longer dormant no not even the heir knew their destiny but it kaykay hastily folded the paper once more the prophecy professor trelawney had made amazing though it was to kaykay that the woman actually did possess the sight wasntrelevant at a time like this in fact it was no longer relevant at all she thought the heir had already come and gone still this thought did not keep kaykay pulse from racing a bit faster the paper shook slightly in her hand with a great effort she stilled it tossing a few more necessities into her small bag kaykay shoved the paper under a pile of sweaters she avoided wearing at all costs then closed and locked her trunk with a bang that resounded eerily through the empty tower there the words would lay forgotten for nearly two months waking early to aching limbs from sleeping on the hard floor of the great hall kaykay blinked at professor mcgonagall only twice before getting up and grabbing all of her things she joined the silent trickle of volunteer students leaving the great hall silently picking her way carefully through batches of sleeping students after taking as little time as possible to get ready kaykay entered the same classroom that they d used for the meeting the prior night there was no chatter no sounds every student though wide awake was silent in determination after the last few students had entered dumbledore swept in two bags hovering behind him he began without preamble the area around hogsmeade has been declared secure we will still have people circulating however so they may let us know if something new should develop we will go now we have to walk to hogsmeade on your way out the door be certain to grab a uniform supply pack and breakfast bar there no time to lose let go all the students fell immediately into line grabbing their respective items before filing into the hallway after the headmaster now after an hour of walking they approached the crest of the last hill they d need to mount before seeing hogsmeade village glancing around at her peers kaykay deducted that they looked like a strong team a peaceful army of sorts every one of them was in uniform a sky blue jumpsuit that went over their normal clothing they all sported armbands too white with a red cross in front of a wand shooting purple sparks also strapped around every individual waist was a supply pack the supply packs looked almost like tool belts except they were far less bulky and they contained very different tools there was a holster for wands so they d be easy to draw a pouch containing bandages another containing gauze and medical tape a miniature book on medical care for emergencies a supply of high energy foods and a self replenishing water canteen however most important of all the items they carried were several flasks containing potions from madame pomfrey most vital stores every student needed them with at all times blood replenishing potions pepperup potions dreamless sleep potions strengthening potions and a few kaykay had yet to encounter personally their earliest instructions were to search houses for survivors of the attacks each pair was assigned certain streets to cover and once they d checked a home they were to send up a signal to hover over the place a phoenix composed of violet and gold unlike most of their schoolmates harry and kaykay were not assigned to search teams but to nursing any wounded that either were uncovered or simply came to their encampment while they waited they were to work on potions that would be needed when their current stores were used up breathing somewhat heavier than they had been before starting on their journey the teenagers continued their nearly completed hike they finally reached the top of the hill capable of seeing hogsmeade and they halted bloody hell ron whispered fervently it was in ruins from every angle the dark mark glared down at them in grotesque smugness houses and shops were destroyed glass was shattered everywhere and smoke rose in small smolders from many buildings under the wind kaykay thought she could hear wailing or shouting from beside her somebody lunged forward and began down the hill at a half run half stumble she d no sooner distinguished the messy black hair before she broke into a run after him harry harry wait we need to stay together behind her she could hear other students hurrying on their way down the hill she stumbled twice tripped and rolled over on her shoulder springing back up immediately harry had slowed and was nearing a large white tent kaykay entered with him at blinked in mild surprise the tent while of a fair size on the outside was enormous inside it was rather like being indoors there were at least a hundred cots and beside each were a medical kit and a small sink there was a tall cabinet on the far wall with the doors swung wide open one side revealed more potions the other potions ingredients also to the back were two doors one heralding lavatories the other office outside she could hear dumbledore calling you know your tasks work quickly but be cautious be sure to keep thorough records of anyone you find where you work and for how long i i guess that our cue to start working on potions kaykay said to harry who was still silent she indicated for him to follow her into the office shall we start with blood replenishing and dreamless sleep potions harry nodded slowly passing her and staring into one of the empty cauldrons then kicked it angrily with a strangled cry kaykay faltered for a moment hovering on the edge of uncertainty then stepped forward and rested a hand on his shoulder he was still breathing raggedly but under kaykay hand his body gave a tiny shudder of defeat and relaxed slightly i going to get the ingredients okay you can get the fires started kaykay said harry nodded again kaykay patted his shoulder and left the room for harry own dignity she pretended she didntsee the tear in the corner of his eye by the time she d returned flames were licking the bottoms of the cauldrons and harry looked perfectly normal i have your flames at the temperature for a dreamless sleep potion he informed her as she set down several ingredients on a table alright here she began sorting the items into two groups this is what you ll be needing he stepped around his cauldron and studying the instruction pages carefully began measuring ingredients kaykay located a set of brass scales and began measuring unicorn hair after a long silence harry said quite suddenly thanks kaykay glanced up at him in surprise what for for being patient with me harry you need to give yourself a little leeway everyone is angry with voldemort besides you saw me last night i was far less composed than you but well still thanks he repeated carefully grinding some scarabs hey what are friends harry kaykay a voice sounded urgently from the front of the medical tent kaykay and harry immediately dropped their things and hurried out into the main room justin finch fletchley was maneuvering a floating stretcher into the tent on which was supported a middle aged man how serious is he harry asked quickly i not sure justin replied quickly he nearly unconscious though put him on a cot up there the most serious cases will need to be near the supply cabinet kaykay instructed the ravenclaw boy let the stretcher down on a bed near the very front waving his wand to make the stretcher vanish once the man was situated kaykay grabbed a chart on a hook at the foot of the cot can you hear me sir she asked clearly crouching down next to him what is your name the man took a long time to speak and when he did it was very soft and slightly difficult to understand him joseph meyers is are there any others justin answered you re the first other teams are still searching your home ah joseph closed his eyes for a drawn out moment and who are you he asked opening his eyes and focusing them on harry who had also crouched down nearby we re justin kayleigh and harry he said indicating each of them in turn we re from hogwarts we ve come to help ah the man repeated merlin bless you he closed his eyes again either falling asleep or passing out harry took out his wand and began checking joseph injuries to see what attention he d need kaykay moved closer to justin to get the rest of the information i dontknow much he said but he from number six on cliodna circle kaykay copied down the information then glanced at joseph harry seemed to be faring well on his own so she leaned a bit closer to justin and continued in a whisper how bad is it out there there was dread laced through her voice and she hated herself for it really bad he confided there are bodies everywhere some are burnt from house fires and other people arentcompletely dead but are close to it the blood and the wailing you two are lucky to be in here kaykay had her fingertips pressed over her mouth and slowly she lowered her hand maybe she said looking over her shoulder as harry wrapped a bandage around one of joseph arms but who can say how long it will last justin left quietly and kaykay went to join harry at joseph bedside she was about to ask if he needed anything when the tent flaps again burst open kaykay it was madison and she was like justin bringing with her a person on a stretcher her wand arm was trembling and no sooner had she lowered the stretcher onto a cot than she ducked back outside the tent door madison are you alright kaykay asked she heard her cousin retching and she ducked out after her i fine i ll be fine she said wiping her mouth on her dirty sleeve and clutching her stomach the girl take care of the girl kaykay nodded and went back to the stranger bedside joseph seemed to be taken care of for the time being and harry was next to the new victim miss can you hear me he asked softly shaking her shoulder gently miss the lady or rather girl because she could barely be older than kaykay herself opened her eyes slowly taking much time to focus her gaze on the two faces above her when she did seem to finally comprehend kaykay and harry she gave a shrill scream and began thrashing as if trying to escape no no leave me alone get away she shouted squeezing her eyes shut stop please stop harry held her arms down and opened his mouth to speak but the moment his hands touched her the girl screamed again no stop stop it kaykay suddenly understood and pushed harry away hard catching him with a hand in front of his chest when he tried to again approach the bed kaykay pleadingly tried to communicate a message to him with her eyes as she took his place in holding the girl to calm her shhh shhh it alright miss we re here to help my name is kaykay and i from hogwarts what is your name please dontlet him dontlet him touch me the girl wasntstruggling as much but she was still hysterical and tears were running down her dirt streaked face he wonthurt you miss he ll stay away out of the corner of her eye kaykay could see madison drawing harry away while whispering quickly now what is your name but he ll he might i promise you nothing will happen to you you re safe now kaykay said soothingly taking the girl hand what is your name a annisele westin kaykay picked up the clipboard from the foot of the cot okay annisele how old are you s sixteen almost seventeen kaykay swallowed hard but nodded copying down the information and forcing herself not to remain professional even though she felt her eyes begin to water where do you live n number seventeen wisteria lane thank you dontworry she said taking annisele hand once more when she saw the fear in her eyes you re in good hands we ve come to help now is there anyplace specifically that hurts i see that you have a bad cut on your shoulder kaykay prompted taking a cloth out of the medical kit and getting up to soak it in warm water annisele tried to sit up he he just came at me i told him to stop and i screamed but no one came and i wasntstrong enough to shhh kaykay hushed gently sitting down next to her immediately it not your fault she gently forced annisele to lie back down worried that if she let the girl continue talking she d get hysterical once again taking the warm wet cloth kaykay gently began wiping dirt and soot off of annisele face taking special care to dab away new tears that leaked out of her eyes harry will you please get me a salve for deep cuts and some more washcloths she called over her shoulder dontworry she added to annisele as she saw her become tense once more that harry potter he wontharm you i promise still harry stopped a good distance back to hand over the items kaykay set to work cleaning the gash on annisele shoulder she later learned that it was from a broken window annisele winced and shuddered as kaykay mended her wounds but seemed to be calming down as kaykay finished up with the bandages and repacked the first aid kit both girls sighed with relief here drink this kaykay said pouring the vial of dreamless sleep potion into a plastic cup it will help you sleep well so you donthave nightmares annisele took the cup with a small thank you and drained it quickly kaykay took the cup and rinsed it out as she quickly drifted off to sleep kaykay recorded annisele injuries on the chart physical and emotional then restored it to its rightful place she was about to step away from the bedside when she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror her eyes were red the lines around her mouth were hard her hair despite being restrained in a tight braid was unkempt and her uniform was already dirtied with blood dirt and soot a sigh the sound used when words werentenough wasnteven adequate to describe how she felt shaking her head at herself kaykay hastily washed and dried her hands then turned to assist harry two young boys that had just been brought in one whimpering for his mother the other out cold this aintcomin from no prophet just an ordinary man when i close my eyes i see the way this
