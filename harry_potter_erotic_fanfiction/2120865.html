spark between two people that you hope wontstart a fire and burn them both to death onizuka gto by tohru fujisawa chapter one a force to be reckoned with it was rather chilled outside for an early autumn afternoon the wind nipped at the sparse branches and filtered through the cracks in the windowpane with a faint whistle outside the sky was a bit dim and gray putting a damper on the week much appreciated sun however inside it remained bright and warm and a tall thin girl sat curled beside the window reading a book she flipped the pages faster for it had just gotten exciting her eyes skimmed the words desperate to see what was yet to come for the troubled heroine tap tap the girl peered up at the window at the sound but there was nothing she shrugged and went back to her novel tap tap irritated at the interruption she tossed the book onto her bed and went to the window oh the latch was loose and the wind was but her thoughts were suddenly disrupted by the shock of a large brown object hurtling straight toward her head larger and larger it became until aaaaiiieeeeee splat the giant brown ball of fluff bounced off the windowpane and fluttered around dazedly swirling about in the wind it hooted and puffed up its feathers the girl clutched the stitch of her chest and her blood began to boil bloody hell lily li ly she shrieked you re stupid demon bird is outside my window i told you to make it stop muuuuuum she stomped out of the room furiously the befuddled owl nudged at the unlatched window and squeezed his plump form inside from there he buzzed through the door which the girl had just exited and zipped into the room next door there he plopped down comfortably on a desk beside a petite redhead she peered up from her work and rolled her eyes at the screaming tantrum that could be heard downstairs she patted the owl on the head dontmind petunia rue she got something wedged up her bum i tell you rue hooted playfully and stuck out his right leg to which some envelopes were attached gladly she untied the twine and shuffled through the letters the first she recognized immediately in swirling green letters it read miss lily m evans it was clearly from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry she unfolded the parchment inside and read what she expected dear miss evans this year as i sure you are aware you shall once again hold the title of prefect for gryffindor house i am pleased to say also this year will entail more in your prefect duties there will be a meeting on friday of the first week to discuss this year events enclosed is a list of books and supplies you will need i look forward to seeing you in the halls sincerely minerva mcgonagall lily smiled to herself and tucked the letter into a slot on her desk and looked excitedly at the other letters it was quite rare that she ever received more than one letter which was yes pathetic and she knew it to get right to the point lily didntexactly have very many friends or any for that matter it wasntthat she was a mean or horrible person just not very popular it didntbother her too much not having more than acquaintances she did just fine on her own studying and focusing on her duties in fact she preferred being alone yes she accomplished more this way no distractions as she would put it tearing open the second letter smiling despite her best efforts she pulled out the parchment within and unfolded it her face fell dear subscriber your payment for witch weekly is overdue penalty charges will be administered at 4 galleons and add three sickles for each additional late day thank you for your patronage best regards erma hix office of funds management and payment but it was times like these when loneliness took its toll lily sighed crinkled up the parchment and tossed it onto the floor to boot she had an overdue fee she was never overdue alright well onto the second letter addressed to miss evans she ripped it open hopefully dear tallulah evans on behalf of your staff and friends here at the ministry we wish you a happy retirement we ll miss you dearly old girl dontparty too much in majorca dontforget your going away party this tuesday and bring your family fondest regards your workmates lily blanched who the hell was tallulah rue she glared at the ball of fluff perched upon her desk lamp wrong evans rue hooted dismissively and buzzed out of the room was she so obsolete to the world that people mistook her for a retired ministry employee even her own owl sigh this was going to be a long year she could tell downstairs the kitchen was producing delicious smells which wafted up the stairs lily took a break from her dismal mail endeavors and bounded down to the little kitchen a red haired beauty stood at the counter mixing a bowl of batter mmmm mum that smells so good lily said dreamily to her mother taking an exaggerated whiff her mother turned her eyes twinkling this one is for your father the rest are for well your father he having a dinner party for his clients tomorrow evening oh she feigned a bit of interest lily wasnttoo fond of her father or his mundane job for that matter she loved him of course but he was just so so hellooo everyone a deep voice burst from the doorway mmmm smells spectacular annabelle darling oh dear my papers wait oh blast there goes all of it a disheveled looking man had entered the kitchen his briefcase hanging open and all its contents were littering floor his hideous brown and yellow striped tie was twisted and hanging from his crinkled shirt at an odd angle normally a hard working man looked like that when he got home after a long day at the office lily father happened to look just like that when he left each morning hi sweetheart he gave lily a sloppy kiss on the cheek as she bent over to help him she smiled weakly and set the papers safely on the table oh her father jumped at the sudden appearance of rue who was now buzzing excitedly around his head oh my er hello he patted the owl awkwardly as it landed on his shoulder lily i thought i told you to keep him in his cage he canthave free reign over this house you know sorry lily mumbled waving her hand at the owl rue hooted and fluttered back into the living room her father dusted off his shoulder and searched for owl droppings lily settled into a chair at the counter and watched her parents side by side it was as if they were from two different planets really her mother was absolutely stunning and so well put together even amongst the baking mess she was sparkling clean her red hair sleek and shining cascading to her shoulders and framing her delicate face everyone said she and lily looked alike but lily didntthink so sure their hair color but she had her dad green eyes and also inconveniently had inherited his limp hair and his clumsiness she wished so hard sometimes that she could be just like her mother beautiful and graceful she did however inherit her determination and organized nature her mother was a spitfire when she wanted to be and somewhere deep down despite her meek tendencies so was lily especially when provoked she was very straight laced like her mother as well very no nonsense it was a wonder her mother could ever be attracted to such a goof as her father her father had his high points though he was incredibly intelligent a genius most would say and very clever lily hoped that she had at least inherited that good trait watching the two of them interact like husband and wife had become a hobby of lily s especially this summer so confounded was she that these two could ever have made a match but as the saying goes opposites attract annabelle her mother had wiped a bit of flour on her father nose and they began giggling in a whirl he picked her up and spun her around henry she pounded his chest flirtatiously like teenagers really she didnteven giggle like that they were grown men and women for goodness sake it was so illogical the way her mother broke out of her calm collected character when with her father she shook her head and headed back upstairs to collect a few things the new term at hogwarts would be starting soon and she had to hit diagon alley to pick up her new supplies blah a tall dark haired young man said holding back his long shaggy hair with a free hand the wind was whipping at his face and the overcast sky made him shiver ow god damn it he clutched his face suddenly i think a leaf just hit me in the eye oh stop complaining padfoot the boy beside him said jauntily doesntit just feel good to be out he stretched his arms up high in the air disregarding the wind which whipped about his already disheveled black locks he was just a fraction taller than his companion and the two were strolling the street of diagon alley despite the terrible weather speak for yourself your corneas arentpermanently damaged he rubbed his eyes wincing james i tired can we at least go inside somewhere stuff it sirius we re almost there james said when did you become a five year old girl sirius looked as if he might sock james but he was quickly distracted by the appearance of a female the wind swirled about lily whipping her robes around so she pulled her cloak tighter and clutched her purse to her chest diagon alley wasnttoo crowded most likely due to the weather plus her shopping spree was far earlier than any other students preferred lily liked to be on top of things it was in her nature she was walking with her head buried in the hogwarts list when her foot caught on a jutting cobblestone and she toppled to her knees ow ruddy cobblestones she said muttered and remained frozen to the spot as she absorbed the shock of the pain to her knees for a moment sirius nudged james who simply rolled his eyes fine dontbe a gentleman sirius said stuffily and headed over to help the cloaked girl up james stood there annoyed it was just a girl not like they didntalready throw themselves on the two of them at hogwarts he thought arrogantly he sighed and watched sirius reach out his hand to the girl but in a sudden gust of wind her hood was ripped from her head and in a splash of color a banner of red hair whipped about in the air oh lily tried to brushed the unruly strands from her eyes and the parchment too was torn away from her by the wind no she cried james was dazed for a moment at the sight the girl hair sweeping her porcelain skin groping in the air for the parchment that she d just lost to the wind sirius made a dive for the papers but missed and it wasntuntil james realized they were floating straight toward him that he broke out of his tizzy he caught the parchment with a deft hand and unwrinkled them his face fell dear ms lily evans the following is your list of required materials for your sixth year at hogwarts but all he needed to see was the first line evans she was a brown nosing know it all with prudish tendencies that made it all the more fun to tease anger and pull pranks on her she got what she deserved he sauntered over to where lily was being pulled up by sirius who d also noticed her identity yet he didntseem too phased james held out the list thank you i but she broke off when she locked eyes with james oh and she ripped the parchment from his hand and shoved it into her bag nice to see you lilykins james smirked he hadntrecognized her at first he d admit but she d changed over the summer she seemed he couldntquite place a finger on it she was growing up he knew that sirius was clearly checking out her curvature but that not what james was referring to it was something else nice hair she flushed and began to smooth it down then realizing what she was doing ripped her hand away and locked her arms at her sides i wouldntbe the one to talk potter he responded with a glare and gave sirius an annoyed glance sirius nodded and shrugged as if to say she has a point james remained indifferent and began flipping a small stone in the air with his right hand nice to know you re as friendly as ever evans you know it rather childish of you to be stuck on the fact that i ve gotten you in trouble she said haughtily you know i canttake advantage of my position as prefect for your amusement oh i didntknow you couldn t i knew you wouldnt james tossed the rock over his head and caught it in his other hand bouncing it about and smiling mockingly now as long as you continue to break the rules i will pull points and issue detentions sirius piped really i must thank you for that i ve broken the school record lily james laughed and lily glared if you dontmind lily began to walk away i have errands to run but james quickly blocked her way oh donttell me you cantmake time for your dear old friends he was tossing the rock unnervingly close to her face now and she was getting irritated get out of my way james shrugged dontreally feel like it and he took a step closer forcing lily a step back then perhaps you could adjust your distance she said her face heating up oh james stepped even closer sorry i wasntaware you wanted lily jumped back again but this time hit the wall of madame malkin robe shop potter geez evans he tossed the rock in front of her face and it nearly grazed her nose james bent over tauntingly and pressed his face in so close it was nearly touching hers i just trying to have a friendly conversation with the flick of his wrist he tossed the rock up from behind his back and caught it with his thumb and forefinger right between their noses he kissed the rock and leapt back laughing lily cheeks now flushed a vibrant red he and sirius were cracking up as they sauntered off down the alley leaving lily embarrassed and angry against the wall of madame malkin s she groaned furiously stupid stupid potter she growled to herself she took a long deep breath and calmed herself dontlet him get to you she thought gritting her teeth he not worth it breathe just breathe she muttered recalling chapter four of detoxify de stress and dontexplode literally for the modern witch of course that what she d been telling herself for the past five years each of which was plagued by the existence of james potter and his friends potter was captain of the gryffindor quidditch team the best chaser in fifty years and subsequently had an ego swollen to the size of the moon lily remembered bitterly the snippets of conversations she would overhear while passing in the halls there no way we ll lose tonight game of course not with james on our team too true james potter never loses anything he unrivaled dusting herself off and straightening up she regained her dignity and headed off in the opposite direction potter and his little friends had better watch out this year from now on she was a force to be reckoned with chapter thirteen apology it was quite chilly lily wrapped her cloak tighter around her shook the stray auburn strands from her eyes and stretched in the distance the surface of the lake shimmered reflecting the rising sun little bugs were buzzing about at the start of the new day and the pixies were gladly taking pest control into their own little webbed fingers lily hadntslept a wink last night she d been up talking to melinda for quite some time everything had sort of just spilled out it started with a briefing on james treatment of her their little deal and of course that entailed admitting she had started the fire in the library granted it was rebuilding quite nicely in fact the building itself was repaired rather quickly with magic its contents however were not in the greatest shape madame pince efforts to restore the books and other priceless items was taking longer than expected and many had been lost completely lily felt terrible she hadntbothered to go back to her dorm at all she d simply spent the evening thinking by the lake watching the beast tentacles splash idly about until the stars began to fade there was no point in hiding from filch she knew that melinda as an authority on campus had a duty to report it to the headmaster in fact perhaps it would be better if filch simply caught her and drug her off after all it was only a matter of time before dumbledore or mcgonagall called her in to have her expelled it was the only reasonable punishment for what she had done and of all those things to think about there was also james james potter ugh what was she thinking lily wiped her lips once more at the memory and wandered back up to the castle she might as well face her fate right now head on how did it make you feel lily blinked down at her open palms laid flat on her lap she looked up what melinda tipped her head and leaned back in her chair when he kissed you how did it make you feel er she blushed i i dontknow i mean fine i think melinda cocked an eyebrow it made you feel fine er well you know i mean it was a kiss it was she could feel the blush creeping steadily higher it was a kiss it was nice melinda smiled i see lily gulped and lifted her chin in all her years at hogwarts she had only been sent to dumbledore office twice and one of those times was to congratulate her on her impeccable o w l s and to discuss some international exchange programs with the ministry and now she was marching to the scaffold on her own accord she wouldntwait for word to travel to him she would tell him herself it was the least wham lily toppled to the floor cushioned by her bum ngghh she groaned and rubbed her backside but when she looked up her heart skipped a beat it was mcgonagall lily gulped mcgonagall tutted good heavens she adjusted her hat and smoothed her black robes miss evans what on earth are you doing up at this hour lily swallowed hard er i was just just coming to see the headmaster mcgonagall squinted inquisitively the headmaster well i afraid he is out on business at the moment what is it that you need well lily began slowly it just that mcgonagall looked rather impatient she was tapping her foot this only made lily more nervous it just i assuming you heard about what happened with the library the library mcgonagall peered down at her sharply whatever have you heard about the library miss evans well it not so much heard as seen seen mcgonagall looked furious are you trying to tell me you knew about potter this whole time and haventsaid anything lily blanched potter he came to me last night and confessed to having a hand in the entire thing some sort of prank as usual he claims it simply got out of hand she was rambling waving a hand dismissively but of course this is the final straw he will meet his punishment professor no i think you mis please miss evans mcgonagall peered past lily shoulder distractedly i really must be going lily opened her mouth but mcgonagall cut her off really we will continue this conversation later you had best make your way back to the tower but professor but she d already gone black cloak whipping around the corner and disappearing into the shadows lily smacked her forehead and groaned james had given himself up in her stead perfect absolutely perfect as usual helen nodded her head primly charlotte whirled around twice in her beautiful new ice blue dress robes yes i am james wontbe able to resist you florence added slurping on the end of a red sugar quill charlotte grinned slyly who said i liked james then she frowned irritably at florence and the stream of red dribbling down her chin ugh she rolled her eyes and looked back in the mirror at her own much more appealing image but i definitely wouldntmind taking him to the yule ball helen giggled it so obvious that you want him of course it is charlotte sighed because i do just then the door creaked open lily dragged herself in and tossed her bag onto her bed she flopped down on her stomach and buried her face in her pillow charlotte smirked and glanced at helen and florence sashaying her hips over to the window by lily bed she peered outside out all night again lily goodness you must be tired lily was silent and buried her head deeper into the pillow so do like my new dress charlotte examined a nail it for the yule ball you know are you going to go the yule ball lily haventwe already had this conversation lily muffled voice drifted up from within the pillow charlotte tittered and began wriggling out of her dress she hung it up and slipped into her robes i believe we have i think there was also mention of james as in he going with me not you lily snorted and lifted her head fat chance of that charlotte her eyes narrowed what that supposed to mean i thought we agreed you arentgood enough for him lily frowned i dontrecall that at all but what i do know is that james potter will probably never step foot on hogwarts grounds again charlotte blanched a and just what does that mean what did you do to him lily lowered her eyes and lay back down what haventi done to him just go away charlotte the thick red curtains shut in charlotte face with a snap she gasped and stumbled backwards gaping at helen and florence so florence slurped on her feather quill i dontsuppose you could lend me that dress you not needing it now and all melinda lily burst through her office door unannounced melinda moonshine peered up from her desk which was piled with a few neatly stacked boxes which she was magically cramming into a small briefcase lily halted where are you going melinda smiled i leaving something come up at home and i need to take care of it i ll be back it only temporary lily furrowed her brow is everything all right melinda smiled yes it will be she hesitated biting her lip i i was wondering melinda raised her sparkling eyes if i d told professor mcgonagall what you told me lily blushed completely embarrassed yes well i assumed you had i sure it your duty as part of the staff she fiddled with the hem of her sleeve the dark curls shook from melinda eyes there no need but why lily my holiday leave began yesterday as far as i concerned what you told me was entirely off the record besides she smiled that is what friends are for lily stammered but i thought that lily melinda put down her things and faced her placing a hand on lily shoulder i know you ll do the right thing remus adjusted his spectacles and flicked the page of his book it was just getting good when remus he glanced up from his reading and blushed hello lily er is there something wrong lily stood there wringing her hands back to the fire they were in the common room and a few students were wandering through she glanced nervously at them and lowered her voice have you have you seen james by any chance remus sighed i haven t not that he speaking to me james well he does this sometimes lily frowned does what leaves for days on end sometimes weeks weeks her jaw tightened and she felt a damp sweat growing on her brow it just something he does remus said closing his book i wouldntworry he ll turn up lily began to panic the boy cantturn himself in and then disappear but where does he go how does he even get off the grounds remus smirked he has his ways er is there something wrong well it just he done something for me that he shouldnthave and now i think he in real trouble remus quickly lost his smirk what are you talking about he she took a deep breath he lied for me and now he surely going to be expelled wait james sudden realization dawned on his features did you two the library his spectacles nearly fell off the edge of his nose he ripped them off irately and waved his book about are you crazy how d he convince you to get in that sort of trouble that the thing lily blushed embarrassed it was my idea it was your idea to burn down the library he hissed incredulously of course not lily sighed it was just an accident look i just need to find james so we can put things right no lily remus stood abruptly he grabbed her shoulder you cantdo that you ll be expelled remus i have no choice you do it may not be the right one but consider this he said sternly james comes from a wealthy family what could the school possibly do to a boy whose father pays a yearly lump sum to the school fund it the principle of the matter remus lily frowned i thought you would understand i do he sighed but i d rather not see you tossed out of school for some accident that you got caught up in with james because i fairly positive he had a good hand in it too lily sighed and removed remus hand from her shoulder with a gentle squeeze thank you for the advice but i have to own up to the consequences remus watched her sadly as she climbed through the portrait hole lily wandered through the corridors a bit purposely taking the long route until at last she reached mcgonagall office door there it stood a bit more foreboding than she remembered with a heavy sigh she reached up to knock on the door when someone caught her wrist she was dragged backward unwillingly and shoved through the doorway of an empty classroom her back slammed against the chalkboard with a painful crack ow she rubbed her head tenderly just what do you think you re doing a voice hissed in the dark coming from a large shape looming over her lumos she muttered pulling her wand from her pocket james was staring down at her angrily still grasping her left arm that she d raised to knock on the office door james where have you been never mind that just tell me what you were thinking his hair was more disheveled than usual and his eyes were dark with fury i did not risk my neck for you to come crawling back here and get yourself in trouble yes well while we re on that subject why did you confess to burning down the library james glowered lily why cantyou just accept it and keep your mouth shut for once let me take the fall he said the most they ll do is suspend me a few days look my family has money in the school and there no way the school council is going to let me be expelled no james no galleons for their christmas bonuses lily was shaking her head james i can t i sorry it just not the right thing to do then bugger the right thing for once lily he pleaded please just take it as my he choked on the word a bit apology to you lily wanted to laugh but her nervous stomach wouldntallow it that sweet james really but i have to do this james looked distraught you ll be expelled lily sighed inwardly she was more than aware of that yes she was i know she gave him a weak smile before leaving the empty room she reached mcgonagall office door once more and took a deep breath she lifted her hand and knocked twice a n it been slow going for me here but as a special present to all my faithful readers here are two brand new chapters i hope you enjoy them as much as i enjoyed writing them i on a roll chapter fourteen family reunion part i tap tap tap tap tap lily swallowed hard and gripped the fabric of her skirt tightly in her fists knuckles whitening tap tap tap mcgonagall adjusted her spectacles primly on the tip of her nose and cleared her throat she let out a little sigh and turned to the window yes good heavens it open she said immediately the latch clicked and the frosted windows burst open a dark brown hoot owl fluttering in and landing at the edge of mcgonagall desk it held out its talons expectantly as she unraveled the scroll it was carrying then sent it on its way into the night she cleared her throat again and turned back to lily well miss evans her lips were pursed tightly this is unexpected indeed and extremely disappointing i must say her eyes softened sadly i expected far better of you lily stared stonily down at her lap cheeks flushed i m i so sorry yes well mcgonagall stood and smoothed her hair searching for words there are unfortunately courses of action that must be taken in such a situation i afraid lily that i ve had to refer you to the governing board and she scanned the letter with her spectacles perched on the tip of her nose it appears they will be bringing up the topic of your punishment at the meeting tomorrow lily nodded i completely understand well you are to attend tomorrow at three where they will reach a verdict she traveled around the desk and held the door open for lily who walked like a dead man toward it lily was about to cross the threshold when mcgonagall cleared her throat one last time in the meantime miss evans she said with a stony face you will be relinquished of your prefect title and duties she held out her hand wide eyed lily stared at her open palm with a sigh she unpinned her prefect badge and handed it over as she did so she watched the tiny delicate inscription of lily evans fade to a blank slate the door shut behind her with a click this had to be officially the worst day of lily evans life how could she let herself travel down this path what had come of sweet innocent intelligent and proper lily evans she took a deep breath and scrolled through the pages of detoxify de stress and dontexplode literally for the modern witch in her mind and thought of the three a s what was it absorb appreciate and accept remember life is a beautiful thing she breathed in and out slowly absorbing the icy cold emptiness of the hallway she was having a bit of trouble appreciating that at the moment in fact life was not a very beautiful thing at the moment not at all really she bloody hated hers oh melinda was right the book was completely useless damn it all if there was any time she needed a friend it was most surely this moment she wished melinda were there suddenly as she plodded down the chilled stony corridors of the castle lily evans felt quite unabashedly lonely lily spent the night lying awake thinking of a way to properly tell her parents that she would be coming home for the holidays rather permanently each time she composed the letter in her head she had to fight off the urge to cry there was no justifiable reason because she had after all brought this upon herself the next morning she slept in quite set on not attending class since there was really no point she was exhausted and even slept through charlotte complaining loudly in a nails on chalkboard voice about her curl coaxing hair serum in fact it wasntuntil lily felt the soft feathers of her owl brushing against her cheek and under her nose that she finally awoke ugh rue stop that lily eyes burst open to find a pair of gray ones staring back augh lily scrambled upright covering herself with her sheets how the bloody hell did you get in here sirius grinned at her holding up a feather quill james is right you are too much fun lily i repeat how please i sirius black he swatted the air dismissively and i kidnapping you by the way oh are you now lily sunk back into bed and buried her face in her pillow i going to count to three and when i open my eyes you will be gone one two i here for james he said casually he told me to fetch you and ta da sirius grinned delightedly lily lifted her head sirius i have to attend a governing board meeting in she glanced at her clock and grimaced an hour to determine my fate at this school i ve slept this long yes you re quite lazy now get up sirius was perusing the room apparently not the least bit concerned about lily looming expulsion he was examining one of lily unmentionables put that down she gasped leaping out of bed and tearing it out of his hands you letch dontyou have class this morning sirius shrugged and moved on to some other trinkets lying about what are you going to do about it i dontsee that shiny badge of yours around here anymore good point but that doesntmean i have to come with you lily frowned at him he had just picked up something off the floor and popped it into his mouth i going to the bathroom to dress when i come out you d better be gone sirius grimaced and spit the unidentified object back out into his hand he waved lily off well that not going to happen so hurry up in there lily closed the door and groaned this was getting ridiculous exactly how much was james going to interfere and more importantly what was he planning that he couldnthave come to get her himself she stared idly at herself in the mirror a moment and rubbed the bags beneath her eyes bugger well a ponytail was really the best she could do though it didntreally matter how she looked in front of the school governors wasntgoing to change the fact that she burned down the bloody library when lily emerged again sirius was lounging on her bed perusing a copy of witch weekly looking er fab love he tossed the magazine aside and stood up er where are you going she reached for the doorknob to get some lunch he snatched her cloak off the end of her bed and jumped in front of her no fraid not put this on sirius please this is ridiculous now move aside lily tried to shuffle around him but he kept blocking her black out of my way lily made to shove him aside but the instant she lifted her arms he snaked a hand around her waist and tossed her over his shoulder sorry love i acting on strict orders from the best mate with that and lily shrieking loudly in his ear he tossed james invisibility cloak over them and in a flash disappeared james peered up from his table at the hog head and frowned there you are what took you so bloody long sirius ignored him and turned to the bar where a grouchy old man was scouring a dirty glass lo aberforth sirius slapped a hand on the counter sending a puff of dust into the air the barkeep grunted and continued scrubbing the mug in his hand lily was dropped to the floor in a daze but when she spotted james her eyes immediately became slits she stomped across the empty tavern and slammed her open palms on the surface of the table in front of him his drink wobbled and sloshed a bit just what do you bloody think you re doing potter james grinned lily relax i have a plan she leaned in with a dangerous look in her eye and thunked him on the forehead ow james potter you are going to take me back to my bed in gryffindor tower this instant or i ll i ll you ll what he leaned gingerly on his elbow give me a detention lily mouth was agape at a loss for words that what i thought james stood up and slung his arm around her shoulder roughly now lils darling you completely disobeyed me the first time and turned yourself in to mcgonagall well i not going to allow that i sorry james lily grimaced tugging free of james grasp i afraid you cantturn back time perhaps not but i can change the future lily folded her arms and how do you plan on doing that she held out a demonstrative hand by holding me for ransom in a whiskey sodden shack sirius plopped down at the table next to lily dropping a foaming mug of something that looked suspiciously unlike butterbeer onto the chipped wood surface lily have a seat he yanked her cloak so that she plopped unwillingly into the chair beside him lily frowned at something sticky and green on the floor beneath her feet james began pacing back and forth in front of her while sirius snaked an arm around her shoulder and pulled her in tight it very simple really we re going to floo you straight to the hearing so the governing board wonthave a chance to send their own goons to bring you in lily looked offended they were going to escort me they think i wontshow up of my own accord sirius shrugged you re a right felon now arentyou lily frowned but he had a point she was a delinquent in their eyes what was stopping her from ditching the thing right james continued face suddenly flushed and i frankly hated the thought of them manhandling you like a criminal which you aren t lily felt a tug at the corner of her mouth was it possible he actually cared about her well being regardless she was still uncertain of this little plan because so far all she d seen was the inside of a smelly tavern and was most definitely doing something against the rules anyway james brushed away his anger the scowl becoming a self satisfied grin i ve got you a way out lily just glared at him this is ridiculous i leaving i not going to let your little antics get me into anymore trouble sirius leapt out of his chair and blocked her path whoa whoa i afraid you cantdo that love james nudged sirius out of the way and placed his hands on lily shoulders lily please just give me a chance i i know i ve been a complete prat but you ve got to trust me on this one i ve been in far worse situations and there is one thing that always always gets me out of it just let me help you frowning lily stared james down she searched his hazel eyes for any flicker of mischief or malice but she found none what she did see though it shocked her to admit was genuine concern lily sighed all right let go james grinned and took lily hand dragging her over behind the bar aberforth we ll take that floo powder now they were following the grumbling old man up a set of stairs when lily noticed sirius wasntwith them arentyou coming he took another swig from his glass and winked no love i ve got to get to class when they arrived at the place of the meeting a dimly let yet richly decorated round room lined with several doors they were already late a wizard directed them through one of the doors and lily took a deep breath james took her hand gently and ushered her inside immediately all eyes turned on them lily blushed the room was small but crammed full of chairs for spectators of which there were only a few and at the head was a long curved table lined with several chairs each filled with a witch or wizard robed in black and silver ah grimaced a slender old man with a pinched face she arrives at last lily felt her cheeks flush even deeper james frowned donahue looking pasty as always the old man fumed and banged his gavel turning to the other witches and wizards shall we resume albertson gerald if you wouldntmind collecting the defendant in question he indicated to two rather large cloaked men in the corner they moved in on lily making to grab her but james stepped in their way pushing lily behind him she ll sit with me for now thanks the beefy men frowned with their fish lips and turned bewilderedly to donahue for instruction donahue looked as if he wanted to scream but instead nodded curtly albertson and gerald made their way back to their little corner and continued to look stern and brooding james took lily hand and sat her down beside him in the front row while you were taking your precious time miss evans donahue announced tersely the board came to a decision lily held her breath and squeezed james hand unconsciously her stomach twisting and turning an elderly woman stood and read gingerly from a piece of parchment it is the decision of the esteemed governing board of the howarts school of witchcraft and wizardry that the offending student miss lily evans be permanently expe i would highly advise going no further with that statement a deep voice boomed from across the room lily and james turned to see who had spoken a tall elderly man strode across the room clutching a fistful of parchment he slammed his hands down on the immaculately carved table and spread the parchment out before the governors he stood back hands folded neatly behind him donahue looked extra pale all of a sudden why mr potter i didntrealize we d be having the pleasure of lily blanched as white as donahue turning to james with an indescribable expression he simply watched his father intently muttering under his breath as if urging his father on believe me there is no pleasure on my part mr potter interrupted nodding his head in the direction of his son i ve been informed by my son of the ill fate of his friend miss evans i do believe my son came to you with the explicit claim that it was he who had a hand in the aforementioned crime did he not he did but donahue wiped the sweat from his brow and i do appreciate your sincere certainty that my son is innocent in the matter however in doing so you call my son a liar donahue looked a tad peeved with all due respect mr potter i afraid you ve directed your respect to the wrong fellow i ll have you look over these student records here though i sure you have already but allow me to refresh your memories lily evans was not only a prefect but top of her class with an outstandingly perfect record mr potter graying hair gave him a very regal air as he began pacing his eggplant velvet robes swishing behind him that is until she became acquainted with my son the governors exchanged glances as much as i love him my son does have his faults as we can all agree upon comparing their records i think it clear the amount of coercion that likely went on mr potter stopped pacing and turned to directly face the governors i certain that my son will be very willing to join miss evans in serving on the student formed committee to help with the restoration of the tarnished library property just as i will be more than willing to make a sizeable donation to more than cover the repairs of the library and i sure that we can all come to the agreement that this was simply a terrible terrible accident regrettable to both parties his hazel eyes twinkled and made him appear half his age donahue looked visibly shaken but satisfied well then you are of course one of hogwarts greatest benefactors he banged the gavel upon acceptance of a generous donation to cover repair costs miss evans will be pardoned of her crime lily heart seized up she looked tearfully to james who was grinning but the smile didntquite reach his eyes lily glanced down and realized she was still holding james hand probably soaking him with sweat but she didntcare she leapt out of her chair and wrapped her arms around his neck burying her face in his shoulder thank you she whispered squeezing him tight james smiled and pulled her gently off of him adjusting his robes no problem but his smile froze when he locked eyes with his father who was making his way back down the short aisle to the doorway lily stopped mr potter touching his sleeve lightly sir i cantbegin to thank you enough whatever can i do to repay you james father stared down at her stolidly no need to worry child he glanced at james you ve done plenty he shunned her and turned to his son your mother and i will be waiting for you at home with that mr potter disappeared through the door what on earth was that about lily stared after him dontmind him james scowled see didnti tell you it would be alright yes but now i feel as if i entirely indebted to your family lily fretted pale from nerves what will i do you re father must be donating an exorbitant amount to keep me in school relax james waved it off it no big deal you dontowe him anything i do lily frowned what do you mean james shrugged never mind let get you back to hogwarts all right lily said tentatively but only if you let me buy you a butterbeer on the way she nudged him playfully in the side james grinned i suppose i can accept that offer chapter fifteen family reunion part ii lily wasntsure where to contact melinda but she desperately wished she could to tell her the good news unfortunately it had been an entire week since she left and lily hadntreceived a single word she was getting worried about her but there were other things to worry for as well for example it was hogsmeade weekend and lily family was coming for an unfortunate visit though with the library incident behind her lily was relieved to say there was still the issue of her debt to be concerned with she d already made arrangements with the shop owner along with the special permission of dumbledore to work off her debt on weekends of course the way she was going it was going to take a century and a half to pay it all off the biggest problem however was the fact that lily mum didntexactly know of her massive debt and she definitely didntintend on telling her her record was pretty much tarnished at school but that didntmean it had to be so at home unfortunately this meant that she had to work at alexandria fine fittings during the same hour her family was meeting her at the three broomsticks predicament yes solution she was er working on that well she did have some semblance of a plan but it wasntexactly a plan she was looking forward to executing she was going to have to force herself to be extra nice james lily approached him tentatively he was sitting with remus sirius and peter eating his lunch and guffawing at something sirius had just said he turned when he heard her voice and smirked lils what brings you to the dodgy end ha ha ha ha she forced a giggle that so funny ha ha the four of them just stared at her er lily are you feeling all right james frowned yes i fine she cleared her throat perhaps that was overkill could i talk to you for a moment sirius nudged remus wiggling his eyebrows suggestively lily chose to ignore this and waited for james to follow her out of the great hall what is it he was still frowning is everything all right of course lily waved a hand dismissively er well sort of i need to ask you a favor as soon as she said the word a slow smirk began to creep across james features and his eyes began twinkling mischievously he sunk back against the wall leaning casually and giving her an expectant look yes you know what lily let out a short nervous little laugh never mind this is silly she was just turning away when james latched onto her arm pulling her toward him no no no lils he stared down at her playfully you finish what you started lily stared back at him gulping down the nervous lump in her throat i just er his hazel eyes glittered go on he was inching her closer to him until she could feel the warmth of his body nearly pressed against hers i she stared down at her shoe my mum and sister are coming to hogsmeade this weekend and well she forced herself to meet his gaze i need you to meet with them james laughed well lily i didntrealize we were that serious you want me to meet the family this soon lily yanked her arm from his grasp we are not anything i just i ve got to work james laughed again working where could you possibly be working you re a student she blushed you know i have that debt she mumbled the word debt i have to pay it off somehow so i made arrangements to work there on the weekends but this weekend your mum is dropping by and you donthave the heart to tell her james finished exactly so what you need me to distract her he raised an eyebrow well for lack of a better phrase yes she shrugged please james i know you ve already helped me enough but i just i really need you to do this for me then i promise i ll never ask anything of you again she eyed him pleadingly he tilted his head all right i ll do it really lily gaped no strings attached right o james yawned and loosened his tie i going to get back to my lunch okay great lily said excitedly thank you james really you re a lifesaver i know he smirked waltzing back through the double doors i bloody fabulous lily was grinning to herself all the way back to gryffindor tower she was just turned the corner to the portrait of the fat lady when she heard a muffled shriek she hesitated and held her breath was she hearing things a soft thud came from further down the corridor lily swallowed hard and pulled out her wand no she heard a female voice say give it back it mine now you dontdeserve it an unidentifiable voice replied roughly lily rounded the corner wand pointed at the two figures hidden in a dark alcove what going on a third year blonde girl and an older boy perhaps fifth year stared fearfully back at lily the boy wearing ravenclaw robes she noticed took off running stop lily cried after him he ignored her and she blasted him with a mild charm that tugged at the heels of his feet and sent him tumbling he landed hard on the ground with a crack and whatever he d been clutching tightly to his chest hit the floor and shattered into hundreds of glittering pieces no cried the girl she ran towards it and dropped to her knees cradling a few of the shimmering shards lily stood over the boy wand pointed at him he rolled over to reveal handsome features and shining blue eyes he sat up a bitter look reforming on his face he saw the girl picking up the shards and scowled better broken than with you the girl turned on him and shouted how could you lily decided it was time to interject what exactly is going on she doesntdeserve it it was our mothers and she never would have approved of her dating that thing lily looked bewildered thing what thing she followed the boy foul indicative gaze back to the dark alcove there had been another person there hidden in the shadows and it was a wonder she hadntnoticed before considering his size kenneth lily gaped what are you doing here he stared at his toes cheeks flaming snogging my sister that what the boy yelled that filthy traitor snogging wow lily never knew he had it in him she shook her head what are you talking about do you know who his parents are traitors they betrayed dumbledore for you know who do you know what his parents did to our mum he spat murdered her on the spot when she refused to admit she d helped one of dumbledore men shh the blonde girl hissed you canttalk about things like that here lily looked to kenneth what is he talking about kenneth was flaming red my parents would never do something like that but lily could hear the hint of doubt in his wobbly voice the blonde girl moved to kenneth side and took his shaking hand it okay i know you re a good person whatever your parents might be the boy stood up shaking with fury i ve had it do whatever you want but dontexpect dad to let him set foot in our house ever lily grabbed hold of the boy you she shook him go to dumbledore now and i ll know if you make it there or not so no skiving off she shoved him lightly in the right direction the boy stomped past his sister and kenneth shooting them both nasty glares kenneth and the girl stood there petrified i cantbelieve him she spat he always like this and now look what he done lily crouched down and examined the pieces upon closer inspection she could see that whatever the object was it had been comprised of polished shell and was very delicate pulling out her wand she concentrated very hard and muttered reparo amazingly the pieces gently worked themselves back together to form a delicate little box with an inscription in some other language the girl gasped thank you how did you manage that with such a simple spell she took the delicate box from lily amazed just a bit more concentration she smiled it not always in the words but rather the mind she said informatively kenneth lumbered forward and nodded to lily er thanks lily i guess being a nark can come in handy sometimes lily frowned i suppose it can i ingrid the girl jutted out her hand to lily ingrid lofgren lily shook it with a smile wait she hesitated lofgren like mila she nodded she my sister and that she jerked her head in the direction her brother had sped off was my brother dirk and thank you again it no problem lily said kindly you two be careful they nodded and wandered off down the hall lily pondered a bit being cooped up in hogwarts sometimes kept her in a bubble she often forgot the dark times they were in the year had been quite mild however there was an uprising a few years ago but the ministry had quelled it and things were appearing to simmer down a bit yet there was still disquiet among many lily shook the thought away and instead marveled about the coincidence small school she thought to herself as she entered the portrait hole it was too bad mila wasntmore like ingrid otherwise they might actually have gotten along this of course only depressed lily further it served to remind her exactly how friendless she truly was it was that moment that she bumped into a small fumbling person madeline lily cried where have you been and with her unfortunately were charlotte and her posse madeline blushed and readjusted her spectacles lily charlotte simpered how lovely to see your face again i thought you were expelled well i wasn t lily smiled tersely back charlotte made no effort to mask her disappointment well that a shame but lily noticed charlotte was looking a bit more haggard than usual well as in she was wearing less eye makeup and her clothes looked a tad rumpled they pushed past lily roughly florence and helen giving her good old fashioned stink eye on the way out madeline however hung back ever so briefly giving lily a shy smile i glad you re still here she whispered madeline charlotte shouted and she scurried off the portrait hole shut and lily smiled to herself perhaps things werentgoing to be so bad after all at least that what she had been trying to tell herself all morning as she sorted through bins of dress robes pricking her fingers and face ouch on various sizes of pins and dealing with galleons to blow customers who couldntdecided on periwinkle or cornflower and sent her back and forth twenty three times until finally deciding on both all the while lily kept taking bathroom breaks hilda her boss with glittering gem studded nails assumed lily had some sort of bladder problem and suggested on the fourth run in a half hour that she see a healer as soon as possible but what she was really doing of course was desperately running between her job and her mum lily burst through the door of the three broomsticks for the fourth time looking even more haggard she whipped the name badge of her chest nearly forgetting and stumbled back over to her mum and sister her mother looking radiant beamed at lily it is just so wonderful here she glanced excitedly around the crowded tavern petunia simply looked bored you should seriously get your bladder checked out she frowned this is like the fourth time you ve gone to the loo now petunia her mum chimed in they dontcall them loos here in the wizarding world er do they darling her mum looked at lily expectantly but lily was distracted she was staring out the window nervously where the hell was james he was already twenty minutes late it was getting exceedingly difficult to balance her time darling her mum prodded huh oh sure they do god mum petunia groaned cantyou see what this stupid school is doing to her she like a zombie or something it weird hush be polite her mother scolded oh look at that is that a broomstick oh lovely i suppose it sweeps the floor itself then no mum actually they re used for flying came a voice from behind lily i should know i ride them day in day out lily whirled around james she sighed with relief he grinned wow she had to hand it to him he looked sharp his tie was adjusted properly his hair was reasonably combed and it appeared he d actually put on a clean shirt her mother stood to shake james hand and who is this she gave lily a little wink my he so handsome i james potter he replied with a winning grin and a wink at petunia who blushed sincerely lily boyfriend lily jaw hit the floor his what her mother looked shocked as well well i had no idea lily how could you keep such a charming young man hidden but lily glared but james cut her off lils dearest he took her by the hand lacing his fingers through hers and swinging her arm slightly for good measure why dontyou go help peter with that potion real quick i ll keep your mum and sister company while you re gone no wait i lily stammered really lily it fine go take care of what you need to dontlet your old mummy get in your way i ll just chat with james here james turned to lily his teeth sparkled yes lily your mother and i will have a little chat but dontdawdle now he said planting a big wet kiss on lily cheek she flushed from head to toe with fury as he shoved her out the door great lily began grinding her teeth trying to get a glimpse of her mother and sister with james but it was too crowded she grunted angrily and ran back to alexandria s hilda kept shouting at her to be gentler with the merchandise but lily was finding it a bit difficult to keep calm what the bloody hell was she thinking asking james potter to keep her petunia and her mother company merlin knew what else he was telling them at that very moment and excuse her but her boyfriend she thought not throwing the glittery purple robe she was holding back into a bin she slipped out the side door another twenty minutes has already gone by and she was dreading to know what else james had opened his big fat mouth about she scurried down the cobblestone streets and burst through the door of the broomsticks there they were laughing gaily at something or other probably at lily expense knowing james she plastered a grin on her face and stumbled through the crowd over to their table she plopped down next to james making a point to grind her heel into his left foot he grimaced and stared at her hard through gritted teeth hello lils i was just telling annabelle and petunia here about out first date you know the one in the library sounds boring petunia frowned into her warm mug of butterbeer one last time before pushing it gingerly away oh no it was very exciting he smiled never taking his eyes off lily oh i would love to hear about it her mother exclaimed no lily exclaimed really it not that great of a story i that not true james eyed lily shirt strangely but lily didntseem to notice thinking about it just makes me fall in love with her all over again lily gaped and was fighting off the urge to slap him when he leaned in taking advantage of her open mouth and kissed her she felt his hand grasp her shirt and tug when he let her go his eyes lingered on hers lily blinked out of her daze and glanced down at her lap to see james holding her alexandria nametag she looked back at him with a mix of surprise and gratitude aw how sweet lily mother clasped her hands and sighed you two are just adorable your father will be thrilled lily lily blushed avoiding james gaze suddenly her mother stood well petunia and i must be going i know you re a busy girl but hopefully at christmas we ll be able to spend more time together all five of us lily nodded and smiled then blanched wait what er five of us yeah james chimed in annabelle here invited me to your christmas dinner this year isntthat kind of her what lily gaped i think it will be lovely annabelle smiled warmly i just know henry will adore james they re so much alike lily very much doubted the likeness between conniving james and her clumsy father but there were deeper concerns on her mind at the moment like say james potter coming to her home on christmas no i dontthink that a good idea oh lils dontbe shy james grinned his eyes flickering mischievously but she gritted her teeth dontyou have other plans with your own family nah james brushed the thought away with a hand they re traveling to france this year to visit my cousin we ll be celebrating the week before you can meet my parents then oh how lovely annabelle simpered that will be just fine i sure she ll make a sparkling impression she always does she pinched lily cheek mum lily grimaced i just don t no i wonthear anything different it wontbe any trouble annabelle said firmly now my darling you be good james dear keep my daughter safe it was a pleasure meeting you the pleasure was all mine annabelle he leaned in and kissed her hand gracefully she tittered and blushed petunia had to tug on her sleeve to get her going come on mum she was already halfway out the door eyeing a crowd of students suspiciously well goodbye then she hugged lily tight and then gave james a peck on the cheek we ll be seeing you she winked and the two of them were off well james said satisfactorily loosening his tie that went well lily immediately turned on him her eyes icy and her finger jabbing him violently in the chest you are not coming for christmas no way james shrugged i cantturn annabelle down now it would be rude lily backed james up to a wall stop calling my mum that james you cannot show up at christmas why not he pouted but his twinkling eyes betrayed him you just just can t you lied to my mum we are not dating what else did you tell her that he said primly is between annabelle and i oh dontgive me that crap lily growled jabbing him again with her finger and i am most certainly not coming with you to your christmas james shook his head you re mother is such a sweet woman too it would be a shame what would be a shame lily narrowed her eyes well she gave me her address it would be terrible if my wrist accidentally slipped and she found out about your debt to alexandria s lily narrowed her eyes you wouldnt james shrugged people do strange things when they re in love he pointed at the clock you d better hurry back to work lils darling tick tock he laughed and sauntered off leaving lily shaking with fury she slapped her nametag back on and stormed out the door chapter sixteen the truth it doesntmatter anyway but charlotte i not having this conversation anymore helen charlotte primly opened the door of the bathroom through which lily couldnthelp overhearing she froze when she spotted lily reading a textbook in bed when did you get in she snarled i ve been here all morning lily said dryly helen bounded out behind charlotte and gave lily a hideous look are you wearing that to the yule ball she gasped at the light brown faded bundle of fabric hanging off one of her bedposts lily sighed yes i wouldntgo if i had the choice but i a prefect so helen bit her lip that tragic charlotte shook the curls from her eyes with a laugh there is no way you ll find a date with that well i sure you ll find one but keeping him with you that another story thank you charlotte i will keep that in mind lily went back to her book i going down for breakfast are you coming helen charlotte prodded helen was still gazing in awe at the hideousness of lily dress i thought you were going shopping with your father today helen said mindlessly charlotte plump lips turned down at the edges well daddy is very busy today so we had to reschedule oh right helen gulped as if she realized she d just made some horrific error and would pay for it later charlotte glared coming helen scurried out the door not meeting her eye lily watched them leave and eyeballed the closed door bewilderedly strange but charlotte did have the ticket she thought as her stomach began to rumble lily marked her page and headed down for some food her thoughts drifted to the yule ball she wasntsure who she was going to ask since no one was going to ask her well unless no no that wasntgoing to happen was it would james potter ask her to the yule ball despite the fact that she was dreading his christmas invitation to her home and wearing that hideous dress of course she found herself getting tiny butterflies in the pit of her stomach after all she d only attended the yule ball once and it was a horrid disaster her date actually tried to get up her skirt and then started a rumor about the size of her knickers after she slapped him away the nerve lily hugged herself in the chilly hallway and dreamed about the dance even letting her mind imagine one only one slow dance with james it was all seeming pretty nice a strange scuffling noise stopped her in her tracks she looked around but the corridor appeared empty she started on her way but she heard it again this time lily pulled out her wand she hadntforgotten the incident with dirk and ingrid lofgren and wondered if the whole thing could be happening again she followed the muffled noises and rounded the corner into a dimly lit corridor she treaded lightly holding her wand in a defensive stance lily froze it was james but he wasntalone the girl he was with had a cascade of dark locks and had him pressed against the side of a statue his hands were around her waist and he laced his fingers through her hair then they kissed lily was speechless softly as if she d never been there she crept backwards and flattened herself against the cool stonewall to catch her breath tears were stinging her eyes but she brushed them away roughly this was ridiculous why was she crying and over james of all people after the way he treated her she shook it off and strode back down the hall her hands balled into fists it wasnther business anyway what he did with other girls she and james werenttogether after all a tear trickled down her cheek and she wiped it away she wasntpaying attention and she slammed straight into someone else oh i so sorry lily exclaimed quickly wiping the last of her tears are you oka oh mila lofgren was staring back at her sheepishly her hands were clasped primly in front of her and she couldntseem to look lily in the eye er she began hi hello lily was hesitant mila smoothed her long blonde hair nervously and lifted her eyes to meet lily s they were a bright resonating crystal blue and they stood out strongly against the pale palette of her skin and faded eyebrows i heard what you did for ingrid oh and i just wanted to apologize lily held her breath i shouldnthave acted the way i did i just i misjudged you she looked at lily expectantly i of course it okay lily shook her head i just hope we can be friends mila smiled good i glad i can be a real bitch sometimes lily shrugged and suddenly felt as if a giant weight had been lifted well cantwe all they laughed together in the halls washing their nerves away so where are you headed mila asked breakfast want to join me mila grinned i starved it turned out that lily had more in common with mila than she d ever expected despite the icy look she was a warm giggly person in fact so giggly that they spent the entire breakfast time laughing about things that really werentall that funny unless you had the giggle bug they finally fell silent lily crunching on a piece of toast she set it down mid bite and gazed at the double doors james has just wandered in his hair extra disheveled and an indescribable look on his face he caught lily gaze and nodded to her with a grin she immediately flushed and turned away mila eyed her curiously are you and james together what lily practically shouted no no of course not lily mila stared at her everyone can tell he got it bad for you well they re wrong lily grumbled they didntknow how wrong mila shook her head i dontknow i mean i ve seen the way he looks at you well it not true lily heard herself shouting her knife clattering loudly on her plate okay i sorry mila said nervously i didntmean to no lily felt herself flush she took a deep breath and tried to bite back the prickly feeling rising in her eyes i sorry i really sorry she stared down at the palms of her hands mila looked genuinely concerned i know we dontreally know each other that well and i dontwant to pry but did something happen lily heaved a sigh he just not who i thought he was he good at playing games she gave mila a forced smile mila raised her eyebrows but didntprobe any further they parted ways in the hall mila heading to ravenclaw and lily to gryffindor tower lily was halfway there when she spotted james there he was leaning against a pillar looking damnably blas clearly waiting for her her stomach lurched he was of course the last person she was keen on seeing at the moment there you are he said what are you avoiding me now lily put her head down and pushed past him but he caught her arm and spun her around hello i talking to you james just leave me lily began but was interrupted by a shrill voice jaaamsiiieeee charlotte was tottering down the hall her curls bouncing james wait he sighed at the sight of her and let go of lily arm charlotte ignored her presence and looked lovingly into james eyes i need to ask you something what she puckered a bit and tipped her head just as helen and florence caught up panting behind her she said you have the honor of taking me to the yule ball this year that was a question james frowned charlotte waved her hand dismissively well you were taking so long to ask i thought i d just give you my answer now no charlotte blinked what she stared at him blankly why it doesntmatter charlotte he growled because i already have a date charlotte looked positively ravaged as she gasped what she shot lily a sudden accusing glare you mean with her helen and florence looked as if they might pass out the horror they cried in unison lily glared back no it isnt me is it james james glowered at her i donthave to explain myself to you lily bit her cheek fine if that how we re going to play it lily james leaned in dangerously close that how it been played from the beginning hasntit charlotte suddenly felt very uncomfortable to salvage the remains of her pride she shot james a withering glare before grabbing the wrists of florence and helen and whisking around the corner lily kept her eyes settled steadfastly on james the intensity was unwavering she took a step closer so that the fronts of their robes brushed ever so lightly together something wavered momentarily in lily eyes as she asked softly who is she james james felt his heart seize up unexpectedly i she never mind lily shook her head and there were suddenly several paces of distance between them she was already making her way down the corridor forget i asked forget everything she trailed off turning away from him james didntfollow groaning lily awoke the next morning with a throbbing headache she d barely slept a wink having spent the night brooding over james and his mystery woman regardless she forced herself out of bed she had class to attend and stewing over a boy was not going to get her an o in advanced potions after a quick shower and a careless ponytail lily dragged herself to class skipping breakfast running into james was the last thing she wanted right now and he was bound to be either stuffing his face with toast and jam or raven haired girl he could take his pick really lily she heard a voice coming from behind her she was relieved to see mila smiling face when she turned morning you dontlook so good mila tilted her head look i ve been thinking james must have done something to upset you so what better way to make yourself feel better than to get some revenge lily frowned mila i dontknow all she really wanted was to crawl back in bed and forget she d ever met james potter there only one way to drive a guy mad she smirked taking lily hand jealousy with a bit of blush and some lash curler lily didntclean up so bad her auburn hair was down and tousled with thick face framing curls she peered back at herself in the mirror and licked her lips well here goes nothing she thought to herself climbing delicately down the stairs from the girls dormitory being careful not to trip and fall flat on her face in her borrowed heels lily made her way into the common room she received more than a few stares she blushed mila had hiked up lily skirt more than necessary and undid the first couple buttons of her blouse she felt like a tramp but mila guaranteed it would get his attention and lily wasnttoo picky at the moment perhaps it was a blatant signal of desperation but there was still the off chance it might just work james was lounging by the fire with sirius and peter scribbling something down on parchment the firelight cast a warm flickering glow across his features making them appear even more angular and strong lily tottered over to where they sat nearly tripping once but she hoped no one noticed that it was james whose eyes caught a glimpse of her first and had to do a double take actually the second take was of her chest which simply made her blush deeper evans james dropped what he was doing and sat up straight she ignored him and walked straight over to sirius who was propped comfortably on the couch peter choked on his water and wiped away the dribble making its way down his chin the firelight made her long slender legs glow and her thick auburn locks burn brighter her back was to james but she could feel his eyes boring into her lily sirius jaw dropped he made no effort to hide the appreciative once over his eyes gave her lily he said again with a grin lily lips curved seductively sirius i was wondering if i could ask you a question alone sirius gave james a hesitant glance but james was still gaping at lily so he took the opportunity to give her an emphatic nod james watched frozenly at them now across the room chatting a boiling rage began in the pit of his stomach and spread throughout his whole body just what the hell did she think she was doing and with sirius lily tugged playfully on sirius tie and pressed herself against him sirius ran a hand through his hair said something that made her laugh james felt his chest tighten as he saw lily lips distinctly form the words yule ball sirius replied with another emphatic nod with a coy smile lily flicked his tie and then headed back up to the girl dormitory james was blind with rage so when sirius waltzed back up looking dazed james hardly took notice peter just eyed him expectantly well he asked sirius grinned purple he said his eyes starry what peter prodded her knickers they re purple and that when james punched him in the face so mila looked at lily expectantly how did it go well i think she said nervously tugging her skirt back down sirius said yes mila gasped that fabulous sirius black is taking you to the yule ball he so pretty she said dreamily lily smiled yeah but my dress isn t she stared at the gloomy thing on her bedpost mila opened her mouth but it was charlotte who cut her off you re not wearing that to the yule ball charlotte said matter of factly storming across the room well i donthave much else to wear lily grumbled do we really have to keep having this conversation charlotte stopped at the edge of lily bed where she and mila sat look she took a deep breath and placed a hand on her hip as far as i can tell we ve both been wronged by james and the only way to make sure he leaves his date whoever the bitch may be is to work together to make him jealous i think lily doing a pretty good job of that so far mila grinned i sorry work together as in you and me lily stared well why not four boobs are better than two right er mila sniggered but was silenced when charlotte pulled out a large black bag you can borrow this lily thought she was going to faint emerging gloriously from the bag was a set of satin emerald robes trimmed with a creamy lace she dropped it in a heap on lily bed as if it were a three week old daily prophet it from two years ago it will probably be a little tight on you but florence knows a good seamstress charlotte lily gaped i i dontknow what to say yes well she dismissed her with a wave of her manicured hand but there was a small flicker of satisfaction on her face just try not to sweat on it too much lily grinned and bit her lip thank you she said genuinely grateful this was going to be a ball to remember lily was going to make certain of that what the hell was i supposed to say sirius growled pressing a cold damp cloth to his eye she looked so bloody gorgeous his eyes shimmered dreamily again no would have been advisable james roared nursing his fist she not just another one of your conquests you know sirius glared at him you think i dontknow that he shook his head she definitely something special somehow that didntcomfort james any more just dont do anything all right sirius laughed put yourself in a room with her all night and we ll see who does nothing sorry prongs but i cantpromise anything i ll put that other bloody eye out black james roared clenching his fist james he said seriously be realistic at sirius words his face fell you know that james sighed he did know he couldnttake lily to the yule ball just promise you ll treat her right okay sirius shook his head knowingly of course mate i promise a n thank you all again for the great reviews and support sorry this chapter a bit late i ve started up my semester again and things are pretty hectic i ll try to tend to my other stories as well when i get time chapter eighteen dinner party lily grumbled to herself as she hauled her overnight bag down the aisle this was going to be disastrous she just knew it didntsirius remember the sizeable donation that james parents made on her behalf to the school in order to keep her from getting kicked out that wasntexactly the type of thing that happened to good girls let me get that for you sirius took her bag and slung it over his shoulder finally they had arrived at their stop they stepped off the train with a few other students on their christmas holiday the air was crisp out in the country lily observed as she took a deep cleansing breath she followed sirius into the station where the ticket master was taking their stubs and handing out small pouches of floo powder he glanced at lily stub and exchanged it for floo right off you go he said brightly lily and sirius found an empty fireplace in a row against the wall together they tossed in the powder and went whirling through the flames at sirius vocal command an instant later they tumbled out onto an intricately embroidered afghan rug well here we are sirius held out his hands the potter residence lily could barely believe her eyes aside from the cluster of chandeliers overhead there were numerous crystal vases lining the mantle of the fireplace they d just come crashing out of the carpet was white the sofa and curving settees were white the thick textured draperies framing the expansive windows were white and there was lily covered in soot from head to toe brilliant master black cooed a deep refined voice it is as always a divine pleasure lily turned her head to make eye contact with a man she found extraordinarily familiar the very first thing she noticed was the giant mole on his chin he peered down at lily over the bridge of his prominent nose and raised a thin eyebrow and who might this be suddenly lily remembered he was the ugly man she d bumped into at king cross station when her trolley had overturned he was rude then and rude now ah leatherby old friend sirius patted the man back roughly miss me desperately he snarled dryly it so good to be home sirius exclaimed grandly dropping all of their luggage at leatherby feet leatherby eyed it distastefully and glared at lily madame shall i direct you to your suite my er what your digs love sirius translated yes she ll follow you lily i ll meet you for dinner in an hour er you might want to clean up a little she frowned well all right she wanted answers to several more questions but leatherby apparently the butler james had a butler was already levitating her things down the hallway she abandoned sirius and scurried off behind her bags trying to keep up with the man through several corridors with enchanted candelabras hovering and casting an eerie glow they made their way deeper into the depths of the potter household suits of armor and ancient portraits of potter descendents alternated as d cor along the wallpapered halls lily strained to get a glimpse of each but leatherby was moving quickly and she had to half run to keep up one thing she noticed in common with the majority of the potters was the thick unruly dark hair it seemed that many of the ladies with the help of pins serums and hair combs had managed some semblance of style but the men were hopeless it made her smile leatherby stopped abruptly in front of a large carved wooden door and her bags fell to the ground with an unceremonious clatter your suite miss er thank you she d never really been to such a formal place in the wizarding world before should she tip the man he wedged an ancient key into the doorknob and cranked it with some effort the door creaked open and revealed an elegant four poster draped with a gauzy white fabric the furniture was extravagant carved rosewood and a portrait of a beautiful young girl gazed down at her from across the room lily entered timidly as if trespassing on sacred ground she d never in her life been in a room so immaculate it felt delicate and airy almost dreamlike dinner will be served promptly at seven with that leatherby shut the door with a click lily could hear his heavy footsteps clopping away down the hall she took a deep breath and turned to examine herself in the ornate wall mirror oh lovely the frizz and pasty skin couldntreally be fixed but at least she could wipe the smudged soot from her cheeks once that was finished and she d changed into a clean pair of trousers and a blouse she ventured out into the hallways hmm right she was told to come to dinner but where exactly was it she tried to retrace her steps with leatherby but was failing miserably she d been paying far too much attention to the d cor at this rate she was going to be hideously late she quickened her pace until she was practically jogging the house was massive and each hallway seemed to lead her only to another hallway she felt a bit like alice but with no bloody rabbit to follow she could hear the tick tock of the clock in her head however and was not going to allow herself to be embarrassingly late to her first dinner with the potters flushed and flustered lily rounded a corner and crashed unceremoniously into a large grandfather clock and landed flat on her bum so she wasntimagining the ticking clock ow she groaned massaging her head are you all right lily blinked up dizzily at the slender figure hovering over her and then her stomach knotted behold the elegantly coiffed and groomed edith baldric a glittering shall draped over her otherwise bare shoulders unlike lily edith was dressed to the nines in a shimmering black cocktail dress to match her sleek black french twist a few wispy tendrils framing her face she held out a helpful hand reluctantly lily accepted it and was pulled upright with surprising strength you re quite strong lily said quidditch she said matter of factly i may look like a lady but i sure dontplay like one she laughed brightly great she was a quidditch player too definitely james dream girl thank you lily dusted off her gray slacks and became suddenly aware of how underdressed she actually was dontmention it so you re a friend of james right evans i recognize you prefect sixth year lily nodded you re the head girl edith eyes flickered that right a moment of silence passed in which lily began to feel exceedingly awkward she glanced up at the grandfather clock she d slammed into and noticed the time i think we d better get to dinner fabulous idea edith grinned her perfectly straight teeth sparkling she slipped her slender arm through lily s and tugged her along as if they d been friends for ages lily was shocked by her forwardness but relinquished herself because frankly she had no idea where the dining room was lily let edith guide her through a set of carved wooden doors into an immaculate room lined with arched stained glass windows the table practically filled the length of the room and there were at least fifteen people seated comfortably already silverware clattered onto a plate james was gaping at lily look who arrived with sirius james lily evans your friend right edith held out lily hand as if she were introducing the debutante of the ball lily immediately flushed realizing that she was in fact sorely underdressed all of the women were in dress robes and the men fashionably suited as well and there she was in her old gray slacks and white blouse with the second faux pearl button missing fabulous but james wasntthe only one shocked his father immediately recognized her and his lips curled into a small frown which he tried to hide by taking an unnecessarily large gulp of wine mr potter was seated next to a tall elderly woman she was very beautiful with thick graying curls pinned with gem encrusted combs like mr potter she too had a regal air about her and when she spotted lily her nose seemed to turn up a bit literally well the woman presumably james mother said replacing her glass on the table how lovely of you to come please have a seat the woman may not have recognized her but lily sure recognized the woman she was with leatherby at king cross station that first day at hogwarts the one she rammed into with her trolley how humiliating lily treaded lightly over to sirius who was grinning broadly at her burgundy wine sloshing from his glass cheers love she plopped down beside him her cheeks nearly as brilliant as the wine thanks for letting me know the dress code she hissed to him the empty glass before her filled itself instantly and she had to restrain herself from chugging the entire thing james father stood and smoothed the front of his cloak raising the wine glass in his other hand it wonderful of you all to come i would like to first raise a toast to my son and his lovely future bride they all clinked glasses with a collective cheers lily caught james eyeing her over the rim of his glass but he turned away quickly when edith touched him lightly and leaned in for a kiss lily nearly choked on her drink now let eat mr potter said grandly the moment he took his seat the plates began to fill with all sorts of succulent dishes roast pig heaping bowls of scalloped potatoes and creamy yams steaming loaves of bread lily was overwhelmed the feast was even grander than hogwarts really eleanor a middle aged blonde woman said from across the table you keep the finest elves in your kitchens where do you find them oh james mother simpered they ve been in the family for ages nearly as old as leatherby i should say the table chuckled somehow lily didntthink the butler would appreciate that observation eleanor turned to lily suddenly so tell me dear she raised an eyebrow where are you from london i presume lily coughed er much further north actually are you familiar with spinner end the blonde woman choked on the very food she d just complimented oh the look on eleanor face was unreadable is that where you were raised well near there lily was suddenly very desperate to change the subject a couple at the end of the table was snickering your home is lovely the smile only flashed across her features briefly thank you you know you do look so familiar we must have met oh no i dontthink but lily was interrupted by the hovering leatherby who d just wandered past to collect a bit of china from a nearby cabinet she a bit crude with a trolley madame he droned in passing ah yes her eyes flickered i knew i d seen you somewhere she turned to the other guests we had a bit of a run in at king cross she lost control of the trolley eleanor turned back to lily i do hope your skill with rolling objects has improved everyone at the table tittered mum please james frowned setting down his glass oh james we re just having a bit of fun arentwe lily er lily forced a smile yes of course she remained silent for the majority of the meal offering up a nod here and there in response to a question or two the women chatted about d cor and witch wellness society meetings discussing plans for future fundraisers edith seemed very involved in everything and eleanor potter along with the other women seemed to hang on her every word she was a delicate eater attuned to the etiquette of high society and handled herself gracefully with each question she also laughed like a twitter bird but it was most unfortunately infectious to everyone else lily wasntwon over though she glared over each sip of wine and tried to focus on sirius conversations but it was hard to follow quidditch talk yes well one of the men who appeared to be the blonde woman husband expounded it all well and good for entertainment but it clear the real galleons are in investing isntthat right james james barely registered the man was even speaking he downed the wine in his glass and it magically refilled itself now i know the man turned to the rest of crowd listening that you hold quite the fancy for that sport james his eyes twinkled i believe at one time you actually wanted to pursue the dream professionally am i right a few people laughed james didntrespond it a good thing your father talked sense into you and edith here seems to have caught on quickly her family made a downright fortune in the cauldron business excellent connection you re making james now it seems you re getting your life on a real track eh he chuckled taking a grand slurp from his glass actually edgar sirius eyed the man with a glint of distaste your nephew is quite talented gives all the teams a run for their money won the cup last year i dontneed you defending me james hissed suddenly standing his glass shattering by some unseen force which sent a current of burgundy across the table it seeped into the white linen its trail ending right at lily plate a few drips landed on her blouse but she like the other guests were not paying attention to the spill their eyes were all on james lily glanced at sirius who had quickly fallen silent but had a dangerously narrow gaze on james james his mother scolded james dropped his napkin and shoved his chair out excuse me edith looked appalled giving a nervous little shrug as if to say i dontknow what possibly could have come over my precious james he never like this but she also didntfollow him out lily swallowed hard and excused herself as well but no one really took notice sirius gave her a solemn glance but didntstop her was it something i said she could hear edgar saying innocently to the rest as she slipped out of the room she peered down the corridors but the mansion was far too big for her to navigate knowing james he likely had some hiding place he sought out for refuge and if no one else could find it a first time guest in the home surely wouldn t so when lily found him perched on the staircase she was more than a bit shocked he didntseem to notice her so she stood there silently watching him for a moment he was quick to loosen his tie and it now hung askew on his rumpled shirt his hands were clasped his head was down and the heel of his left foot was tapping angrily he exhaled gruffly and looked up as he did so catching lily eye hi she said tentatively he stared at her a moment hi lily wandered over pausing in front of him was that your uncle james nodded mum baby brother he seems quite rude james reached out a hand and lily made to move backwards but he only caught the hem of her blouse i spilled on you he rubbed the small red stain between his fingers oh yeah that okay he let go are you with sirius now lily scoffed of course not then why d you come he frowned because he asked me to so you do what he says now do you never listened to me that easily lily glared at him for your information sirius has been a very good friend to me i sure he has james spat lily shook her head not everyone thinks in sexual favors you know padfoot does well not this time can we please drop the subject i just came out to see how you are james leapt up and grabbed her hand his eyes suddenly alight with mischief let get out of here lily was taken aback what where come on let forget this stupid dinner he tugged at her hand james james she jerked her hand free no he looked as if she d slapped him in the face you cantkeep shunning your responsibilities lily reprimanded what do you know about it you ve never done a single irresponsible thing in your life he retorted and dontsay stealing a damned book because lils that doesntcount lily looked hurt i burnt down the library that was a bloody accident james shrugged let face it you re no rebel lily gasped i can so be a rebel i can she added in response to his bored look he shrugged again egging her on i dontknow lily i just dontsee it she glared all right then where are we going wait no no i know what you re trying to do and you will not persuade me to aid in your misbehavior james burst out laughing all of a sudden clutching his stomach what what is so funny her hands were on her hips he continued to laugh tears sparkling in his eyes potter what is so bloody hilarious frustration made her flush james caught his breath and sighed you are too much evans come on let get back to dinner lily frowned well all right but no more making fun of me james grinned making lily lips curve in response promise they walked back towards the dining room side by side and lily felt james slip his hand into hers entwining their fingers but the moment they glanced up they knew they d made a mistake as quickly as they spotted edith they ripped their hands apart but edith had seen the corner of her lip was twitching a bit there you are she said lightly but sent pins and needles lily way everyone is wondering where you went james shoved his hands into his pockets right coming edith slipped her hand through the crook of james arm as he passed by and ushered him back inside she glanced over her shoulder briefly giving lily the chills lily was about to follow but thought better of it instead she ventured back to her room sighing she plopped down listlessly on her bed she peered out the window but there was not much to see in the darkness she began digging through her bag to pull out her outfit for the big christmas party the next day when a small scroll of paper tumbled out with the loosened fabric it was her letter she d almost forgotten carefully unraveling the sheet of white paper lily scanned the scrawled lettering immediately recognizing it as her mother s but only a few lines seemed to really matter didntwant to upset you and petunia before christmastime but you need to know that your father is temporarily out of his job at the office there no need for real concern of course i certain mr wiggins will come to his senses and send a notice of rehire to your father around spring it really was the strangest thing so sudden the business is a roller coaster after all lily dropped the paper to her lap of course her mother thought everything would be all right her mother was an eternal optimist and she clung to the lingering hope that there was a bit of good in everyone mr wiggins however clung to the hope of increasing his profit margin the thought of her bumbling father being sought out for rehire was laughable she crumpled up the letter and tossed it back into her bag her poor father he worked so hard for them happy christmas mr henry evans you ve been sacked sincerest regards mr wiggins she collapsed backwards onto her bed and drifted off to thoughts of the evening james edith and her family and when lily awoke she was greeted by sunlight streaming through her window sparkling on her lashes as she blinked her eyes open it seemed that overnight the mansion had been coated in a fresh layer of snow the country landscape glistened in its new winter coat that morning after a quiet breakfast lily ventured out for a walk sirius seemed to be consumed in a deep discussion with mr potter so lily went alone she sure wasntabout to ask james and edith was a bit preoccupied buttering james toast though she did seem to register lily with a glare when lily excused herself from the table to go find her cloak but a little fresh air was just what she needed only two more days and she could finally be out of this horribly awkward situation her mind drifted back to her family as she trudged down the path moving further and further from the mansion until she stumbled upon a frozen pond hidden behind a cluster of evergreen trees idly she began breaking off bits of ice and skidding them across the frozen surface she had just snapped off a rather large chunk with her heel when a looming shadow made her jump oh you startled me lily stopped mid sentence when she turned to see the shadow caster lily edith said in a sweet voice lily hesitated hello edith stepped delicately over to the edge of the frozen pond and peered at her reflection on the ice shiny surface hmm it a lovely day that it is lily busted off another chunk sending a spray of shaved ice everywhere edith flicked a small piece off the hem of her black skirt and cleared her throat so tell me how long have you known james i dontsee why that important lily didntmean to sound so rude but edith was getting on her nerves didntshe have more brown nosing to attend to edith laughed hollowly well you two seem very comfortable with one another though i wouldntget any ideas ideas about what edith lily eyed edith brazenly she simpered about james i suppose i donthave to worry about that though and why is that exactly i sorry to say lily she crooned but you re just no match for me you re ordinary and someone like james deserves better i unlike you am unrivaled it felt like a rabid cat was clawing lily insides she wanted so badly to scream or just slap the bitch i do fine for myself you can have james potter oh right because you re here with sirius black edith laughed longer than was necessary what the bloody hell was so funny lily tried to push past her but edith blocked her with a heel stay away from james lily glared at edith and scoffed she shoved edith aside rather roughly not giving her the satisfaction of a response edith brushed her jet black waves aside and watched lily darkly as she trekked back up to the mansion the corners of her rosy pink lips curling into a small smirk chapter nineteen proposition guests slowly trickled into the potter mansion as the band struck up a soft tune that echoed throughout the high ceilinged ballroom the tinkling of champagne flutes and hors d oeuvre forks filled lily ears as she trailed in behind sirius she had to hand it to them the potters certainly knew how to throw a party it was the finest christmas ball she d ever attended though she had to admit she hadntattended all that many and certainly none in a place like this lily was moving too slowly she supposed dazzled by the atmosphere around her because just then sirius grabbed her by the hand and tugged her right into the middle of the action she suddenly found herself surrounded by towering hook nosed women in glittering black robes and middle aged men casting her appreciative glances in between their sips of firewhiskey and investment chatter indeed this was not her parent office bash no chili pepper red two piece dresses adorned with glittering green bow pins or santa shaped earrings that somehow always ended up in the cheese dip or punch bowl after 10 p m and certainly no fordhams or davenports to offer up their peaky son to have a dance with the shy little evans girl my what a lady she becoming glancing down at her own appearance lily felt a wave of confidence flow over her she hadntdone so bad for herself after all she d put on her mum vintage cocktail dress which wasntexactly wizard attire but did the trick it was a rich deep blue and a bit slinky around the shoulders so she added a heavy shawl of course the moment sirius spotted her he grinned kissed her cheek and ripped the shawl from her with a wink and a matter of fact you wontbe needing that love which left her simultaneously embarrassed and feeling more than a bit revealed but as lily wandered awkwardly through the crowd she noticed other girls her age in similar dresses one whom she quickly recognized as florence page one of charlotte little cronies florence whose hooked nose so resembled the women around her actually looked quite nice she spotted lily at that moment and with a strange look on her face trotted toward her lily her curved eyebrows gave her a perpetually shocked expression but lily realized upon further inspection that florence had just gotten a bit overzealous with the tweezers what are you doing here er hello florence despite the fact that they had been roommates for the majority of her years at hogwarts lily really knew nothing about her and had only assumed florence was from a crowd like this of course if florence were here then surely evans an incredulous snarl came from behind florence and lily turned to see not charlotte as she d expected but helen halverson dolled up like a queen and striding forth arm in arm with some unassuming blonde boy what are you doing at this party there was a snotty edge to her voice and lily didntlike it much not that she cared for helen all that much in the first place but without charlotte around helen tended to be a least a bit mild mannered toward her i here with sirius black thank you kindly for your interest wait helen scoffed in that obnoxious tone of hers you and sirius helen date held out his hand amiably hello i grant you must be helen friend charlotte but helen swatted it away shooting him a glare you dont speak okay and she isnt charlotte she spat charlotte with nearly as much venom as she had lily last name whoa even florence shot helen a questioning look though it could have just been the deceptive over plucked brows but helen was certainly not acting like helen or at least the helen lily thought she knew it seemed there was an upset in the social order of things and when charlotte wasntaround helen was more than willing to fill the position it appeared a new princess had been crowned helen narrowed her eyes and flashed a teasing smirk as she slunk past lily you dontknow what you re getting yourself into lily raised her eyebrows and frowned as the three of them merged with the chattering crowd and disappeared suffice it to say lily was now feeling all the more uncomfortable helen was right what was she doing here helping sirius but lily thought to herself as she watched him from across the room mingling and joking with the guests did sirius really need her it was pretty clear she didntfit in here as helen and edith had been so helpful to point out thus far she was quickly shaken from her thoughts when she spotted edith across the room attached to her arm of course was james to lily dismay he was wearing a grin and seemed to be accepting a barrage of complements from his guests pertaining to edith appearance as evidenced by her fake little blush and titter of thanks in response lily thought she was going to be sick what was james thinking what were his parents thinking couldntthey see right through her lily was just turning to find the drink table when james caught her stare his expression didntchange but his eyes flickered up and down her body forcing a blush to rise up her neck lily whirled around and stared intently at the wall a moment trying to force the blush back down once she felt she d composed herself she peered back over her shoulder but james and edith had already moved on to mingle with another group frustration welled up inside of her why was she allowing herself to act this way and for what james potter the boy who had treated her like garbage since the day she arrived at hogwarts surely lily evans had more dignity than that she thought glumly to herself flicking a bit of lint from the hem of her cocktail dress ahem a clinking glass summoned lily attention to the center of the ballroom james parents were standing in a small clearing of the crowd and had ushered james and edith in between them beside madame potter was a tall slender couple with willowy dark hair just like their daughter mr baldric seemed bored while his wife pasted on a syrupy grin that didntat all suit her we would just like to wish everyone a happy christmas and thank you all for attending our little affair there was a tinkling of glasses in approval mr potter cleared his throat and continued we would also like to make an official announcement to you all our dearest friends and family and confirm a rumor that i have no doubt has been circulating he grinned at his son who returned only a token twitch of the lips and raised his glass to my son james and his future wife miss edith baldric everyone raised their glasses amidst the excited murmuring and congratulations the glasses clinked and the champagne sloshed about and lily went pale she turned and went straight into the hall in search of a bathroom she opened the door then immediately blushed having walked in on someone crying oh i so sorry i lily gaped charlotte charlotte vane blinked through her streaming tears black eye makeup smudged unevenly down her cheeks her eyes widened she slammed the door and let out another wail lily stood frozen with shock momentarily before hesitantly giving the door a little tap er charlotte it lily go away she sniveled making it a bit difficult to make out the words frowning lily began to walk away but thought better of it and propped herself against the wall did something happen lily tested delicately there were a few more sniffles did someone get hurt more sniffles lily swallowed are you hurt the door clicked and creaked open gently beckoning her ominously to enter when lily crept inside charlotte was propped up on the old fashioned toilet rhythmically dabbing her face with a handful of crumpled toilet tissue she sort of sniffled and peered down at her lap morosely charlotte what going on lily shut the door behind her she heaved a wobbly sigh and blew her nose it it s it s daddy lily frowned what happened is he all right charlotte shook her head fiercely and dabbed her nose it gone all of it lily was only growing more confused er what that the m m m moneeeey she wailed and buried her face in her hands it all gone daddy sold it er he sold his money lily was thoroughly confused no you nitwit charlotte shrieked the business our prized cauldron business there nothing left oh no charlotte i sorry what does that mean charlotte lifted her face and stared at lily bewildered it means no more money that what it means it means daddy is out of the job lily didntknow a whole lot about business but it seemed that a man like mr vane would have other options hasnthe invested in anything else he not an investor he is an entrepreneur charlotte spoke the word haughtily with a french accent he built an entire empire and that bitch took it from him who charlotte narrowed her eyes edith well her father he bought out the company daddy had no choice at least that what he told mummy she sighed forlornly now i have nothing lily shook her head charlotte i sure your father will figure something out like you said he an entrepreneur he ll start building a new empire it s not that she peered at the floor uncharacteristically solemn everyone thinks that i not good enough anymore not good enough for what she laughed tonelessly to be their friend lily furrowed her brow she actually felt bad for charlotte you mean florence and helen lily scoffed helen a cow good riddance to lily surprise charlotte smiled thanks but the smile quickly faded i canteven get madeline to speak to me i sure madeline will talk to you she seems like a good person yeah charlotte said scornfully the only reason she hung out with us is because i threatened to have her father sacked what lily was feeling less sorry for her her dad he a squib charlotte continued he couldntget a job anywhere else so my dad took him on i know i shouldnthave but it was just so easy lily glared and flushed charlotte that horrible making her live in fear of that her father might be the sole provider you may not have had to worry about money but she did that a sick cruel thing to do charlotte looked taken aback i sorry i know i just like i said it was easy what got your knickers in a bunch lily sighed and began tearing up a loose bit of toilet tissue my dad was just sacked i dontknow if i can afford my last year at hogwarts charlotte looked surprisingly embarrassed i sorry anyway so i sort of know how you feel lily smiled weakly charlotte shrugged yeah well i sure madeline will be able to join our little club soon lily jolted upright what do you mean please she scoffed ripping bits of lint off a towel with the baldrics in charge squibs will be the first thing to go and next will be the mudbloods lily cringed at the word but she knew charlotte was right they sat together for awhile oddly comfortable in somewhat companionable quiet only a few sniffles permeated the silence finally lily stood are you going to be alright i going to get back to the party yeah i just going to clean up she hesitated er thank you lily lily smiled sure she stepped out into the hallway and shut the door going somewhere lily jumped startled by the voice then she snorted with derision james was leaning casually against the banister his hair was its usual disheveled mess as if he hadnteven bothered attempting to tame it for the occasion dontyou have a fianc e to attend to james laughed out loud louder than necessary in lily opinion she tried to push past him but he simply blocked her with his wide chest she huffed do you mind he poked his forefinger skyward lily frowned and followed it then frowned even deeper at the mistletoe dangling above them at the base of the stairs ha ha so funny potter mffff james cut her off with a sloppy wet kiss and pulled away grinning ah i love tradition lily whacked him hard in the chest you just cantambush me whenever you feel like it she spat her cheeks flaming james pressed closer forcing her up against the wall why not because because she was getting flustered and james was eating it up because you canthave everything you like i can t he said mockingly something flickering in his hazel eyes and what about edith lily muttered glaring past his shoulder desperately avoiding his hazel gaze he grinned the mischief reappearing in his features he took a step closer slipping his hands around her waist what about her it not like she ever been faithful to me why should i start lily reached up to slap him but james caught her wrist and held it tightly let go of me she struggled he pushed her gently against the wall and let go of her wrist using both hands to push the hair back from her face his warm breath tickled her cheeks paralyzing her their noses were nearly touching james stop it she breathed james lips were parted and he leaned in toward her you heard the lady a voice interrupted james languorously lifted his gaze away from lily and turned to see sirius standing in the doorway that my date you re pawing he smirked but there was something dangerous in his eyes speaking of pawing james played along turning away from lily and loosening his tie how have you been treating the lady padfoot it seems you ve left her all alone for someone to snatch up sirius smirk washed away and he glared quit playing games lily decided it was time to intervene she stepped in front of james who had been guarding her like a dog i was just using the bathroom thanks i ll be getting back to the party now she turned back to james congratulations james on your engagement she brushed past sirius as well and went straight back to the ballroom where she found the drink table the nerve like she was a piece of meat just as she was reaching for the wine bottle a hand slipped gracefully in front of her and snatched it up artfully filling a glass and handing it to her lily gulped and met the intense gaze of mr potter er thank you he smirked no trouble he poured a glass for himself as well she tried to slink away but mr potter stopped her i was hoping perhaps i could chat with you lily privately just for a moment his hazel eyes crinkled so much like james i wontkeep you from the party er sure she replied uncomfortably no one seemed to notice them leave through a small door and make their way to a little office lily entered at his behest and hovered by a wall of bookshelves pretending to be interested in the collection the office was dim and became even darker when mr potter shut the door with a click lily jumped at the sound mr potter made his way around to his desk and took a seat sipping his wine calmly enjoying yourself yes thank you so much for having me here of course james seems pleased and that is what his mother and i like to see silence lily fiddled with her glass lily i just want you to know that i have nothing against you he said softly but this family has obligations it would be improper to have you interfering her brow furrowed excuse me mr potter held up a hand to silence her there are things you do not understand about our lifestyle coming from the situation you do i sorry lily face was heating up i not sure what situation you re talking about he laughed hollowly let not play these games child i not a child lily blurted rather loudly he was silent lily was breathing heavily trying to settle herself down i donthave long to live lily i an old man he wandered to his desk and sat down pulling out a quill i need to make certain that my son will inherit the wealth and prestige necessary to keep him safe and protect the potter name he dipped the quill delicately into the inkpot lily listened to the scratching of the feather tip on parchment these are dark times and to ensure my son safety i must ensure that he remains in a position of power he folded the parchment and stood up rounding the desk and handing the scrap to lily what this she asked tentatively resistant to take it he urged it into her hand insurance lily took the paper and unfolded it a small key tumbled out into the palm of her hand immediately she shoved it back towards him i wonttake this i wontbe bought i not buying you miss evans the lines around his mouth grew deeper i purchasing my son well being you will take it because you desperately need it and why would i need your money lily frowned because he said lightly with your father out of a job and a year of school left to pay for you donthave many other options the breath caught in her throat how how do you know about that he just smirked keep the key the vault is in your name if you dontchoose to open it within the next few days i will remove the contents why would you do this lily fists were shaking why not just take away the donation you made and have me kicked out of school because james would know i had something to do with it this way he never needs to know you ll simply stay out of his life and finish your final year intent on getting a good career to support your family lily stormed out of the office wordlessly and all the way to the ballroom stumbling down the staircase she burst through the doors and went straight to sirius who was in the middle of telling some joke to a large group she walked straight up behind him and stopped i want to leave lily stammered her eyes stinging now sirius placed his glass down on an end table pulling lily away delicately by the elbow what wrong she knew everyone nearby was staring at her particularly edith who seemed to be wearing a small smirk and the frowning madame potter who looked affronted at the interruption but she didntcare please sirius she pleaded with her eyes he seemed to chew on the thought briefly but nodded his head and turned to the group he d been chatting with please excuse us something come up i afraid we ll have to take our leave a bit early madame potter looked shocked with a gloved hand to her d colletage she let out a worried little sigh good heavens what could possibly be so important just let them go mum james interrupted lily didntrealize he d been standing right there with edith edith placed a hand in james making lily cringe thank you for the invitation sirius said formally james he nodded to his friend james barely acknowledged him sirius ushered lily out into the hall and didntspeak until they reached the fireplace finally he broke the silence i sorry i brought you here i know sirius lily shook her head shamefully i ve been a terrible guest i must have made an awful impression his parents clearly hate me i hope it doesntruin your chances of sirius put a hand up looking uncharacteristically stern no i not ashamed that you re here lily i ashamed that i made you come what sirius sighed running a hand through his feathery dark hair the truth is he swallowed hard i was trying to make james jealous lily raised her eyebrows what he shook his head i lied i dontwant to move in here believe me i do want out of my house but i just wanted him to realize what he missing with you he always gotten anything and everything he wanted until now when he sees you with me it kills him because not only are you something he canttake away from me you re also something he can never have because of his obligation to edith lily was speechless sirius had used her i know it was wrong to bring you here knowing you could be embarrassed but i so sick of james games i just once wanted to show him what it was like sirius her insides were burning how could you sirius looked genuinely ashamed i you knew what was going on between james and me i came here to help you and once again the joke is on me somehow i keep getting dragged into the middle of this this power struggle first remus and now you what exactly is it that you re trying to prove to each other lily was fuming i it complicated he scratched the back of his head and sighed we ve been friends for so long and remus and i have had to grow up a bit faster than james he trapped in this little world of his and his parents donthelp that much he needs a wakeup call i just i really thought that his eyes softened thought what lily bit her cheek sirius smiled his black hair brushed her cheek as he leaned in and kissed her lightly on the lips i think i could fall in love with you lily but for your sake i d better not he grinned and his gray eyes began to sparkle once more besides who am i to defy nature he said breezily a small smile tugged at lily lips despite her lingering anger you owe me sirius black you really do sirius grinned let get you back to hogwarts do you think lily hesitated that we could make a stop on the way a n hello again i back with chapter two thanks for the reviews they re few and far between these days since hardly anyone reads new stories anymore since there so many harry potter has the largest portion of stories on the site so i appreciate it well keep with me here the tale should get more interesting soon chapter two prefect duties the sun had risen casting a brilliant warm glow over the city and the birds were chirping happily in the trees lily thrust the windows open and took a deep exaggerated breath it was an unusually bright day for english autumn but lily didntcomplain she absorbed chapter seven detoxify de stress and dontexplode literally for the modern witch the three a s absorb appreciate and accept remember life is a beautiful thing your life is a beautiful thing take a moment to absorb and appreciate this will help you accept and conquer any obstacles that await she took another breath for good measure today was the first day of hogwarts and she needed all the help she could get because with the marauders out and about a hoard of first years to usher in and a restless poltergeist awaiting her at the castle obstacles was not a word to be taken lightly smoothing back her hair into a neat ponytail lily checked her appearance briefly in the mirror then flitted off to collect her things unfortunately not coming from a wizarding family meant having to carry everything herself once she had coerced rue into his cage she balanced as much as she could in her arms and made her way downstairs you want some help with that petunia offered poking her head out of her room sure lily said that d be great the two gathered everything up and trudged downstairs lily petunia spoke from behind a large stack of books hmm i know i shouldntask you this but i cantask my friends what is it school you need tutoring no petunia said reproachfully my grades are fine this of course was a lie lily knew petunia had never been particularly book smart but she kept her mouth shut and listened it wasntvery often that she chatted with her sister she didntreally have time what with being away at hogwarts the majority of the year then what the problem you know you can tell me anything petunia hesitated well there this boy rupert red flags immediately went up in the back of lily mind pet come on you re too young for boys you re only twelve i ll be thirteen in 24 days she said angrily right sorry anyway i figured i could ask you i mean you being older and all i want to kiss him but kiss him lily cried petunia for heaven sake you re in middle school so tons of people kiss in middle school but none of your friends yes most of them have then what the problem ask them i refuse to be the vessel for which my sister gets her first taste of a man lechery stop talking like that and i can t they think i ve already kissed someone ah lily sighed you know you shouldntlie who are you trying to impress anyway it more complicated than that she spat setting down the books by the trunk of the car they began loading things i was hoping you could give me advice lily nearly choked on her own saliva h help you um well you have kissed haventyou petunia put her hands on her hips lily swallowed it wasntthat she d never kissed just that it had been a long time a really long time and they were never very good and by they she meant two pathetic right of course i have i just dontknow how much help i d be i mean i cantkiss you she laughed nervously but you could tell me look pet this isntthe best time i have to get going and you need to get to school so why dontyou just fine petunia bellowed dropping the books she d been loading with a thud forget i even asked with that she stomped off into the house lily sighed heavily the feeling of guilt began to creep up on her inching its way into her stomach but what was she supposed to do tell her sister she had tons of experience that drooling daniel jenkins was fantastic in her first year or that kissing thomas bellows in second year was great despite his glasses jabbing her in the eye sending her to madame pomfrey for three hours or when no she didnteven count that time in fact she didnteven want to think about the third time okay lalala think about the sky lily beautiful day beautiful day ready hon lily mother hair bounced freely as she hurried out to the car keys jangling in her left hand did you say goodbye to your sister um yeah let go lily fumbled with the last of her books and shut the boot it wasnther fault petunia was naturally a brat if she didntget what she wanted it always amounted in a tantrum but she was her sister and they did have their good moments though sometimes she was just so unbearable the car ride there was mundane at most sending lily into a silent stupor while her mother hummed along to the radio her eyelids were just starting to grow heavy when the car jerked to a stop we re here her mother sang let get going you re father wishes you good luck as usual lily droned a smile plastered to her face she was feeling suddenly less perky about her day you know he had work dear yes like every year she grabbed rue cage and set it atop the trolley her mother wheeled over all right then to the platform um lily interrupted that alright mum i ll go myself oh her face fell well all right then yes i suppose that good you are sixteen after all the grin once again crossed her elegant features and she released the handle of the trolley ushering lily over to it you have a fantastic year hmm she kissed lily cheek and smoothed her hair thanks mum i will lily smiled in spite of herself lily watched her mother stride back to the car before turning to the station however it was only a matter of minutes before she d lost control of the trolley and nearly ran into an elderly couple walking arm in arm oh sorry sorry lily exclaimed rue squawked loudly in reproach and the couple glared the old woman fixing her large decorated maroon hat her features were refined but the man beside her had a large mole on his chin and a beastly nose over which he glared down at lily after getting a closer look at him it was clear he wasntthe woman husband but perhaps her son her very ugly son i highly advise madam he snarled that you watch where you are going and respect your elders any witch below you would take more care not to draw so much attention to herself how did he know she was a witch lily glanced over at rue overturned cage oh she supposed the owl gave it away he must be of the wizarding world i lily gaped i sorry but good day he grimaced and turned on his heel to meet the haughty woman by offering his arm madame he bowed to her and the two strode off down the station how rude lily puffed adjusting her clothes and hair need some help a deep voice seeped into her ear lily jumped and spun around oh for she cried meeting sirius twisted smirk dontdo that and no i fine thank you go find james or something sirius put on a sad face but i dontwant to i want to stay here with you shove off black i donthave time for your games i have a train to catch presumably so do you if you haventbeen expelled yet lily droned finally putting rue cage upright and loading the trolley back up no he said breezily i love the school too much merlin forbid i get stuck at home the rest of my life he shoved his hands in his pockets and leaned against a pillar while she fumbled with a stack of oversized textbooks what a sob story too bad i donthave time to hear it so is there something you wanted or are you just here to annoy me a few books slipped and lily cursed loudly my words so unbecoming for a beautiful young lady allow me to help keep your jinx producing hands off my things black lily bellowed out of my way with that lily shoved the trolley along as fast as she could keeping an especially wary eye out for obstacles this time however sirius continued jogging backwards to keep up with her hands still shoved in his pockets and exuding that damnable air of laxity that made all the girls swoon so you got a date for the yule ball yet lily almost tripped excuse me the yule ball i heard you lily could feel her cheeks flushing rapidly what did you mean by it the ball over three months away sirius shrugged i figured you were a project so i thought i d give myself some extra time you ve got to be kidding me her jaw tightened and she made a running jump through the brick of platform 9 sirius followed immediately catching up to her once again well assuming this isnta joke which it most likely is lily glared when hell freezes over he grinned i thought so dontworry i ll break you i know you want it i can see it in your eyes he squinted mischievously you will be my date lily evans before she could object to his rudeness sirius had leapt aboard the train lily glared furiously at nothing in particular and then boarded as well making her way to the back for the prefect meeting she slipped into the large compartment and sat down between a tall sandy brown haired boy and a very pretty girl with a sheet of blonde hair cascading down her back the girl looked rather stolid but when lily made eye contact she grinned brightly her blue eyes sparkling lily smiled back and turned her attention to the head boy and girl who had just entered this year the head boy was the very robust eric maclean he was a very friendly gryffindor with rosy cheeks and a short patch of read hair he smiled and greeted them all with a hearty hello incidentally he was the star keeper for the quidditch team on his left was a tall girl with a waterfall of wavy black locks that fell to her waist her eyes gleamed and she was wearing a slightly fierce expression but she was absolutely beautiful like a model lily might see in witch weekly not that she read that garbage but she might have caught a glimpse of another girl copy awhile back the girl caught sight of lily staring eye and turned up the corner of her mouth in a small smile on her chest glittered a silver and green badge labeled hg i eric maclean gryffindor many of you already know me well i do see a couple of new faces but we ll get to introductions in a minute he gestured for the girl to speak edith baldric slytherin now this year entails many new duties for sixth year prefects she said silkily lily noticed all the boys eyes were on here faithfully organizing the yule ball the halloween feast and christmas d cor for the halls this evening you will escort your house students to the common rooms after giving the first years a brief tour tomorrow you will each be assigned your individual duties by your head of house the results of which will be discussed at the next meeting three weeks from today the sixth years are dismissed eric added we ll get acquainted with the rest of you and let you fifth years know what being a prefect means have a good trip you lot he bid them goodbye lily picked up her bag the girl on her right rising as well on her left the brown haired boy stood slowly and followed her out good to see you again lily he smiled i was looking forward to it if you haventalready got an arithmancy partner i was going to ask of course remus lily grinned back remus lupin was one person she always looked forward to seeing even though he was technically a marauder he sympathized with her plight with james and sirius and was always a good friend i suppose i ll see you tonight then right now the trick is finding james peter and sirius i assume they re wreaking havoc as we speak he smiled and strode off down the aisle lily sighed and looked around this was always the most difficult time finding an open compartment after everyone had boarded she shuffled down the aisle peeking into compartments but most of them were full or rather full of people who didntseem particularly keen on allowing her in finally she found an empty one where she slipped in and plopped down on the seat exhaustedly wotcher evans aaaauuggh lily jumped two big brown eyes mere centimeters from her face bloody hell kenneth she cried to her fellow gryffindor clutching the stitch of her chest dont do that sorry kenneth shoved the whole body of a chocolate frog into his mouth leaving brown smeared around his lips he was a large fellow and his robes were very disheveled not in the lightly ruffled sexy sirius sense but rather the big fat slob sense it alright really she moved to the other side and slumped in her seat i so tired why he began unwrapping another frog oh it helga i already have her here he offered it to her uh no thanks i ve got um plenty she eyed it with distaste suit yourself he continued munching so prefect again this year eh yup lily smiled lots more work that stinks i wouldntbe a prefect if dumbledore paid me he grimaced flicking his messy brown hair to the side getting chocolate on his forehead in the process i wouldntwant to be a bloody nark thanks kenneth no problem say you going to eat that he said eyeing the pumpkin pasty sitting next to her they arentmine brilliant he finished for her toss it here so how was holiday mundane lily sighed you all right went to th the door sliding open with a bang cut kenneth words short overly loud laughing filled the compartment but stopped dead quite suddenly james peter pettigrew and sirius were standing in the doorway staring at the two of them a sly grin formed on james features when he spotted lily and soon after the look on sirius face followed morning evans kaufman lovely day for a train ride eh james drawled plopping down beside her sirius and peter sat down on either side of kenneth and grinned at him tauntingly kenneth narrowed his eyes warily and wrapped up his chocolate frog what not going to share then sirius said sadly get your own kenneth barked now that not very nice james interrupted you should have more respect for your school mates he would potter lily interjected but it difficult when none of you are his mates ignore them kenneth they re just bullying you bullying james eyebrows tilted sadly what a harsh word dontmake me dock points lily growled now now there no need to be hasty sirius said snatching the chocolate frog out of kenneth hand and tossing it to peter who caught it gratefully give that back kenneth said lily was getting furious they had no right to be in here bullying them she was a prefect for merlin sake they should at least give her due respect give that back to him and get out sirius or i ll give you a detention sirius looked like he might explode with laughter james grinned and pinched lily cheek oh you are so cute when you re mad evans lily shook him off blushing furiously with a mix of anger and embarrassment now the least you can do is let us stay after all this is our compartment what excuse me lily growled this is not your compartment actually peter said through a mouthful it quite rightly ours see lily followed peter pointing finger to the wall by the window sure enough four names were burned in by wand moony wormtail padfoot and prongs you cantjust go around claiming everything you burn your names into that defacement of school property i could have you suspended for that not if you just let it slide sirius sidled over to her and looped his arm over her shoulder get lily lifted his arm as if she were carrying a dirty sock your arm off of me lily sirius looked her in the eye your words are so callous donttalk to me about callous sirius black i ll the door slid open again this time remus was standing in the doorway looking rather tired and clutching an armful of books oy remy sirius said delightedly come to join the party have a seat what are you doing now harassing these two yeah wanna join james tossed him another one of kenneth sweets warranting another foul glare from kenneth remus caught it deftly then handed it back to kenneth with a sigh why dontwe leave them alone because sirius said that not the way of the marauders besides james added this is our compartment they re our guests it wouldntbe right to kick them out on such short notice after all they d never do that to us he tacked on a sickeningly sweet smile to the end which he flashed brilliantly at lily she rolled her eyes and scooted to the far end of the seat remus turned to lily is that all right with y aaauugghh kenneth cried suddenly clutching his face lily gaped at what she saw blood was pouring out of his nose and then suddenly from his ears as well he began shrieking and trying to stop it with his robes but blood was spilling everywhere wh what he sputtered what did you you do he coughed at james who was lounging casually on the seat trying to suppress a smile dontknow what you re talking about mate you d better go fix that leak doesntlook too good from here sirius was howling with laughter and peter had subsequently joined in remus looked a little peeved and grabbed kenneth arm i ll take him to the front he ushered kenneth out with a weary glare at james as soon as the door shut james burst with laughter as well did you see that big lug good one sirius laughed how d you know remus d toss the chocolate back to him it remus james said dismissively not my best use of that hex thou you selfish horrible egotistical jerk lily seethed through gritted teeth how can you just go around doing horrible things to people who ve never done anything to you he had it coming james drawled had had it lily stuttered with fury do you have any idea how much people hate you for being so cruel hate us sirius laughed please people love us we bring the fun back into school fun ction james stared blankly at sirius that was really bad padfoot i know sorry fifty points lily cried at the top of her lungs i taking fifty bloody points from gryffindor house on you we ll see how much people love you after that what james shouted back you canttake away fifty points school hasnteven started yet i a prefect i ll do what i have to for the sake of discipline james leapt out of his seat and rounded on her you donthave any jurisdiction on the train watch me lily spat in his face with that she whirled around and flew out of the compartment james stood there fuming calming himself in the presence of sirius and peter he tried to act flippant by flopping down on the seat but slipped and hit his hip bugger she really gets to you mate sirius raised an eyebrow she just a girl peter scoffed ugh james groaned she just so infuriating infuriating sirius smirked you talking like her now no he spat defensively she just makes me angry she so full of herself sirius didntsay anything the answer to that was a given but he thought better of it and changed the subject with peter got anymore of those frogs a n this one is long overdue guys thanks for sticking with me chapter twenty silent night when lily and sirius arrived at gringotts she wasntquite sure she was making the right choice it was a lot of money after all a lot of money that her family could use she found mr potter offer to be an insult to her integrity yet here she was but here she was not without a plan lily marched straight up to the counter and chatted quietly with one of the goblins handing him the key sirius waited patiently and when lily returned to where he stood looking accomplished he questioned her what was that all about anyway she sighed and shoved her hands into the pockets of her cloak which clashed horribly with the blue cocktail dress she was still wearing i just needed to transfer a bit of gold ah he said breezily money being a matter which he cared little for they wandered back out to the silent street of diagon alley mildly lit by the glimmering stars above so you arentstill angry with me are you lily sighed again this time more exhaustively no she trailed off coming to a sudden halt but i do need a favor sirius put on a dramatically stern face anything seriously he nodded his head all right i do owe you though i should warn you my going rate is not cheap and i afraid that favor is only worth so many galleons lily ignored his joke and peered up at the stars tell me the real reason you and james are fighting sirius actually guffawed it echoed through the dark streets and made lily angry it not bloody funny sirius i dontlike being lied to he fell silent but something flickered in his eyes why do you think i lying there only one reason men fight as adamantly as you two she glared it always over a woman sirius raised an eyebrow and his gray eyes flashed again and i know it not me she smiled contritely then biting her lip hesitantly she whispered you re in love with her arentyou silence sirius head was turned slightly and his shaggy locks blocked his face so lily couldntsee his expression but after a few minutes he turned to her and smirked am i a cool evening breeze picked up suddenly and tickled their cheeks as it whisked by there were neither birds nor bugs out the absence of which only made the moment that much more disquieting sirius turned away and ground his heel into the cobblestones unconsciously it not like you think then how is it lily prodded gently he sighed and tilted his head up to the stars i think by now you ve figured out what sort of family she from the same sort as mine he smiled at her ruefully she d be my fianc e you know if i hadntturned my back on my family does she know he nodded she does well that explained why she laughed when lily said sirius had brought her as his date does she feel the same i mean she was forced to be with james right she cantbe happy about it oh no sirius laughed again but this time his tone was tinged with sourness edith would never turn down a good game and her parents would never let her turn down the power and prestige of the potter family and what about the black family ah sirius chuckled the most noble house no we didntoffer quite the benefits at the time she sounds selfish sirius lily said bluntly sirius flicked a small pebble out into the darkness she not all bad was all he said ah christmas cheer it was what lily had none of at the moment bugger she had just spilled half a bottle of someone perfume all over her suitcase bloody hell all my things will smell like she read the bottle bitterly petite cl matite charming charlotte shrieked that my favorite scent look what you ve done she tore the bottle from lily grasp and cradled it mournfully do you know how much a bottle of this costs no lily went back to packing charlotte huffed and glared at her what is wrong with you this morning it christmas eve have some bloody cheer and stay away from my things you re right i sorry lily flopped down on her bed as charlotte stomped off to salvage the rest of her perfume the truth was she d been distracted all morning ever since last night she d been thinking about what sirius had confessed he wouldnttalk about it anymore and she couldnthelp but wonder why on earth anyone would fall in love with edith baldric sure she was beautiful but she wasntexactly sunshine and roses behind all that she and sirius just seemed so different still it was fairly clear now why sirius and james were so bitter toward each other yet one thing still remained nagging at the pit of her stomach why was james so eager to fight back lily had tried desperately to push an incriminating piece of evidence but it was resurfacing now to haunt her james had kissed edith and passionately at that it burned lily to think about but there was no avoiding the truth lily flopped down on her bed charlotte charlotte was shuffling around her bed reorganizing some of her trinkets what she didntbother turning around a few bottles of nail polish clinked as she lined them up by color on her nightstand lily could feel herself flushing and was thankful charlotte wasntwatching her what do you know about james and edith what do you want to know lily could practically see her smirk despite her turned back everything charlotte set down a nail polish bottle and turned around on the floor curling her legs beneath her well she shook the blonde curls from her face other than the engagement i know they ve been seeing each other off and on pretty much when edith feels like it lily raised her eyebrows when edith feels like it charlotte shrugged she a seventh year gorgeous rich and she plays quidditch 100 enviable material would you say no to that unfortunately she couldntdisagree charlotte eyes softened momentarily and she sighed at the look on lily face look evans you have to face the reality at some point regardless of what he feels for you in james world things are different you would have to be a part of it to understand it there are rules to follow certain things are acceptable and certain things aren t certain things like me charlotte shrugged you arentthe only one who falls in that category now she turned back to her little project lily flushed i sorry i didntmean to please lily it old news what new however is you and sirius black charlotte stood up admiring the finished product of her organizing and turned to lily smirking believe me there nothing there new or otherwise frowning lily folded and refolded the shirt in her hands right because he in love with edith lily dropped her shirt and glared at charlotte how did you know that she scoffed please evans everyone knows that sirius black and edith baldric were to be married james and edith dating openly last year was the biggest scandal and then when the new engagement was announced this year no one could shut up about it besides that the blacks basically disowned sirius bloody hell lily blanched god lily charlotte simply looked disgusted are you aware of anything that goes on at this school you are a prefect it not exactly the most social post lily mumbled stuffing another cloak into her overflowing suitcase she flicked her wand and sealed the bag shut whisking it off the bed and over to the door so that she could flop down face first on her bed well now i know why you ve been so damned moody lately charlotte sneered down at her you re caught in the middle of two boys fighting over a girl lily snorted into her pillow charlotte narrowed her eyes your knickers are all twisted because that girl isntyou lily was silent charlotte pursed her lacquered lips bit self centered isntit the trip to her parent house was long and quiet not peaceful however because she couldntshake what charlotte had said she wasntbeing egotistical was she was she really angry because james and sirius werentfighting over her fog billowed eerily past her window as the train zoomed along the tracks it finally came to a creaking halt at the station and she grabbed her bag from the overhead rack now that she was home she had other things to worry about like her father unemployment it was something she wasntlooking forward to confronting her parents about msh sntsnd the conductor voice crackled over the intercom indistinguishable as usual lily was the only passenger who seemed to need this stop she didntwant to risk anyone seeing rue so she sent him to her parents on his own the long flight would do him some good lily wasntkeen on walking in this part of town but she also didnthave the change for a taxi cabbies in spinner end werentlikely to accept wizard money although they accepted almost everything else she hobbled down the busted pavement in the dark past several shattered lampposts it was silent no one fooling around on christmas eve thankfully the evans home wasnttoo far from the train stop and lily arrived promptly on her doorstep dropping her bag with a thud she may have been a prefect but unfortunately that didntgive her the ability to use magic outside of school yet there was a soft pattering behind the painted red door the porch light switched on and the scraggly looking wreath quivered bits of snow littering the steps and then the door flew open lily my lily her mother cried squeezing her tight she was in her mrs claus apron and a cloud of flour and cinnamon filled the air mum she buried her face in her shoulder not caring that she probably looked like a powdery ghost now dad she exclaimed running to greet her father who d just shuffled around the corner darling her father embraced her lily frowned he felt much thinner she pulled away and examined his kind face many more grays had sprouted how is school eh same old lily petunia rounded the corner she d sprouted again and had grown even taller what did you bring me lily frowned nice to see you too come on now their mum scurried back into the kitchen i need to finish before everyone gets here lily furrowed her brow mum you are losing it she dropped her bag on the couch and headed to the sink to wash the flour off everyone is here the doorbell rang lily turned on her heel who else did you invite she frowned and wandered back into the living room flinging the front door open evening james potter tipped an invisible hat and grinned lily slammed the door and spun around who is it dear her mother called from the depths of the kitchen er a solicitor she could hear james muffled protests really her father walked past the kitchen doorway and grabbed the eggnog from the fridge odd it christmas eve yes er heh heh strange lily cracked the door open and glared at james what are you doing here she hissed it not polite to go slamming doors on people faces you know he chided he was carrying a giant gaudy bouquet of flowers you you brought me flowers lily glared incredulously they arentfor you he said haughtily they re for your mum he grinned again he looked quite normal in muggle clothes you look pale it flour lily narrowed her eyes you need to leave i dontthink so i was invited he made to push his way in but lily blocked him no you need to leave now this isnta game james this is my family i aware of that he frowned equally irritated with her accusation i made a promise yes you did to edith baldric i dontwant to think about edith he brushed the thought away with a hand my parents arenteven here they re in france canti just have a normal bloody holiday for once no lily tried to slam the door again but just then her mother appeared jamie she burst past lily with open arms you made it lily dontbe rude dontleave him standing out in the cold oh thank you mrs evans james flashed his best smile now james we ve been through this call me annabelle oh are these for me what a darling lily gaped as her mother ushered him off towards to the kitchen table grumbling to herself she trailed into the kitchen and flopped down in her seat lovely place mr potter james said amiably sitting right next to lily please call me henry her father beamed eyes darting between james and his daughter he chuckled to himself i just so happy to see our little girl finally bring someone home dad lily hissed i didntbring him home she grumbled fluffing her napkin bitterly now you re from hogwarts too i presume years of mingling with socialites had done james wonders he could say or do no wrong only petunia was wary of him and the subtle winks he kept throwing in her direction i am he flies a broomstick annabelle pointed out proud as if he were her own son lily stomach did a somersault er it called quidditch actually james grinned taking a bite of mashed potato i the captain of the team oh really now henry marveled through a mouthful of turkey he was an avid sports fan himself anything like football sort of and at that point james and her father became lost in a deep conversation about the history and inner workings of quidditch lily slouched deeper into her seat pushing the peas and potato together around the plate with her fork her parents grinned and chuckled at every quip that slipped expertly from james smiling lips if only they knew how could he just show up here after everything that had happened and act so nonchalant if anything this only confirmed her worst suspicions about james potter right lily her fork stopped scraping at the plate she lifted her head er right yeah oh how marvelous annabelle screeched what a sweet thing to do lily er what lily paled what had she just agreed to james grinned and continued and that not even the best part after she made that beautiful candlelight dinner and confessed her feelings for me she released the fairies the fairies lily choked on her eggnog oh the fairies annabelle clasped her hands excitedly yes james winked at lily she spent weeks training them to spell out i love thee james with all my heart in the night sky he swept the air before him distantly with a hand a glazed look in his eyes her mother burst into tears oh god mum petunia rolled her eyes i sorry she sniffled that was just so beautiful i didntknow you had such a romantic streak lily lily cleared her throat yes well she said through gritted teeth shooting james the darkest look she could conjure what can i say i just love this bloke with that she dug her heel into james foot and stabbed his thigh with her fork james groaned and buckled forward but saved himself by making it look like he was reaching for the punch henry smiled well dear i must say i approve james you re a lovely young man er thank you henry he croaked catching lily eye he grinned mischievously i suppose we d better clear the table annabelle stood but james immediately leapt up no no please let me he began stacking the dishes expertly in his arms james you re a guest henry protested it the least i can do well thank you annabelle shot lily and approving look i ll help lily said quickly ushering her parents and petunia out into the living room once they were settled on the couch she whirled around and stomped back into the kitchen just what are you playing at james james back was turned and he was already scrubbing the dishes in the sink i just having a bit of fun lils fun she slammed the glasses onto the counter you call humiliating me fun lily he turned to her you were the one who asked me to play your boyfriend i staying in character in charac she stammered that was ages ago why are you here james was silent flipping on the water just wanted to see you for christmas please lily crossed her arms and leaned her back against the counter next to james you saw me at your little engagement party congratulations by the way feeling fidgety she snatched the dishtowel and began drying james grunted do you love her lily asked suddenly violently chafing a plate the plates james was holding clattered in the sink what sort of bloody question is that a valid one she grumbled heat rising in her stomach he shook his head i dontwant to talk about edith well then what do you want to talk about how long have your parents been married she scoffed dontchange the subject james i told you i dontwant to talk about edith now answer my question he glared sideways at her please lily it christmas lily eyed him a moment then sighed about twenty years i think that good really good the water trickled slowly from the faucet head lily dried another plate and stacked it on the counter her anger ebbing how about yours he shrugged sixty three years and two months wow she frowned you remember that he shrugged again it important dontyou think how long you spend your life with someone lily stared at the water spots on the glass in her hand i suppose she glanced up to find him staring at her although it seems like it more important to focus on how you spend those years does time really matter james smirked if you donthave much of it yeah he went back to scrubbing you know she changed the subject and turned around to face the counter i dontthink i ve ever seen james potter raise a finger to do work he grimaced and splashed her with soapy water james she shrieked throwing the towel at him you prat he stared at her blankly and splashed her again lily gasped and leapt at him reaching into the water herself but james was too quick he snatched her around the waist and lifted her off the ground let me go she yelled giggling and beating him with a wooden spoon jaaames liiily he mocked swinging her around everything alright in here annabelle voice came from the doorway her eyes sparkled as if she d seen something warm and all too familiar james dropped lily who was still giggling thick red locks in a tangled mess erm yes mum she replied blushing annabelle examined her kitchen all of the clean dishes were covered in soapy water again you two are making more work for me she scolded with a smirk sorry annabelle james cleared his throat ow lily had whapped him with the spoon when her mother wasntlooking we ll clean it up mum no no she ushered them toward the living room presents the family piled onto the couch james and lily on either arm of the sofa petunia began rifling through the gifts crackers first um i full no thanks james held up a hand when petunia shoved a wrapped purple tube at him no silly she rolled her eyes it like a gift you pick a partner and rip it open you know crack petunia threw her arms apart to simulate the explosion it a lowly muggle tradition lily said sternly can you indulge us a moment james grinned only if you do it with me lily stood up and took the other end of the cracker 1 2 3 petunia cried delightedly the tube exploded everywhere candy and toys scattering across the floor petunia snatched them up in a heartbeat lily leaned down and picked up the purple paper crown and fixed it atop james mussed dark head there she smiled perfect oh pictures annabelle leapt up scrambling for her camera against the mantle scoot she brushed them together against the fireplace james and lily stood stiffly beside the gnarled christmas tree james purple crown askew closer i cantget you both in the shot annabelle complained james and liiily sitting in a tree petunia danced around singing come on now annabelle henry said gruffly trying to snatch the camera from her dontembarrass them henry stop it this is a beautiful moment relax k i s s i petunia circled the tree throwing candy lily sighed flushing with embarrassment mum please the commotion grew in the cramped little living room her parents arguing voices colliding with the cheesy christmas music coming from the record player petunia continued to tease them skipping by and plopping a crumpled yellow crown on lily head i sorry god this is embarrassing she mumbled to james he just smirked i am calm annabelle henry folded his arms and grumbled i just want to make sure the lighting is proper closer act like you like each other now annabelle sang peering through the viewfinder lily flushed suddenly as she felt james arm slip comfortably around her waist he pulled her gently against his side lily looked up at him but his eyes were on the camera flustered she turned just in time for the flash lovely annabelle cried i not sure that will turn out you didnthave enough backlight backlight oh please henry james didntlet go of her instead he tipped his head and caught her gaze lily stared back her green eyes wide james leaned in making her heart leap into her throat but he didnttry to kiss her he just smiled a genuine kind smile and whispered this is nice it took a minute for lily to find her voice so she just nodded in response desert let eat before it crawls away henry joked stomach focused on the kitchen james let go of lily and turned to the family i d better go i ve got a long trip home broomstick you know you flew your broom all the way here lily frowned long flights clear my head his gaze lingered on lily a moment oh annabelle raised her eyebrows well thank you for coming she scooped james up in a hug thank you for having me he said he turned and shook henry hand and you sir lovely chat interesting sport that quidditch perhaps i ll see you in that world cup one of these days he gripped james hand firmly one can only dream james sighed i ll walk you out james lily said softly outside it was cold and dark the street was poorly lighted in the distance the cannery clunked and churned steam billowed into the inky sky and hid the stars from view no rest for the weary at spinners end even christmas eve was a workday lily shifted on the snowy doorstep awkwardly there were no carolers songs or dim candles at their neighbors doorsteps lily felt somewhere at the back of her mind that she should be embarrassed but she was tired of that and she couldntmuster the energy to care she was focused only on the boy at her doorstep who in this dim light looked like a grown man his angular features were emphasized by the shadows and his hazel eyes blazed happy christmas james lily said tentatively happy christmas he smiled taking a step closer she could smell cinnamon and apple wafting through the crack in the door i actually had a really good time tonight me too he grinned and ran a hand through his hair i really like your family lily frowned even petunia even petunia he laughed taking another step closer but lily stood very still as he reached out and brushed a lock of auburn hair back behind her ear i especially like you his eyes sparkled lily laughed you re a prat i know but i a marvelous sexy prat he snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her body up against his own right she peered up at him suddenly very aware of his warmth james leaned in tightening his grip on her lily kept her gaze steady on his unaware of the icy cool air or the snow that had begun to fall around them she reached up and tugged on the collar of his jacket tightening the scarf around his neck her fingers lingering on the warm wool you should keep warm on your ride home you could catch a cold james didntrespond he just watched her with those sparkling hazel eyes lily blushed and stood on her tiptoes giving james a small kiss on the cheek he stared at her amazed i sorry we ve fought so much good luck with everything she said quickly lily james caught her hands in his as she was pulling them away his eyes darkened with intent and he leaned in she out here snogging her boyfriend still want me to get her lily thought she might die actually she wished she could die damn petunia james grinned he had already taken a step back he gave lily a smirk i d better get home right good night then lily hurried to through the door awkwardly night james gave her one last glance before the door shut with a jingle lily pressed her back to the cool wood and slammed her head against it three times when she peered out the curtain james was gone she closed her eyes and sighed what a sweet young man lily opened her eyes to meet her mother s mum her mother had stars in her eyes you know you two would make lovely children mum lily shrieked she sighed and flopped down on the sofa then looked back over her shoulder at her mother mum yes darling er what happened with dad her mother smiled shooting a quick glance into the kitchen where petunia and henry were eating desert what do you mean his job mother what happened she shook her auburn locks exactly like lily s and waved a hand dismissively oh dontworry about that things will be patched up in no time i sure it was a misunderstanding you know sometimes these things happen around the holidays it is a slow year after a mum lily pleaded her mother stopped herself heaving a sigh that made her eyes glisten ever so slightly i dontknow it was very sudden so lily stared at her open palms what does that mean her mother shrugged dejectedly she plopped down uncharacteristically beside lily i dontknow she looked her daughter in the eye they sat there for a while in silence perhaps contemplating entirely different things lily for one felt a dawning sense of guilt and as the night grew later and she crawled into her bed she couldnthelp but think that she d brought this on somehow had james father really done something to interfere with her father job or was he simply a savvy businessman taking credit for circumstances beyond anyone control lily feared that there was only one reason for his reaction and that reaction could only come about if someone had tipped him off which led lily to her next somewhat satisfying conclusion lily intimidated edith if edith truly thought lily was a threat and went to james father about it then lily was in luck as she drifted off to sleep lily dwelled peacefully on one thought she had the upper hand a n i just needed to say thank you

standard also i took some good advice from a reviewer and changed the category of my story so thank you for catching that chapter twenty one dangerous games it was awful charlotte groaned kicking a stack of clothes across the room everything i got for christmas was from the second hand store gross how tragic lily didntbother to feign interest she was scribbling a letter at her desk there had been an owl waiting for her the moment she returned and she beamed with delight when she saw who the sender was lily it been too long i glad to say things at home are well and i ve picked up my old position at the ministry however i hate to tell you this news i wontbe returning to hogwarts my services are no longer required though i have been working on a few freelance articles for the prophet they ve already printed one just between us i ve been working on an investigative piece it was actually inspired by what happened to my uncle vane company charlotte father you know maybe you d be able to help me out as the vanes still arenton the best terms with the mottlebums much love melinda happily lily began penning a reply she was more than willing to give melinda any help she needed after everything she d done for lily she d nearly forgotten that melinda was cousin to charlotte perhaps her family had been affected by the selling of the vane cauldron business as well unfortunately madeline family had her father had been sacked and she still had not returned from christmas break lily was beginning to wonder if she even would just then the door clicked and helen and florence sauntered in dressed in newfound confidence they sent charlotte a withering glare and then went to their corner of the dormitory charlotte kicked the stack of second hand clothing under her bed quickly and folded her arms nonchalantly anyway she changed the subject how is sirius these days lily noticed helen and florence ears perk up a bit i wouldntknow she glowered rolling up the parchment and tying it to rue outstretched leg hmph charlotte examined a nail right you know you used to be such a different person evans lily tightened the twine and sent rue on his way what that supposed to mean she replied testily well charlotte tipped her blonde curls thoughtfully you were so much more uppity you know i the best i a prefect and all that not so much anymore granted you were obnoxious as all hell but to be perfectly honest you ve sort of lost that spark evans lily blanched that spark you know she waved her manicured hand that drive all you used to care about was being a prefect and whatnot now all you care about is potter lily look affronted james potter is not all i care about in fact i dontcare about him she folded her arms stiffly she was getting this from the girl who cared for nothing beyond curl serum and designer nail files uh huh she replied blandly that why you ve been calling out his name in your sleep lily nearly toppled out of her chair i have not no you haven t charlotte shrugged but you might as well have been with all the dreamy looks you keep shooting him in class oh please lily felt a tad bit relieved good lord if she had been calling his name i just saying charlotte went back to unpacking lily fingers tapped softly on the stack of blank parchment before her she couldntshake the strange feeling that had just come over her had she really gone soft heat began swelling in her chest when was the last time she d gone to the library to study for her n e w t s she wanted a career and a life beyond this and she wasntgoing to get that by dwelling on james potter she sighed deeply to herself after all it wasntas if she was in love with him or anything lily flicked a bit of dust from her desk and rested her chin in her hand she d been tangled up in james business for so long now she d forgotten herself charlotte was right lily wasnta part of that world and she needed to come to terms with that it was over after all christmas with james had been nice but it was a bit of a fantasy suspended in time wasntit he had obligations there was no turning back from that now things were strained between the marauders that much was clear at lunch the following day sirius and remus sat together while at the opposite end james dined with peter and much to lily dismay edith sirius kept shooting unsubtle glances at james and edith while remus just gazed off into the distance lily jabbed her food robotically watching them from the ravenclaw table lily lily hmm lily turned her head mila gave her an exasperated look what is the matter with you you ve been acting strange all day it true charlotte agreed taking a bite of salad you didnteven raise your hand in potions today you always raise your hand in potions it like some sort of compulsive tic mmm lily mumbled sipping her pumpkin juice just have a lot on my mind well spill it mila glared dontleave us in the dark you haventeven told us about your christmas yet charlotte eyed lily briefly and then took another bite of salad she must have had some idea about what went on at the potter home she was there after all nothing happened it was supremely dull lily poked her bread i dontbelieve you mila frowned taking another bite lily didntrespond the three of them sat there eating in companionable silence for a bit she took a sip of juice and stared at charlotte and mila for the first time in weeks something occurred to her she had friends here she was halfway through the school year she thought would be complete hell and the two most unlikely people had turned out to be the two who provided the most comfort why shouldntshe be confiding in them you re right lily said suddenly laying down her fork some things did happen over holiday but the fluttering of wings interrupted their plates were showered in feathers as rue landed inelegantly on charlotte tossed salad ew she screeched shooing rue away ugh lily lily ignored her and took the parchment that was wrapped around rue ankle unraveling it at the table she gasped miss evans alexandria fine fittings is pleased to have received your final payment for the outstanding balance in question we would like to take this moment

her debt was thousands how could it possibly be paid she d plotted it out and it would have taken her years charlotte snatched the coupon that had fluttered to the table can i have this sure lily said distractedly mila frowned peering over her shoulder wow congratulations you must have been working hard what this charlotte frowned something was scrawled in ink on the back of the coupon happy christmas lils i they re best customer how come i never got a personalized coupon lily blanched er right she stood up suddenly and her plate cleared itself i i have to go lily ignored their odd looks and walked hurriedly toward the double doors she glanced back at the gryffindor table and caught james eyeing her his expression was unreadable she looked away quickly and fled the room the weeks passed by and january became february lily seventeenth birthday came and went and her thoughts shifted between school and her prefect duties in those passing weeks lily didntsee much of anyone she was busy catching up in her classes which had become increasingly difficult she didnteven have time to think about james in fact she hadntseen much of him at all or sirius for that matter she d seen bits of remus and peter in passing but they all seemed to be living separate lives sixth year seemed to have ripped them apart and lily couldnthelp but feel partially responsible finally after a few weeks her solitude was broken lily was fumbling with something in her bag when she jumped at a slender shadow looming over her lily books and quills went flying bugger she muttered crouching down to clean up her mess bending to help her was remus lupin he handed her a few pieces of the parchment abashedly sorry about that oh she laughed nervously that all right remus hovered a moment staring awkwardly at his feet lily cleared her throat well it was nice to see you maybe we can get together to study for the arithmancy exam i pretty behind yes he burst suddenly er i mean i d like that er okay great well bye then lily stuffed the last of the parchment in her bag and slipped past him strange but she didnthave much time to ponder because she nearly ran into the burly frame of eric maclean evans just the girl i was looking for he said fiercely grasping her shoulders erm why lily replied nervously prefect meeting at 3 sharp we ll be discussing campus cleanup he shuffled past her dontbe late lily frowned this was the fourth meeting in two weeks and she was getting particularly tired of seeing edith baldric perfect face she was never outright rude to lily no that wasntthe problem it was that she was sickeningly nice nonetheless she had to go so she forced a smile on her face and plopped down next to mila remus she noted did not show up it was a little irritating actually she d just seen him in the halls that morning in fact it was the third meeting he d missed in a row the other prefects slowly filed into the room and seated themselves in a circle when edith arrived she swept past lily gracefully and gave her a syrupy smile hello lily she simpered mila mila just glared stiffly perfectly aware that edith had been james date to the yule ball it pleased lily to know that mila was loyal right then eric bellowed let get started so edith and i have paired you up by house and assigned specific duties for the campus wide cleanup we have a list of students who signed up to assist you prefects and we ve divided them up as well slowly eric began reading off the names and who would be paired with which student helpers once the prefects had their assignments they filed out of the room mila passed lily and gave her an encouraging smile soon it was lily left alone eric examined his list hmm evans evans well lupin has been sick the past few meetings so we didntassign any students to you but dontworry lily edith added breezily i ve got the perfect job for you right eric agreed handing edith the clipboard i ve got to suit up for practice but you go on ahead cheers evans erm lily held up a hand in protest but eric had already lumbered out the door humming a quidditch chant she turned sourly back to edith and folded her arms edith just smirked you ll be scouring the bleachers on the quidditch pitch i think you ll find the job hasntbeen tended to in decades isntthat filch job she said through gritted teeth edith waved a hand dismissively yes well you know how busy he is lily after all this program was designed to give students the opportunity to pitch in with the grounds keeping then why am i the only one assigned to the grounds lucky draw edith lips twitched lily was ready to lunge fine i ll just get started shall i oh good i ll meet you down there i watching james practice today oh good lily snatched up her book bag and stomped out of the room how perfect she thought bitterly scrubbing the entire bleachers with one wand this was going to be a night to remember after throwing on some old clothes lily gathered up her things and headed down to the quidditch pitch it was early evening and the team practice was nearly over lily purposely timed it that way she wasntexactly leaping at the idea of having the entire gryffindor quidditch team watch her doing the work of a house elf with a few buckets and sponges from the kitchens lily traversed the grounds until she reached the pitch damn she d forgotten just how large the stands were she dropped the pails at her feet and followed the towering bleachers up to the sky where hogwarts banners flew brazenly in the cool breeze she could hear shouting from the other end of the pitch sure enough james was leading his team in various drills he blew a whistle and a line of broomsticks shot across the pitch in a blur of red then flipped artfully and sped back good she heard james shout you lot jenkins burton black other goal post let do some relays obediently the three swiveled their broomsticks and zoomed to lily end of the field sirius spotted her and grinned evans he shouted down at her hovering idly what brings you out here er he spotted the buckets have you given yourself detention then lily grimaced no thank you it campus wide cleanup day thank you black for signing up to help she added sardonically he shrugged and did a little flip practice love he winked and rejoined his hovering teammates lily grumbled she began steadily climbing the stands when she d reached the top she accidentally looked down she swayed and clutched a railing tightly her stomach giving a little turn she blinked and spotted edith across the pitch sitting comfortably at the foot of some bleachers watching james lily stomach did another somersault and she dropped the buckets haphazardly with her wand she filled them each and then charmed them to begin scrubbing around her on her own hands and knees she began crawling around searching for mold to scourgify a sudden painful thump to her backside made her reel lily whirled around wand pointed defensively and just what are you doing up here miss evans james grinned playfully tossing the quaffle up and down in his left hand you ass lily kicked a sponge and jabbed her wand in his direction rubbing her sore left buttock how dare you oh come now lily is that any way to thank me for you christmas present lily frowned and brushed the sticky hair from her forehead i james i cantaccept that gift why he narrowed his eyes suddenly didntyou like it i thought you hated working at that robe shop lily fidgeted and glanced in the direction of edith who was now standing and peering inquisitively in their direction arms folded icily yes well james i think i ve taken enough money from you i really dontwant to be in your debt he brushed a hand dismissively bollocks it not a debt lily it a gift a few of his teammates began hollering for him right but it just doesntseem appropriate lily tightened the scarf around her neck to hell with appropriate he seemed a bit angry now oy james james let out a frustrated yell tossed the quaffle up and spun his broom around giving it a violent whack in the direction of his anxious teammates he turned back to lily it just a gift lily didntrespond she peered down at the dirty bleachers and sheathed her wand when she looked up james heaved an aggravated sigh and flipped his broom around speeding back to his teammates apparently practice was over james leapt off his broom and the rest of the team began pulling off their gloves and loading up the balls much to lily dismay edith was being extremely helpful she reached out and touched james sleeve lovingly then pulled his face down for a quick kiss james was resistant and distracted edith pulled away and shot lily the most disdainful look before following the team toward the lockers lily sighed and turned back to her cleaning like bloody cinderella except she d already missed the grand ball just then the bleachers gave a startling lurch lily crouched next to a bucket grabbed hold of the bench in front of her the structure shook again this time violently soapy water went flying and lily fumbled for her wand but she wasntquick enough the bleachers began rocking dangerously flinging her body back and forth she leapt up and grabbed a hold of one of the railings desperately clinging to the splintering wood but it was too late the soap slicked wood began crumbling beneath her feet as the entire thing began to collapse lily caught a terrifying glimpse of the ground so far below her and then she fell lily tumbled through the sky grasping blindly for anything but only felt her arms scraping bits of jagged timber then out of nowhere an arm slipped nimbly around her waist wrenching her back with a jolt the arm held her firmly to its body it was then she realized she was atop a broomstick wobbling through the air dangerously but they continued to fall the broom taking a beating against thick beams of wood as the stands came crashing down just as they were about to swoop clear of the calamity a large beam with a yellow and black banner attached toppled from above and slammed into them snapping the broom in two like a twig lily screamed as she and her rescuer plummeted to the earth they hit the ground hard with a crack but whoever had caught her had also broken her fall lily blinked through the cloud of dust she groaned and kicked the debris off of her chest and legs for the love of get off a voice beneath her sputtered oh i sorry lily rolled off the body and gasped to find james grimacing back at her james are you all right he was lying flat on his back and she began prodding him roughly oof be gentle please he puffed he groaned and forced himself up on his elbows they were surrounded by logs and crumbled wooden benches and she could hear people shouting and running toward them from across the pitch sorry lily brushed the dust from his chest and picked a shard of broomstick out of his tangled black hair james caught her wrist suddenly and gripped it tightly are you all right his hazel eyes bore into hers lily nodded her eyes glistening slightly i fine she reached up and gently cupped his dirt smudged face in her palms you caught me james turned his eyes away abashedly yes well he began gruffly you were helpless up there i had to do something lily didntbother to protest his chauvinist words they were soon interrupted anyway by a loud crack eric maclean had physically lifted a giant log and tossed it into a nearby pile of rubble are you both all right he bellowed cheeks ruddy and slicked with sweat the entire gryffindor team along with edith and a few other spectators were right behind him one of them a small first year girl shrieked deafeningly his leg lily turned her head and blanched how could she not have noticed before to her horror she saw that james left leg was bloody and awkwardly bent jagged bone was protruding through the flesh of his knee james swore colorfully and swayed slightly at the sight grabbing lily arm to steady himself bloody hell prongs sirius shook his head crouching down beside him that one for the record books i fine he scowled james edith scrambled forward and dropped to his side shoving lily out of the way look at you we need to get him to the hospital wing lily said calmly james was still gripping her arm edith shot her a withering glare and grabbed james hand placing it in her own well we wouldntif you hadntbeen so bloody clumsy lily gaped clumsy the bleachers collapsed under m i ll take him eric offered leaning down careful of james bloodied leg he promptly conjured a stretcher and with the help of sirius and the other beater loaded james on top the entire group followed the stretcher up the path back to the castle save for lily who lingered behind in the rubble lily sighed and examined a small scratch on her wrist then she peered up at the stands that structure was solid there was no reason for it to collapse so suddenly it felt like the entire earth had been quaking and violently at that no it wasntsome isolated earthquake that lily concluded bitterly was magic and there was only one person lily could think of that would want her wounded or worse partway up the path to the castle edith onyx locks shimmered in the sunlight she turned suddenly as if sensing lily burning stare and shot her another piercing glare before turning back to dote on james it could have been lily imagination or a perhaps a trick of the light but she could have sworn she caught a small smirk flit across edith lips a n thank you all again for the reviews you guys kick butt chapter twenty two confrontation moonlight spilled into the courtyard illuminating lily pale skin she had propped herself up on the stonewall where the climbing roses had frozen in the winter cold they were still rich and green but flowered no more it was the perfect place to brood perhaps that why mila flopped down beside her looking so somber lily hmm she turned her head reluctantly from the view of the glistening grounds i heard what happened it took me ages to find you she said why didntyou come tell me lily sighed i guess i just needed to think on my own for a while oh lily you cantpossibly think what happened is your fault mila set down her book bag her blonde hair swishing against the cool stone oh no i know exactly whose fault it was what lily you cantreally blame a thing like that on someone can you i mean it was a freak accident lily stared out across the grounds with a purposeful look in her eye exactly it had to be magic mila that was a sturdy structure there no way it would collapse on its own lily i know what you re thinking charlotte told me about edith lily grunted you dontknow the half of it that would have been some pretty heavy magic lily someone would have noticed edith performing a spell like that okay so she had someone do it for her who would agree to that i mean they could have killed you mila exclaimed look lily i think you re reading way too much into this have you gone to see james yet no well maybe you should just get some sleep and then visit him in the morning lily grunted all right but she wasntnearly convinced she knew the culprit and she wasntabout to let edith get away with it the next morning lily contemplated stopping by the hospital wing but thought better of it when the image of edith feeding james with a spoon crossed her mind so instead she headed to the library to meet remus lily he said looking genuinely happy when she arrived with an inordinate amount of books teetering in her clutches he leapt up and snatched them from her carrying them in a very gentlemanly fashion oh thank you lily took a seat and began unloading her book bag she shuffled through her things looking for an inkpot when she lifted her head she spotted remus staring at her he looked away quickly and cleared his throat so where do you want to start er i was thinking potions potions lily frowned you arenteven in advanced potions oh right er well then arithmancy i suppose he cleared his throat nervously again and blushed visibly remus are you all right lily was genuinely concerned you know you ve missed the past few prefect meetings yes i very sorry about that he quickly changed the subject so how are you feeling from the other day i mean i fine james not so much right remus frowned pomfrey wontlet him play for two weeks the break was pretty bad lily jumped two weeks isntthe next game against slytherin on friday remus nodded dontthink we ll be winning that she frowned and began mindlessly flipping through the pages of her book remus shifted uncomfortably lily can i ask you something sure she said distractedly well it just that i dontreally have anyone to talk to these days you know things haventbeen quite right between sirius and james it just put a wedge in everything lily shifted her attention away from the pages and looked remus in the eye is something bothering you he snorted softly and grimaced at the library table more like some things i can i trust you not to repeat this lily was extremely interested now of course what it is the bags beneath his eyes appeared more prominent as he spoke his lips moving against pale skin i saw i saw sirius with edith they were arguing about some things i dontthink you have to guess what lily shook her head sirius saw me he made me promise not to tell james remus fiddled with the corner of his textbook the thing is edith said something that seemed odd what lily was on the edge of her seat what did she say it was something about her parents she was saying they were forcing her to be with james well we knew that much no no it what she said afterward that it being with james was only temporary lily jaw dropped what is that supposed to mean you dontthink that that she would kill james she whispered eerily paranoia consuming her remus shook his head vehemently no of course not sirius may be in love with edith but i highly doubt he d allow his best friend to be murdered i just wonder what she meant is all anyway i dontmean to burden you with this sirius wontspeak to me about it i just know that you care about james he looked at her hard his eyes flickering his gaze was so intense that lily had to turn away right well i ll look into it okay thank you really he said i promised sirius i would say nothing to james i made no promises about speaking to you he smiled weakly lily nodded and stared at her book somberly i donttrust her i haventfrom the beginning remus sighed i know rays of light splayed out across the grassy quidditch pitch the sun was setting and cast a golden hue upon everything lily walked purposefully towards the field swelling with anger and adrenaline she squinted into the distance and saw several members of the slytherin team filing off the grass toward the castle they were laughing and joking patting each other on the backs then lily spotted her thick black waves tumbling down her back as she pulled a rubber band from her hair every bit of edith glistened in the setting sun it was no wonder boys couldntkeep their hands off of her taking a deep breath fists wound tightly at her sides lily trudged deliberately toward edith who was chatting up a couple of her rather large male teammates she didntrealize how large until she was standing at their feet they peered down at her grimacing beater bats thrown casually over their shoulders edith followed their gaze and merely smirked derisively when her eyes landed on lily can i help you she gave lily a once over hardly bothering to turn more than her head lily folded her arms i need to talk to you edith exchanged glances with her beaters and they grumbled something before trudging off edith turned and faced lily what i know you had something to do with james injury just like you had something to do with my father losing his job edith scoffed and removed her quidditch gloves methodically that is quite an accusation but i not sure i know what you re talking about i sure lily fumed just like you care so much for james she snorted the arrangement has been made lily i afraid you cantchange that even if you re in love with him you re clearly not lily spat what is it exactly that you are in love with his money the prestige or is it a game to you seeing what it takes to win him for yourself a game edith sighed airily and waved a hand please lily give me more credit than that i have a great interest in james potter for a number of reasons love means nothing in business trust me this is the best play for all parties involved right and what about sirius how does he fit into all this sirius edith spat bitterly but her eyes flickered strangely sirius is a fool he chose a different path and when the time comes he ll suffer the consequences i helping james giving him a way out i can protect him what that supposed to mean protect him from what twilight was upon them and a cool winter breeze had kicked up lily pulled her scarf tighter around her neck what do you think she said darkly moving towards lily her eyes flashing why do you think his parents agreed to the marriage the breeze swept the hair from lily cheeks and sent a chill up her spine edith smirked my family is from a long line of slytherins who are close enough to the dark lord to offer that kind of protection by my side james will be safe that all his father wants whatever the price may be you you call that protection lily stammered taking a step back from edith incredulity filling her emerald eyes you ll put james right in the middle of everything that not the kind of life james wants he a good person and i wontlet you do that to him how do you know what he wants edith snarled suddenly breaking her composure not everyone gets the things they want in this world lily not everyone can be so fortunate why is james potter so special he made a binding agreement with his family if you truly cared about him lily shook you d never ask such a horrible question well edith relaxed a bit in the face still wearing a snarl isntthat pretty to think so and you care so much about him to know haventyou ever been in love lily burst suddenly admitting something without fully realizing what she d said sirius loves you you know he cares for you how could you do something so cruel turn your back on someone who cares so much for you tears were springing to her eyes now lily shook her head thinking about what remus had told her what was edith up to toying with sirius lily hoped it was dark enough so that edith couldntsee her crying weakness was the last thing she needed to be showing now and what if it doesntmatter what i feel hmm edith replied blandly it doesntmatter what you feel either james made his choice and so did you or have you forgotten you accepted the money that the potters offered you or have you spent all your galleons so soon lily narrowed her eyes striding forward and closing the gap between them so that she was nose to nose with edith you did have something to do with my father losing his job lily whatever you think happened i sure there a reasonable explanation even in the dark lily could see that her eyes were alight with malice like say your father is a fool who canteven hang on to a paper pushing muggle job lily fists balled up how dare you besides edith narrowed her eyes and leaned forward her shapely lips curving there no proving the imperious curse lily slapped her you bitch edith held a hand to her cheek and licked her lips you took the money it your own fault you canthave james you have to stay away from him you re right lily nodded i did take that money but i think you ll find mr potter made a rather generous contribution to the international wizard hair follicle renewal research fund thinning wizards around the world will be eternally grateful edith expression contorted with fury well arentyou bloody clever she hissed bearing down upon lily you stay away from james i will make your life a living hell lily evans it going to take a hell of a lot more than money and trying to throw me off quidditch stands to scare me away really and what makes you think i had anything to do with that i not stupid edith lily glared yes well just like certain curses that is a very difficult accusation to prove though i regret james was caught up in the middle i so sure with him out of the way you re sure to win the match on friday was that part of your plan too injure me and hope that james would be brave enough to throw himself in the fray as well edith laughed humorlessly you have quite the imagination lily her eyes flashed smugly but i was with the gryffindor team and my wand was in my pocket the entire time so good luck pinning that on me lily stared edith down you obviously dontknow me her face was hot because i love a challenge she turned and headed back to the castle leaving edith to stew in her wake scritch scratch scritch scratch scribbling furiously lily brushed her tangled red locks from her forehead smearing a bit of ink across her cheek she dipped the quill and continued to scribble and what are you doing evans helen frowned curling her hair in the mirror beside lily bed it extremely irritating lily ignored her and continued writing helen sauntered over and nearly tripped over one of the scrolls littering the floor at lily feet she picked one up and examined it potions helen sneered this is the longest bloody essay i ve ever seen that the fifth scroll lily replied distractedly her head still bent helen cringed and tossed the scroll on her way to the loo right she rolled her eyes luckily for lily helen had kindly filled charlotte shoes and was doing quite a good job at making her miserable but lily had bigger things to think about and as she learned once before from charlotte helen was all bark and no bite charlotte finally returned from dinner wearing a strange expression when she caught sight of lily she frowned hands on hips just what are you doing evans working she gaped exactly how long were you planning on making this essay charlotte lifted the same scroll helen had thrown eyeing it distastefully as long as it takes for me to figure a few things out really charlotte flopped down atop her bed and kicked off her heels writing an essay lily seems i was wrong about you you re back to being strange and a bit peaky you should really get some sun you know lily sighed turning to her i just it helps me think better when i working she frowned suddenly and jabbed her finger at the floor before charlotte are those new shoes er what charlotte shifted uncomfortably and kicked the sparkly blue heels beneath her bed those old things just then helen burst from the bathroom looking haughty as usual she strode purposefully toward the door primped and pampered she jerked to a stop suddenly when something caught her eye she turned menacingly to charlotte and pointed at a shimmering blue heel poking out from beneath the bed skirt what is that charlotte raised her eyebrows and slid the shoes back out daintily with a toe oh these old things i picked them up the other day you helen growled eyes mere slits you she threw up her arms exasperatedly and stormed out of the dorm slamming the door behind her the entire room shook and a few things clattered off lily desk let me guess lily rolled her eyes charlotte grinned diabolically she been dying to get a hold of these ever since she saw them in the witch wardrobe catalog lily narrowed her eyes i thought you didnthave any money yes well she waved a hand breezily the situation has changed a bit lily eyes lit up charlotte that wonderful so you re father is doing well then i told you things would start looking up she cleared her throat awkwardly and took off her cloak yes er right well what that she looked over lily shoulder and jabbed her finger accusingly lily followed her gaze and blanched when helen slammed the door the dusty old broomstick she d confiscated had toppled to the floor from behind the desk oh er that just something i took from a first year months ago charlotte eyed her strangely arentyou supposed to turn things like that into mcgonagall er well it depends really i see charlotte rolled her eyes and flicked open witch weekly whatever lily nervously snatched up the broom and stuffed it away then she paused thoughtfully hand still gripping the smooth wood of the handle what if there was a loud crash and then shards of glass and flower petals littered the floor of the hospital wing water trickled across the worn floorboards and james nearly slipped on his one good leg back in bed this instant potter madame pomfrey cried throwing a spell at his chest and flinging him back into his cot i won t this is bloody madness he roared i perfectly capable of flying madness indeed madame pomfrey tapped the glass shards with her wand and mended the broken vase setting it daintily back atop the bedside table james pouted just cut the damn thing off i dontneed two legs to play quidditch i sure you like to think so but mr potter there is no one around to impress at the moment surely not me so i suggest you lie back down and get some rest she said shrilly and turned on her heel er lily cleared her throat and tapped lightly on the open door am i interrupting james caught sight of her and grumbled turning his attention back to his lap not at all lily raised her eyebrows and took a seat at james side how are you he just grunted are you angry with me that depends james leaned back and fluffed up his thick dark hair have you decided to accept your gift the the gift lily sputtered james i talking about your leg he brushed the air dismissively i asked you a question lily frowned well i have no choice i tried to get alexandria to give you your galleons back but they werenttoo keen on that idea james guffawed you tried to only you lily you kill me i know i almost did lily knitted her brows together i owe you my life james what were you thinking you could have been killed she trailed off eyes lingering on his leg wrappings james frowned and stared out the window i d do it again no you won t i forbid it james turned and stared at her he reached a hand out and touched her cheek gently lily could feel the skin burn where his palm lingered it caused her to suck in her breath sharply he brushed his thumb softly and pulled it away he held it up to show lily a smudge of ink he d wiped from her cheek eyes flickering mischievously fraid you donthave a say in how many times i allowed to help you lily could feel a smile tugging at her lips as long as i donthave to be your slave well he said breezily we ll see about that there was a long pause and lily let her gaze wander out the window as well she hesitated debating whether to tell james about edith but stopped herself each time for some reason she didntwant to ruin their companionable silence besides what could he do lily however had a plan it was her turn to help james i was thinking of a way i could pay you back she said suddenly turning to meet his warm hazel eyes james straightened up and stared at her attentively pay me back well it the least i can do for you helping me james frowned absolutely not sirius flung his bat over his shoulder walking determinedly toward the lockers he was already in a poor mood from the way quidditch practice had gone without james not well that what james said lily grumbled trying to keep up with sirius long legs please sirius it the only way i can think of to pay james back sirius stopped in his tracks and turned to face her leaning in so close she could feel his breath on her forehead you know any one of us could have swooped out there to catch you james just happened to get there first if jenkins had caught you would you be begging to fill in for him at next friday game lily didntanswer that what i thought so no i a quick learner no just give me a chance i i need to show edith that i not weak lily blushed sirius sighed and ran a hand through his hair lily please sirius you owe me she watched him carefully he rolled his gray eyes and propped his bat up on the ground leaning sideways on it exhaustedly he took a deep breath all right you can fill in for james at friday game but that is the only time and you d better not get hurt or he ll have my neck yes lily leapt up and kissed him on the cheek she neglected to mention that she d already run it by james and his response was less than enthusiastic but he d be confined to the hospital wing anyway how would he find out thank you thank you thank you come on i ll take you for a quick test run and we ll see how you do just look out for the bludger all right lily frowned er which one is the bodger again sirius pinched the bridge of his nose bludger a n thanks for keeping up the great reviews guys this story is quickly wrapping itself up just to warn you please stick with me until the end i promise not to disappoint keep reviewing i beg you chapter twenty six goodbye lily had been pondering what could possibly make edith risk everything she and her family had been working for over a boy the conclusion she continued to draw made her not only uncomfortable but more and more uneasy with the idea of using the information against her it was clear now lily thought to herself with a bit of an ache in her heart that edith was in love with sirius black despite all of her previous snide comments she knew perfectly well also that sirius was in love with edith how could lily possibly bring herself to ruin that taking that away from him well it just wasntin her she couldntdo it even if that meant giving up wholeheartedly on james potter not that she cared about that prat after all he had been using her as for madeline well she would just have to think of something else the owl post arrived a bit earlier than usual on friday night as charlotte and lily were chatting amiably about hemlines rue crudely stepped in her mashed potatoes upon his landing interrupting their conversation and her dinner lily cast him a disapproving glare before taking the scroll from his outstretched leg haughtily he fluffed his brown feathers turned and fluttered off what a queen lily grumbled as she unraveled the letter gross charlotte glowered at the owl dropping which had landed conveniently atop her next forkful of salad she dropped it and shoved the plate away what are you looking so pleased about it a letter lily proclaimed her eyes darting delightedly over the scroll from your cousin melinda oh her charlotte rolled her eyes and watched as her plate disappeared she snatched a roll and began picking at it so what it say lily i cantwait to hear all about your time at school that i ve missed i think it wonderful you ve made friends with charlotte i think you ll be an excellent influence on her as per the article well i ve come quite far but it is difficult to find strong enough sources there have always been rumblings regarding the baldrics as supporters of you know who but nothing can be confirmed no one is brave enough to step forward and solidify the claims at least not in the current climate what with the continual uprisings what i could tell you i wouldntdare communicate through owl post i hope you understand but your interest concerns me please dontinvolve yourself in anything dangerous lily take care melinda lily smile rapidly faded the brusque ending of the letter irked her melinda of all people should know she wouldntseek out danger er well intentionally anyway she quickly crumpled the letter and stuffed it into her cloak pocket nothing important she just makes me so mad charlotte grumbled stuffing a chunk of bread into her mouth melinda lily frowned trying to think how anyone could possibly dislike her no helen lily followed charlotte angry glare over her left shoulder to where helen halverson was seated with edith baldric james florence and several others strangely helen was staring straight at them it was unnerving her pale blue eyes scouring them calculatingly she didntlook away even when lily raised an inquisitive brow lily turned back to charlotte did you do something to her recently charlotte shook her head on the contrary i helped her out she become edith eyes and ears lately it the reason she traded me those shoes for the details about edith and sirius right lily casually glanced back over her shoulder helen was still staring as she popped another forkful of roast into her mouth lily gaze traveled inadvertently toward james back he was leaning towards edith and whispering she giggled and took a sip of her pumpkin juice suddenly helen nudged her and nodded in lily direction both edith and james turned edith just scoffed while james eyes lingered a moment lily whipped around her cheeks heating up pathetic if you ask me charlotte said her eyes still narrowed in helen direction i never would have stooped so low she tore into another roll with her teeth she spoke through a full mouth she thinks by pleasing edith she ll move up the social ladder but you just cantscramble out of the shallow but slippery hole that is upper middle class she ll never be me lily folded her napkin and stood i going to the library charlotte quickly followed scurrying after her down the hallway hey she said trying to keep up with lily tottering in her heels have you thought at all about what i said yesterday i have lily was curt charlotte stared at her that it you have lily didntrespond she rounded a corner and began to climb the staircase when charlotte snagged her sleeve lily this is serious we need to come up with a plan she whispered excitedly peering over her shoulder to make sure they werentbeing watched charlotte because i was thinking there this fundraiser being held at the potter this month in honor of his birthday i think it something about rescuing the endangered blue snouted ukrainian ironbelly i mean my parents wontbe invited but i know someone who could get us guest invites i cantdo it charlotte froze mid sentence her wide eyes narrowing what i sorry lily you do realize this is our only chance to exact revenge she hissed clenching her fist is this because of sirius i mean really lily it just lily began i dontwant to hurt him he been so good to me oh merlin charlotte threw her arms up in the air now you like him lily make up your mind james sirius james sirius i have a headache charlotte it isntthat i just dontthink i can do it for a moment charlotte looked blank then realization crossed her features and her eyebrow twitched i knew it i knew you didnthave it in you she was shaking her head as she folded her arms and i thought you d changed it the means that bothers me i feel so sneaky and cruel i dontwant to stoop to edith level there has to be another way lily the end always justifies the means charlotte exclaimed if you want to play in the big leagues you have to get your hands a little dirty i thought you knew that when you claimed you wanted to get even with edith lily frowned and smoothed her robes absently you just dontunderstand charlotte grabbed lily shoulder suddenly forcing lily to look her in the eye i dontunderstand i didntmean no charlotte narrowed her eyes let get one thing straight edith may have taken james away from you but she took everything away from my family i have a stake in this too you know lily was suddenly ashamed i sorry charlotte shook her blonde curls and frowned forget it if this is what you want then fine i wontsay anything thank you whatever i have to go to work lily nodded okay i ll see you later but charlotte was gone before lily even finished her sentence she peered up at the portrait above her the group of darkly suited old men peering at her quickly shuffled and looked away clearing their throats lily sighed and climbed dully up the stairs to the library when her foot caught on the lip of a step and she tumbled ungracefully to her knees her books scattering everywhere talk about d j vu grumbling she brushed off her skirt and began gathering her things to the sniggering of the suited men in the portrait she was about to snap when she noticed a pair of dark shoes right across from her nose they were much less raggedy than kenneth sneakers in fact they looked very expensive she peered up cautiously and nearly toppled down the rest of the staircase when she locked eyes with james father you might be more careful in the future child he nudged a stray book aside with the leather toe of his shoe and clopped down past her without another word right i wait a minute why was she apologizing you know you could learn to say excuse me once in awhile immediately she regretted her words the man turned his silvery head around to meet her livid green eyes with his hazel ones he surveyed her briefly evans correct yes she thought bitterly the one you tried to blackmail she nodded tersely keeping her expression impassive he smirked and turned back around no wonder he muttered to himself she was about to question him when he called brusquely over his shoulder james now lily froze as james clopped down the stairs past her as well she tried her best not to look at him but curiosity got the best of her she followed the back of his black robes as he trailed behind his father she wondered what business james father had at the school but she figured it had something to do with the governing board or some such just as she was turning back to her scattered books james cast his eyes back over his shoulder watching her for the longest moment there was something unreadable there but the moment abruptly came to an end sooner than she could digest it the next second he had rounded the corner with his father scrambling to gather her things she scurried up the staircase and found the library her only safe haven with relief she found her usual table in the corner and set out to find an arithmancy text she d heard professor vector mention during a lecture on the chaldean method the shelf she was perusing was thick with dust which frankly boggled lily mind since it was one of her favorite subjects she found the equations thoroughly satisfying to solve and the answers far less dubious than divination news to me a girl on the other side of the shelf was whispering not very quietly so did james have a say maybe he was embarrassed about the last quidditch match that ridiculous a higher voice chimed in what about this one said a third brittana and gareth are supposed to finally get together in this one greta will you put that book away we re talking about james potter here said the first voice anyway the second high pitched one piped where did you hear it from helen halverson she just came down to the great hall and spilled it well what does edith have to say about it the third voice added glumly clearly still stung from being chided lily pressed her ear up against the bookcase eagerly well the first voice softened slightly i dontknow about her but sirius black didntseem all that beat up about it do you think he maybe i mean everyone knows he wants edith baldric for himself look all i know is that by three this afternoon james potter will be long gone no more hogwarts for him what a shame he was so pretty to look at brittana and gareth have never faced such adversity greta sighed glumly lily dropped her arithmancy book her face turning ghostly white james was leaving hogwarts her mind began to race and she had to prop herself up against the dusty books she thought about the conversation she d had with remus about sirius and edith that he d caught edith telling sirius she was forced to be with james and that well it being with james remus had said cryptically was only temporary edith words swirled around in her head could this be what she d meant that she would get james taken out of school so that she could be with sirius awkwardly lily began stuffing her things back in her bag but when her notebooks crumpled up and got jammed she hastily flung it to the ground and sped out of the library glancing at the clock on her way 2 45 stumbling down the staircase nearly repeating the earlier incident lily ran she ran until there was a stitch in her chest and even then she ignored it and kept running she shoved past students and nearly crushed a wide eyed first year and didntstop until she d reached the front of the castle she took the steps two at a time and when she reached the bottom she came to an abrupt halt on the path the grounds were empty and silent but for a horseless carriage and a few house elves packing a trunk in it there they were james and his father mr potter had already boarded and was gazing silently out the other window james had just reached up to pull himself in when james she bellowed he turned to see her standing there chest heaving breathlessly her face was likely red and sweaty but she didntcare he said something to his father who looked displeased but nodded brusquely nonetheless in his normal manner james sauntered toward her hands stuffed casually in his pockets you re leaving she breathed did you run here james eyes danced mischievously answer my question she said harshly he hesitated then nodded shortly and folded his hands behind his head my father says it too dangerous to be here now that i going to be seventeen in a few weeks but that doesntmake sense lily scoured her brain trying to follow the reasoning dumbledore is here there no place safer not according to my father he sending me to france with my grandmother i going to finish out this year there and stay the summer but do you want to go james laughed hollowly what i want doesntmatter i obligated to my family you were going to leave without saying goodbye it wasnta question lily eyes traveled to her shoes i didntthink there was much point lily nodded and what about edith we ll be married by then lily jaw dropped she was certain her face was ghostly white m married he nodded again but quickly changed the subject so good luck with the head girl thing lily was more concerned about his brisk marriage at the moment but she humored him i haventgotten a letter yet you will his hazel eyes sparkled lily stood there silently while james turned to leave i ll see you around he said over his shoulder she bit her lip and fiddled with the frayed hem of her left sleeve right wrong this was all wrong james couldntleave he shouldnt he was going to marry the wrong person at the wrong time in the wrong place he should be she could feel a tear trickling down her cheek and she wiped it away roughly this was all happening so fast she never got the chance to before she could finish the thought james had turned on his heel and caught lily by the shoulders pulling her toward him he didntkiss her though his breath tickled her lips a moment as he hovered there lily heart pounding so hard she could feel it even taste it in her throat and then he hugged her close his arms comfortingly around her lily wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his shoulder tears springing despite her efforts to hide them i going to miss you evans he said gruffly into her tangled hair she swallowed hard trying to find the words to reply i i going to miss you too potter he pulled away and peered down at her his hazel eyes dark and unreadable it been fun i mean you never quite caught up to me but you came damn close are you kidding close she laughed shakily trying to keep her composure i unrivaled james potter he smirked handsomely that you are with that he turned toward his beckoning father stuffing his hands into his pockets head bowed low he didntlook back and then they were gone a n well guys this is it i just wanted to tell you how much your reviews and support have meant to me over these past few years since i started this story in 2004 i feel i ve learned a lot and my writing has greatly improved i ll continue with my other stories as this final chapter of unrivaled comes to a close i just hope you ve all enjoyed reading this fic as much as i have enjoyed writing it i wish i could give each and every one of you a big fat hug much love the kat chapter twenty eight final chances with spring came hints of good weather starting that tuesday the sun was out shining through the high windows of the great hall teasing the students locked up inside lily flipped the page of her paper and took a sip of pumpkin juice in the autumn of 1968 these little known facts have been concealed for decades allowing the baldric family to conduct their affairs with little to no interference weaseling their way into the homes of many upper class wizarding families with well known names the vanes among the others were unfortunately swindled out of their booming cauldron company in return for the baldric vow of protection from you know who a new investigation regarding these incidents has been opened by the ministry in light of the recent findings and testimonies regarding the once sealed lofgren case both aldus and gemma kaufman names have been cleared see related article they are now residing in a care home for rehabilitation from their years wrongfully locked away in azkaban in such dark times the only hope is that these revelations prove the flaw in the justice system and make the ministry of defense far more aware of the wide network of you know who followers melinda moonshine staff writer for the daily prophet lily folded up her copy of the prophet mr and mrs baldric faces plastered shamefully on the cover and right beside them in another article a photo of a beautiful blonde woman smiled back at her with the title verdict on lofgren kaufman case overturned printed in bold it a good day charlotte beamed at lily long weekend but a good day today yeah lily looked across the table at charlotte chewing thoughtfully on her cheek i ve been meaning to ask i dontunderstand she said that photo you took behind alexandria you said it was sirius charlotte popped a bit of sausage in her mouth and swallowed yeah well it was dark i finally got around to cleaning it up and there is was clear as a bell bellamy grimm well lily grimaced it still doesntmake what you did right but it sure was fun charlotte relished the look in edith eyes was priceless there was a soft rap on lily shoulders and she spun around to meet professor mcgonagall stern gaze she pressed her glasses up the tip of her nose and cleared her throat professor miss evans she spoke tersely through thin lips i have someone who d like to speak with you er lily looked bewilderedly at charlotte who simply shrugged and stuffed another strip of bacon in her mouth this way please mcgonagall said sharply already turning away and heading for the door er lily scrambled out of her seat stumbling over her own book bag okay coming she gave charlotte one last weird glance before chasing after the swift moving mcgonagall huffing and mildly winded lily followed mcgonagall all the way to her office once inside the door latching with a soft click lily was directed to a wingback chair by her mahogany desk a large blonde head poked up and a wide face met lily with a smile kenneth lily was startled what sorry we have to meet here kenneth looked bashfully at his feet mcgonagall ahem mcgonagall cleared her throat primly with a sharp look i mean professor mcgonagall thought it would be best not to advertise my whereabouts but lily was still confused looking from the professor to kenneth why did something happen i ll say mcgonagall adjusted her glasses with a faint smirk kenneth flushed and sniffled well i took your advice actually it was charlotte vane who gave me the name of your friend writing the article and that how it started before i knew it i was standing before the wizengamot lily was speechless so that how melinda was able to publish the article but i suppose i really owe it all to you my parents are finally free he looked at his large hands a moment i just i really needed to apologize to you for you know not having your back at the party oh well i was a complete sod i sorry lily what else could she say it okay kenneth things worked out for the best she smiled and she put a hand on his arm i proud of you you were very brave he blushed again thanks lily kaufman it time for you to get going mcgonagall began ushering kenneth toward a large trunk in the corner wait lily began putting two and two together you re leaving he cantvery well stay here mcgonagall chirped it not safe fraid i canttell you either kenneth shrugged but dumbledore made arrangements for me lily paled she hadnteven thought about the repercussions for kenneth after all he d just testified about a murder and put two death eaters in azkaban he d surely be a target and she d encouraged him oh kenneth i so sorry i didntrealize he shook his ruddy head vehemently dontbe for once he took a deep breath i feel brave mcgonagall huffed well you are a gryffindor kenneth beamed yes you are lily beamed back on her way back down to breakfast lily thoughts wandered to mila ever since her family had been informed about the overturned verdict they d been gone from school mila had sent a short letter letting her know she d be back at the end of the week she had taken the news just fine but it still dredged up unwanted memories still she wore a bright smile and after absorbing everything she asked lily about james but lily didntreally have an answer like mila james had also disappeared and though she d been thinking about him constantly actually she also knew he probably needed space after all his family had been plotting behind his back and was trying to force him out of the country whatever the reason and though lily hadntseen much of anyone the whole weekend she did run into someone she hadntplanned on monday on her way to charms she passed through the astronomy tower stumbling across a shrunken figure lounging on a windowsill her dark wavy hair caught a breeze and fluttered back to reveal dark sad eyes intent on lily when she froze on the spot unable to move her legs edith lily stared at her edith didntfrighten her anymore she just smirked and turned back to the view lily noticed she wasntwearing her robes and she seemed a bit thinner and paler lily was about to slip out the side door when edith spoke to her going to class she stopped in her tracks and turned responding hesitantly charms you edith laughed hollowly no i just waiting for my aunt to collect the rest of my things lily really didntwant to talk but felt suddenly compelled to humor her your aunt edith swung her legs around so that she was facing lily yes she taking me to bulgaria for a few months to wait things out so no graduation lily pulled awkwardly on the strap of her book bag no graduation she stared at lily a moment her dark lashes shading any expression her eyes might have had i d better i knew once word got out about grimm the only way to keep things in order would be to get james away from hogwarts so i convinced his father it wasntsafe here i just didntthink they would want to send me too she blurted suddenly lily bit her cheek you wanted to be here with sirius she fell silent and kicked a loose stone in the wall with the back of her foot why er if you dontmind me asking did you risk everything for that slytherin beater edith eyes were shaded everyone gets lonely she tipped her head back and smirked and sirius wouldntgive in he become too much of a good boy i think i should blame you for that there was something that had been bothering her those scars on your wrist lily pointed shyly isntthat you saw them edith sighed shortly and turned her head away scratching at the phantom wounds self consciously my parents had the dark mark given to me when i was fourteen i spent a full seven months trying to burn cut tear and hex it off nothing worked of course she looked lily in the eye darkly a small smirk on her lips just another testament to the life i cantescape my parent world has made me what i am lily be grateful you were spared that lily was silent you have everything you know looks intelligence james she laughed i have everything and nothing at all that the difference between you and me lily i empty another breeze picked up and brushed a bit of auburn hair across lily forehead tickling her nose she gazed outside past edith shoulder edith blinked suddenly as if from a daze i keeping you and that was all edith stood up and gave lily one last strange look before walking out she didntapologize for anything or say goodbye but for some reason lily didntthink twice about it she just watched edith go and then went to class meditating on sirius words she not all bad maybe maybe not lily thought to herself most likely she was just an angry girl another few days passed and it wasntuntil she d heard some girls gossiping in the corridors that she found out james had returned to hogwarts she had yet to run into him but she had privately decided not to seek him out lily had finally come to terms with the fact that james had been using her and since that was all in the past there was no sense in dredging it up no it was time to move on she had prefect duties to attend to and a headship to look forward to in seventh year and yet lily she stopped outside the door of her classroom as students rushed past her on their way to lunch sirius was sweeping a hand through his jet black hair leaning casually against the wall across the corridor she smiled and made her way over to him he smirked at her a moment while the students filtered out of the corridor until they were the only two left doing well his grey eyes were bright i should be asking you that she blushed he brushed the air with a hand ah he grinned i ve got plenty of things to keep me busy i moving in with james this summer really i thought he grinned again it done he my best mate cantstay mad at each other for long he shifted against the wall and folded his arms thoughtfully besides i think he changed just something about him i ve never seen him stand up to his dad before you know oh lily tried not to seem too interested yeah he said with a sparkle in his eye so lily peered down the hall fiddling with her shoulder strap i guess you and edith werentplotting to kill him then what oh she stammered kicking herself for saying something so stupid i just meant er well remus had told me once that he saw you and edith fighting and she said something about her relationship with james only being temporary sirius looked extremely confused then after a moment something dawned on him ah you mean he chuckled a bit dryly and nodded she wasnttalking about james she was talking about grimm i knew she was seeing him you lily gaped you knew but i was angry she told me her relationship with the weed was only temporary sirius smirked to himself remus always trying to look out for everyone well lily scuffed her toe against the ground bashfully remus isntthe only one who looks out for his friends she brought her bright green eyes up to meet his softening face thank you for being so good to me and you know about edith you ll have it again one day again huh he trailed off and then tipped his head musingly i suppose i could have had it with you but i think there someone else isntthere lily swallowed hard and avoided his gaze he an idiot he smirked but he a lucky idiot lily scoffed he out there hmm she tried to sound nonchalant who sirius snatched her by the shoulders and turned her in the direction of the courtyard you re so cute lily dontbe coy now go with a quick kiss on her cheek he shoved her off nervously lily stumbled off glancing behind her for reassurance from sirius but he d already disappeared she steadied herself in the doorway took a deep breath and then stepped out into the sunshine she laid her books down on the stone floor of the covered walkway and then shrugged off her book bag dropping it beside them there he was perched gingerly on the rough stone wall bracing himself against a pillar at times james seemed older to her and at others so childish but at this moment set against the pale blue sky his dark good looks were all the more striking the elegant outline of his jaw and straight nose making him appear so mature lily smoothed her skirt and ventured toward him he didntseem to notice her the clouds were shifting above their pale shadows moving across the expansive grounds the crisp spring air rustled the leaves and blew a few strands of hair across her cheek roughly she brushed away the tears that had begun to pool inexplicably in her eyes james she stood still beside him watching as he stared intently out at the grounds she recognized this part of the courtyard it was where she d followed him out the night of the yule ball now the climbing roses that encircled the stone pillars were blossomless but rich and green ready to sprout new buds he didntturn to her a breeze ruffled his dark hair james she repeated softly wordlessly he peered up at her as if it took all of his strength to tear his gaze from the grounds she turned her eyes down to her open palms and swallowed hard i i sorry about edith james just stared at her silently his hazel eyes flickering there was something different about him lily shifted awkwardly on the cobblestones and took another deep breath i mean i sorry that it all happened this way i wish i wish that he was still staring his eyes boring into hers discomfort welled in her forcing her throat to close up a bit it just er what i mean is shut up lily flushed brightly james stood his lean body arched slightly over her quite suddenly gently he reached out his forefinger tilting her chin upward so that the light hit her face he scoffed and dropped his hand have you been crying lily frowned no not really he snorted and turned away sudden inexplicable anger welled in the pit of her belly and deepened her flush i know you dontcare about me but i am trying to at least be a friend james whipped back around darkly what makes you say i dontcare she quickly lost her fire and stammered a bit just i know about the contract edith told me james eyes narrowed slightly as she spoke she cast her eyes away i know that you could have gotten out of it if you were able to declare your love for someone else his eyes widened that what she told you yes but lily began to babble obviously if there had been someone else you would have just done that but since there wasn t you re an idiot lily frowned excuse me james moved toward her eyes dark i said you re an idiot evans i am not an idiot thank you not only am i a prefect but i also top of the class james actually guffawed lily thought that was a bit excessive after all she was trying to be friendly here there no need to be rude that what she told me and you believed her he was grinning now lily if that was all i had to do this whole mess would have been over a long time ago but lily he said his voice strained i love you he ran a hand through his disheveled hair and turned his eyes to her how could you not know that she blanched from the roots of her auburn hair to her toes but b but she stammered but if you l loved me why didntyou say anything what about lily the time in the corridor when we almost well you know couldntyou have told me then shut it evans is that why you were trying to get me to say it that a bit cruel dontyou think not to mention presumptuous right then james grabbed her shoulders and pulled her deeply into a kiss almost instantaneously her healthy blush returned and by the time he pulled away she was glowing he rested his forehead against hers and searched her eyes his glittering with mischief softly he brought his hands to her cheeks and brushed the thick auburn hair back from her face cradling her head there a moment his lips curled into a grin you love me she stared at him blankly a moment still in shock from the kiss james slid a hand down to the small of her back you love me he repeated half whispering i she mouthed blushing his hand gently but firmly pulled her body tightly to his say it he commanded gruffly lily heart thudded she lifted her downcast eyes to meet his their emerald color sparkling in contrast to her thick lashes as gently as he d touched her cheeks she too brought her fingers delicately to his face and held him a moment he almost seemed to weaken slightly at her touch his entire body relaxing into her i love you james she whispered to him although soft it carried a weight she never knew she could convey with simple words that signature smirk spread across his face and that mischievous sparkle returned to his eyes he embraced her tightly and leaned in for a kiss but she laid a hand on his chest to stop him but lily added with her own mischievous twinkle you ve always known that haventyou evans james grinned you never have known when to shut up and with that he pulled her deeply into a kiss lily didntprotest how had james put it sometimes hands on is a more effective method of getting the message across james pressed her tighter to his firm body his lips beginning to roam lily sighed she couldnthave put it better herself the end dear lily i know it been quite some time since we ve talked but i wanted to make sure i told you how much i appreciate all

three the guidance counsellor lily stomped down the hall searching frantically for some higher authority to give her the go ahead to take away points this was ridiculous she had the power she just had to prove it she took a deep breath and counted backwards from ten she had to stop getting so upset after all she was a prefect and needed to remain calm in all situations the thought of the new herbal potion her book recommended for relaxation helped to sooth her boiling blood at the end of the corridor she spotted a woman with wavy flowing black hair slipping into a compartment could she be a professor or something she didntlook familiar excuse me lily waved a hand to catch her attention but the woman had already disappeared and shut the door with a soft thud rats she was never going to punish the marauders at this pace thump lily fell hard to the carpeted floor of the train pain shot through her neck and bum which she rubbed dolefully oh dear perhaps some of us should watch where they re going a silky voice cooed loud tittering from a few girls followed the comment lily glanced up to face a tall slender blonde with thick goldilocks curls her heavily lashed eyes batted demurely before she gingerly took a step over the crumpled and fallen lily excuse you lily muttered pushing herself up but a foot crushed her side and knocked her back down three girls subsequently stepping over and on her lily blood began to boil but she remained quiet and groaned softly to herself charlotte vane in all her blonde glory stood hand on hip before lily and smirked derisively behind her was her band of three girls i think she got uglier if possible said florence page a brunette girl with an unsuitably large nose more laughter ensued and lily curled up a little on the floor helen halverson grinned with sparkling white teeth then pursed her lips it the hair she got granny hair look at that little bun how quaint one of the girls was shorter than the others with straight mousse brown hair that fell past her shoulders and in her blue eyes they flickered slightly behind large glasses and she took a small step back madeline charlotte practically snapped her fingers at the girl she turned in response to charlotte dontyou have something to say to lily madeline peered down at lily shakily and swallowed hard erm i what are you doing a voice came from the end of the corridor lily looked over her shoulder to find james potter stalking toward them lily scrambled to sit upright he paused and looked down at her then eyed charlotte reprovingly having fun at others expenses again charlotte he smirked he held out a hand casually to lily she scoffed and pushed herself up ignoring james hand he shrugged and turned his attention back to charlotte hello james she grinned and pushed past lily havent seen you all summer except james grinned and ran a hand through his hair the two were awfully close and lily was feeling like a very uncomfortable onlooker find someone less helpless to pick on helpless lily felt her face flush she was perfectly capable charlotte smirked you ll have to do better than that try and stop me james and with that she flipped her curls and spun around mid turn she shot lily a personalized glare and strutted off to the next car with her posse in tow lily watched james grumpily as he followed charlotte with his eyes she sighed audibly and began stalking off down the corridor back to the compartment james noticed she was leaving and latched onto her cloak with a swift hand what the rush evans he said smoothly pulling her back to his side another irritated sigh passed lily lips i ve had enough ego for one day i thought perhaps that portion of the car would explode i wouldntwant to get caught in it oh she not that bad he furrowed his brow i wasntjust referring to her she said bitterly ouch dontbe so uptight it no wonder you have no friends james words were said flippantly but cut lily beneath the surface she didntrespond but instead swept straight past the compartment her robes fluttering behind where are you going james raised an eyebrow the loo join me if you d like she stomped off not bothering to turn around james grinned and considered taking her up on the invitation when he heard laughing coming from inside the compartment his curiosity for what his friends were doing was too strong he tore his lingering eye away from evans and joined the marauders the train rumbled beneath her feet and the lights flickered and rattled slightly on the wall by the mirror lily glanced back at herself inside the small washroom compartment and shook her head james was right she even looked uptight reaching behind her head she pulled out the hairpins and let her auburn tresses loose her hair spilled past her shoulders in soft waves from being wound so tightly she stared at herself dumbly for a moment then flipped her hair and giggled imitating charlotte and her friends ugh she looked cheap what was she doing this wasnther hastily she wound her hair back up and threw open the door she trudged back to the compartment and entered to find the three boys rolling with laughter peter actually fell off his seat when lily slid back the door with a bang lily ha ha ha sirius said through tears look at this james too could hardly contain himself that was a bad sign warily looking from one chuckling boy to the other lily stepped forward to see what sirius was holding isntit the damned funniest thing you ve ever seen i didnt know you had it in you lily immediately flushed it was her self help book detoxify de stress and dontexplode literally for the modern witch where d you find it james was cracking up zonko s elliot s no must have been zonko s that stuff too rich lily immediately snatched it away and clutched it tightly to her chest doing her best to hide it beneath the billowing fabric of her robes what your problem sirius said we were complimenting your taste in humor what humor james guffawed she walks around with a stick up her arse all day the lot of them burst into hysterical laughter james practically patting himself on the shoulder for his cleverness lily gritted her teeth her eyes beginning to sting despite her best efforts she knew they were just mocking her but she d had enough of their jokes tight lipped and without a sound she grabbed her bag and left slamming the door behind her it rattled slightly in the silence the humor in james eyes faded slightly but sirius and peter were still laughing did you see her face they burst what is with her anyway that bloody book i know she a geek but damn she never fails to surprise me but something in james stomach twisted suddenly it wasntso funny anymore shut it sirius rolled his eyes oh she ll come off it in an hour dont worry i said shut it james glared at him sirius raised his eyebrows and scanned james eyes a moment as if to make sure he was entirely serious alright mate sorry james sat silently glaring out the window why d she have to be so bothered by everything it got on his nerves he was just having a bit of fun but evans never had fun it was like a forbidden language for her peter shifted uneasily in the awkward silence utterly grateful when remus slid open the compartment door he paused where lily peter shook his head causing remus to retract his statement forget i asked anyhow i brought us some food keen he tossed a few pasties and frogs onto the seat but peter was the only one who lunged for them remus tossed one to sirius and james who caught them deftly but remained silent sirius grumbled to himself in the corner what was his problem anyway he was getting all uptight over a girl he never used to be that way warily he peered over at james it better not be what he thought it was because if james potter was going to let a girl affect him like that they were going to have to have a little chat but it was too early to assume he was probably just reading too much into it james would never let that happen right james stared grimly out the window with a partially unwrapped chocolate frog in his fist not once taking a bite lily took her time wandering carelessly down the corridor as the train chugged tirelessly along it wasntlike she had anywhere to go finding another compartment was highly unlikely she could just walk up and down the cars for the next few hours she supposed ugh she slumped down on the floor leaning against a compartment door the year hadnteven started and she could already tell what it was going to be like but no matter her grades would be top and she would keep on organizing and once she was out of hogwarts with a fantastic career she could laugh at her former classmates and their miserable jobs and squash charlotte like the little dung beetle she was yes that would be appropriate whoa the compartment door slid open behind her and lily landed flat on her back with a thump she felt her cheeks flush a violent scarlet as she peered up at a beautiful woman with a cascade of curly dark hair she had silvery eyes and flawless skin lily recognized her immediately as the woman she d seen earlier erm lily pushed herself up and smoothed her hair embarrassedly i really sorry she gushed gathering her bag and standing up a glowing smile broke out on the woman face and she took lily by the hand it alright you look like you could use a compartment why dontyou stay here with me huh oh well i dontwant to intrude she held up her hands dear it fine she said softly beckoning lily inside it appeared the woman had the compartment to herself please i could use company lily stared at the woman a moment then couldnthelp but grin back she was very beautiful and kind and her smile was infectious lily dropped into her seat while the woman slid gracefully into the one across from her i melinda her silver eyes shimmered melinda moonshine moonshine why did that name seem so familiar lily evans she smiled and shook melinda hand then unable to quell her curiosity she added i sorry you seem a little old to be a student are you a guest or something oh no she shook her head the curls framing her heart shaped face i new to the staff miss moonshine i ll be the new guidance counsellor lily was taken aback guidance counsellor wow hogwarts has never had a counsellor before unless the detail of chapter fourteen in hogwarts a history is too outdated miss moonshine laughed no the ministry commissioned me for the position they believe that times of crisis require special needs and considering these dark times we re in so many students have lost family and friends they felt it only right to instate someone the students and staff can talk to also i can help you all choose an appropriate career path really lily smiled i suppose that a good thing well i hope you enjoy your stay here i a prefect so if there anything you need she added to boost her self importance a bit she smiled thank you dear that lovely of you to say lily fell silent and fingered the hem of her sleeve after meeting and greeting she never really knew what to say the train rattled on beneath them for a good ten minutes lily shifted uncomfortably she could feel melinda eyes on her expectantly so lily she snatched lily from her stupor does that girl always bully you it took lily a moment to register the question usually she was asked the basic what year are you and how are your classes fairing none of which were quite so erm straight forward um well charlotte just lily scrabbled for an explanation charlotte just charlotte and by that you mean stuck up twat melinda raised an eyebrow lily coughed i ah well she couldnthelp it she laughed yes actually melinda expression turned stony but donttell anyone i said that they ll have my head lily shook her head of course not erm i just shocked a teacher would talk about a student like that well melinda rolled her eyes she not just some student she my cousin you mean she gaped knowing she probably looked rude but didnt care you re a vance melinda was so nice how could she be related to such a wench actually it the other way around she a moonshine no lily was confused you see her family changed their name mine changed when i married melinda explained our family name is mottlebum lily nearly choked and then coughed as an attempt to cover her laughter she felt awful but really mottlebum i know i know melinda waved her hand wearily as if this was one of a hundred times she d encountered the very same reaction it horrid but her family had no right to change it and turn their backs on the rest of us just because we come from a long line of hufflepuffs doesntmean you were hufflepuff lily didntmean to sound so shocked but melinda was just so graceful yes but as soon as my uncle first son made it to gryffindor they thought themselves too good for the rest of us i suppose that horrible yes well that that family melinda sighed so what house are you lily er lily was a little embarrassed to reveal her house name now gryffindor actually gryffindor really well now she didnthave to act so surprised lily puffed up a bit and pursed her lips yes i am a gryffindor a gryffindor prefect ah melinda nodded i just expected you to be ravenclaw you have that look oh that interesting lily thought though is made sense she was impeccably organized and equalled their book smarts if not surpassed them miss moonshine how old are you if you dont mind me asking her silver eyes sparkled i thought you might ask twenty actually she continued with a smile when she saw the shock in lily eyes i started my career early never needed much training for what i do you see i guess i have a gift or some such nonsense as my mum puts it her eyes travelled to lily partially open bag and lingered on her copy of detoxify de stress etc are you reading that lily followed her gaze and blushed furiously shoving the peeping book down into the depths of papers in her black bag erm yes i am melinda smiled and said nothing more the sky grew dark outside the window and they chattered about various things lily warned melinda about peeves and filch while melinda in turn reminded lily that she was a student only a mere four years prior lily subsequently blushed and swallowed the lump of her prefect pride that had lodged in her throat but lily quickly felt at ease with her and the professional courteous manner of a prefect addressing a professor evaporated leaving two girls similar in age gossiping about nonsense oh it lovely to talk to someone young again lily you have no idea melinda sighed everyone at the ministry is so stiff save the interns and their priorities are wedged so far up their bums they can barely walk straight let alone chat for a moment about things outside the government lily laughed she felt older than sixteen with melinda like an old friend from school chatting over drinks she felt grown up silly she knew but intellectually melinda was her match the train slowed to a halt and whistled loudly slamming and sliding compartment doors and the shuffle of students could be heard outside their door reluctantly lily stood up and stretched picking up her bag well i suppose i ll see you on campus melinda erm miss moonshine of course miss moonshine exclaimed please feel free to come by my office anytime i look forward to talking with you more and please call me melinda when it the two of us we ll leave awkward titles for the halls i hope i can consider you a friend and vice versa lily felt herself grinning despite her best attempts i i d love that wow a new friend given she was an authority figure of course as a prefect so was she lily reminded herself proudly miss moonshine slipped from the compartment gracefully and gave lily a kind smile and wave lily however waved and toppled not so gracefully over her left foot and nearly fell face first to the floor luckily she caught herself on the door but the contents of her bag spilled out in a shower of parchment and quills with a groan lily began shoving the objects back in when she came across detoxify de stress she was about to cram it back in her bag but something caught her attention on the cover the gold embossing on the bottom of the cover shimmered in the starlight the author name stared blatantly back at lily and she nearly slapped her forehead melinda moonshine she knew she d heard that name somewhere before and now her de stress guru was going to be working at her school how could she have been so stupid as not to recognize her melinda must think her a complete fool just a special thanks from chapter three sweet sarcasm thank you so much you have no idea how good your comment made me feel i ve been so stressed out the past few months and i really have had no time to write but when i read what you wrote i sat down and started typing i really do love writing and it was so sweet of you to say what you said i can only hope it goes somewhere i just have to put more work into it you got me going again thanks and thanks everyone who does comment it really does make my day and it always makes me want to write more i love hearing what you think even if it bad i just want to be a good writer and every tip helps so please keep reading and reviewing chapter four the crush lily trudged up the stairs letting out a deep sigh of relief bloody first years they re as frightened as baby chicks the first day and a week into the term they latch onto you like monkeys not a day went by where she wasntbombarded with stupid questions about the moving staircases and remus lupin romantic eligibility really remus was doing a grand job but something about his bookish brooding good looks and kindness made the young girls swoon lily of course the female prefect had to hear the brunt of it the fifth year prefects tended to have a little too much interest in abusing their newly found powers to properly care for the students thus it was left up to lily and remus and the stress she found was becoming a bit overwhelming she flipped on the faucet and began scrubbing her hands peering back at herself she smoothed the loose hairs of her ponytail and straightened her robes but something in the wide mirror caught her eye the small empty patch of fabric over the left side of her chest where was her prefect badge desperately she felt around the fabric to check if she d accidentally put an invisibility charm on it no blast it wasntthere she immediately dropped to her knees and began searching the floor crawling beneath the row of leaky sinks the latch on a stall clicked and a girl stepped out hesitating at the sight of lily erm lily grinned faintly the girl raised an eyebrow are you all right ah oh yes crack lily leapt up and whacked her head on the bottom of a sink she cursed loudly and clutched the back of her head tenderly just fine she gritted her teeth and smiled weakly the girl eyed her a moment longer and left phew perhaps it was a good thing she wasntwearing her badge just then it wasntproper behaviour for a prefect to be crawling along the bathroom floor now was it lily continued her search but found nothing damn now she d have to ask for a new one but wait she couldntjust ask for a new one what was she thinking the prefect badges were treasured parts of hogwarts history they didntjust conjure new ones like it said in hogwarts a history the sacred badges of the head boy and girl and prefects were worn by generations of students since the founding of the school itself that was hundreds of years or more hundreds lily gasped oh no mcgonagall would think her unfit to be prefect for not taking good care of the badge her status would be revoked she d never be able to show her face again heeeee huuuuuh heeeee huuuuh lily began to hyperventilate okay lily just breathe breeeaathe chapter fourteen relaxation techniques for the stressed count to ten out loud and take slow deep breaths be sure to focus on your breathing this will take your mind off the problem and provide a gentle calming relief there it was working the anxiety subsided and lily leaned over the sink to splash her face with water life as a sixth year prefect was going to be more difficult that she had predicted well this was the life she chose all right she could do it she had the perseverance almost methodically she dried her hands as she counted her breaths to ease her anxiety before leaving the bathroom but by the time she reached her dormitory door lily heart had sunk to the pit of her stomach the one place she could always go to be alone and think was her room she turned the handle and entered unfortunately the same did not go for hogwarts what does he mean it not in stock a voice screeched from within lily groaned well if you had done it earlier helen this wouldntbe an issue would it florence page spat ugh you re both idiots charlotte snapped for merlin sake give me the quill and i ll take care of it lily snuck in quietly and walked to her bed which was nearest the door and began searching her smooth sheets and neatly folded clothes for any sign of the pin look as long as they know i ordering it there wontbe a problem charlotte said primly she swept the quill across the parchment with a flourish to sign her initials before rolling it up there that ll teach you to order your dress robe for the yule ball earlier lily burst with laughter and had to clap a hand over her mouth to silence it charlotte helen and florence looked up seeming to have just noticed lily arrival and glared oh it you helen and florence immediately went back to their chattering about dresses but charlotte eyes lingered on lily lily could feel charlotte gaze burning into her but kept her head down and eyes focused on sorting through her parchment so lily you ll be attending the yule ball this year as a prefect again what will you be wearing lily swallowed hard and looked up defiantly at charlotte with a faint smile i not sure actually really charlotte looked positively ravaged even helen and florence looked up in shock surely you re joking she tittered lightly peering over her shoulder at florence and helen with mock surprise lily sighed and went back to stacking her books but charlotte continued to push the subject do you think you ll be going alone again the book in her hand froze in midair and lily gritted her teeth i dontknow charlotte really i dontplan my dress four months ahead and that goes for dates as well hmm charlotte furrowed her brow i see well that explains quite a lot anyway she turned back to the other girls i believe i shall have james potter ask me this year he should suffice oh he sooo handsome helen swooned very suitable match lily mumbled under her breath what was that charlotte ear pricked lily looked up and smiled i just congratulating your decision on choosing james you two will make a fine pair charlotte eyes sparked well thank you lily i always enjoy your input lily could practically smell the fire she was lighting beneath charlotte bum and cursed herself silently charlotte could easily make her life at hogwarts a living hell for a number of reasons and in a number of ways but she couldnthelp it charlotte was provoking her florence sighed and picked up a nail file i would have chosen sirius frankly he is the best looking in the school sirius black helen raised her eyebrows eagerly yes of course sirius black florence snapped irately charlotte flicked her blonde curls back no he was last year i want james this year he is positively delicious charlotte helen giggled i know suddenly her eyes flicked to the bed in the far corner madeline after a few moments the small mousy brown head of madeline popped up over the bedside eyes peering out from behind those large lenses she stood up and closed her novel laying it carefully on her bed did you finish my potions paper yet er she shifted awkwardly not quite but almost i haventeven done mine yet charlotte lower jaw jutted out in obvious anger you know the rules madeline you finish mine first and it due tomorrow merlin stop dallying she flicked her wand wielding wrist in the direction of the bed accio book madeline groped lamely in the air for her beloved tome as it was whisked through her fingertips charlotte snapped it out of the air and briefly examined the worn brown cover poems that live forever how quaint she tossed it over her shoulder into the rubbish bin there now you can concentrate there are you quill and parchment charlotte motioned with her hand madeline tore her eyes away from the book lying amidst crumpled tissues and ink botched parchment scraps and followed charlotte gesture to her bed where she had conjured the supplies lily looked on furious how dare charlotte treat her that way madeline was shy and charlotte had done nothing but bully her since the moment lily first saw her madeline was obviously new to hogwarts and charlotte was being more than cruel fuming lily stomped over to the garbage and pulled out the small book then with florence and helen gaping she strode directly over to madeline and held it out firmly for her to take madeline stared at the book her lips slightly parted then peered up at lily unblinking charlotte looked on her eyes narrowed to thin slats lily pushed the book forward urging her to take it madeline blinked and glanced from lily kind eyes and pursed lips to charlotte burning gaze here lily said this must be important to you she doesnthave the right to take your things madeline mousy face twitched and she caught charlotte fiery eyes once more then lowering her gaze she took a step back and turned away from lily bending over the bed and started scribbling silently on the parchment lily stood dumbly clutching the book which wavered slightly in her grasp a scarlet flush crept across her cheeks at madeline blatant rejection she lowered her arm dazedly bringing the book lamely down to her side a small smirk had formed on charlotte features as she began massaging lotion into her hands why dontyou go find someone else to play with lily she obviously doesntwant to be your friend florence and helen giggled in response still in shock of madeline reaction lily stared down at the worn cover of the book she traced the words with a finger and then walked to madeline side madeline fiercely scribbling hand froze mid sentence as she felt lily presence just above her left shoulder but kept her head firmly bent toward her paper lily placed the book of poetry beside the inkbottle atop her bedspread and without pause walked to the door grabbed her cloak and left the girls immediately burst into a gale of laughter charlotte however stood up and stalked over to madeline who kept her eyes averted from the impending figure now hovering hands on hips before her dontyou ever think about taking anything from her again madeline as long as you re hanging out with us you arentto associate with that twig understand she swallowed and nodded silently of course not that you ever would am i right charlotte cocked her head madeline was quiet clutching her quill tightly yes just as i thought i am always right arenti of course helen burst earning a reproving glare from florence good charlotte waltzed back over to her bed and plopped down on the pillows her pleated skirt billowing gracefully madeline simply stared at the neatly scrawled lines on the parchment and breathed deeply but as she dipped the quill in the inkpot her eyes landed on the book of poems she stared for a long moment at the cover before it disappeared beneath her nose with a snap i almost forgot charlotte said with a titter she now stood above madeline with the book clutched firmly to her chest you wontbe needing this lightly she hopped back over to her bed opened the trunk at the foot and tossed it inside she slammed the lid shut and flicked her wand to latch the lock madeline flushed and turned her attention back to the parchment scribbling more monotonous words steadily her knuckles turned bright white as she squeezed the life out of the thin quill knock knock peter rolled over on his stomach buried his head in the fluff of his beloved pillow and groaned go away knock knock knock someone get that james muffled voice came from beneath the blankets knock knock sirius was snoring loudly head hanging over the edge of his bed a steady stream of drool making its way from the corner of his mouth to a small pool forming on the stone floor he jerked slightly at the sound and rolled over remus remained like a rock passed out on his side knock knock knock james eyes flicked open knockknockknockknockknock oh for the love of get the bloody door james practically ripped the sheets off his bed as he leapt up fuming he flung the door open what lily blinked back at james flushing slightly er her eyes travelled to his boxers but she tried her hardest to avert her eyes james however didntseem phased but he still seemed irritable well he barked his pillow still clutched in his free hand he looked ready to bean her with it his rudeness helped her regain composure i she frowned and peered inside i need to see remus she said firmly he asleep james began to shut the door offended lily caught it with the palm of her hand it ten thirty in the morning i need to talk to remus it important the lines between his eyebrows creased in annoyance it a saturday the day of the week has no bearing on the magnitude of the emergency potter now let me in lily eyes were slats she would not be spoken to in such a manner especially by potter she was a prefect james sighed and flicked the door with his wrist letting it fall all the way open he scratched the back of his neck and shuffled over to remus bed hesitantly lily poked her head in the door and peered around it seemed safe seemed being the key word nonetheless she took a drastically large step over the threshold and entered man country sirius was still snoring on his back and lily made a face at the puddle of drool at his bedside there was a bit of an odd smell oy moony get up james had leapt atop remus bed and kicked him in the side rather indelicately lily jaw dropped what are you doing to him get down james paused his jabbing and turned to look at lily amazingly remus had slept through it you want him up dontyou he jerked his head at remus the bloke sleeps like a log literally i taking necessary action james lifted his foot to prepare for another nasty kick no stop lily burst exasperatedly that quite enough she was absolutely furious how dare he treat remus that way he was a kind sweet boy i ll wake him up thank you james stared blankly at lily as if she had told a joke he didntquite understand but when he saw the determination in her frowning features he simply shrugged and jumped down whatever you want i was just trying to help yawning he sauntered over to his bed and collapsed on it you always fight the losing battles lilykins he mumbled into the sheets lily glared she had to take a deep breath to calm the rising heat in the pit of her stomach idiot kindly she turned to remus prepared to see his open expectant eyes but instead met his unconscious face he was still asleep how could anyone sleep through that remus she shook his shoulder remus remus remus remu the name caught in her throat as something went flying past her face bam ow damn it remus jerked open his eyes and rubbed his forehead what the he peered up at lily oh morning lily looked over at james he was lounged against his headboard with a shoe in his hand he smirked just trying to help lily glared at him well you didnthave to throw a bloody shoe she turned back to remus are you all right huh remus peered down at the shoe by his pillow and shot james a glare who simply smirked and slumped down into his pillow to go back to sleep yeah i ll be fine so what up oh um lily had been so distracted by the ruckus that she d almost forgotten why she came oh yes may i speak with you um sure let me get dressed remus slid out of bed his hair askew and prominent bags under his brown eyes lily watched as he trudged to the bathroom when the door shut she had nothing to do but stand silently and awkwardly in the middle of the room waiting she began tapping her fingers on her thigh her eyes travelled around the room from the quidditch posters on the walls to the piles of dirty boxers scattered about the floor and finally her panning gaze jerked to a stop on james now wide awake and eyeing her with playful interest she turned away quickly focusing intently on a ball of lint in the corner to keep from blushing yet her eyes crept cautiously back to james he was silent but his lips slid slowly into a smirk what she snapped feeling her face flush despite her best efforts he simply shrugged and folded his hands behind his head then after a long pause he leapt up and bounded over to remus bed and flopped down on his mussed sheets hi lily she sighed hello james what do you want he shrugged again and rolled over on his back so that his face was directly beneath hers and stared up earnestly at her lily glowered down at him and sighed heavily again dontyou have anything better to do than irritate me who me oh please you enjoy my company admit it he laid a hand casually across his slender chest and began scratching his armpit ugh she stomped to the other side of the room remus come on james leapt up and followed her lily rolled her eyes and took a large step back dontplay coy with me lily evans it obvious what you want his grin was dripping with mischief immediately her face turned beet red what is that supposed to mean get get away from me she backed up further as he sidled forward uncomfortably close the fine laugh lines around his eyes and faint stubble on his chin were clearly visible i mean it james donttouch me i dontwant anything from you his eyes were dancing it was then she realized he had backed her into a corner you mean he leaned in not even this wh wh what james pulled out a small golden badge and stuck in front of her face lily squinted her eyes at it it it was her prefect badge that jerk give me that where did you find that james shrugged and held it up in the light squinting as if examining a giant gold nugget it was laying around laying around lily burst i need that james mcgonagall will kill me if i lose it but you haventlost it he grinned see i have it and i sure she wouldntkill you maim perhaps but kill is a tad extreme damn this thing is old yes i know which is precisely why you must give it back now james tossed it up and caught it again lily catching her breath as the priceless heirloom flew through the air he turned to her with a frown now that tone just wontdo lily please james she said desperately holding out her hands as if trying to calm down a mental patient i begging you he raised an eyebrow and immediately she regretted her words begging now are we no now that s that not what i meant lily began to panic he heaved a sigh and flopped down on the edge of sirius bed sirius grumbled and rolled over now i sure we can come to some sort of agreement agreement hell no we can t james flippant tone and attitude were really getting on her nerves well alright james stood up and pocketed the badge if you insist he headed for the door wait lily cried sirius and peter shot out of bed and looked around fearfully sirius was clutching the stitch of his chest what the bloody hell she narrowed her eyes at james and with a small sigh gave in what do you propose james grinned and walked back over to her well i was thinking you could be my slave he spoke as casually as if he were discussing the weather lily jaw dropped to the floor your what you know my slave you could do my homework wash my feet bring me butterbeer slap you silly lily finished with her arms crossed i hope you are joking james potter now give me back my prefect badge before i take thirty points sirius and peter laughed from their beds watch out james she ll give you detention peter snorted lily shot peter a deadly glare that wiped the smile from his face then turned back to james with the same intense stare yet he appeared unaffected i will do no such thing not for a silly piece of metal hmm silly piece of metal is it he examined her stare and pulled out his wand in a flash he it directed at the badge threateningly how silly what are you doing lily cried out in panic you cantdestroy a piece of hogwarts history just as i thought now you can start by washing my laundry though i must warn you the socks are a bit excuse me i am not going to work for you james er no james shook his head you misunderstand you arentworking for me you are my slave so you shall no longer refer to me as james but rather master potter or commandant whichever you prefer sirius was cracking up just then remus stepped out of the bathroom groomed and showered but still shaggy he looked from james to lily and sighed what going on james whipped his wand and badge behind him grinning innocently nothing absolutely nothing remus turned to lily suddenly she froze tell him that james took the badge he d make him give it back but for some reason she couldn t looking into remus kind brown eyes something stopped her it really wasntthat important besides she d look silly making such a huge deal over a little badge like a fool she shook her head and grinned yeah they re just teasing me again let go james jaw dropped they all watched in awe as lily and remus exited the dorm the door shut behind them with a soft click erm peter raised an eyebrow did she just cover for you with remus james gaped why he doesntcare what i do sirius rolled his eyes and scoffed what james narrowed his eyes he just shrugged and began combing his hair in the mirror it just so obvious what what is sirius shook his head she fancies moony prongs open your eyes remus followed lily out into the common room where they loitered by the fireplace lily sighed and folded her arms looking at him intently i know i shouldntbother you about this but i really need a favour he furrowed his brow sure what do you need i lily trailed off a bit embarrassed i was hoping you could talk to charlotte charlotte he said blankly charlotte vane lily nodded remus turned up the corners of his mouth knowingly and shook his head what she doing now well there this girl madeline who just started hogwarts this year and remus she so horrible to her she stressed but she ll never listen to me she has no respect remus if you could see how she treats madeline you d understand remus shook his head sceptically lily i dontknow what i can do just talk to her see if you can get her to leave madeline alone she has no respect for me whatsoever that a fact you re the authority figure prove that to her he urged it doesntmatter anyone that is in her opinion below her is not authority remus sighed and looked lily in the eye he knew she was right okay i ll see what i can do but i wontpromise anything lily she wontsee me any different oh no lily gushed immediately rolling her eyes trust me she ll see you differently he smiled slightly and grasped lily arm squeezing it slightly i ll do what i can see you in class right lily chest tightened er she was suddenly very aware of remus hand on her arm yes i ll see you in class she smiled a blush creeping up her neck and into her cheeks remus nodded and walked back to his dorm lily watched as he disappeared up the staircase and sank slowly into an armchair oh boy she wondered if melinda book had a chapter on crushes because she could feel one coming on yay thank you all so much for the reviews and sweet sarcasm you are more than welcome to print my stories that was so nice of you to ask you guys are such awesome readers hopefully i ll have enough time to thank each of you next time chapter five the deal hogwarts was growing steadily colder by the day as fall began to wane the golden leaves lost their lustre turning the grounds into a sea of orange and brown lily waded through kicking large bundles of leaves sending them spewing into the air to be carried off by the wind she huffed and stomped all the way from the greenhouse back up the steps into the courtyard advanced herbology was only the second class on her schedule for the day she had two more left lily knew it was a hectic schedule but she was not about to change it she intended on being fully prepared for her n e w t s even if it meant a mortally threatening class load of course she had no problems keeping up she had always been top of her class and was quite certain that would never change but a ruckus in the centre of the courtyard made lily lose her train of thought a small group of first year boys were chattering and laughing loudly gathered around something immediately her prefect sense began tingling it was her duty to investigate puffing up her chest slightly lily began to stalk over to the giggling group a little blonde boy peered over his shoulder and spotted lily his eyes widening immediately he jerked on the sleeve of the boy next to him and whispered urgently in his ear this made lily walk a little faster what going on here lily approached eyes narrowed and hands on hips nothing two of them responded immediately in unison uh huh she was not swayed what are you looking so guilty for while most of the boys looked scared one of them rolled his eyes at her we arentdoing anything so could you go away lily blinked excuse me you heard me we re busy he raised his chin and cocked his head provokingly at her his dusty black hair swished across his forehead and the corners of his lips twitched in amusement well if he didntremind her of someone right now those taunting eyes just like what going on lily eyes flicked up from the first year and landed on james speak of the devil the defiant boy grinned at james arrival and took a step toward him hi james he said admiringly hello david how it going then james grinned and ruffled the kid hair the boy smiled sheepishly in admiration and turned back to lily with a revitalized boldness something told lily this rebellious streak may have been taught and not inherent after all james do you mind lily sighed she needed to get him out of there there was no way this boy david was going to confess with james around boosting his mischievous confidence he shrugged not really he settled down on the edge of the planter and winked at one of the boys you need something james she said warningly he simply cocked his head and raised his eyebrows expectantly lily sighed realizing he wasntgoing anywhere and turned back to little david just tell me what you re hiding i not hiding anything he said folding his arms snitch lily jaw dropped how disrespectful could a kid get would you like me to take points from you he just glared back at her she was about to give the little rat detention when james opened his mouth lils the kid harmless they re just having fun now go run along i sure you ve got prefect things to take care of am i right run along how dare you speak to m lily he said as he began tossing something in the air just calm down i sure we can work something out she wanted to smack him but it was that moment that she realized james was casually flipping her prefect badge up and down with the flick of his wrist she took a deep breath and gritted her teeth all right fine just dontmake so much racket in the courtyard and with that lily stomped off lousy james turning every roguish first year into a potential marauder that was the absolute last thing she needed next year merlin if she could just get that stupid badge back she could forget about him argh fwump lily fell flat on her face her parchment and books strewn across the floor of the corridor in her all her silent ranting she d failed to notice the pile of books lying in the middle of the hall then bam ow bloody hell lily clutched the side of her head in agony as books flew past her face one by one they shot through the air from within a classroom the pages ripping and fluttering about what in lily pushed herself up and walked into the classroom ducking as another book flew over her head what peeves the podgy poltergeist grinned and tossed another book her way what in merlin name do you think you re doing to professor flitwick library lily cried pulling out her wand ho ho ho peeves did a somersault and belched firing more books from his mouth ickle lilykins miss priss prissy prefect to the rescue ha ha ha ha ha in a puff of smoke he disappeared lily moaned audibly and stared at the mess of books this was going to take forever to clean up slowly and with a sigh she pulled out her wand and began sending the books back to their rightful places on the shelves of course she had to figure out what order they had been in she glanced down at her watch the next charms class wouldntstart for another two hours so she had time one by one she ordered the books neatly on the shelves cursing peeves all the while but as the pile waned a certain book caught lily eye she picked it up and dusted off the cover with her sleeve crime and punishment an advanced theory of charms in magical law enforcement she read aloud thoughtfully interesting curious she flipped open the worn cover and fingered through the pages there were hundreds of charms listed from simple cheering charms to advanced body part replacement ones but it gave detailed descriptions of each charm usage in magical law enforcement specifically tracking capture retrieval and lily eyes widened torture a light bulb flickered on in the back of her mind hee hee hee miss evans a high pitched voice broke her concentration lily dropped the book and it fell in with the sea of the others erm hello professor flitwick peeves was here and well he sort of destroyed your library i was trying to clean up flitwick gasped oh my blasted poltergeist well thank you miss evans i appreciate the assistance oh of course lily shot him her winning prefect smile but her eyes lingered on crime and punishment peering out from beneath several other books erm well i had better get to class ah flitwick looked a bit startled as lily scrambled past him tripping over a few books on her way as she zipped out the door pausing just outside the room lily clasped her hands with glee that book could be the answer to her problems there were bound to be some good spells to use against james and perhaps she could finally have some control over him smiling to herself lily eyes flickered briefly back inside flitwick room to the pile of books before she strode off down the corridor to her next class with an extra bounce in her step i sure we ll win it this year we cantlose with james sirius took a bite of toast and had barely swallowed the lot before he stuffed more in his mouth the way i see it we re undefeatable undefeatable isnta word padfoot remus drawled taking a sip of his tea morning peter and james plopped down at the table on either side of remus knocking his elbows and causing his tea to slop remus frowned disapprovingly and went back to reading the daily prophet a small huddle of girls passed by at the same moment giggling and waving remus was oblivious while james peter and sirius flashed them winning grins hufflepuffs right sirius whispered to james through the corner of his grin james nodded and turned his attention back to the table dishing up massive amounts of food onto his plate i think i dated the brunette peter chuckled then began fighting with sirius for the last muffin what cha reading james leaned in toward remus slathering his toast with butter just an article remus set the paper down and stood up abruptly i have to get to class see you later moony james frowned asremus grabbed his bag and strode out of the hall james turned back to peter and sirius who had stopped bickering and were staring quizzically back at james has he been like this all morning sirius shrugged i dunno mate it not the he lowered his voice it isntthe full moon for another week i know james sighed i ll have a chat with him later sirius attention was suddenly directed just past james shoulder he winked and grinned incoming charlotte vane approached flicked her shirley temple curls over her shoulder and pouted her lips hello boys she crooned slipping into the seat between james and peter peter grinned but james was less than thrilled not right now charlotte we re busy well i sure you have time for me she simpered pinching peter cheek he blushed and nearly passed out what do you want sirius was watching with interest his chin in his hand florence and helen were gazing at him intently with stars in their eyes pouting their lips in the hopes he would look their way charlotte smirked at james bitter front i want she leaned closer you to take me to the yule ball the yule ball james stared at her blankly and sirius burst out laughing what is so funny she snapped oh nothing nothing sirius waved his hand do go on james interrupted her before she could continue look it a bit early to find a date dontyou think besides i may not want to go with you when the time comes charlotte smiled and smoothed a strand of his hair as he stared dully off into space clearly uninterested i know you ll come to your senses i just wanted to let you know my intentions as every lady should she slipped out of the seat running her foot coyly along james leg as she did so but he remained passive i ll see you in class she whispered in his ear her girlfriends tittered and followed her out of the hall james immediately groaned as sirius began laughing she took me last year it your turn doesntshe know i not interested anymore james snarled and flicked his toast with the knife been there done that you know i think she marvellous peter eyes twinkled with delight well i wouldntcall charlotte boring if that what you mean sirius chuckled through a mouthful whatever i ve got better things to think about like quidditch james shifted his attention elsewhere and began daydreaming about snitches and quaffles lily traversed the hallways dodging the barrage of students rushing to lunch it was difficult being a hardworking student she sighed she was one of very few who had to fight the flow at lunchtime to reach the library along the way the buzz of chatter filtered through her ears and she picked up bits and pieces of conversation mostly about the marauders rumours of a bogart in the potions storeroom and of course the much anticipated quidditch season gryffindor will dominate for sure this season a young boy said to his friend i dontknow slytherin looking good too his friend refuted she pushed past a huddle of third year girls i hear james has never lost ever mmm hmm my roommate said that every game he ever played he won that why he team captain lily ears prickedandshe paused in her tracks peering over slyly at the chattering girls she pretended to be digging for something in her book bag the girl continued i not so sure this year what with slytherin new captain oh but james is so wonderful yes and gorgeous mmm but so is remus i prefer sirius he got that roguish quality roguish quality lily frowned poor poor na ve little girls doesntmatter james is still the best i agree alright c mon gretchen i starving okay okay the small group moved away from lily and joined the flow of traffic hmph lily shut her bag and made her way to the library grumbling all the way james this and james that why is james so bloody great so he won a few games and he was sort of nice looking and he was good at pulling pranks and he was smart but he was a bully and a jerk then again what did she have to rival james book smarts sure she was intelligent enough but not like james he was clever and witty and had a whole ton of common sense lily was just lily she sighed and pushed her way through the double doors and found a comfortable chair in her favourite nook of the library madame pince greeted her warmly on the way in which was rare for any student taking a load off lily slouched into the seat and pulled out her arithmancy level three text she had gotten about four pages in when she noticed another student had joined her a few seats away remus lupin brushed the brown hair from his eyes and flipped open his text which he appeared to be skimming quite intently dare she interrupt him lily watched for ten whole minutes as he scanned the words his brow furrowed and his mouth in a straight line taking a resolute breath she shut her book and stood up walked over to him and sat down across the way erm hi remus his eyes flickered upward and he immediately shut his book hi hi lily what are you doing here at lunch i could ask you the same she said trying to be coy he frowned and looked at the clock on the wall well i had better be going i ve got a lot to do i ll er see you at the prefect meeting tomorrow shall i then ah before lily could finish he had gathered his things and left good one lily she commended herself bitterly but she didnthave much time to reprimand herself any longer because as remus exited the double doors a hovering trolley filled with textbooks making its way inside had caught her attention a jaunty looking house elf with an abnormally large head was flicking his hands to and fro balancing the overflowing trolley with his magic shipment from professor flitwick the house elf said importantly one of his ears was longer than the other and it flopped about as he spoke madame pince dropped her spectacles to the tip of her nose and eyed the cart oh yes the ones to be reconditioned i spoke to him earlier just take them to my office she pointed primly to the opposite side of the library the elf nodded and hopped along he and his cart drifting past lily she watched slyly as it passed tilting her head inquisitively there teetering perilously off the front end was crime and punishment in all its glory perhaps she could just no no she couldn t she was a prefect for merlin sake she couldntgo around pilfering books like some marauder there were already plenty of those at hogwarts she scoffed to herself then again was it not for a good cause really she only wanted to skim it perhaps find some useful spells to use against the forces of evil i e james potter for the forces of good i e her and then she d give it right back and it was a library after all she shot one more glance at the cart as the elf directed it past the book still balancing dangerouslyon the edge clearly it was fate how could she pass up such an opportunity immediately lily slipped her hand into her robes and felt for her wand casually she headed over to the bookshelves pretending to be interested and as the cart hovered by lily discreetly jabbed her wand in its direction without a sound the book slid off the head of the cart lily snatching it up and slipping it behind her back as the house elf passed she quickly shot the elf a nervous grin who smiled back and continued on his merry way quite stiffly lily sped from the library her legs taking strides twice the normal size and small beads of sweat forming on her brow once she d burst out from the double doors she broke into a run ohmerlinohmerlinohmerlin she just stole a book stole a book what if madame pince noticed and told flitwick who would tell mcgonagall who would tell dumbledore who would be ashamed to have a thief as a prefect nay as a student and expel her augh she was doomed deep breaths lily deeeep breaths eeeeee huuuuuhh eeeeee huuuuuh slam lily was thrown backwards from the collision and landed flat on her bum ugh ow rubbing her backside she shook the stars from her eyes and peered up james was standing a few paces away leaning down to pick up crime and punishment no lily leapt from the ground and made a dive for the novel but james already had it in the air he frowned and cocked an eyebrow calm down i ll clean this up for you all of lily things were strewn across the floor but she hadntnoticed she was leaping up and down like a child trying to get the book from james raised arm james give me that book right now the faintest smirk flitted across james face his eyes alight with a new mischief and immediately lily knew she had made a mistake oh and why is that er lily stopped grasping for the book and folded her arms haughtily no reason keep it if you like i dontcare oh all right then james smiled happily and flipped open the cover roughly thanks gah careful lily exclaimed lunging forward once more but james simply slammed it shut and lifted it casually out of her reach again ah lily you are too much fun she grimaced and gritted her teeth fine just start a pool of valuable things to blackmail me with she dropped to her kneesin a huff and began scrounging for all the papers that had spewedacross the floor but a hand in her face made her pause james had crouched down and was holding out the book to her lily frowned what you re just going to give it to me james shrugged and nodded yeah i dontneed it warily she reached for it then hesitated her hand hanging just centimetres away just like that her green eyes were searching his james smirked just like that still wearing an obvious frown lily took the book her suspicious eye still intently holding james gaze they both stood up and lily quickly shoved it into her book bag leaping back a step to ensure her safety so lily paused awkwardly and tilted her head i dontsuppose you could give me my badge back as well james laughed yeah right i need some blackmail he grinned right lily grimaced and pulled the strap of her book bag back over her shoulder then asjames was walking away he called back over his shoulder not that i dontalready have you by a string lily felt her face flush a vibrant scarlet and her fists began to shake that cocky a n thank you again for all the awesome reviews there was a question about me having a livejournal no i do not but i do have a myspace if you want to check it out you can access it through my profile at the homepage link sorry i cantbe more detailed in my thank you s but i have an exam to study for chapter six march to the scaffold it was a glorious day indeed lily sighed and smoothed her ponytail and oh what the heck undid the first button of her blouse and loosened the tie ah freedom she practically skipped down the steps into the courtyard the sun beaming amidst the puffy white clouds and the birds chirping delightedly it was picture perfect students were lounging about the grounds reading and chattering in the crisp autumn air lily even greeted a few of them with one hand and the other shoved deep in her left pocket was wrapped securely around a page of parchment she had used to jot down a few particularly good spells to use on james and she was quite prepared to use them all heh heh heh that d show the little zzzzzooooom lily ducked for cover as a gigantic bird zipped over her head several hairs from her tight ponytail came loose and fluttered in the wake of the creature dive what in the lily straightened up hands on hips oy bloody hell look at that someone cried pointing at the bird which was coming back for a second round but wait that was no bird someone got a broom a first year girl squealed pointing at the giant object before running to get out of its way zzzzooooom it nearly took off lily arm oh for merlin sake now you come down here this instant she cried exasperatedly after the illegal flyer eek lily ducked again shielding her head as the broom and its rider took another deadly dive over her now she was furious whipping out her wand she directed it at the rider forty points from wherever you re from she cried sending a mild shocking spell in his direction stupefy but the rider caught on evading the blast and took off toward the quidditch pitch you arentgetting away that easily lily muttered hiking up her robes and taking off after him students were watching with incredible interest now some rooting lily on but most of them laughing someone please alert professor mcgonagall she hollered over her shoulder she huffed practically out of breath and came to a staggering halt half way to the field she could see him in the distance trying to get away well not on her watch she wasnttop student for nothing accio broom she jabbed her wand at the rider suddenly the broom began shaking and it became obvious that the rider was loosing control lily smiled to herself and watched as the broom brought itself and its rider though desperately trying to stop it smoothly over to lily it was at that moment lily realized the flyer was not the only mischief maker in the area as if sensing the presence of a snitch four boys leapt out from behind the bushes and made a break for the castle ah ah ah she waved her finger and pointed her wand at them as well the boys jerked to a stop in their tracks and began wincing as some invisible force began dragging them backwards by their ears just then the broom rider landed tumbling to the ground when he stood up and tried to run lily caught the collar of his cloak and spun him around just what did you boys think you were david lily furrowed her brow she should have known gazing defiantly back at her beneath shaggy dark fringe was the very same little boy whom she d encountered in the courtyard a week ago the little disciple of james potter david was wearing a foul grimace and the other boys a look of wide eyed fear lily released them and placed her hands on her hips in a motherly fashion and just what are you first years doing with an illegal broomstick it goes against all the rules as i more than certain you are aware the boys sighed and shrugged david seeming to take the lead whatever you say we were just having fun well fun isntallowed lily said bluntly er illegal fun that is david rolled his eyes and held out his hand can i have my broom back now i promise i wontdo it again lily narrowed her eyes this bloody kid was really getting on her nerves absolutely not lily picked it up with a flourish i must confiscate it awww the boys cried in unison what a blonde one with freckles frowned that not fair not fair you broke the rules you have to suffer the consequences now where did you get a broom like this from someone must have sent it to you the boys were mum the blonde one with freckles began grinding a hole in the dirt with the tip of his shoe lily tilted her head and tried to make eye contact with him hmmm who gave it to you i may lighten your punishment if you name names the boy looked extremely nervous the others staring at him warningly dontworry about them lily waved her hand now who was it huh spit it out or it detention for the lot of you it was the boy began lowering his voice to a whisper with each word it was prongs an drew david hissed stepping on his foot ow andrew winced what she going to give us detention i dontwant that my mum ll kill me prongs did he mean of course he did james did james give you this broom it was all coming together now that why they were huddled in the courtyard the other day tell me it was him wasntit expelliarmus augh lily was slung backwards her wand books and the broom flying from her hands david had blasted her with his wand when she wasntlooking that little rat he and the boys took off running disappearing around the corner of the path furious lily stood up and dusted herself off detention for all of them and james potter the instigator hmmph she looked around for her books and wand great where had her things gone she turned her gaze upward to the tree branches above jammed betweena few twisted limbswere her precious books and teetering far out of reach at the top was her wand blast now what lily placed her hands on her hips and examined her surroundings hmmm there was that broom picking it up and smoothing a few of the broken twigs at the end she examined it looked safe enough come to think of it she d never really been on a broom much before sure first year she learned to ride but that was only a brief course but how else was she going to get up to those branches and retrieve her things all right lily one leg over the handle and eep lily felt her feet leaving the ground in a whoosh she was up in the air zipping around the tree in circles wheeeeee ha ha ha ha ha lily cried out this was fantastic she d forgotten how much she enjoyed this with grace quite uncommon for her when her feet were on the ground she plucked her things from the branches and glided safely to the grass she chuckled to herself and tossed the broom over her shoulder that was quite fun then she hesitated glancing over her shoulder she could see the three giant goal posts of the quidditch pitch rising in the distance she d never actually been to the quidditch pitch other than to watch a game her first year maybe it would be fun just to but no she shook her head that would be silly she didnteven like quidditch that much resolutely she turned her back to the field and marched off back to the castle she had detentions to serve hogsmeade weekend sirius twirled his wand and plopped down on the couch in front of the common room fire we re about due for a zonko run jamesie james frowned and flicked a bit of lint from his sleeve like we cantgo there whenever we like sirius shook his head and leaned forward excitedly yes but it no fun without the other students you can only set off so many dungbombs in the hog head before it gets a bit old in other words james rolled his eyes you miss the girls sirius lounged back and propped his head up with folded hands indeed my dear boy indeed james laughed and tossed sirius a pumpkin pastie he had stashed in his pocket he caught it deftly unwrapped it and had swallowed the whole thing in one swift motion so tell me james he ran a hand through his hair who are you going to take to the yule ball james snorted with laughter nice impression of charlotte padfoot really that was good but sirius just sort of smiled actually i was sort of serious james stopped chewing er okay why do you ask well i was thinking about sirius leaned in with a grin asking evans james sprayed pumpkin pastie all over the floor coughing and sputtering whoa james are you alright sirius slapped james over the back causing him to cough even more augh i m i fine sirius james straightened up and dusted himself off he turned his head to find half the common room staring what he bellowed immediately the students dispersed and scampered upstairs sirius was smirking what the matter with you you jealous or something james scoffed no why the hell would i be jealous of you oh sirius said demurely i meant jealous of evans i know how much you wanted to go with me he batted his eyelashes james threw a chocolate frog at him which he ducked so d you ask her yet nah i making it my new project you re joking right james frowned evans she ll never fall for it james please you are speaking to the king what not to love about me james shrugged i ll humour you besides his eyes lit up she absolutely gorgeous i mean you ve seen her lately haventyou yes she alright alright james he hissed she s she s behind you huh sirius spun around to see lily with her hands on her hips foot tapping and eyes menacing lily he immediately grinned and eyed her with interest hi lily ignored him james detention and forty points from gryffindor the grin on sirius face faded what he turned to james who was perched casually on the arm of the sofa head tilted in amusement did you hear me lily said her lips pursed james nodded uh huh for what for giving those boys a broomstick they were first years james sirius smiled nice james they were just having a bit of fun no harm no harm lily scowled that david boy nearly took off my head twice sirius was cracking up james just shook his head lovingly that my boy lily was not amused james i giving you detention and and her face fell you don t care james laughed why should i you arentreally going to lily jaw dropped wh excuse me i am a pre yes you re a prefect we know already james rolled his eyes irately look just go bother someone else for awhile sirius and i were in the middle of a conversation the pit of her stomach began to boil how dare you boss me around james potter just because you have my she paused mid sentence he still had her badge but really she couldntcontinue this way he really did have her by a string and that was no way to perform her prefect duties she would just have to suffer the consequences and go directly to mcgonagall with the news of her incompetence lily eyes narrowed and she pulled out her wand detention james he laughed and shook his head again just who do you think you are evans james sirius said warningly but james wasntlistening no one tells me what to do not the world not this school and certainly not you james growled cockily no one has ever beaten me and no one ever will lily simply gazed back at him calmly funny thing she said pulling out the bit of parchment stashed in her pocket you seem to forget that you re lacking in one area james brow furrowed as lily waved her wand complicatedly sending a series of blue and green sparks flying they danced around james momentarily and in a mere second had formed a blue and green glittering cage around him he gaped in awe i top student she smiled sweetly and you clearly are not with a flourish she made the cage hover at her will james anger was beyond words but he used them nonetheless evans you little he lunged forward ramming into the magical bars but was slung backwards in a shower of sparks grimacing he sat up realizing sirius was rolling on the floor with laughter tears were streaming down his cheeks it not bloody funny he cried already several students had gathered to see what the commotion was all about lily folded her arms and smiled at james i going to make sure you serve that detention and this is how james was fuming he reached into his pocket and pulled out the small prefect badge lily blanched if he destroyed it but with an angry toss james sent the little badge flying through the magical bars causing some sparks of blue to dance around it and it landed at lily feet here take it i dontneed it anyway he said as his confidence came rushing back you re already in deep as it is i dontneed this to ruin your prefect status lily brow furrowed what was that supposed to mean but she didntreally care to ask she bent down and scooped up the pin tucking it safely in her pocket with a wave of her wand she sent the cage out the portrait hole james stumbling as it took off she was going to make sure he stayed within magical walls and served his detention if it was the last thing she did you wontbe lieve where prongs is sirius gloated bursting through his dormitory door remus raised an eyebrow but continued scribbling away on some parchment nonplussed sirius plopped down beside him causing remus inkpot to slosh all over the bed remus waved his wand irately over the spot mumbling scourgify what donttell me you dontknow i thought all prefects knew what went on with matters of punishment remus sighed we arenttelepathically connected padfoot then to humour him he added what happened to james sirius eyes lit up with glee and he opened his mouth to speak when the door burst open peter stood at the threshold grasping the stitch of his chest as he took one giant breath and blurted remus eyes widened and his jaw dropped visibly damn you pete i was going to tell him sirius cried leaping off of the bed with his wand pulled on the stout boy sirius was in the middle of giving peter a magical wedgie when remus jumped out of his bed and burst through the door without a word peter and sirius just stared at each other blankly you dontsuppose he going to warn lily sirius finished as a sudden realization set in the humour had escaped his eyes and peter began to look a little fearful whatever feelings sirius sensed james may have had for lily on the train had surely dissipated lily book bag bounced against her leg as she marched through the halls chin held high and a fresh feeling of pride coursing through her veins james was locked away in filch office thanks to the help of her favourite new charms book and she she was golden absolutely golden yes lily she patted herself on the back you are indeed a brilliant mind whoops watch your step there eh heh heh lily flushed as she almost stumbled over a first year tying her shoe but people were staring quite a bit in fact they had been staring for quite awhile as she passed she picked up bits and pieces of their whispered conversations but she couldntquite tell what they were saying every time she turned around it seemed a small group was shushing each other and scurrying away from lily prying eyes had they all heard what she d done to james whoa lily almost ran smack dab into remus hello remus what are you shhh he hissed and before she could say another word he had grabbed her by the arm and pulled her around the corner into an empty classroom oh my could he she and remus here now like this lily was getting flustered this was highly inappropriate two prefects sneaking off into a classroom to well lily blushed remus lily stammered i dontthink we should lily we need to talk about james he turned to her firmly after checking to make certain the room was empty lily face froze oh her shoulders sagged slightly er she plastered on her bright smile what about james remus sighed and looked around avoiding eye contact you put him in a cage lily blanched yes well how did you know people are talking yes i noticed lily peered around the classroom she d never seen this one before it seemed to be just a spare room empty and filled with clutter but her eyes drifted to the back where an old dusty piano sat buried beneath old blackboards was this a music room she turned her attention back to remus who was now eyeing her with concern about that rumours fly here remus waved his hand absently wait what rumours what do they think i look lily they think you re either insanely brave or just er insane and they have every reason insane lily put her hands on her hips huffily he deserved what he got nonetheless he looked slightly distraught james is not he has never been one to wrestle with do you understand me lily she didntunderstand what he was getting all worked up over james was just a pompous rich boy who needed to be put in his place well i dontcare what everyone says james is staying in detention and he is not coming out for hogsmeade i doubt that remus muttered but lily didntquite catch it lily you know what james is like she shrugged yes and and he doesntlike to lose lily she raised her eyebrows well then he ll just have to learn i tired of him parading about this school as if he owns every bit of land we walk on well his father does put a lot of money into this school as have a long line of potters you arenthearing me remus lily folded her arms i not going to let a series of rich snobs have reign over this castle it not fair and it isntright just because potter charlotte her friends sirius the dalby twins and every other pureblood family here donates a thousand galleons a day doesntmean they re better than everyone else i mean remus you should at least sympathize with that remus just sighed you have a lot of gall challenging james potter i know lily said but i think it time someone did he shook his head i dontknow how much i can do to keep him from retaliating lily and believe me when james wants revenge he gets revenge oh please he had it out for me since day one i ve put up with his pathetic pranks i used to it no this is different lily that was just james being friendly he loves to tease and humiliate it in his blood he rolled his eyes but this this lily you need to watch out for if james starts a prank war with you there no going back i just hope you re prepared for that lily stomach began doing flip flops but her features remained calm i can handle james i am top student after all that got to count for something right she laughed nervously remus didnteven crack a smile he just grasped her shoulder in a soldierly manner and looked her in the eye i ll do what i can to keep him off your back but i donthave much sway with james even as his best friend with that he turned and left the room the door clicking shut behind him lily was left alone in the small dusty old music room a slight shiver went up her spine as she pictured the horrid look on james face as she had hauled him away in that magical cage why did she suddenly have the icy cold feeling that she was marching up the scaffold to her death this chapter is for brit and all my other faithful reviewers whom i kept waiting far too long sorry i am counting down the minutes as i am sure all of you are until the release tomorrow at midnight of hphbp this chapter is in honour of the oh so glorious release chapter seven someone plotting a soft breeze rattled the window in lily dorm she reached over from her desk and latched it unconsciously with a quick wave of her wand she was quite absorbed in chapter seventeen of detoxify de stress etc entitled tossing the garden nome a theory of anger management lily was halfway through the fourth paragraph when the door creaked open and madeline slunk inside carrying an armful of scrolls lily wouldnthave noticed but she heard a slight sniffling and set down her book hello madeline lily said without hesitation lily wasntgoing to let the poetry book incident get in the way of any possible friendship besides melinda er miss moonshine recommended in her book that she be open to as many new people as possible not only would it boost her self esteem but theirs as well plus she d do just about anything to get charlotte knickers in a twist madeline sort of froze eyes wide and glowing behind the pile of scrolls as if not entirely sure what to do or rather like a deer caught in the headlights i have a spell for that if you need some help lily offered motioning toward the scrolls madeline still said nothing it then occurred to lily what an awkward position she was putting madeline in charlotte had probably forbidden her to speak to lily well that snob wasntgoing to control madeline like that if lily had anything to say about it er that would be nice thank you madeline said blowing a strand of hair from her eyes lily hesitated shocked that she d agreed so quickly but then a smile crept slowly across her features she waved her wand and the scrolls drifted from madeline hands into a neat stack on her desk you sure have a lot of work there is that for advanced potions i wouldntbe surprised lily trailed off realising that madeline wasntlistening instead her eyes had travelled over lily shoulder and widened considerably at what she saw lily turned following her gaze and immediately flushed madeline was staring at the broom lily had confiscated oh er heh heh she laughed nervously sliding over to it and tucking it quickly behind her desk i was just erm well i confiscated it you see i mean i dontreally fly or anything rats how embarrassing lily was meaning to turn that in but it would just be thrown into the broom closet and get no use and well she really didntsee any point in that but madeline had apparently been staring at something else her eyes seemed even larger behind those giant lenses of hers what what is that erm lily stepped aside as madeline rushed past her snatching something from lily tidy desk oh that lily waved her hand i pulled it out of the rubbish really i mean that charlotte needs to lily froze when she saw madeline face there were a few tears sparkling in her eyes as she clutched the book of poetry charlotte had carelessly thrown away tightly to her chest i well it was a bit presumptuous of me i suppose but it seemed important to you so i madeline flushed with embarrassment and wiped the tears quickly from her eyes thank you she said quietly i thought i d lost it a warm grin spread across lily features sure we just wontmention it to charlotte will we madeline chuckled softly and stashed the book beneath her pillow i m i sorry for the way charlotte treats you lily she said bashfully she not a very nice person not particularly no the two girls fell into a fit of giggles at the understatement but were soon interrupted by the dormitory door bursting open lily was still smiling but madeline became quite stony faced and scuttled over to her bed pretending to have been working on a scroll charlotte strode into the room tossing her book bag languorously behind her where a disgruntled looking helen caught it just in time florence trailed in letting the door slam behind her lily couldntwipe the smile off her face she was too happy that she had just maybe maybe made a friend however she must have looked particularly goofy grinning ear to ear for no apparent reason for charlotte stopped abruptly in front of her and grimaced what are you so happy about evans the up close view of charlotte thickly layered eye makeup and pursed glossy lips were an effective means of destroying her smile lily just sighed and turned away no reason charlotte eyes narrowed with a huff she whirled around and spotted madeline scribbling madly on some parchment madeline madeline peered up fearfully er yes charlotte plopped down upon her bed and curled up with a magazine be a dear and fetch me a book from the library i need research for the astronomy paper due monday madeline nodded obediently and began to gather her things to go i ll help you lily piped up snatching her own book bag charlotte dropped her magazine what i ll go with madeline lily smiled affably pulling on a sweater over her thin shirt i was heading there anyway er on second thought charlotte sat up and flicked her curls primly i think i d rather you just stay here and help me write an outline for it madeline obediently set down her things and went back to writing but kept a curious eye on lily well then i ll just stay here and help you lily plopped down beside madeline a bit flustered charlotte leapt out of her bed and snatched madeline arm dragging her away from lily i changed my mind i want you to get me a pumpkin pastie low fat from the kitchens excellent lily cried i starving i ll just get my cloak shall i i thought you had to get to the library charlotte hissed running out of patience madeline hung helplessly from charlotte grasp and there was something of fear mingled with awe in her expression well it not that important i could she doesntneed your help charlotte finally burst right madeline madeline hesitated eyes darting between lily smiling face and charlotte snarling one tell her madeline charlotte shook her arm slightly madeline head sunk down to her chest and she mumbled i i dontneed help thanks anyway lily lily smile faltered and her insides twisted in anger why did charlotte have such a powerful hold on the girl anyway oh well all right but if you need anything she added brightly donthesitate to ask she won t charlotte snapped despite lily burst of adrenaline from standing up to charlotte she figured it was best to leave now lest she get madeline into more trouble than she probably already had upon the door latch clicking shut she heard the hissing and scolding of charlotte from within o o o o o o o o o o o o o strangely it had been about three days since the incident with james and lily had not seen him once he had not even come to class in fact she was even beginning to worry however she had also become somewhat of a legend around school she was the first prefect ever to have captured james potter this way he was able to serve out every single detention he owed the prefects so naturally all of them loved her but the majority of the student body considered her insane because as remus had pointed out in secret it was only a matter of time before james figured a way out and lashed back she knew she should be concerned and she was but only a little lily trotted down the corridor and popped jauntily into charms class where she found a seat conveniently next to remus she grinned at him but he only smiled hesitantly back as if she were a bit crazy but she paid no mind and instead turned her attention to the front of class where professor flitwick was pacing ah excellent no james once again the grin remained steady on her face at least for a moment it did lily brow furrowed slightly as she noticed the pacing flitwick wringing his little hands frowning quite visibly he climbed atop his pile of books right right he said fidgeting beneath his oversized cloak right good morning class oh i really hate this he groaned suddenly pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger blast it class something quite unfortunate has happened that was recently brought to my attention a soft chorus of muttering flooded the room lily blanched and looked at remus who as well looked taken aback and fearful had something could it be did something happen to james suddenly his lack of attendance was not so pleasing lily palms began to sweat with anticipation and her stomach was twisting into knots please let james be all right she felt herself thinking urgently please remus had scooted to the edge of his desk along with the other students now tortured by flitwick dramatic pause it seems he took a wavering breath that something very important to this school to me has gone missing oh merlin lily clutched the stitch of her chest james had gone missing he really was important to the school he brought life and excitement didnthe and he was a star quidditch player though she never knew flitwick thought so highly of him flitwick sniffled his worn appearance his depth of knowledge his sturdy binding sturdy binding remus raised an eyebrow and the rest of the class sunk back into their seats what on earth was he talking about unfortunately i have narrowed down my search of the culprit to this class flitwick said determinedly and with a touch of drama someone in this classroom has stolen my beloved heirloom my favorite possession my first edition of crime and punishment an advanced theory of charms in law enforcement lily blushed furiously then quickly hid her face in case anyone noticed damn the class began to chuckle softly he off his bloody rocker she heard charlotte mutter to her friends now now he squeaked this is no laughing matter i do not wish to punish the culprit but if they would simply step forward honestly i would really really like my book back ouch lily clutched her chest he was tugging on her heartstrings or perhaps her guilt double damn who would steal a bloody book sirius muttered to peter ashamedly she peered over at remus who was staring straight ahead with mild concern she couldn t she just couldntstand up here not now with remus watching no but she must return it yes she could she d sneak into the library and place it in madame pince office as if nothing ever happened ha ha what a brilliant scheme but somehow she didntfeel too brilliant as she sat through the rest of the lecture watching the normally bouncy flitwick moping dejectedly about and nervously knocking over stacks of parchment and books while her classmates snickered derisively o o o o o o o o o o o o o o two more days and still no sign of james indeed it had been a full week in which no one seemed to know where he went some claimed they d seen him on the outskirts of the forbidden forest while some even fuelled rumours that he d shrivelled up and died in the cage in filch office warranting the occasional foul glare at lily and though lily knew he was serving out detentions it didntexplain his absences from class hogwarts star chaser appeared to have completely vanished however lily had a feeling the marauders werenttelling her something remus wouldntlook her in the eye sirius just shrugged nonchalantly when asked and peter cowered and made up some lame excuse before scurrying off round a corner so when hogsmeade weekend arrived and james still had not lily had needless to say a funny feeling in the pit of her stomach something was definitely up but as far as she was concerned james wasntallowed to step foot in hogsmeade until his punishment was up even if it killed her so she vowed to stay on the lookout all aboard the conductor bellowed as steam began billowing and whistling from beneath the wheels of the engine lily gazed out the window of her compartment feeling a rush of d j vu once again she was stuck in the only compartment left with kenneth kaufman drooling over chocolate frogs by her side she sighed and reached inside her pack to pull out detoxify de stress etc but her hand fumbled over crime and punishment causing it to slip sideways out onto the floor lily insides froze an obvious look of anguish now plastered on her face as she gawked at the book lying quite blatantly on the ground before kenneth his mouth fell agape bits of chocolate dusting his chin lily she couldntspeak kenneth had seen no he d turn her in and she d be humiliated in front of everyone on the train sure flitwick said he would refrain from punishment but if he found out it was a prefect who took it who knew a prefect who d stolen it she d lose all the respect of the students that is if she didntlose her place as prefect first well kenneth continued gaping at her you dontexpect me to pick that up for you lily frowned what kenneth swallowed and huffed i said i not picking that up got me a bad back a bad lily trailed off her insides unwinding how oblivious can you be thank merlin for that lily sighed leaning over quickly to pick it up before shhhook the compartment door flew open madeline madeline oh it you charlotte vain cringed at the sight of lily florence and helen filed in obediently and lined up behind her where is she for a moment lily forgot about the book her attention focused primarily on what charlotte had just said what about her charlotte scoffed you obviously know nothing come on girls she spun around and waved helen and florence on wait lily stood up flushing what do you mean you cantfind her where did she go well if i knew that i wouldntbe here would i charlotte grimaced the girls giggled in response and began filing out she probably offed herself when you werentlooking it a worse fate taking orders from you lily mumbled under her breath kenneth nearly spit out his food in his sudden burst of laughter oops lily hadntmeant to say that so loudly charlotte whirled around and stomped over to her crunch charlotte hesitated and looked down lily blanched charlotte cautiously lifted her foot to reveal crime and punishment lying blatantly in the open with wonder she leaned down and picked it up delicately dusting off the cover lily was too paralysed with fear to move what and suddenly with the wave of realization a broad grin spread over charlotte fair features why isntthis the beloved tome dear professor flitwick has been desperately searching for lily could feel her insides once again tighten into hefty knots she was done for now charlotte please it not what you but charlotte wasntlistening she whirled around and shoved it in kenneth face did you take this from flitwick erm kenneth frowned i dontrecall well charlotte leaned back with her arms folded and the book dangling delicately from her fingers i ll be i never thought you had it in you wouldntflitwick be pleased to know you had it the snake like flicker had returned to her eyes lily watched kenneth staring dumbly at charlotte this was her way out she d just let charlotte blame kenneth and oh she couldn t no matter how obnoxious or oblivious he was he was still her friend and she could never really do that to anyone she had to fess up even if it would give charlotte an early christmas charlotte you ve got it wrong lily said firmly it was so obviously i wouldnttell him charlotte continued oblivious i mean what a brilliant move i cantstand that little midget both lily and kenneth gaped well charlotte flung the text back down on top of lily overflowing bag i guess you re cooler than i d thought with that the three of them marched out just as the door was sliding shut charlotte poked her head back in shooting lily a fowl glare if you re hiding madeline i ll have your arse bam lily flopped back down onto the seat with eternal relief that was too bloody close she had to get that book back into the library tonight after hogsmeade and that was the end of it the only question was how kenneth licked the chocolate from his lips and puffed up his chest well then didja hear that lily i cool chapter eight sweet revenge reluctantly beneath the shade of a shedding deciduous tree lily cracked her change purse a few bits of lint fluttered out carried by the soft breeze that also pulled a few strands free of her tight ponytail curtly she smoothed the hairs back into place and emptied the contents of the wallet into her open palm one two three sickles and four knuts well then it appeared she d be sitting this shopping trip out coming lily kenneth had paused in the doorway of honeydukes his feet dancing on the steps in eagerness to enter er she glanced around uncomfortably i think i ll head over to um the three broomsticks he shrugged and did not hesitate to ask questions the sugar quills were calling to him lily wasntexactly crying to be rid of kenneth granted he was her friend but they had never been particularly close to say the least brushing her cloak back she strode down the street perusing the shop windows she was just going past the robe shop when something made her jerk to a halt there glittering in the window was a gorgeous set of deep blue robes trimmed delicately with silver lace and embroidered with shimmering thread and iridescent beads the sheer sight of them sent chills up her spine they were so beautiful something was churning in the depths of her stomach she d never really cared about frilly frivolous things before yet she was beginning to see what some of the fuss was about why charlotte and her friends spent so much time meticulously planning their evenings and why every girl wanted to go with a handsome boy so that she would feel that much more beautiful she frowned suddenly she may not have had any money but that didntmean she couldntact like it puffing up her chest a bit she flung open the shop door her ego quickly shrank once she d stepped over the threshold her breath catching in her throat the walls were lined with incredible robes of all styles and colours each was intricately embroidered by hand no doubt and gleamed in the warm light of the elaborate little shop clearly this was a more upscale portion of hogsmeade she wondered if it had always been there or if she d merely tried to block it from her vision to save herself disappointment and looking around at the finely dressed and polished shoppers she wished she had ignored it once more she watched a very pretty blonde girl pick up a set of peacock feather robes and add it to her hovering pile lily felt her cheeks flush involuntarily as she peered down at her own fraying robes can i help you lily eyes flickered up landing on a young witch in a set of trendy purple robes with gemstone trim she raised a neatly shaped eyebrow and tilted her head are you lost um lily could feel the blush deepening in colour er yes i mean no what i mean is i looking for a new set of dress robes the witch eyed her sceptically for a moment with a new sense of pride lily stared her down defiantly imagining she was the blonde girl casually carrying around a mound of beautiful new gowns the witch tapped her chin with a lacquered nail and nodded resolutely well i think i have just the thing with a flick of her wand a measuring tape unravelled in thin air and began dancing around lily body hmm she muttered a hand thoughtfully at her chin right right excellent you have perfect proportions you know merlin i jealous she tittered gleefully okay you just wait in that dressing room and i ll bring you the perfect gown oh all all right lily stumbled through the racks and sat herself inside a small room with mirrors on all sides in the centre of the floor was a raised platform she dropped into a green velvet armchair and waited twiddling her fingers in anticipation great just great lily and how exactly did she plan on paying for these new dressing gowns she had no money and she was quite positive this store did not take i owe you s there was a soft pop outside the dressing room door and then a faint knock erm come in the door burst open here we are immediately lily blanched the young witch was carrying a stack of robes in hot pink brown powder blue and various other colour combinations with an assortment of trims ranging from sequins to goose feathers er eh heh heh lily smiled dumbly at the pile which the witch set atop a velvet armchair with a flick of her wand she sent the gowns dancing around lily in a whirlwind so she exclaimed delightedly which would you like to try first i um well i lily was desperately thinking of an excuse to escape when her eye caught a set of blue robes spinning past her face wait stop that one the robes jerked to a stop suspended in midair lily stepped down off the raised platform and stopped before the gorgeous set of blue robes the very same she had been admiring in the window these she breathed slowly the witch smirked and tapped her chin well i was going to suggest the fandango pink set but well yes those may just do fine she strode over to them and waved her wand now hold still i ll get them on you in a jiffy lily shut her eyes tightly as she felt her own shabby robes fall to the floor with a flick of a wand and then the coolness of the softest fabric she d ever known sliding over her skin oh they felt so nice there lily opened her eyes wow wow was that was that her hmm she tapped her chin well the pink was definitely more your colour but goodness these arenttoo bad not too bad indeed lily thought in awe gazing at the reflection of someone she didntknow or at least had only dreamed about so you like them then i i lily sighed wistfully and spun around i do i adore them excellent the saleswitch burst her jewelled sleeves bouncing as she spun around i ll just go ring it up for you then shall i what lily jaw dropped no wait i but she had already apparated from the room oh damn lily scrambled out of her robes she had to catch her she couldntpay for these she had just barely pulled on her own shabby robes and burst out the door when she nearly ran smack dab into the back of a curly blonde head she stopped dead in her tracks clutching the blue gown tightly to her frozen heart so then i said well obviously i want them in periwinkle blue and white they are my colours after all charlotte vane waved her hand in a dismissive gesture nearly smacking lily in the face her back thankfully was turned at just the right angle so that lily remained out of her visibility lily ducked behind a rack marked 30 off assuming that charlotte would never look there lily brain was buzzing she couldntlet charlotte see her here she d never escape the shop it was bad enough having to avoid that saleswitch who incidentally kept scanning the shop with hawk eyes waiting for lily to emerge lily watched charlotte polished shoes stride by on the other side of the rack two more pairs followed presumably her posse of helen and florence i mean talk about a pathetic excuse for a personal shopper i told daddy i said daddy i am going to do my own shopping from now on and he said darling i will get you a new shopper immediately charlotte giggled during this interlude then continued you see he just hates the thought of me having to do anything myself he can be sweet sometimes if you know what buttons to push she flicked her curls well lily couldntreally see if she flicked her curls but it was just a very charlotte thing to do what on earth a voice came from behind whatever are you doing down there lily froze blast she looked over her shoulder to find the saleswitch watching her with a mix of amazement and disbelief i er dropped my purse her disbelief turned to genuine worry oh dear let me help you look accio purse nothing lily blushed furiously that odd the witch tapped her chin with her wand ah well lily stood up slowly still keeping an eye out for charlotte who was now thankfully halfway across the store i must have lost it somewhere else i ll just go look for it and come back shall i fear darted across the saleswitch face at the thought of losing a sale no no nonsense here i sure we can work something out come with me no really i should get going lily began but the witch was dragging her by the arm and before she knew it she was at the register lily stomach flopped now the witch began scribbling something with her quill do you have wizard credit erm lily wasntparticularly paying attention she was busy keeping an eye out for charlotte but she seemed to have disappeared for the moment i dontknow really well i sure we could set you up with an account here what your mother maiden name an account lily turned back to the saleswitch what for well to purchase your new dress robes of course it a simple payback plan with minimal interest oh well lily flushed slightly i dontthink i d really be eligible oh nonsense she waved her hand dismissively there always collateral collateral yes if you are unable to make payments we usually take items to you know cover the cost oh well lily frowned what sort of items she licked the tip of her quill and began scribbling something else on the parchment oh you know limbs lily blanched i i sorry limbs yes the witch nodded brightly ears toes the occasional arm we did take a right buttock once but it was a particularly bad customer we were dealing with lily eyes were the size of dinner plates she liked her limbs she didntwant to trade them for a missed payment on a lousy set of robes bloody hell just as lily began to panic the ominous bouncing curls of charlotte appeared in her peripheral vision charlotte turned and headed toward the counter a giant pile of robes hovering behind her blast how was lily going to get out of this one there all done your new wizard credit account is set up what lily whirled around no i charlotte was getting closer lily tried to hide her face behind a spinning display of non fat chocolate frogs look i really shouldnthave an account but the witch face dropped i already set one up lily was desperately glancing back at charlotte if she saw lily she d never let her leave the shop without exploiting the fact that lily didntbelong there and had no means to pay um i really should but what if i just the saleswitch began but it was too late charlotte was only a few paces away her head turning threateningly in lily direction ack lily threw the blue dress robes over her face and made a dive for the door she knocked into charlotte sending her hovering stack of robes flying several glittering pink and baby blue ones stuck to lily arms and head as she stumbled desperately across the threshold she was almost home free when wham lily could see stars she blinked realizing it was just a set of glittering pink robes blocking her vision slowly she peeled back the gown from her head and dropped her jaw another girl the blonde one with the pile of robes was also on the ground beside her in a bit of a daze all of her beautiful gowns had been scattered across the cobblestone street muddied and torn some drenched and soiled in puddles this fact finally seemed to dawn upon the girl and she glared incredulously at lily who flushed with unparalleled humiliation the saleswitch stood at the threshold of the shop tapping her foot impatiently lily who was attempting to avoid eye contact very clearly spotted charlotte giggling uncontrollably amongst the onlookers the saleswitch pursed her lips and held up the tattered remains of a yellow gown pinched between her thumb and middle finger i ll just add these to your tab shall i lily blanched at the twenty some odd ruined dress robes and shrank abashedly away from the blonde girl seething glare dejectedly lily licked a cut on the palm of her left hand and drug herself away from the crowds to a secluded bench amongst a few evergreen trees overlooking the shrieking shack now that she was officially in debt oh merlin was she in debt lily had to start thinking about what it was going to take to repay that debt and still lingering in the back of her mind was how was she going to sneak that ancient copy of crime and punishment an advanced theory of charms in law enforcement back into the library without getting caught lily brain was swirling with the disasterous events of the past few weeks when she felt a presence beside her something wrong lily looked up remus was now lounging cross legged beside her she flushed and shook her head no no i fine just avoiding the crowds remus nodded that understandable i not much for large crowds either she began fiddling with the muddy hem of her cloak oh her cloak it was filthy she looked like she d been rolling in the mud blushing furiously again she tried to scrape some of it off but to no avail remus smiled enjoying the spectacle which just made lily flush even deeper she froze suddenly when remus reached out and gently grasped her wrist pulling her closer her red cheeks quickly became white with fear as remus leaned toward her what what was he doing was he she shut her eyes and pursed her lips and waited and waited she opened an eye and glanced down remus had tapped the sleeve of her cloak and muttered scourgify immediately the mud dissipated and her cloak returned to its original faded black colour and like the cloak her original red blush had returned rather quickly lily muttered a soft thank you and tried to focus her attention on the peeling bark of the pine to her left was it her or was remus snickering at her but when she turned back to catch a glimpse of his face he appeared as stolid as ever it beautiful out here isntit he said suddenly many people dontrealize it right lily mumbled except for the shreiking shack remus smiled true very true lily do you remember the first day at hogwarts er i suppose sure she brushed a few stray hairs from her face and tilted her head i was like a scared little kitten remus laughed so was i i couldntimagine being as comfortable here as i am now yes i suppose that true lily sighed not that she was having a particularly good year or anything i also remember the first time i met you lily ears pricked w what do you mean well i mean that remus turned to her quite fiercely lily i thought you were so pretty and now when i look at you i just lily froze remus was proclaiming his love for her remus i i want to be with you lily couldntbelieve her ears before she could stop herself the words tumbled out remus i want to be with you too i want you remus i think i love you remus then just like that she leaned in and kissed him his were soft but they began to curl into a smile lily pulled away and it wasntremus staring back at her it was james lily shrieked and leapt off the bench and nearly tripped on a dead branch you james was rolling with laughter the last few strands of remus sandy hair fading quickly into james famous messy black locks that was priceless lily insides were streched so tight with anger she thought they might snap you re sick oh remus i want you i think i love you he bleated mockingly practically rolling on his back with laughter yet his wasntthe only voice laughing lily ran she ran down the path until she reached the main street blaring from some unknown source was lily own voice repeating those awful words again and again i want you remus i think i love you remus remus i want to be with you too i want you remus i think i love you remus remus i want the entire town was stopping in their tracks trying to figure out where the voice was coming from and all the eyes of lily classmates landed on her everyone was laughing especially charlotte and her friends who seemed to think this was the best thing that could possibly ever happen charlotte began mimicing the words and dancing around as did many of the other students and there standing beside sirius who was of course laughing his arse off as well was remus flushing scarlet lily caught his eye and he simply turned away she thought she might cry biting back those tears she turned on her heel and ran back into the trees hadntshe been humiliated enough for one day enough for her whole life why did james have to be so nasty the dark was settling upon the town and it was only a matter of minutes before they had to be back on the train but lily couldntbring herself to emerge from the forest she was beaten down and tired she hated not having any friends she hated being smart she hated having james around and she hated being her what was it about her she needed to change in order to be liked was it that she was a prefect but no prefect from the other houses had any problems the students respected them but not lily no one seemed to respect her and why should they just look at her she was all in all rather pathetic lily simply sighed then stood up enough wallowing she had to get back to the train she couldntlet it get to her so much she just had to suck it up and finish out these last two years and she was gone off to some dream job working for the ministry in australia or some such like that she smiled to herself it made her feel better knowing she had some place to go after this school that she had the skills to get hired unlike many of the sorry wannabe of her class ha she d show them especially james that stupid selfish wait a minute james how had he gotten to hogsmeade he was supposed to be in detention and was prohibitted from trips like this that conniving little lily growled to herself but how had he done it she was just passing honeydukes when she saw a few student stragglers being rounded up by the prefects there was remus shaking his head and apparently talking to himself great fantastic now she had driven him insane with the thought of him actually being in love with her he probably thought she was stalking him he glanced furtively around and hung back as the students scurried off trying not to drop all their sweets lily paused in her tracks and took a step back into the shadows she really prefered not to have an awkward run in with the boy she just proclaimed her undying love for but remus was acting really odd shifting around and well quite animatedly talking to himself lily gasped james head had just emerged out of thin air he was laughing then the rest of his body appeared tossed over his right arm was a silvery sheet of fabric sliding around in his grasp could it be remus motioned to something and then shook his head and stomped off toward the train james shook his head nonchalantly then threw on the silvery fabric and disappeared into thin air ah so it was lily felt a smirk creeping across her features james potter had an invisibility cloak
