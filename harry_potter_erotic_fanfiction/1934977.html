be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that for a week after the quidditch match which they won 200 50 harry had attempted to avoid hermione but that proved to be an uneasy task actually it proved to be impossible he gave her the slip the entire weekend but on monday the now enraged teenage girl finally caught up to him before defense class she had cornered him and said alright harry james potter you re going to tell me why in merlin name you have been attempting to avoid me i wasntmia he said weakly dontmia me she snapped and dontthink i stupid i don t he shot back you expected me to believe you werenttrying to give me the slip he didntsay anything and stared at the floor harry she said softly why did you fly so high into their air at the quidditch game he sighed and said i i just lost it i just wanted to die for some reason there just too much pressure he looked like he was going to break down any minute again maybe you should skip classes today harry you dontlook too good she said cautiously no i making myself look like a wimp i mean i ve collapsed how many times so far and i ve been sick he trailed off and frowned i ve been in the hospital wing more times then i should have hermione also frowned and thought he right too many odd things have happened so far much more then any other year although out loud she said well one of the reasons you keep collapsing is because ron keeps trying to get into your mind so i guess it isntthat bad no harry admitted i keep hoping that sometime i ll finally hear what he says clearly you will she said and suddenly the bell went off both shot each other a terrified panicked look today they had double defense and they were late they set off at a high speed run neither of them noticing that they almost knocked poor professor flitwick as they ran by him professor evelyn looked at the door expectantly she hadntstarted class yet and nobody knew why she usually started when the bell rang suddenly the door flew open showing a late and exhausted looking harry and hermione a few people muttered to their friends with shock about hermione granger being late for class mr potter miss granger what is the meaning for this her voice was sharp and quick and harry realized that this was one of her off days you never knew what mood she was going to be in i sorry we were discussing what been happening lately that all hermione said honestly evelyn eyes seemed to soften for a minute before motioning to their seats just dontbe late again they nodded and quickly took their seats at the front of the classroom now i know i gave you a schedule for this class but i decided to change it because of recent events she said yes i know the creatures you might run into is vital to know but there are some more important things at the moment for instance her eyes traveled over to harry dueling a few people whispered excitedly now i want to know where you all stand in dueling so i can try to train you all as individually as i possibly can now in alphabetical order hannah you re first apparently each one of them had to duel her harry was watching everybody fight since he would be one of the last people to go up but something wasntsitting right with him as he watched everyone duel it was as if he was forgetting something that he should remember he had a little feeling of pride in him as he noticed professor evelyn shocked face as the members of the uld went up and showed they had more ability then anyone thought they would especially neville come to think of it evelyn looks a little peeved off she probably thought she d be able to teach most people these hexes and they already know score harry 1 teachers zip he thought with amusement harry lets see what you ve got evelyn said suddenly with a smirk harry walked and faced opposite of her then as she bowed he said that a stupid rule you know in the middle of a fight i doubt a death eater going to wait for you to bow her eyes flashed and she said no your quite right harry they wouldntso let forget that part diffindo harry was a little startled by the spell she used but said progeto her spell smashed into the shield and was thrown backwards just above her head causing part of the wall to split she raised an eyebrow and said impressive reflexes potter rictusempra he jumped to the side then yelled quietus evelyn voice was cut off just before she was about to call another spell tarantallegra her legs started dancing around the way neville had last year and she held up her hands in a sign of defeat finite the dancing stopped and she said very good mr potter harry walked to the side and noticed hermione staring at him proudly he smirked at her as dean went up to show what he knew that was great harry hermione whispered but i know that not all you could do from that training at grimmauld place this summer you know a lot more yeah a lot more that neither she nor anyone else needs to know about right now harry whispered back and his friend just shrugged and clapped along with everyone else as dean had done fairly well it almost as if you donttrust her she said offhandedly right about now the only ones i really trust are you fred george remus and tonks i sure ron would be on that list if he was here too he replied i notice dumbledore not on that list hermione said almost smirking a good damn thing too harry muttered under his breath angrily dumbledore been acting too weird this year he had his back turned from professor evelyn while talking to hermione and now he felt as if someone was glaring holes in the back of his head he turned quickly and saw their teacher staring at him once he turned she smiled and continued the class harry didntsee why he needed to pay attention to what everyone else was doing though you re all an exceptional duelers i impressed evelyn said once everyone had a go at her but to be a good dueler you need to have your own wand they re personal to you and i want to know about them so here the deal your homework is to write at least half a page about your wand the catch is you have to tell me what the core is what kind of wood the size what its specialty is and so on it will be due next class a few people sighed with relief that there wasntvery much homework but harry gave her an odd look why in gods name would someone assign something like that suddenly the bell rang startling everyone they didntrealize that the class had gone by so fast then again this class was rather large and they all did spend awhile dueling see you next class evelyn said and they all walked out of the door what so funny hermione asked harry as they approached mcgonagall classroom our assignment he replied with amusement then he frowned and added i not passing it in why a few people around him echoed as they stopped in front of mcgonagall classroom and waited for their teacher to show up just in case i wouldntwant it to fall into the wrong hands harry said what so important about someone knowing about your wand parvati asked harry suddenly had a flash of a green curse and a red spell crashing into each other then the two wands they came from being connected together with a gold beam of light you never know suddenly the bell rang but no professor mcgonagall showed up a few people started whispering she was never late for class well this is a chance to finish my homework someone said and sat down on the floor and started finishing the questions they were assigned hermione tutted and harry sniggered a bit they ended up sitting in the hallway for about half of their class some people were playing games on paper others had fallen asleep hermione was changing one of her book covers different colors and harry was just staring off into space suddenly there was a sound of footsteps coming down the hallway and everyone turned to look at who was coming luckily the people that fell sleep woke up just as mcgonagall appeared she didntlook happy needless to say no she looked positively livid about something she flicked her wand and the classroom door banged open loudly causing everyone to jump out of their sitting positions well what are you waiting for get in she growled a few people got alarmed looks on their faces and ran into the classroom as quickly as possible professor are you ok hermione asked her favorite teacher she shot hermione an appreciative look and then said no ms granger i not ok in the least she frowned heavily and motioned for her to enter the classroom harry shot her a confused look as she took the seat next to him mcgonagall slammed a book down on her desk and said mr boot collect the homework ms turpin pass out the she stopped her eyes directly on harry they narrowed slightly as she said pass out the stuffed animals you will be turning into creatures mr potter i would like a word with you in the hall now harry jumped slightly and everyone did as they were supposed to an angry mcgonagall was something nobody wanted to cross he walked into the hall followed by the professor she slammed the door then yelled what were you thinking he backed away from his furious professor and stammered p pardon the quidditch match catching the snitch and not letting anybody see it she yelled then flying up 100 feet above ground thinking you re going to throw yourself off of your broom oh how did i mean no i wasn t he said in a pathetic attempt to lie dontyou dare lie to me potter she said her face then went soft i cantbelieve you d do that waste your parents sacrifice harry felt his blood run cold at that and he said i didntthink about that he looked at his feet ashamed well think about it more often potter she said i wait how did you know he asked with confusion albus told me she replied simply that when it hit harry like a bludger had just plowed into his stomach dumbledore had been reading his mind he let out a light growl then said i d like to get to class professor she nodded her head and harry walked back in the classroom it seemed as if people could sense his bad mood harry was tired of dumbledore no wonder the headmaster knew almost everything that happened in the castle he probably read people minds all the time hermione tried to ask him what was wrong from time to time but he d just ignore her after class was over harry didntgo to lunch instead he went up to his dormitory he was looking through his trunk for his extra quills because he had broken one from anger in transfiguration when he came across his chocolate frog cards he picked up his large group of dumbledore cards when a memory shot back into his mind it was last summer at grimmauld place after remus went through a list of all the things the wizarding world had done to dumbledore but dumbledore says he doesntcare what they do as long as they donttake him off the chocolate frog cards said bill grinning he stared down at the cards with shock and saw all the dumbledore slide out of the pictures at the same time so he hasntbeen reading minds harry said out loud he been spying through the cards and i bet the portraits too damnit no wonder his card is so popular you d think one of the most powerful wizards in the world would be rare to get he jumped up and took them in his hands then headed downstairs to the common room hiya harry someone said hullo colin harry replied automatically and chucked all the cards into the fire why d you do that the curious boy asked ever wonder how dumbledore always knows what going on harry asked yeah colin said slowly well i think he uses the cards he said colin seemed to think for a minute before his already wide eyes widened even more making him look like a bug as he said that makes sense i getting rid of mine see you later harry he took off towards his dormitory strange kid the boy who lived said and walked out of the door to tell hermione what he figured out the uld was in the room of requirement again throwing some random curses and hexes around they were working on the shield charm harry wasntreally paying attention his eyes seemed almost glazed over suddenly he felt a small shock run through his body and he looked over to see and amused looking nicola look at him shouldntyou be paying attention to what people are doing he looked over to see that a curtain had caught fire and no one noticed it yet looking around quickly he found the culprit a happy looking griffy he rolled his eyes and watched as athena hermione water owl jumped from the top of the bookshelf where she was perched and onto griffy head she had yet to learn how to fly athena shape was like any other owl but her eyes were the same electric blue as her egg had been and her feathers looked perfectly slick and shiny with white silver and blue her talons and beak were also a dark shade of blue he waved his wand and the fire was put out and only then did people actually notice it cho said awe i wish our grade was doing that project too katie rolled her eyes and said we have enough work to do as it is chang she then smirked and said i pity the seventh years next year why dean asked she shrugged and shot him a smile but didntsay anything actually she didntknow anything either she just wanted to get the sixth years nervous harry sighed then said keep going with the shield charms i noticed your shields are breaking too easily start with light spells then use stronger and stronger ones but please dontkill each other i ve gotta look something up in these books a few people laughed and they split off into pairs harry didntreally have something specific to look up in the books he was just extremely bored last year he had become good at the shield charm and over the summer during his training with tonks moody and remus he had become an expert at it he was flipped through a book called the most dangerous curses on earth although it also said unknown author the first thing he saw that caught his eye in the index was the words avada kedavra he was about to go look at it when there was a scream from across the room his head shot towards the sound and he dropped the book to the floor and rushed over to see what had happened looking confused he saw a girl named alison on the floor and a slightly surprised looking cho standing opposite of her what the bloody hell happened harry growled we were practicing the shield charm and she didntmake a good one cho said simply i was making good ones chang alison yelled angrily as she stood up one minute we were doing first year spells and blocking them then the next minute she does this seventh year spell i could usually take it but i was so startled a few people murmured with agreement i did not cho snapped that it harry yelled everyone out meeting over some people looked slightly startled but listened to harry anyway and left in twos and threes harry hermione said and walked towards him cheer up think about it tomorrow the halloween feast yeah harry said and followed her out of the room great time of year isntit she shot him a look and said no need for sarcasm sorry it just my parents died on halloween and all oh hermione said with a guilty tone i sorry i forgot it just you never used to mind of course i didn t harry said nothing gave me a reason to remember now that sirius is gone she nodded sadly and they continued walking up the many sets of stairs halloween came and seemed to lift the heavy air off of many people shoulders there hadntbeen an attack for a while harry on the other hand was absolutely miserable this halloween when he had lived with the dursleys he knew dudley got dressed up and went out and came back with a lot of candy apparently he brought home less then he originally had because he ate a lot before they came home and here it was usually just come to think of it something odd has always happened on halloween harry thought quirrell letting the troll in on halloween in their first year then in second year there was the first attack the basilisk made in third year the fat lady portrait was sliced to pieces by sirius in four year his name was pulled out of the goblet of fire and in fifth year he stopped and stared blankly at a wall he couldntremember what happened in fifth year note more like i cantremember and i just finished reading the fifth book again the other day halloween must be my unlucky day harry muttered out loud suddenly a second wave of memories hit him and hit him hard something bad actually had happened every halloween even at the dursleys he didnthave a clue how he suddenly remembered all of this and wasntreally sure he wanted to when he was two he remembered having a terrible dream about his parents dying and was crying loudly uncle vernon had come in and growled about him being noisy and waking little dudders up and actually hit him across his face petunia was just told he fell out of his bed when he was three he went over to mrs figgs and one of her cats pretty much attacked him then when he was four dudley shoved him roughly to the ground and he pretty much ripped open his knee when he was five he accidentally turned his teacher wig into a giant rat although he didntknow how or why at the time when he was six he fell down the stairs and broke his leg when he was seven aunt marge came over and her dog ripper attacked him when he was eight he caused aunt petunia favorite flower to shrivel up and die giving him a week locked in his cupboard when he was nine he almost got hit by a drunk driver when going out to get the mail and finally when he was 10 dudley once again shoved him down the stairs and he broke his arm in three places smiling sarcastically to himself he said what a great childhood i ve had are you coming to the feast harry seamus asked him as he walked up to the armchair harry was sitting in i heard the entertainment was provided by the weasley twins this year after thinking for a moment harry said yeah sure where everyone else already down there hermione was growling about you not showing up so one of us decided to come get you parvati volunteered me seamus said and his stomached growled with hunger harry smirked then said whipped they exited the common room and started walking towards the great hall i am not seamus said with a frown yes you are harry argued parvati got you wrapped around her baby finger well if that true then hermione got you whipped seamus said forcefully harry raised an eyebrow and said i not going out with her mate seamus just rolled his eyes and went silent not noticing the confused look harry was giving him there you are hermione said her voice full of delight as the two boys sat down at the table i honestly thought you meant it when you said you werentcoming harry rolled his eyes then said i decided to save these guys from hearing you complain he smirked at the look on her face then winced as she kicked him in the shin shut up she growled but not with anger fine i will he said and went silent for awhile after about five minutes of no replies from her friend hermione said fine dontshut up you proved your point harry smirked once again at her then said so i guess fred and george are doing the entertainment he gestured towards the front table where the weasley twins were sitting looking positively excited about something hermione shook her head and said goodness knows what after a delicious meal that consisted of anything from roasted chicken to tomato soup and then some desert came everyone favorite part of halloween the house elves always seemed to go out of their way to make the best of the best on that night harry was actually having a good time the pain about his parents dying on that night 15 years old was dulled as he joked around with seamus dean and neville and tormented hermione lavender and parvati dumbledore clapped his hands together and said now that we are all full and tired i would like to present our entertainment tonight misters fred and george weasley a few people laughed and almost everyone clapped as the weasley twins stepped forwards they grinned evilly and fred yelled duck everyone ducked then much to their surprise a bunch of ducks flew over their heads there was a bit of laughter as the ducks flew around then one landed on malfoy head get off of me you stupid little malfoy started but didntget to finish bang there was a puff of smoke after the bang then when everything was clear malfoy was soaked in red and gold paint the show continued on with exploding paint ducks amazing fireworks and many little stupid tricks which were mostly played on slytherins one duck landed in front of dumbledore and exploded soaking him in silver and gold paint everyone looked on with shock even the twins until dumbledore started laughing merrily quite a good bit of magic the night continued on and everyone was having a good time including harry until he noticed something red running down the wall after staring a little more he realized that it was blood more places on the wall started to leak blood too but no one noticed at first he shot fred and george a confused look and said what are you doing what george asked the walls he replied and everyone looked at the walls a few people screamed and everyone that was sitting by the wall jumped up and ran to the opposite side of the tables silence dumbledore roared and everyone fell quiet fred george is this your doing no sir both twins said together while staring in horror at the wall harry suddenly felt a strong pain flash through him but not where his lightning bolt scar was but where the words half blood prince were scarring over on his arm a light haze seemed to fill the room and everyone looked around nervously and jumped as laughter filled the room not cheerful laughter but the type that an insane person made hermione grabbed harry arm and looked around fearfully 1 2 there goes you 3 4 i ll take some more 5 6 you ll never guess this 7 8 i ll make you wait 9 10 it not the end a sadistic sounding voice sang out followed by that evil laughter again peeves somebody asked dontcompare me to that stupid poltergeist the voice growled and at the moment peeves actually poked his head into the great hall curiously a human shaped figure appeared but it had no features it was just a gray shadow suddenly it sprang out towards the hufflepuff table and people screamed but it was stopped in it tracks as a second figure appeared in front of it and it stopped harry felt his heart almost stopped when he realized the second figure the female was the one that always protected him in his dream and that must mean the gray one was the thing that turned into his evil clone go away the girl growled and her body started to glow with light and beware the half blood prince approaches the other figure hissed with pain then disappeared as a load of magic shot from his body towards different parts of the house tables a few people screamed as their friends were thrown backwards harry felt like someone had punched him in the stomach as he was slammed backwards into the wall hitting his head against its stone surface the last thing he heard before he blacked out was hermione screaming his name author random babbling end there smirks i know i so evil arenti ok so i chose hermione animal to be an owl not just any owl because of her element but a water owl i mentioned this before but i really mean it now i start school on tuesday so

come on harry you can do it a female one also yelled harry eyes snapped open as he looked up at the two figures standing in front of him they were blurred because he didnthave either his glasses or his contacts but he could clearly see two sets of fiery red hair get him his glasses the girl said and someone handed his old thick rimmed circular pair to him he put them on with confusion knowing that he had a better pair then this somewhere what he saw though made him gasp in shock more then anything ron ginny you re alive and here harry yelled happily and hugged them both in one big bear hug they both got confused looks on their faces and ron said of course we re here where else would we be with voldemort he captured you guys remember he replied with sheer confusion ginny smirked and said harry i know you miss sirius and all but dontworry and who voldemort but harry said and looked around realizing that he was in the hospital wing damn this is the hundredth time i ve been in here this year he didnteven hear ginny question they both looked confused again and ron said no it not harry shook his head and said so it was all a dream ron smirked and said i guess you ve been in here for about a week now what happened the raven haired boy replied we were all out at quidditch practice when there was a run away bludger flew towards the stands where hermione was and destroyed it she fell and you jumped off your broom to catch her you both hit the ground but you were knocked unconscious suddenly the door to the hospital wing burst open and hermione ran in looking anxious her eyes turned to the bed and she dropped the books that were in her arms let out some funny sort of squeal and ran at him she tackled him back onto his bed and hugged him tightly are you ok does it hurt do you need help with your homework is there anything i can get you how hermione harry said loudly shocking the girl slightly yes she asked stop asking questions it wasntyour fault it was the fault of the person that never mind he realized that someone probably didntcharm the bludger but it just was a rogue one harry hermione asked curiously seeing the distant look in his eyes it nothing harry said and shook his head i just dontfeel too good that all of course you don t i ll go get madam pomfrey ginny said at once and ran over towards the nurse office hermione harry said after a minute yeah where did i spend the summer he inquired she looked surprised at the question then said with amusement at godric hallow were else what harry said with shock why was i there the brunette and the red head shared an odd look then ron said er harry mate you live there with your parents and your brothers and sisters remember my parents are dead he replied without thinking no they re not hermione insisted you must have hit your head worse then we thought your mother is the charms teacher here remember no i don t harry stated oh dear madam pomfrey voice echoed out to him i was afraid of this a strong trauma to the head can cause amnesia but this is one of the first times i ve heard of someone coming up with new memories in their head although it could have been one long dream i suppose amnesia a dream how that possible harry said weakly he suddenly got an idea and looked towards his arm he pulled up the sleeve to his pajama top and stared with shock at his arm there was no marks on it at all hadntthe words half blood prince been written there just moments before what the date the three friends and the healer looked at him with surprise it was hermione who said december 23rd that not right harry thought with surprise i was just at the wait where did i think i was i cantremember harry a female voice yelled and suddenly he felt another body jump on his and give him a tight hug he looked in shock as a girl about a year younger then him with silky raven black hair and emerald green eyes looked up at him i so glad you re alright dontworry i fine lex he said then another voice filled his head how did you know her nickname was lex oh so you remember your sister name not ours ginny said sounding insulted sister he thought weakly and you were just going on about your parents being dead ron added my parents arentdead harry said with amusement hermione ron ginny and madam pomfrey all shared odd looks once again but no one said anything to make him think otherwise do you know my full name harry lex asked him of course it alexa lily potter why wouldnti he asked she smiled happily and someone else said madam pomfrey said you might have amnesia when you wake up harry turned to see another girl who was alexa double hey gemma the girl smiled glad that her brother knew who she was do you remember all our family yeah there mum dad you two and me nice trick question thanks i think do you remember the blacks yeah there sirius maureen kaylee chad and haylee oh and we cantforget sirius sister kaylee and her son orion what about the lupins alexa asked although she seemed almost sad when harry answered the question before there remus liana and josh oh good you remember everyone gemma said and gave him a hug harry hugged her back then suddenly another voice came into his head since when did you have a family aside from the dursleys harry was let out of the hospital wing the next day he didntseem to have any problems except for that stupid little voice running around in his head which he kept silent about knowing that it wasntnormal to be hearing voices no one else could hear and splitting headaches he got at random times which he also kept silent about the annoying voice inside his head mostly started talking when he was around others especially when he was with his family it kept saying that he didnthave one anymore he was broke out of his thoughts as alexa said come on harry or we ll be late late for what he asked wildly as his little sister pulled him towards the gryffindor common room dontyou remember the girl asked and frowned dumbledore gave our families permission to spend christmas here together our family the blacks and the lupins i didntthink that was allowed harry said of course it is you were the one that planned it you know dontyou remember she inquired no i can t sorry i guess i hit my head harder then i thought he replied with a shrug as he entered the gryffindor common room it looked positively more beautiful then he had ever seen it before there was live fairies floating around glowing in different colors streams of shimmering tinsel wad wrapped everywhere there was warm frost on all the chairs and walls and the tree was huge and covered in the nicest array of decorations harry had ever seen alexa smirked as her brother eyes widened and his mouth fell open this is amazing i know isntit too bad nothing good ever lasts she said with a sigh what he asked and stared at her with surprise she shrugged and sat down while staring at the fire sadly what wrong he asked her i dontknow it just i feel like something missing like i somewhere i shouldntbe ever feel like that harry she asked yeah he said and looked around the room the portrait opened and gemma walked in skipping slightly she looked over at her evil twin and her older brother and ran over to them quickly sitting on the chair beside her sister s what are you so happy about harry asked dully it christmas she said happily obviously she was the over active one while alexa was the deep thinker alexa rolled her eyes and said i was just thinking you do that too much gemma interrupted whatever she said with an annoyed sigh there was a scream from up the girl dormitory steps then a young girl the same age as the twins flew through the door and into the room she tripped and ended up flying headfirst onto the cushions of the sofa both of the twins just burst out laughing at the girl she sat up and her gray eyes flashed angrily her black hair was a mess and it added to her annoyed look gemma why did you put a rat in my bed calm down kaylee it was just a joke the girl said kaylee glared at the girl darkly and said dontdo it again you know i dontlike rats that just because pettigrew was one gemma replied the other two girls and harry got stony looks on their faces but harry had a slight suspicion that it wasntfor the same reason he did harry was walking silently out of the grounds ron hermione and ginny all left to go home earlier that day just after harry had gotten out of the hospital wing he stared at the frozen lake and said to himself why do i keep thinking hermione has a little sister here i dontknow why do you that annoying voice in his head said again suddenly he heard crying coming from somewhere he followed the noise and saw a 15 year old girl with long jet black hair holding her knees close to her chest and crying are you ok he asked and knelt down next to her she looked up and he saw she had gray eyes and she looked just like a young female version of sirius he said she nodded her head and said i just can t oh harry i know you dontknow what i going through but i cantbelieve my dad gone it ok kaylee he said and hugged her tightly how did you know her name was kaylee kaylee jenna black he thought to himself i miss sirius too why d he have to die i hate my stepfather he treats me like shit god when i was home at one point of time he told me to shut the fuck up because i laughed god nobody had told harry how sirius had died but he kept seeing a flash of a man falling through a veil what happening to me he whispered and backed away from the girl while holding his head what kaylee asked with worry i feel like i not supposed to be here like i supposed to be somewhere else she just gave him a worried look and said i dontknow christmas eve was eventful but harry had a feeling of deep longing as he watched his happy parent joke around with his two sisters he felt deeply sorry for kaylee as her stepfather matt kissed her mother maureen and her brother and sister chad and haylee did an odd little jig the lupins seemed to be the most normal of them all aside from the fact that liana had to put up with both remus and josh being werewolves kaylee or rather cassiopeia black sirius older sister adored her son orion but she had the same empty look in her eyes that kaylee did here harry james said and held out a package wrapped in thick brown paper figured you could use this i have the other one harry got an odd look on his face and slowly opened the package to see a square shaped mirror nobody noticed the look of horror on his face as he stared at it sirius he seemed hesitant when saying that name and matt looked angry and i used to use them to talk to each other during detention james said harry hand shook as he had a flash of himself opening up the same package and then throwing it into his trunk smashing it it fell from his shaking hand and shattered on the floor harry are you ok lily asked him and moved towards her oldest child only son james however looked angry that harry had broken sirius mirror it shouldntbe this way harry said causing everyone to look at him what lily asked this is all wrong harry yelled and ran out of the common room harry his mother yelled and tried to run after him but james stopped her he just stared blankly at the door and muttered what wrong with you harry harry sat on top of the astronomy tower shivering from the cold his own words repeated in his head like a choir of harry chanting this is all wrong it was almost as if he thought he wasntsupposed to be there but be somewhere else with someone else this isntright i not supposed to be here i supposed to be helping hermione with he saw blood leaking down the great hall walls and several students crashing back into the bloody brick including himself no that right harry keep remembering alexa voice said he faced the younger girl with confusion written on his face what this isntreal harry no matter what you think this never happened she said sadly it could have happened but it didn t this is what it would have been like if voldemort never existed that not true a second voice said and gemma joined them dontlisten to her harry its all lies she just trying to confuse and hurt you no harry i not i swear alexa replied sadly you have to trust me no harry trust me gemma said and shoved her sister lightly to the side remember the philosopher stone nicolas flamel still has it the chamber of secrets there no proof it real alexa glared at her twin then a mirror appeared out of nowhere she took it into her hands and walked closer to harry he stood up from his sitting position on the cold stone floor and stared curiously in the mirror hold it she said and he did she then reached her hand forwards and pushed his hair out of the way to reveal his lightning bolt shaped scar remember this harry was staring at his lightning bolt scar his eyes widened as he heard his mother screams his father yells voldemort high pitched laugh and a flash of bright green light i remember wait what am i doing here gemma sighed and alexa said happily you were knocked unconscious in your world and your mind was pretty much thrown into another one when that happens two people from the world your mind went into are chosen to either try to get you back to your world or to keep you here i had to try and make you remember so you could go back while gemma was supposed to convince you that this was real and i was just out of my mind why harry asked with surprise because gemma piped up when you re mind is thrown out of your body there a good chance you could die if i had managed to keep your mind here it would be here forever and your body would just eventually die because your soul would follow your mind here amazing harry said as much as i love this world how do i get back to mine suddenly a portal of light appeared between the two twins illuminating the area so much that harry had to put his hands over his eyes to keep the pain at a minimum right through there gemma said you ll remember everything that happened here alexa said sometimes it causes people mental breakdowns so he cut her off by saying no it won t it ll make me try harder i know what could have been now and i ll make voldemort pay for taking my family away from me and life away from you guys i just have one question though for gemma yes she asked why are you named the same as my dead sister from my world he inquired it was one of grandma favorite names and she promised no matter what to name her oldest daughter that i about five minutes older then alexa so that why i was named it i know in your world mum was raped that why she had gemma but she stayed true to her word to her mother gemma said harry nodded his head and said i ll keep you guys in my heart and mind just so i know what i fighting for now the two girls smiled as he walked through the portal then had to let their eyes adjust as it vanished along with their brother think we should have told him that he not going directly home alexa asked nah he ll get through fine gemma replied with a shrug harry eyes got used to the bright light he was in as he looked around sighing with an annoyed tone he said to himself i should have guessed it wasntgoing to be that easy getting back looking down at his arms he saw that all his scars had returned and were throbbing at the moment including his lightning bolt scar he continued walking although he didntknow why it didntseem to be getting him anywhere stopping he growled angrily to himself and said i should have just stayed in the other world at least there was scenery suddenly he was tackled onto the ground and there was a yell of harry he looked back and jumped away in surprise to see a large black dog on him he got up and said sirius sure enough his godfather although looking like he did when he was younger appeared in front of him with a wide grin but you re dead yeah i know sirius said happily i having a great time and dontblame yourself for it i happy with james and lily by the way they ordered me to tell you that they do love you and they re really proud of you now i donthave much time here i was just supposed to lead you to the door of unconsciousness dontyou mean consciousness harry asked no i got it right you re in a coma right now and there no way you d keep going on your own here sirius said and started walking harry followed him closely i sorry i got you killed he blurted out you know it not your fault if you hadntgone voldemort would have just got tired of waiting and went himself the order would have been alerted and i probably would have gone anyways and well you know the rest he said with a sigh he then got a happy look on his face and said but now i free i can do whatever i want whenever i want i with your parents and i couldntbe happier just take care of remus and your friends for us ok harry smiled at his godfather and said alright just make sure you guys dontforget about me no way in hell we would sirius cried out a door appeared out of nowhere and he said here your stop just promise not to forget us harry touched the door handle then turned around and said sirius yeah he asked harry paused for a moment as if thinking the right words to say then said someone once told me something and it was the wisest thing i ve ever heard not even anything dumbledore says can compare to what he said what was it sirius asked curiously the one we love never truly leave us they will always be found right here he placed a hand over where his heart was sirius chuckled remembering that he himself had said those words a phrase to live by now get going you re friends miss you and hermione probably having a fit or something knowing her harry said with a small smile bye sirius he smiled and nodded as his godson opened the door and walked through it looking around curiously harry realized that he was probably back in his mind because it was all black with swirling colors like you see when you close your eyes suddenly there was yet another flash and he was in a prison cell harry someone asked he turned around to see a shocked looking ron staring at him ron he said and his voice echoed ron face turned from shocked to glee as he said finally i hope you donthave another odd dream so i can get my message across this time harry sighed and said to think i heard dumbledore saying once for in dreams we enter a world that entirely our own seems to me like everyone but me is deciding what i dream ron snorted then said seriously harry you ve got to get us out of here i dontknow how much more of this i can take it the same with everyone else i ve been coping the best out of us all harry bit his lip and said tell me where you are i think we re in you know who old house or something ron said with a shrug some death eaters called it the riddle house or something like that and you said his name is really tom riddle harry moved to the window covered in bars and looked out it there was a graveyard and he could see a cauldron one that looked like it hadntbeen touched in at least two years sitting there i know where this is really how the red head asked and walked next to him that where voldemort was reborn he replied and gave an annoyed sigh at ron wince say his name ron i can t he replied his freckles standing out against his pale skin ron harry said threateningly v v v v vold emort ron said the last part in a whisper it ll take practice but you ll get it soon harry said so you re in the riddle house about the third floor up and the corner window and the riddle house is right by the graveyard that i was taken to in fourth year well it a little off from where dumbledore thought you were yeah and harry about quidditch harry chuckled and said katie captain and we have a reserve keeper the spot was saved for you ginny will have to try out next year we won against slytherin dontworry oh by the way i got your prefect badge i dontcare what you say your taking it back ron smiled at his friend and said thanks buddy suddenly there was another flash and harry was back to just seeing black hermione looked like a mess these days she was either in classes or the hospital wing she was slipping in her classes a little because she didntpay attention all of the time she still always had her homework passed in on time of course and when we say slipping for hermione granger it means she goes from 110 to 100 she never went to her dormitory let alone the gryffindor common room either parvati or lavender would bring her clothes and her books sometimes though she wasntallowed to see harry dumbledore would be with him and then he would go and talk to other order members currently she was sitting on the chair next to harry bed she was holding his hand tightly as lavender brushed her hair and started putting it in a braid he going to be fine you know harry the strongest person i know i know he strong and all but we already lost ron hermione said weakly and told herself mentally i will not cry again she started going over phrases for ancient runes when she felt something squeeze her hand stop it lavender i not doing anything she replied grumpily what but i she trailed off and gasped as she saw harry hand squeeze hers again harry a light groan escaped his mouth and after a minute of struggling he opened his eyes where am i now hermione let out a little shriek and hugged him tightly causing her hair to fall out of the unfinished braid lavender didntreally care though she jumped up and said i ll get madam pomfrey are you ok she asked harry was glad she didntgo off on him like the other hermione had done i fine and so is ron he said happily what she asked with confusion madam pomfrey ran over followed by professor dumbledore who had a look of deep relief on his face harry he said who did you send to get the weasleys harry asked right away dumbledore looked surprised beyond anything and said how did you know i saw them saving the weasleys he replied honestly yes i should have guessed as much the headmaster said in deep thought the healer and the two girls looked on in confusion we got the information on where they were located when you went from being in a coma to being unconscious you would mumble in your sleep and we knew all we needed to know to save them wait so you re saying lavender said and trailed off suddenly a door to the hospital wing opened and a group of aurors walked in one of them levitated a stretcher behind him the figure on it was covered in a white sheet hermione let out a gasp and harry sat up straighter who is that dumbledore asked with slight alarm there was sobbing and a red headed woman walked in sobbing heavily molly weasley was defiantly skinnier and paler then the last time any of them had seen her her hair and cloths were a mess and she had cuts and bruises all over her soon arthur weasley walked in the room looking extremely depressed like molly he was skinnier paler and dirtier but he was obviously abused much more then she had been then ron and ginny walked through the doors ron who looked awkward before seemed even more so now he was very tall and obviously underfed he was skinnier then harry like his parents he was pale and dirty and the light that was always present in his eyes was gone ginny likewise seemed to be the same as her brother she was starting to turn into a rather fine young lady but because of her time being held captive she seemed to have stopped growing in every way possible oh no hermione said and looked at the sheet percy he gone mrs weasley suddenly screamed with sheer pain in her voice tears gathered in hermione eyes and she clung onto harry tightly from both fear and sadness for the weasleys why couldntyou have heard where we were sooner harry molly screamed out maybe my baby wouldnthave killed himself then harry looked at his blankets with an ashamed look on his face as mr and mrs weasley were led away by dumbledore ginny followed them but ron didn t he looked at his friends and said it wasntyour fault you tried and you got us out in the end thank you harry you really are a good friend where i was always the jealous one now i ve got a taste of your life and i glad i not you harry smiled sadly at his friend as he walked after his family not giving hermione or lavender time to jump up and tackle him they re back harry thought happily suddenly a familiar voice echoed in his head keep in mind what right and what wrong harry i know who it is now that voice harry muttered under his breath dad author insane notes decided to rename it for awhile well i decided to get another chapter up before i went back to school i ve gotta make this short because my three friends are coming over later should be fun for my step dad four teenage girls anyways lol if you noticed to the replies in chapter 15 my cousin put a math problem in that for gorav1 that didntreally work because she messed up so badly on it it was supposed to be 14 x 2 plus 10 minus 50 plus 20 plus 10 that equals 18 the chapter that the weasleys were returning in i feel bad now i should have done it myself because not only did most of the figures not show up but she also typed in the wrong last number so sorry to everyone it was supposed to be a hint but obviously it didntwork thanks angel rolls eyes well i going to get to the replies to the reviews and then send

breakfast and go to school lol anyways thanks again krystal lily potter harry potter and the half blood prince by krystal lily potter chapter twenty six the bottom line rating pg 13 more on the aa side couples hp hg dt lb pp sf ll nl dt gw lb rw ll rw hp cc summary as harry and his friends enter their sixth year at hogwarts they dontenter the cheerful world they left behind they enter a world covered in a thick blanket of fear it only hits harry how important he really is when people start seeing him as the light that allows them to see under this blanket along with his friend he must battle the horrors of the past present and possible the future to begin the end of the war hopefully before it hits hogwarts what happens when people start disappearing from under dumbledore protection and one of the famous trio disappears it up to the last two plus some more friends to find a way to save all the people that disappeared because they cantfight this war on their own warning dark themes will be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound note damn you should see all the things i have to wrap up in this story and in a possible sequel i ll be leaving some lose ends because i originally had them planned to be explained in the sequel to this which is call never mind lol also there a few things that have to do with religion in this chapter if you dontbelieve that point of view it ok just please dontgrowl at me about it this is from my point of view remember third person omniscience i know all and i see all lol ok now i decided to put all this up here so people would see it this is the way i look at the way you become a pureblood half blood or muggleborn you might look at it different it all a matter of opinion really two muggle borns muggle born muggle born plus a muggle half blood muggle born plus a half blood half blood muggle born plus a pureblood half blood muggle plus a muggle either a muggle or a muggle born muggle plus a half blood half blood muggle plus a pureblood half blood half blood plus a half blood pureblood after all two halves do make a whole half blood plus a pureblood pureblood pureblood plus a pureblood pureblood wow that was confusing anyways on with the story there was a constant thumping sound on the floor as harry walked back and fourth in his empty dormitory he had to get the news out about who exactly was taking people and why swallowing the saliva that had formed a lump in his throat he sighed and ran a hand through his black hair he could be extremely dense at times and when it came to school work he was no genius either without hermione and his time turner none of his work would have gotten done so far this year the point was though he wasn t by any means stupid harry knew when it was time to take a step back and get help even if you didntwant to have anything to do the person that you needed to help you kneeling down beside his bed and harry whispered please dear god give me the strength to keep going he had never been a religious person because the dursleys had never taken him to church they thought he would stain the purity of it as he learned later on since many people believed that magic was satanic like mentioned before though harry knew when he needed help and when he couldntdo something alone it was a feeling that had accumulated inside of his mind just this year he needed someone to help him and if he was blessed at birth with magic then maybe the one person that truly gave him that gift could show him how to use it or at least give him a hint as to what he had to do smiling bitterly to himself as he got up and sat on his bed harry realized something he did indeed believe in heaven and hell and he also knew that if you committed sins you would go to hell when you died one of the biggest sins was killing and he had to do that in order to save the world looking out his window at the clear blue sky he muttered you ve sure dealt out the cards in an interesting way this time suddenly griffy jumped on his bed and stared at him curiously the little griffin had taken to sleeping majority of the time now and hagrid explained it was because griffin usually hibernated the griffin swatted at the hem of his robes and harry looked at him emerald met emerald as their identical eyes met and harry said i know what you re thinking and you re right it time i went to dumbledore i ve tried turning everywhere but to him and i know he the one that can get the message around about the prince griffy growled lightly and seemed to smirk and nod if that was possible he then walked up to harry pillow walked around in circles for a few seconds then laid down and fell into a light slumber sighing to himself again harry stood up one of griffy eyes opened a little and he watched his owner leave the room harry knew it was time to face the music professor dumbledore sat at his desk reading through documents his pale blue eyes held no twinkle and he looked more ancient then he actually was even though he had lived for over a century already there was a sudden knock on his oak door and without looking up he said come in the person pushed the door open and walked in he seemed to pause for a minute before saying professor dumbledore looked up with light surprise to see harry standing in front of him ever since last year he and the young man hadntreally gotten along that didntmean he cared any less about him no in fact harry was still the grandson he never had at least in his eyes to whom do i owe for this surprise visit harry the old man asked harry chuckled lightly then his eyes turned dark and he said no one sir i have a favour to ask of you and in return i going to give you vital information hermione and i found dumbledore expression turned into one that someone who was doing business wore he had a serious face of a veteran who had been in one too many wars yet his eyes held the eagerness in his eyes was that of a five year old i will tell you everything as long as you tell the rest of the staff harry said slowly as if he thought dumbledore needed a hearing aid and make sure the rest of the school is informed as well that mr potter i can and will do without hesitation dumbledore said alright then the young man said he took a seat across from dumbledore closed his eyes took a deep breath then said we found who who attacking students how and why dumbledore sat straight up and his bushy white eyebrows seemed to fuse together where did you learn all this in a book i have harry said one on family history sir are you familiar with the legend of the half blood prince of course i am dumbledore said briskly he was the first ever half blood and he was punished greatly for that it reminds me so much of what happened to jesus christ he sighed sadly although it was because of his death that this school opened the founders were friends with his only son and they wanted to make a place where all types of blood could learn together without a repeat of what happened to the prince do you know what his ritual was harry asked yes when a half blood would appear in his bloodline once again he would gain the power to rise again is it too bold to ask as to why this is relevant though do you know the name of the half blood prince harry said extremely slowly no dumbledore admitted after a moment of digging around in his memory for the answer his name was vulcan potter the boy who lived said simply harry then started into everything he and hermione had figured out he told him the part about the dream but he left out the fact that he had been having dreams all this year the expressions and emotions on the old man face had morphed many times during harry story and once he was done it sat in a look that was crossed between dread and thoughtful vulcan doesntneed his prisoners dead then dumbledore said slowly if he did he would be in a terrible position because the prophecy counteracts his ritual sir harry asked with a slight look of shock on his face i have studied the ritual myself out of curiosity dumbledore said because voldemort does not know the full prophecy neither does vulcan according to the ritual his half blood descendent needs to be sacrificed by him once he returns in a physical form this counteracts with the prophecy which says that either you need to defeat voldemort or he needs to defeat you any threat on your life before the final battle that doesntcome from voldemort is something to laugh about they cannot kill you even if they stabbed you in the heart fate has a way of twisting things around after voldemort is gone you can die like anybody else but until then you can only fall at his hands so the prince choose a poor time to come back harry said slowly he also thought you mean if i defeat voldemort harry i am very impressed you were able to handle everything that has been put in front of you so far this year not many people could and i could guarantee you that at your age neither could i dumbledore said with a very light smile on another topic how is your time turner suiting you sticking to all the rules harry remembered that one incident where nicola seen both him and his past self or whatever he was aside from that he almost had one accident where he had almost seen himself he went back in time to get more sleep luckily he heard his other self enter the room and he hid underneath the bed until he fell asleep then ran out to join his friend for lunch yes sir he said then stood up i have to be going i just wanted to inform you of what happening very well but first i think you ll find this copy of the daily prophet most amusing dumbledore said handing his favourite student the paper good day harry waited until he was out of dumbledore office to read it his eyes grew wide and he burst out laughing there was a huge picture of fudge running away from the ministry of magic looking a mess also some people were chasing him many enchanting vegetables to follow him until they hit him his eyes scanned over it and let an amused smirk pass over his normally serious face letting out a loud laugh he ran back towards the common room with the paper waving around in his hand ron and hermione looked up with slight surprise as harry burst through the door they were even more surprised to see that he was honestly really amused slapping the paper down between them on the table he said fudge got sacked a few people around him stared and started muttering stuff he did ron said and grabbed the paper before hermione could even lift up her hand to grab it he quickly skimmed it over and a large smile appeared over his face and he let out a great whoop what the hell lavender asked as she climbed in through the portrait hole just to hear her boyfriend act like a moron my dad got promoted to head of magical law enforcement ron yelled happily he did ginny asked her head shooting around from her conversation with halle and tessa but i thought that madam bones had that position she did ron said his eyes scanning the article but she been promoted to minister or is it ministress of magic i didntread that part harry said with a slight bit of surprise but a smile adorned his face she ll be a good leader for now she fair and listens to everyone hermione nodded in approval and said she is i met her over the summer before i moved to privet drive when i went to change some of my money at gringotts she knew who i was surprisingly hermione harry said dully told you once and i ll tell you a million times you and ron are famous too we are ron asked with a perplexed tone of course you are lavender piped up you re known for being the best friends of harry potter and the ones that get him through everything damn straight they re the reason i get through everything harry muttered a slight frown had appeared over ron face at the first part of the statement but by the end he was smiling widely he knew all along that harry couldnthave gotten though it all without hermione and him but he could never remember him admitting it he might have but ron didntrecall it suddenly a loud crack was heard and everyone that was in the common room turned around looking for the source of the sound everyone that was in their dormitories came down looking confused and surprised would all students please report to the great hall immediately professor mcgonagall distressed yet firm voice echoed around the halls they re going to tell everyone harry whispered to hermione she got a serious look on her face and gripped his hand tightly as they entered the flow of gryffindors heading down to the great hall professor mcgonagall looked around nervously as the students poured into the great hall and headed to their house tables she knew that all the slytherins that were in the school that year were safe from this half blood prince but all the other houses had a mix of the three types of blood it was only when all the students settled in that she noticed how much the number of them had decreased also the mood had changed people were nervous and everyone was shifty almost everyone in the great hall was nervous that is a few slytherins seemed as if they were expecting this hearing a light growl to her right she looked over and saw professor evelyn there looking livid as she looked at the sea of students that was slowly evaporating in front of their eyes are you alright clara she asked lightly perfectly fine evelyn snapped i on edge that all it hard to believe this is happening in hogwarts it just messes up everything i agree professor flitwick said in his small voice that matched his body height he who must not be named is becoming stronger each day and now we are told it not him who is taking our children evelyn nodded and her emerald eyes got a sad glazed look over them as she turned her vision towards the gryffindors are we sure he right we have no choice but to trust him clara professor dumbledore said suddenly he deserves it evelyn looked at his for a minute before turning away and saying i just saying that sometimes students will do anything or attention albus you know that yes i do know dumbledore agreed with her whole heartedly but harry is not one of the attention seekers that true mcgonagall said he stays quiet in class unless he answering a question asking for help or there something important he believes he has to point out evelyn simply shrugged and watched as dumbledore stood up and everyone went silent she had always admired his ability to silence the entire school without saying anything while she had to shoot firecrackers off in some of her classes just to get them to shut up students i have many things to discuss with you first and foremost i would like to mention that we have a different minister as of now and she is here with us today i d like you to give a welcome to madam bones he waved to the woman at his left that mcgonagall and everyone else to her right hadntnoticed the students clapped politely and then went back to listening to dumbledore as you ve noticed our numbers have greatly decreased this year not only have parents been taking their children out of hogwarts but many have gone missing all of you have wanted answers and suggestions as to who might be next and much to our luck two of our students have found what you seek he looked around noticing everybody seem to hold their breath we have identified that the creatures doing the actual attacks are a type of demons wolves that are made of a rare shadow element the one that created these creatures and controls them is known as the half blood prince he was the first ever half blood and was tortured to death in front of his entire city including his wife and only child he created a ritual that would allow him to return only when one of his descendents was a half blood and there was a half blood with a heart of pure evil alive at the time both those elements he needed have come into life and as of now he has come back in spirit people all around the hall broke out in whispered some of the slytherins looked like this news wasntnew to them which proved professor snape theory about many of them being informed by their parents about death eater activities in order to return to full life dumbledore continued part of the ritual was he needed many new half bloods as he called them and the easiest way to identify them is when they are at school as many of you have guessed the victims are indeed all half bloods and there are not many of them left in our school people looked at each other from where they sat many looked relieved but now a few others looked absolutely terrified it was obvious from the lack of students in the school now that there were very few half bloods left most of the remaining students were purebloods and muggle borns which wasnta good combination and everybody knew it one thought seem to hit everybody in the hall at the same time and it seemed as if they all turned to the gryffindor table it wasntalways easy to tell who was what kind of blood unless a person was famous and had famous parents it just happened that harry was famous enough for that it was common knowledge that james potter was a pureblood and that lily potter was a muggle born this meant that harry potter was a half blood and that he was a target on the prince list although none of them aside from hermione would know that he was the descendent of the prince at least for now that is harry ran into his dormitory and slammed the door shut roughly he took a few deep breaths then turned around to see everybody in his and house staring at him he jumped slightly then said what the hell are you all doing here same thing you are lavender said darkly someone announced that there were only four half bloods left in the school seamus muttered you me lav and dean now nobody will leave us alone they re all trying to protect us wait harry said and looked over at dean i thought you were muggle born dean shook his head and said ever since i got my hogwarts letter and none of my brothers or sisters did my mum thinks that my dad was a wizard she doesntknow because he left when i was a year old this year i found out that he was a wizard evelyn told me apparently she knew him harry got an odd look on his face and it wasntbecause of dean rubbing his right arm wait a minute harry thought leaving his other thoughts behind right arm flashback what the hermione said to herself and pushed open the door much to her shock she saw him sitting in black shorts and a dark t shirt pretty much carving something into his arm luckily it wasnton the side with all his veins harry hermione screamed at him and slapped the piece of the mirror away it landed on the floor and shattered even more she then looked at harry face and noticed it had a blank look to it like he wasntthere harry she whisper shaking slightly when she noticed his eyes werentgreen anymore but pale blue i not harry he said but it sounded like someone was speaking with him i the one who will win it all in the end my mark will be left on the boy who lived forever hermione shivered then gasped as harry eyes turned green again and some type of magic shot away from his body he groaned and leaned forwards some fuck he yelled when he got control of his body back including the pain in his arm where the hell did this come from there was something controlling you hermione said and got up she ran to the bathroom and came back with a wet towel and put it on harry arm what happened harry asked i dontreally know hermione whispered well i know there was something possessing you he cut something into your arm and said his mark will be left on the boy who lived forever harry moved the towel from his arm and stared with surprise at the three words carved into his arm it said half blood prince end flashback now that he was thinking about it his right arm was starting to hurt badly he could feel the words carved into his arm throbbing he noticed that lavender and seamus seemed to be in pain too when he remembered something else flashback harry was lying on the grass in front of the lake with a bored look on his face hermione sat next to him with both their mystical eggs beside her a little closer to the lake sat seamus and lavender both who were rubbing their arms with a look of pain on their faces harry assumed that they accidentally elbowed each other parvati sat a little away from them and beside her sat both dean and neville end flashback our arms harry said suddenly what hermione asked and looked up at him from her place curled up beside him on his bed he got the idea from the dark marks i sure of it harry muttered under his breath it was a way of separating us from the rest what the bloody hell are you going on about ron asked bluntly in the summer he replied slowly something possessed me i didntremember it but i do remember blanking out hermione on the other hand was there and actually saw it my eyes turned blue and some weird thing was talking through me it was the half blood prince i sure of it now lavender dean seamus show me the outside of your right arms the three shot him odd looks but they rolled up their sleeves at the same time he did and everyone gasped on all their arms was an identical carving of half blood prince you were all targeted before hand hermione said this was planned before school started so that means they had time to get a spy into the school to keep track of all the targets that why there never any teacher around when an attack happens neville said you dontthink that evelyn the spy do you parvati asked after a moment saying what they were all thinking well she is the new teacher lavender said hesitantly i dontthink so hermione said after a minute of thinking i think it malfoy that giving information malfoy all the others asked at once well he hasntbeen bugging us at all lately since before christmas hermione said obviously something else is going on with him so that means that he has no time to deal with us you know that makes sense seamus said something doesntsmell right around here ron said and it not snape greasy hair i know harry agreed it going to get worse and all of know it so the teachers know neville said the rest of the students in the school know parvati added that doesntmean we re less likely to be attacked lavender said the things that take the people those demon wolves they re made of shadow meaning they can probably get through walls and stuff what does that have to do with anything ron asked her it means they can attack without a seconds notice hermione explained whatever their target is doesntstand a chance even if they re with a group of a thousand people they all fell into an uncomfortable silence not one of the eight people in the room noticed a small wolf made of shadows staring at them from atop a wardrobe staring at the carvings in four of their arms it licked it lips growled a bit and vanished into the wall griffy head shot up and his eyes narrowed at the sound of the growl all the other animals which were asleep in a corner in the room woke up as well although once again the talking students didntnotice the eight animals staring up the spot where the wolf had been harry looked around the room feeling a little bit uncomfortable as he said the one thing he and the other three half bloods dreaded to hear the bottom line is if this prince wants us ge going to get us and there nothing anyone can do about it author random babbling alright here the deal i not going to write all the replies to everyone but i am mentioning everyone who did review if someone guessed something and i consider it a good hint to the story then i ll point it out to everyone ok if anyone has any questions that were not answered in that particular chapter i ll answer them as best as i can i want to thank everyone who did review you guys are awesome and i really appreciate it please review and give me your honest to god opinion but do me a favour and make it so i can understand it and if you re going to flame me make it mature sounding and i alright with it the only criticism i donttake good is when someone just sends a flame worth being flamed anyways here a couple of answers to questions dontworry you ll be able to understand what the question was by the answers no the figure that was in the staff room last chapter was not ron but the person is evil and it someone you have all met before this might give away a little bit but i will answer it anyways the reason the half blood prince wants to live again was to get revenge on not only the ones that were the cause of his death purebloods muggle borns but the other half bloods too because they didnthelp him at all no hermione is not going to be killed in this story at least i ll be blunt blood has everything to do with this story and bloodlines do in away elements well they re not that important hagrid lessons on them was just to set up for the fact that the half blood prince had an odd one and the animals were just added for fun more than anything at the beginning i know i had in my summary and things up there that harry could go out with either padma or ebony that year well that was sorta just to keep things open in case i wanted to make hermione jealous or something like that but cho did that good enough on her own if you notice i donthave the hp em writing up there anymore this isntreally a question but i d like to point out that the half blood prince is vulcan potter an ancestor of harry s not any current children in the school also vulcan is indeed everything he says he is so someone noticed it finally every outing something bad happens this is more of a hint then an answer to a question so keep it in mind anyways thank you to all my great reviews doc tanalike destined enchantress hhhrshipper17 hpfanchrissy1502 lady shilver ginny cry silver gold

more on the aa side couples hp hg dt lb pp sf ll nl dt gw lb rw ll rw hp cc summary as harry and his friends enter their sixth year at hogwarts they dontenter the cheerful world they left behind they enter a world covered in a thick blanket of fear it only hits harry how important he really is when people start seeing him as the light that allows them to see under this blanket along with his friend he must battle the horrors of the past present and possible the future to begin the end of the war hopefully before it hits hogwarts what happens when people start disappearing from under dumbledore protection and one of the famous trio disappears it up to the last two plus some more friends to find a way to save all the people that disappeared because they cantfight this war on their own warning dark themes will be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound yesterday ff n messed up my story some now it auto fixed it but my titles to those chapters are gone and i cantmake them stay without messing it up again otherwise nice eh lol life is a challenge and only those who live up to the challenge can really know what it means to live unknown what do we do now lavender asked with a slight note of hysteria in her voice i dontknow we re kinda trapped seamus replied sarcastically both were obviously on edge as they continually looked around the corner shut up would you harry growled at them from across the hall there was a thin line of blood running down from his forehead and he looked extremely pissed off you guys there something coming dean muttered and backed up a little bit shit harry muttered suddenly he remembered he had heard something when they had ran into this dead end i know what we have to do come here quick the other three moved over to him and harry groaned as he woke up and looked around wildly he had felt something cold pass over his body which in turn yanked him out of his dream what the hell was that he muttered under his breath as he rolled over noticing that it was 6 30 in the morning sighing to himself he got up to get ready for classes that day when he got downstairs he saw a nervous looking hermione waiting for him the second she saw him she jumped up and threw herself on him woah what the hell mia he said wildly i was afraid you wouldntbe coming downstairs she muttered and she buried her head in the crook of his neck harry sighed and said i fine hermione what with you though you knew about this before dumbledore announced it yes but i thought there was something we could do to stop it she said you said there wasn t hey calm down we re all going to be fine we always are harry said confidently it occurred to him that he was trying to make himself believe that statement more then he was trying to make hermione beat it she calmed down slightly then said well come on let get to breakfast quickly so we re not in the hallways alone for along time with that she grabbed his arm and pretty much dragged him out of the door giving him very little time to grab his bag before being tugged away clara evelyn waited patiently for her class to show up she knew by now that the sixth year gryffindors would be the first to show up and they d all be together it was a ritual she had become familiar with over the course of the year looking back at her schedule from the first day of classes she chuckled slightly something inside of her mind had told her they wouldntbe following everything like she had planned actually today they werentdoing anything that was on it they were going to do something else looking up quickly as the door open she saw the gryffindors walk in and grab their normal seats which were all up at the front she smiled lightly at them and waited for the rest of the class to appear as they did she noticed with a look of pain that there was a few missing students in this class well sixth years she started i know we ve been off the schedule i made for us at the first of the year so for now on i just throwing that to wind you will never know what we re doing in class we could be studying a magical creature looking at curses looking at transfiguration in defence duelling or many other things today we ll be doing one of those other things the class seemed excited and nearly everyone leaned over their desks a little bit to get closer to her put all your wands quills and books away she said i going to be telling more or less stories for now everyone did and stared at her with interest now this might seem a bit off my subject but are prophecies real evelyn asked this question struck harry as odd and he almost didnthear neville answer yes that right she said prophecies are kept in the department of mysteries in the ministry of magic the only people that know them are the ones that it told to majority of the time the person that says it cantremember saying it now sometimes other people hear the prophecy and they re not meant to that does not mean they forget it she quickly got up from her desk strolled over to the chalk bored and magicked a picture onto it of a sphere this is what prophecies are held in and the only way to hear them once they re in that is to shatter the orb actually no that not true that only one way to hear it the second way is to go to the person who it was originally told to she started pacing back and fourth after a moment of silence she said have any of you ever heard a prophecy before everyone went silent and a few people glanced over at harry curiously they expected him to know because not only had he been in the department of mysteries last year but everything always seemed to happen to him harry narrowed his eyes and said what does that have to do with defence well she started dontanswer that he said dully you know there no answer or at least not a good one unless you plan on telling us all a lie everyone stared at him in pure shock he had never talked back to professor evelyn yet this year but it was almost as if he was talking to umbridge again evelyn emerald eyes flashed angrily and she said get out fine by me harry said i ll just take a trip up to dumbledore office and see if he can answer what prophecies have to do with this class sure they may tell us how to win a war or something like that but it doesnthelp us defend ourselves he attempted to get up and leave when a flash of panic went across evelyn face she pretty much flew across the room and in front of the door never mind potter just stay here and shut up he got a small smirk of triumph on his face and he learned back crossing his arms over his chest as he continued listening to his teacher go on that them someone whispered in the hall there are only four of them left someone else whispered why are patil weasley and granger staying around them someone else said arentthey in danger of being attacked i think so yet another person said we can hear you harry said loudly causing people to stare at him with alarmed looks so if you re going to attempt to talk behind one of our backs then make sure that one we re not in the area and two you re not pretty much yelling it out the four that had been talking turned red in the face and they took off in the other direction he couldnthelp but chuckle at their frightened faces that was so mean hermione said i know but i a mean person he insisted no you re not she said back right sorry you re the mean one he said oh shut up she smacked his arm as they walked to transfiguration when they got there professor mcgonagall had a worried look on her face and she looked like she was about to cry the second she saw harry and it got worse as lavender seamus and dean walked into the room she stood up and said we re working on changing those pencils in front of you into physical shields because this is something you might have to use when defending yourself we ll be using different objects but start with the pencils this spell is more convenient then any of the other ones we ve ever done because there no fancy wand waving or anything just point your wand at it and said sheilius it does take a bit of energy but as you get used to it you ll never notice it now go everyone set to work on the first shot hermione got it and was awarded 10 points it took harry a few times to get it but ron said there were probably too many things on his mind his red headed friend had got it the try before him before they got up to leave she said now i know at the first of the year i said i d be making animagi out of some of you this year has been mostly to see who is ready who isn t and who is capable of it you ll find out sometime if you are or if you arentand if you do get a letter from me do not tell anybody else understand everyone nodded alright now you can go to lunch they had a great time in that class but after lunch they had to go to potions which harry still dreaded more then anything the second snape marched in harry felt a bitter feeling of dislike run through his veins he didnteven have to look at snape to know when he was around anymore today we ll be working on a project with the partner i assign you he said icily this is not part of the sixth or seventh year curriculum but the headmaster insists it necessary i will put you into pairs and you will make a potion from scratch in hagrid or evelyn class everyone would have burst into whispers already but you did not do that with severus snape it just wasntdone the same could be said for good old minerva mcgonagall i will explain after you get into your partners snape said with a slight hiss to his voice macdougal and bulstrode boot and finch fletchy goldstein and zabini granger and patil bones and moon nott and macmillan and finally malfoy and potter harry mouth fell open as did malfoy and the two looked at each other for less then a second this time malfoy moved when snape told them to he stared at harry darkly and he returned the look neither one had so much as looked at each other recently let alone talked so this would prove to be interesting at least most people thought that i dontplan on failing because of you potter malfoy spat that what ebony said to me too harry growled and i didntfail her that comforting malfoy muttered what that supposed to mean he said slowly i know she a traitor she been giving information to you guys for along time now the blonde said you never told harry asked cautiously yet dangerously i a lot of things potter draco said after a moment of thought but i am not a rat especially not like pettigrew that was the last harry said to him outside of trying to figure out what to do for a potion this will prove to be interesting no doubt harry thought as the bell rang hermione yawned slightly as she leaned over her transfiguration homework glancing up from time to time she was glad to see that harry was at least trying to work but had to frown at the fact that ron and lavender didntknow what a pda was harry had his books pushed up in front of him in a pile and had his head leaning on the palm of his hand he knew hermione would kill him if she saw that he wasntstudying like it seemed after a few months of good rest and lack of dreams harry had suddenly started feeling extremely tired again he would use his time turner more often now to get some more sleep his scar was constantly throbbing heavily suddenly a sharp pain shot through his head he let out a groan of pain and lurched forwards knocking his books to the ground and startling ron and lavender causing them to break apart his hands flew up to his forehead and he started shaking in pain closing his eyes tightly he fell backwards onto the couch the last thing he heard was hermione calling his name vvvvvv harry dream vvvvvv he was watching a shadowy figure pace back and forth tapping his long fingers together he seemed to be waiting for something suddenly there was a hissing sound and a large snake slithered into the room ahh nagani did you bring me any information on the location of pettigrew the man said it only took harry a minute to realize he was seeing through voldemort eyes he could also tell that snake man didntknow he was there he understood the snake as it said no which made him wonder what the rat was doing who cares about that rat now the shadowy figure said there only four of them left lets get them while we can i admire you vulcan potter but you are brash like the rest of your family was voldemort said the smarter thing to do would have been to grab these four at the beginning of the year but my longing to see your descendent suffer clouded over my good judgement the remaining four are potter and three of his closer friends meaning they will be well protected vulcan muttered something and walked into the light he looked just like he did in the picture except he wasntcoloured just several shades of grey and he was transparent and floating dontworry potter voldemort said i am well aware that you need my magical abilities to come back to life as i need your abilities for creating spells and rituals that is something i not willing to sacrifice good vulcan replied i wouldntwant you forgetting your part of the bargain voldemort i wouldntdream of it voldemort hissed but there was something in his voice that harry didnttrust and make him think that vulcan was incredibly stupid for believing the dark man but i believe we can snag two of the remaining four now an evil smirk of glee came upon the prince face and he said excellent vvvvvv end dreams vvvvvv harry shot up into a sitting position sweating heavily he felt sheer panic rise in his stomach as he tried to say something but he couldntget anything out harry are you ok hermione asked say something please come on mate ron encouraged him as well his green eyes snapped towards lavender who obviously noticed that with nervousness and surprise because she took a step back he jumped up and ran towards the portrait while asking where are seamus and dean they just went down to the kitchen why hermione asked as she kept up with him followed by their other two friends they re going to be attacked harry panted out as he ran down the stairs taking them by twos and threes wait his girlfriend yelled suddenly and for good reason harry just ran on the magical stair but he was running so fast his leg didntsink through he was just thrown forwards and took a very painful tumble down the stone steps onto the landing below are you alright she asked and ran to his side at full tilt harry nodded wincing in pain and said we re not going to get there on time i can feel it in my gut it ok calm down maybe it was just a dream hermione said but she didntbelieve that at all we can still get to them in time you know ron said suddenly harry nodded and he stood up helping hermione to her feet then taking off towards the kitchens once again dean seamus lavender yelled out seeing their two friends walk in front of them hey guys what wrong dean asked obviously be careful harry said and fell to his knees the pain from his scar and falling down three sets of stairs now finally built up are you alright mate seamus asked i fine but you wontbe harry said what dean questioned with a perplexed look he coming he replied i saw it he coming for you two he could be coming for lav or y seamus didntget to finish off his sentence because a hand shot out of the wall and grabbed him around the neck seamus lavender screamed and attempted to get closer to help him no ron said and grabbed her holding her back harry got up and shot towards his friend only to make that effort to go in vain seamus was pulled through the wall when he was some of his blood splattered onto the floor obviously the blood that was left behind was vulcan trademark the only living potter at the time ended up crashing into the wall then stumbling backwards onto the floor hermione rushed to his side and screamed as the half blood prince spirit came through the wall harry got up and grabbed a hold of her in an attempt to protect her even though she wasntin danger vulcan looked around the room and said i could grab you all now go to hell vulcan harry muttered causing his ancestor to look over quickly at him his pale blue eyes bore into harry emerald green ones painfully hermione moved between the two slightly mudblood or not you re no threat to me the prince said and threw himself towards the two suddenly he was stopped and rebounded backwards everyone stared in confusion then the female ghost appeared harry knew right away that she was the one protecting him all along and the antagonist had been vulcan he right you know you should just go back to hell where you belong the ghost snapped that coming from a girl who died 15 years ago vulcan said sarcastically slowly edging towards dean without anybody noticing when you were only a baby she growled angrily then gasped as the prince threw himself and dean crashing into him before he could even scream and pushing him through the wall once again his blood splattered on the floor no lavender screamed and started crying falling into ron arms for comfort the ghost stared in shock and said oh dear sweet i didntknow i sorry harry looked up at her while comforting hermione then something hit him vvvvvv flash vvvvvv harry sweet heart you are the good child in this family lily said with a giggle looking over at the play pen beside the chair james had been in her face turned into a slight frown as much as she hated to admit it lily preferred one of her children over the other she had a soft spot for harry but for her vvvvvv flash vvvvvv james looked on the floor and saw a rat run into the living room and to the play pen then his old friend peter pettigrew appeared out of nowhere he reached into the pen and pulled out a baby girl that looked older then harry put her down james yelled give us the boy potter voldemort hissed no lily screamed kill her voldemort said and peter pulled out a knife and stabbed it into the baby chest vvvvvvvvvv flash vvvvvvvv remus did i have a sister harry repeated the question he asked last night remus sighed again and said yes you did harry her name was gemma aileen evans evans why not potter why didntmom like her that much what happened to her woah slow down there she was an evans because james potter wasnther father remus said darkly she looked just like her dad too which is why lily didntlike her that much you see lily didntmean to have gemma gemma father was a man named parker beaumont a known death eater a known death eater well why did my mom go with him wasntshe with my dad at the time that the thing harry she was no no lily would never cheat on james you see this bastard of a person well he raped her that why she couldntreally look at gemma without wincing james helped her and tried to take care of the child as if it was his own but he just couldntreally do it she was taken care of good though mind you that night when your parents died gemma was killed by being stabbed through the heart vvvvv flash vvvvv harry looked at her and he noted like he did along time ago in summer that she was not white meaning she wasnta normal ghost she had strawberry blond hair and dark brown eyes gemma he asked hesitantly she had been looking away from him and had turned around quickly enough to startle hermione greatly slowly the look of shock disappeared from her face and she said yeah i gemma evans harry felt his throat go dry and his eyes water up i i sorry he didntknow why that was the first thing he said but he knew it was necessary why gemma asked confusedly it took harry a few minutes to realize the answer before he said mum liked well she seemed to prefer me more and it didntseem fair it alright she said sadly i got to know them technically i grew up with them you didntso i the one that should say i sorry to you harry held in the tears that threatened to fall as he asked how come you re colored i not a normal ghost she said briskly getting her mind of the sad subject from before i your guardian once my job is done i ll return back to where i came from and only come back when i needed most harry nodded weakly unable to say anymore hermione ron and lavender were all in too much shock to say anything else dumbledore coming but i ve got to get going remember dontgive up faith or hope just yet also be careful there is a dangerous person here gemma said before vanishing into thin air goodness mcgonagall voice rang out as she dumbledore snape and evelyn walked around the corner what happened evelyn asked sharply they re gone was all hermione got out before fainting back into harry arms woah he muttered and picked her up who gone dumbledore asked worriedly seamus and dean ron said there only harry and i left lavender said heavily her voice echoing in the empty hallway author babbling well actually i not sure what i going to do just reply to questions or all reviews for this chapter i replying to all

potter and the half blood prince by krystal lily potter chapter twenty eight and then there was one rating pg 13 more on the aa side couples hp hg dt lb pp sf ll nl dt gw lb rw ll rw hp cc summary as harry and his friends enter their sixth year at hogwarts they dontenter the cheerful world they left behind they enter a world covered in a thick blanket of fear it only hits harry how important he really is when people start seeing him as the light that allows them to see under this blanket along with his friend he must battle the horrors of the past present and possible the future to begin the end of the war hopefully before it hits hogwarts what happens when people start disappearing from under dumbledore protection and one of the famous trio disappears it up to the last two plus some more friends to find a way to save all the people that disappeared because they cantfight this war on their own warning dark themes will be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound thought i d mention that aside from the author notes and things like that when you see italics it either harry having a dream or somebody remembering something also we re getting down to the bottom line here and i know the last chapters have been short and this one probably will be too because i have to set the scene for the big events that are happening really soon if you ve noticed i starting to tie all the lose ends together but for every one i tie in to the end of the story i probably going to leave two things that happened untied so it a 1 2 ratio of what you ll find out at the end of this and here a hint the prophecy is only mentioned a little bit and it not important right here i know jkr said book six was really just like half of book seven split up but i not doing it like that i used to find myself longing and waiting for the future to come now i long and wait for the past to return unknown looking around curiously harry muttered to himself this isntthat bloody castle i know it not a female voice said and harry turned around to see his dead sister floating away from him i just assumed that you wouldntwant to talk there damn straight i don t he replied and yawned slightly why am i tired while in a dream you ve been exhausted lately gemma explained so that means that you ll feel it even when you re sleeping oh great he muttered and sat down on the ground so what up i know the other day things happened too fast to really keep track of she started after a minute it even seemed like a dream to me and i dead the dead dontdream harry asked suddenly i not really sure if we do then i cantremember it gemma said with a shrug harry sat down and she sat across from him they looked at each other for a few minutes before he asked why didntyou tell me before i couldn t she said right away you see oh how do i explain this well destiny has a way of controlling your every move if you re not supposed to do something you won t it a scary concept and it seems to get rid of the thought of free will doesntit harry stared at her before asking why is this happening i donthave all the answers harry she said it up to you to find out all the patterns and put them together i cantdo it for you and neither can anyone else he nodded and said cantyou just give me a suggestion at the first of the year i said something to myself while watch you hermione dean and seamus she said after a minute i said almost all the pieces are set only a few more and then let the games begin harry i said that when you were in hogsmead and found something important that cave harry whispered after a moment of trying to remember back to that day that cave with the weird growling sound in it yes the sound that sounded like a wolf gemma said stressing the word wolf wait a wolf as in vulcan wolves harry said glancing up from his hands to her for approval she just smiled and nodded after a moment of uncomfortable silence she said i think you should get some sleep as in not dream for awhile i ll try to keep vulcan out of your head for tonight you d think after voldemort refused to attempt to hack into your mind again he d get a hint gemma continued muttering to herself as harry sight of her blurred then everything went a peaceful black with swirling colours the next morning harry was in a great mood he had no dreams of blood dripping from walls no dreams about his friends being tortured and he actually got some sleep even though he knew he would never really meet his sister he loved her all the same for doing all this for him having a happy harry a round was contagious because he was in a good mood so was hermione and because they were both happy at the moment ron didntneed to be there for any dead serious talks so he could be with lavender more this seemed slightly odd to most people they all thought harry and lavender would be extremely nervous and on edge about being the only two half bloods left in the school when mark got the courage to voice this to his cousin harry simply said what the point dreading something that we cantchange no matter what being on edge isntgoing to make us any safer so we might as well live each day as it was our last lately he noticed lavender little sister ashleigh attempting to hang around mark more and he would always chuckle and tell the older girl i think you re little sister likes my brother she going to be a player lavender said liking almost every male human possible currently in the common room ron and lavender were in there alone desperately trying to finish the last of their homework which was due that day in about an hour they decided to skip breakfast to finish it this is all you re fault you know she said with a smile playing at her lips we could have gotten this done last night with hermione and harry i didntwant to work last night ron muttered where are hermione and harry anyways i dontknow and really i dontthink i want to know lavender replied after thinking about it for a minute but i ll probably ask hermione later anyways you girls are weird ron said a little louder then he meant to you say you dontwant to do or know something but you do it anyway it because we can get away with it she said seriously can you picture a room full of little chattering boys gossiping about girls you d never believe what we used to talk about he insisted ohhhh do tell lavender said and put her quill down leaning forward a bit well ron started but the bell cut off his speech shooting the other a panicked look the two both took off to their first class winter had passed and spring was finally here meaning they got easter break although nobody got to relax like they wished they could have once the warmth of spring arrived all the students knew that meant that exams were coming up soon hermione already made coloured coded schedules for herself and harry to follow harry was glad they werentdoing their owls this year otherwise he probably crack with great sarcasm he mentioned how he couldntwait to take his newts on top of all of that the last match quidditch match of the year was approaching dumbledore decided to have it earlier rather than wait for the end of the year like usual in an attempt to get everyone minds off of the approaching doom that was sure to come the match was gryffindor against ravenclaw when harry commented for the hufflepuff ravenclaw game it proved that he really didntwant ravenclaw to win so that broke the team a little bit but they were still such a good team that they managed to get into the finals once again because of their brutal win over slytherin this match interested more people than the gryffindor vs slytherin one at the first of the year had katie had the gryffindors working like slaves harry didnteven have time for asleep anymore when he used his time turner instead he used it to keep up with his homework this is just like last year ron said as he got dressed in the changing rooms the day of the match no it not harry replied sure it gryffindor against ravenclaw again but we have two different chasers two awesome new beaters our senior chaser our excellent keeper and me the red head chuckled a little and said bless my sister and all but i think you re a better seeker than she was she a better chaser harry shrugged and looked outside the weather was brutal for this time of year usually for the last match it was sunny but not today instead it was pouring rain and he could hear thunder in the distance the wind pounded against him the moment he stuck his head a little ways outside wow tessa said as she walked up to him and also glanced out over his shoulder this is going to be interesting no doubt katie agreed as she approached them alright team once again i donthave a big speech like wood did but please just win if we do in this weather i ll be beyond happy oliver and angelina are also in the stands watching as well as fred george and alicia let show them what we ve got harry ron tessa halle shayn and scott all whooped at the same time and they followed her out onto the pitch the second the door opened of the school started cheering the hufflepuffs were all for the gryffindors after harry showing them so much support even though they had ran them into the ground at the hufflepuff gryffindor game slytherin on the other hand supported ravenclaw they didntlike them much but in the snake eyes the eagles were better than the lions welcome to the quidditch finals everyone justin finch fletchley yelled into the magical microphone he had offered to take dean place for this match as announcer this year it once again gryffindor verses ravenclaw everyone cheered as loud as they could harry couldntsee them yet but he knew that sitting with justin was probably hannah ernie susan hermione lavender parvati luna neville and padma luna and padma were spilt between who to cheer for so they decided just to cheer for both for ravenclaw we have boot rain harlan jensen allain chamberlain and chang all the ravenclaws and even the slytherins cheered as the ravenclaws all waved to the crowd and for gryffindor we have bell morgan norton berry levison weasley and potter the gryffindor and hufflepuff in determination to out scream the other spectators yelled as loud as possible which was pretty good because there was more slytherins than any other houses in the school now because they were all purebloods now i want a nice clean game madam hooch said loudly captain shake hands katie and terry boot shook hands but they didntlook like they were going to kill each other like katie and montague had mount your brooms she said and everyone did she took out the quaffle and tucked it in her arm then she let out the other balls there goes the bludgers justin echoed around the stadium they re followed by the golden snitch remember everyone that the snitch is worth 150 points which usually decides the winner of the game kick off hooch said and they all flew into the air on my whistle then all the chasers seem to tense up at this statement harry glanced at cho who was flying opposite of him and noticed she was shooting him a glare but she was also giving off nervous vibes the whistle blew the same time hooch dropped the quaffle between the two teams katie being the most experienced chaser there grabbed it quickly and started flying towards hufflepuff harry set to work attempting to find the snitch he noticed that his fellow seeker was following him from a distance he flew around the gryffindor goal posts and shot ron and encouraging look he gave one in return and harry noticed he looked a hell of a lot more confident than he had last year bell throws the quaffle to berry who throws it to morgan she shoots she scores 10 0 gryffindor half the stadium booed and half the stadium cheered harry glanced over at the teacher and visitor box which was full to the maximum capacity he saw hermione and waved at her he also noted that just like the first game of the year oliver alicia angelina lee all the weasleys were there cheering the lions on looking to his right quickly he managed to dive just before a bludger almost took off his head justin actually didntseem to be having an easy time yelling out the results of the game and keeping an eye on everyone so the reinforcements came in hey everyone remember me lee jordan yelled into the microphone as he took justin place i back for one last round let go guys one of the ravenclaw chasers had got the quaffle and threw it roughly towards the gryffindor goal posts luckily ron smacked it with his broom just in time sending it back although it did smash into the guy face painfully it wasntcounted as a fowl because ron didntgave control of where the ball went this match was proving to be more interesting and intense than the gryffindor slytherin match was that was defiantly a shock to everyone wow that was a nice hit from beater levison fred george i think you two have gotten perfect predecessors lee yelled excitedly as scott smashed one of the bludgers away the game was getting vicious now one of the ravenclaws rammed tessa into the ground she was a true trooper though and got back on her feet within minutes and with a vengeance also one of the ravenclaw beaters hit one of the bludgers directly at ron who had to move out of the way and smacked his head on one of the golden hoops he was protecting allowing the quaffle to enter it at the same time harry was frantically looking for the snitch now he saw that everyone was getting roughed up more than they should have been katie was thrown off her broom and landed on the ground lee nearly had a heart attack while yelling insults at cho who had deliberately pushed her off you stupid wh jordan there are children here mcgonagall yelled at him although she looked highly angry as well katie then called a time out and all the gryffindors flew down to her ok guys this is getting insane she said wheezing a little bit harry i know we usually say go at your own pace and all that nice stuff but for the love of god get that snitch as fast as you can argh i think i broke a rib maybe you should go to the hospital wing halle suggested and miss my last game to hell with that katie shot back well let make this one hell of a good last game ron said i ll block as much as i can we ll beat the other team until they re black and blue shayn and scott chorused together sounding a lot like fred and george we ll score as many goals as possible tessa agreed i ll catch that snitch or die trying harry said remembering wood words from his third year when he got his firebolt about catching the snitch or dying there were tears in katie eyes and she said you guys are the best let do it the team flew back into the air and the game was on again before the time out the gryffindors had been going easy but they were trying their hardest now to win even if it meant breaking a few rules ouch morgan hits boot and he nearly out of the sky boot gets a penalty shot mess up lee yelled out jordan i warning you mcgonagall said with all due respect ma am lee said to her in a calm voice there not much you can do i not a student here anymore mcgonagall lips twitched into the smile for a minute before going into its normal thin line unfortunately terry didntmiss ron cursed loudly and professor mcgonagall yelled at him from the stands the game was now 100 100 harry knew the points werentgoing to change much so he was trying to find the snitch furiously suddenly he saw it it was right beside the wall he knew he could get it but he would end up injuring himself somehow deciding it was all or nothing he flew as fast as he possibly could he was thankful that his broom was faster than cho because she was an excellent flyer although he would never admit that to her he removed his hands from his broom and held his right arm out cho stopped flying when she realized his was heading to the wall at an alarming speed harry suddenly turned within a second then flew up into the air holding his hand up with one hell of a move harry potter catches the snitch the final score is 250 100 gryffindor gryffindor wins the cup lee yelled half the stadium burst into whoops and applause the other half groaned angrily and booed once all the team landed katie practically tackled harry she was sobbing loudly but there was a huge smile on her face as she screamed we won dumbledore strode over and handed the team the cup once again katie stared at it then passed it over to harry harry also looked at it again then held it half out to her she smiled and they both held it up for everyone to see everything happened in a blur after that but the next thing he knew the whole team was pulled onto the shoulders of the gryffindors and they were in the common room with much talking and cheering you almost gave me a heart attack hermione said as she sat on his lap and gave him a hug that was the whole point he replied cheekily well i can see i loved she said sarcastically and attempted to get up but he held her down you know you re loved mia he said honestly across the room ron was telling his point of view of the match lavender was hanging off his every word as was a few other people he noticed that majority of the people listening to him were female and was very proud of himself nobody remembered that there was a terrible evil around them right then honestly nobody could have cared right now their spirits were high as were their moods later that night harry ron and neville all laid in their dormitory talking about the match seamus and dean would have loved to see it neville noted i know ron agreed he really didntwant to talk about anymore morbid right now so he desperately looked for another thing to talk about his eyes landed on harry and he automatically got his new topic so harry how are things with you and hermione just fine why harry asked as he glanced at his friend whenever hermione name was mentioned he seemed to become a little happier well i already knew the answer to it i just wanted to get a new topic ron said his eyes still sparkled with mirth though i have a different question though when did hermione start wearing lipstick what no dude dontworry i haventbeen checking your girl out the red head said with a shrug neville was laughing into his pillow now because he noticed what ron had too it just well you ve got a nice shade of pink on you and i hope to god you didntput it there purposely harry face flushed red and he wiped his mouth off then yanked the hangings around his bed so he was blocked from view and rolled over so his back was facing them is hermione a good kisser neville laughed out none of your business harry muffled voice called out once again and the two started laughing heavily morning hermione said happily as harry walked into the common room he gave her a large smiled and kissed her on the lips after a minute they parted and hermione said with laughter in her voice you re sure in a good mood damn straight i am he said and his smile grew even more he kept his arms around her waist and held closer to him get a room ron voice called out to the two of them they broke eye contact and looked directly at him both flushing red like you re won to talk ron hermione said after a moment unlike you we dontsnog on the couch in front of everyone yeah we do it out of the public eye harry said and threw an arm around her shoulder laughing as her face turned pink again ron to joined in with his laughter and they both could feel hermione mock glares digging into their skulls hermione lavender voice called out and she ran over to her friend i really need your help with something sure she replied then leaned up and gave harry a kiss on the cheer before following the other girl out of the room harry sat across from ron and the other boy asked a game of chess for old time sake now that neither of our girlfriends are here just was i was thinking harry agreed and ron summoned his chess set down it had been along time since the two of them had sat down and actually played their favourite game one thing hadntchanged though ron could still whip harry at wizard chess or just chess in general any day lavender sat looking at parvati padma and hermione nervously the other three girls looked like they had all been slapped in the face well she asked timidly not being able to stand the silence i dontknow lav padma said after a minute i mean it isntthat smart is it why not lavender demanded her tone was insulted you re a target of this prince lavender it just not the best thing to do parvati agreed with her sister hermione what do you think you d get what i mean right now she asked desperately do what your heart tells you to she said after a minute that the best advice i can give you she stared at her then said i know what my heart telling me to do do it then hermione insisted the four sat in uncomfortable silence you see they had been talking about problems lavender was having she had noticed how ron was starting to take more interesting in other girls lately and she was starting to feel a distance growing between them she had been thinking of dumping him and went to her three best friends to get their opinions lavender still wanted to be friends with ron so she knew she d have to break it off before it got bad and neither one of them wanted to talk to the other again i going to do it lavender said it doesntseem fair for me to keep going out with him just to say i have a boyfriend we can still be friends though right of course you guys could the other three said they all said it in different ways but they got the same message out i ll be back in a minute lavender said and started to walk down the hall when she just stopped what wrong padma called out do you hear that hear what that they all stood together and listened to what the other girl had heard it only took a few seconds for them to notice the deep panting sound what is that parvati asked in a terrified voice i dontknow hermione said her voice was shaking and her skin was getting pale from terror the panting turned into a low dangerous growl then it started getting louder and louder suddenly they all heard a set of paws running towards them whatever it was had long nails they could tell from the loud clicking sound that was approaching them there was a loud howl and a pair of blood red eyes looked at them from the dark corridor it sprang out at them quickly bearing its teeth hermione was the only one that got a chance to let out a shrill scream harry looked over as professor mcgonagall entered the room whenever she showed up you automatically knew it wasn t a good thing she looked around the room for a minute then her eyes landed on harry everyone watched curiously as she said in a low voice potter weasley you d better come with me the two shot each other confused looks but followed her out of the common room doors both could keep up with her easily what wrong ron asked her she led them into the hospital wing and she said i harry there was another attack both of them stared in shock and ron muttered lavender she gone mcgonagall said we have three eyewitnesses that saw a shadow wolf pull her away after attacking them both patils and miss granger are here they needed their injuries tended to she had barely finished when harry caught sight of his girlfriend and ran across the room to her side hermione are you alright her eyes opened and she said harry yeah it me he replied weakly and put a hand on her cheek it happened so fast we could have tried to stop it but we never got the chance tears were pouring down her cheeks like small waterfalls now it wasntyour fault there was nothing you could have done and you know it he wrapped his arms around her and leaned his chin on the top of her head both looked over at ron and harry said we ll get her back bud ron just shook his head and sat down on the empty bed beside hermione and put his head into his hands after a minute he looked up with an alarmed look in his eyes i just realized something he said nervously what his two friends as simultaneously there only one half blood left in

knew who it was all along well i ve gotta go see ya ll later krystal lily potter harry potter and the half blood prince by krystal lily potter chapter twenty nine when all is lost rating pg 13 more on the aa side couples hp hg pp sf ll nl dt gw lb rw summary as harry and his friends enter their sixth year at hogwarts they dontenter the cheerful world they left behind they enter a world covered in a thick blanket of fear it only hits harry how important he really is when people start seeing him as the light that allows them to see under this blanket along with his friend he must battle the horrors of the past present and possible the future to begin the end of the war hopefully before it hits hogwarts what happens when people start disappearing from under dumbledore protection and one of the famous trio disappears it up to the last two plus some more friends to find a way to save all the people that disappeared because they cantfight this war on their own warning dark themes will be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound note this chapter is short and choppy because i in a real hurry i promise i will make it up in the next chapter because that one planned out in detail this was just to get the final parts in place sorry for such crap and like i said i wrote this really fast and it late at night so i right out of it so there probably a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes when you step on the ledge of all the light you have left and you take that first step into the darkness of the unknown you might believe one of two things might happen there will be something solid for you to step upon or you will learn how to fly ron laid on his bed looking positively horrible he couldntbelieve lavender was gone sure he hadntbeen the nicest person to her lately taking more interest in other women then in her for awhile now honestly he was angrier at himself for taking advantage of a great woman well technically he didnttake advantage of her but in his mind he did something just as bad he neglected her when he knew she was in trouble you know ron said and glanced sideways at harry who was sitting on the bed beside his i think lavender was going to break up with me too it was just this look she had in her eyes for awhile now harry sighed and set down the book he was reading and looked over at ron his eyes looked tired behind his thin oval black rimmed glasses he had put on in place of his contacts that day i dontknow what to say ron i really don t you seemed less worried then i am the redhead said suddenly while rolling over and looking at the stone ceiling overhead and you re on this nutter list of people to kill actually you re the only one left thanks for making me remember harry replied sarcastically any time ron said with a smirk harry looked back at the array of books that were tossed around the room with amusement if you would have told him last year that he was going to spend most of his time either studying reading for information on some crazy ancestor oh his that wants to kill him and staying with hermione in the hospital wing constantly he have said you were insane well maybe except for the hermione part even when they werentgoing out he liked to be with her when she was hurt what are you looking for ron questioned as he looked at the many books tossed carelessly he had seen harry read through so much then throw it read through so much then throw it etc and it was really starting to annoy him now i want to know if the ritual can be stopped harry said after a moment of thought as he laid back i haventbeen able to find anything yet though he fell back onto his pillow and started fiddling with his mother pendent that was around his neck maybe it in the restricted section ron suggested you know i never thought about that harry said sitting up straight i think it time for my dad cloak to make a comeback along with the marauders map now you re talking ron said and sat up dontgive me that look i coming with you no matter what you say i wasntgoing to try and stop you the other boy said with a shrug as he started rummaging through his junk filled trunk he hissed and took his hand back watching a thin line of blood appear on it looking into it he saw the broken pieces of the mirror sirius gave him rolling his eyes he muttered now thing are getting repetitive what is the youngest male weasley asked curiously at grimmauld place this summer i cut myself on this mirror too he replied and picked all the pieces out after getting all of the parts he could find he took out his wand and muttered reparo surprising when it all repaired itself there wasnta piece missing he picked it up sighed and said if only i had actually looked in here setting the mirror down he grabbed the cloak and the map and said let go as harry and ron walked quietly through the hallways they heard the sound of voices getting closer to them accompanied by the footsteps of the person severus it going to be in the prophet tomorrow evelyn voice was heard there no way we wontbe able to stop panicking from happening all over the school the headmaster has more control over these students then you d like to think clara snape replied sharply maybe so but these are dangerous death eater that have escaped azkaban they re all on the loose she said angrily you know as well as i do that many students arentgoing to take kindly to this the students will listen to albus and be calm about it he shot back majority of the student population is either gone or are loyal to potter not albus she yelled and they both stopped walking right in front of where harry and ron were crouching down neither of the boys had seen evelyn look so mad before but both were sure they didntwant to see her angry again snape seemed to think for a minute then he said exactly how did you come to that conclusion it obvious if you sit and listen to it she said then turned around and continued walking down the corridor harry got an odd feeling of dejavu as he watched her pass by there was someone he was reminded strongly about when he looked at her at that moment in her anger although he could think of whom maybe we should go back to the common room and check the library tomorrow dumbledore will give you permission if it for this ron muttered yeah you re right harry muttered and they waited until the coast was clear and ran back to the common room evelyn suddenly pushed open a secret passage way and looked at the door opening and closing quickly she shook her head sadly and turned to leave only to run smack into remus remus what are you doing here she asked from surprise it my turn for guard duty he said and yawned lightly it pretty tiring oh right there was a full moon last night i forgot she said you know clara someone could get suspicious from all your creeping around he insisted jokingly i know evelyn said in an amused voice i was just worried because i knew harry and ron were in the hallways so i wanted to make sure they got back alright hi remus clara another voice said and the two turned and saw tonks walk into the area anything happening harry and ron tried to go somewhere but i think they heard severus and i arguing clara evelyn explained i followed them through the passageways to make sure they got back alright tonks eyed her for a minute then said you re so different compared to your brother and i live each day thanking i am she replied i wouldntdo anything to hurt harry the other two nodded in agreement and then went their own ways to patrol the castle hermione looked up from her bed in the hospital wing and smiled as harry walked over to her did you get it well i dontknow he said playfully harry she said in a jokingly whiny voice alright alright here he handed her the book she had requested him to get from the library thank you she said and shoved her face in the book right away harry shot her an odd look and sat beside her on the bed are you feeling better i fine she replied glancing over the top of the book at him for a moment i dontsee why madam pomfrey insists on keeping me here and you told me i was crazy about thinking she was over protective of her patients he said oh shut up she snapped playfully smacking him in the stomach lightly how ron about this whole lavender thing he as best as we could expect you know he thinks she was planning on breaking up with him harry said with a shrug hermione got a guilty look on her face and she said oh poor ron i guess he could see though that no matter how good it appeared to be going on the outside their relationship was slowly starting to crumple that what she was talking to you about that day wasntit harry asked suddenly she wanted another person opinion if she should break up with him or not after a moment hesitation hermione nodded her head donttell ron though she deserves to tell him herself i know she ll be back so will everyone else that was taken moving his arm around her shoulder harry sighed and said i going to go to dumbledore today to get permission to look through the restricted section for information about this ritual hermione bit her lip then said i worried about you harry why you re the one in the hospital wing he said with a raised eyebrow i know but you re the only half blood left in the school she insisted true but remember i also the boy who lived so i ve got at least 10 people following me every hour of the day they re all outside now because madam pomfrey insisted that her hospital wing was safe he said encouragingly there was a pause then she said that doesntmean i not allowed to be worried he sighed and rested his chin on the top of her head and rubbed her back while saying everything going to be fine do you honestly believe that she asked harry didntanswer her they just continued sitting in silence harry sighed as they left care of magical creatures that day pretty much the whole class surrounded him as they walked back towards the castle this was a common practice now but it drove him insane this especially annoyed him after his last class when no one had any right to follow him i ve got to go see dumbledore he said suddenly coming ron yeah ron said he looked slightly uncomfortable in the large group of people but he had gotten a little used to it since this is how it had been since before lavender seamus and dean were taking captive the big group attempted to follow them but ron said do you guys intend on following harry to the bathroom when he has to go a few of the girl blushed and a few giggled with the guys just stopped walking thanks bud harry said and the two continued climbing up the stairs to the castle he looked back for a minute to see hagrid playing with griffy athena and roller he smiled lightly glad hagrid could take his fire griffin hermione water owl and ron earth weasel they had all woke up from their semi hibernation and it took their large friend to control them they continued up the stairs think the scene from harry potter 3 here and then over the bridge to the castle after a long hike up the stairs ron face was slightly red and he was muttering about sore legs you say the password harry said and leaned against the wall with amusement it took ron approximately five minutes to say the word voldemort right out without stuttering they stood on the moving stairs but didnttalk to each other they didnteven look at each other this was a very serious matter they were about to talk to dumbledore about harry knocked on the door and opened it before dumbledore could answer them the headmaster looked slightly surprised to see them sir harry said i need to ask you a favour yes harry dumbledore asked curiously ron and i would like to have your permission to look through some books in the restricted section about possible rituals vulcan could use and things like that he explained and ron nodded in agreement on most occasions i would not give a person permission to look for dark rituals but i believe this is one occasion where it is necessary the old headmaster said and he dug out a sheet of paper and wrote a note on it then held it out i believe madam pince will allow you to look through the restricted section but do not be surprised if she checks up on you every five minutes we wontsir ron said while snickering harry tucked the note into his pants pockets then said thank you you re welcome and harry yes be careful he said i ll try sir harry said with a sigh as he and his friend headed towards the library this is the best time i spent in the library ron said as he read through some of the different books in the restricted section hermione ll be jealous when she hears about some of the things we read here harry smiled both from the attitude of his friend and the mention of his girlfriend they were sitting at a small table in that part of the library and like professor dumbledore said madam pince was constantly checking up on them the emerald eyed boy continued looking at the books until he found a blood stained one he remembered seeing this one in his first year when he had been searching for information on nicolas flamel it seemed to be something to avoid at that particular time but now he just kept looking back at it over and over sighing to himself he finally picked it up and waited for it to scream or something but nothing happened he sat with his back against another book shelf and propped the book up on his knees ron noticed his friend expressions change as he read it his eyes would darken lighten and get spikes of terror in it harry he said slowly as if terrified he didnteven notice that madam pomfrey had walked over to them shoving the rest of the books hastily back in their proper places harry said i d like to check this one out madam pomfrey this is really important the librarian seemed to hesitate for a minute until she saw the look in harry eyes and sighed saying fine potter but only that book and dontmess it up thank you harry said and collected the book into his arms as he jumped to his feet ron followed suit then the two walked out of the stuffy room what in that book he asked the answers to some questions i didnteven think of harry said as he practically started running to the hospital wing this is something all three of us need to hear together isntit he asked yes harry insisted taking the stairs in twos and threes needless to day when the two boys run into the room red faced from running hermione was more then just a little surprised what in merlin name are you two doing she snapped at them harry sat down beside her on the bed and ron sat on the chair looking as interested as hermione did i found what the ritual is and everything but that not important you wontbelieve what else i found he said quickly what his two friends asked him together suddenly there was a cold feeling in the room and harry shivered ron was twisting in his chair to see if anything had entered the room and hermione eyes were darting from wall to wall i ll tell you later he said slowly looking around nervously i dontthink it safe to say here understandable hermione said then looked at the clock and said get back to the common room soon harry might have permission to be out but you dontron and even so harry you re still under strict supervision i know he groaned thank you for the reminder mother dear ron made a face and said that sounds wrong in so many ways hermione chuckled and harry made a face i hungry the redhead said suddenly we missed supper i ll see you two later bye they both said as he walked out there was a moment of silence then harry said hermione i want you to wear this he took out his mother pendent and placed it around her neck why she asked and touched it lightly just trust me he muttered and stared at it with an odd expression on his face harry wake up harry eyes snapped open and he stared with confusion as he saw hermione leaning over him still dressed in what she had been earlier that day hermione what wrong he asked and sat up she backed away a bit and said hurry dress up quickly there something you have to come and see there was a note of panic to her voice harry got up as fast as possible and got dressed in a pair of jeans a t shirt and a zip up sweater he pulled his socks and shoes on quickly and put his contacts in noticing that hermione had turned around and was a deep shade of red what going on he asked her placing a hand on her shoulder come on she said and grabbed his arm running out of the room they ran down the stairs and into the empty hallway for a moment harry thought they were going to dumbledore office but they didn t instead they went to the room of requirement hermione what he asked as she pushed the door open he felt his blood run cold as he looked into the room then turned around and faced her quickly the first thing he noticed was her pale blue eyes no he muttered and fell back into the bloody room i really didntthink you d fall for the same thing twice she muttered but you must really like this mudblood to fall for it again harry attempted to get out of the room when the blue eyed hermione changed into vulcan potter form there was a loud howling and harry turned quickly to see four wolves staring hungrily at him oh shit hermione shot up in her bed and screamed loudly this woke madam pomfrey parvati and padma who looked at her wildly what wrong miss granger madam pomfrey said as she ran into the room throwing a robe over her nightdress quickly harry something wrong with him i can feel it she muttered wildly and jumped out of the bed she was about to go to the door when dumbledore came in with a stony face where harry hermione asked with a note of insanity in her voice i will not lie hermione the old man said quietly he gone there was a message left in the room of reqirement for us all it said i have all i need the world shall meet me again finally no she whispered then started screaming how could this happen it too fast this is impossible mr potter from the look of the area put up a better fight then any of the other victims had dumbledore said we ve been looking for him for an hour now but i just had the dream about it hermione said i am aware of that hermione the old man sighed it was a delayed effect i believe it happens to those that arentused to seeing the present hermione put her head into her hands and started sobbing loudly the only clue we have is a trail of blood going towards the mountains in hogsmead dumbledore said sadly her head shot up and her eyes widened the cave what cave pomfrey asked soothingly the one harry dean seamus and i found hermione said we heard a wolf in it i think that the place or at least the way to where everyone being held captive harry someone whispered and shook his gentally harry groaned and rolled over slightly feeling a terrible pain shoot through him with a struggle he opened his eyes and noticed the beat up looking forms of lavender

summary as harry and his friends enter their sixth year at hogwarts they dontenter the cheerful world they left behind they enter a world covered in a thick blanket of fear it only hits harry how important he really is when people start seeing him as the light that allows them to see under this blanket along with his friend he must battle the horrors of the past present and possible the future to begin the end of the war hopefully before it hits hogwarts what happens when people start disappearing from under dumbledore protection and one of the famous trio disappears it up to the last two plus some more friends to find a way to save all the people that disappeared because they cantfight this war on their own warning dark themes will be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound note we re getting down to the end here people and a lot of your questions and many lose ends are starting to wrap up in this chapter and the very few that are left to follow this i so proud i never got this close to finishing a fic that i was actually interested in usually i get bored with them for example element of life because i kept mixing up different things and there was too many plot lines all tangled together but i love this one it my pride and joy question everyone sequel or not i want a yes or a no from at least a few people within these last few chapters warning major violence is implied in this chapter more then anything what i mean by that is there is a lot of gore as well as more violence i not going to rate this r but if you feel it should and dontcontinue reading i respect that as well courage isntabout being the strongest or the bravest it about believing in your heart no matter what anyone else says and it about facing your fears head on even if you know you cantwin in the end kaddie doucette me harry stood up and went to the edge of the cell he looked around nervously ignoring the shooting pain that was originating in his arm where the words half blood prince were carved looking down he saw that there was about four people in every cell around them some people were wearing their torn and dirty hogwarts uniforms while others were wearing their normal cloths but those werentin much better shape we thought for sure that the half blood prince wouldntget you dean said quietly and the other two nodded of course he was going to get me harry said and turned to face them sharply there was a note of hysterics in his voice that made the other three nervous those shadow wolves can pull people through walls and floors vulcan himself can become different people and he can possess people the only one stronger then him here is probably voldemort you know who oh all right v voldemort here seamus asked alarmed he the one that going to be in control of vulcan harry said with a depressed tone who vulcan lavender asked he the half blood prince he also the first magical potter he replied there was a long uncomfortable silence that just seemed to weigh the four of them down to the ground then lavender asked in such a small voice harry was surprise she heard it herself is there a way to stop the ritual to bring vulcan back harry could hear people in the cells around him move closer towards their cell so they could hear his answer he knew that there was gong to be a lot of disappointed people here no he said once it starts there absolutely no way to stop it and because of the throbbing in this stupid scar i d say it already begun hermione ignored madam pomfrey pleas to stay in bed she got up and started running towards the gryffindor tower she could hear professor dumbledore telling the healer as well as the two other girls in the hospital wing to stay there and let her go do what she had to do like harry had when he brought that huge book into the library but didnttell her what was in it she took the stairs by twos and threes she didntcare if she scared a couple people who were revising for their exams that day but harry was more important to her then any stupid test any day needless to say when she burst into the sixth year boy dormitory ron and neville were more then startled arentyou supposed to be in the hospital wing ron asked his friend as he finished buttoning his pants up i dontcare where i supposed to be she snapped and ran over to harry trunk and opened it she didnthave to look far for the large leather blood stained book yanking it out she sat on harry bed and started flipping through it shouldntyou be getting ready to write your exams neville asked clueless and ron raised an eyebrow her eyes flashed angrily at them and she said harry more important to me then any stupid assignment quiz test or exam and dontforget it what happened to harry ron asked his eyes looking at the bed she was sitting on i thought he just got up early or something he gone ron she said suddenly and tears started collecting in her eyes again they only found a note and his blood dear sweet merlin ron said and sat down on his bed his face showed pure shock and his eyes were wide ron where hermione ginny questioned as she bounded into the room hermione held up her hand and continued reading her brown eyes were slowly going wider and her left hand clasped onto harry pendent around her neck herm ginny voiced again after a minute there no way to stop the ritual she said there no way to stop the half blood prince from coming back once it begun and i doubt once he got harry he decided to wait around for a little while he got harry the only other girl in the room asked receiving a nod from the other girl is there any way we could find them neville questioned i have a theory about it she said slowly when harry dean seamus and i were in hogsmead the first trip this year we found a cave with growling in it many of the people blood has been found heading towards the village mountains so i betting everything that the cave we found is the way to go she read the book a little more then said this pendent what about it ron questioned i know it harry and all it was his mothers hermione explained she got it when she was 16 from somebody harry and i read through her diary in the summer and we found it was from a mysterious cloaked man who claimed to be from the past she had suspicions that it could possibly be merlin once she was able to identify it this book proves her theory she leaned the book down so they could all see it and sure enough there was the pendent and beside it under the description it said the last time this was seen was when merlin was buried what so special about it ginny questioned curiously sure she hadnttalked to hermione or harry much this year but once her boyfriend dean disappeared she insisted on helping them anyway she could this pendent is more then just a normal necklace it has three uses for it each goes along with the different types of metal somehow or at least that what merlin wanted the gold metal has the magic in it to locate its owner for someone who wants to find him but only for good reasons inside the silver metal is the magic that allows the owner to find anyone he wants to both these use a person aura to detect them so it makes sense what this last one is that red metal there uses magic to make a person aura visible nobody else has been able to do that since merlin what so important about seeing a person aura ron questioned it can allow you to identify if they re good or evil for one but aside from that i dontknow she explained nobody does so this pendent can lead us to harry by detecting his aura neville said hermione nodded and continued reading but she didntfind anything else useful so she closed it looking at the others she said i going to get changed and then i going after him you can come if you want but you donthave to i coming ginny said and followed her out of the room once they left neville got changed quickly into normal day clothes what are you doing ron questioned i going with them and it mighty uncomfortable to run around in our uniforms he explained good point the other boy agreed and quickly got changed as hermione ron neville and ginny were about to escape from the castle they got the shock of their lives standing at the bottom of the stairs waiting for them was luna mark and nicola i coming with you i heard dumbledore talking about harry earlier and i knew you d go after him luna said in the most serious voice anybody ever heard her use fine hermione said but you two arentcoming like you can stop us mark hissed harry my cousin and you re my sister nicola said hermione groaned and said now i know how harry felt last year well fine let go they headed over to the statue of the humped witch and whispered the secret password the group then creped quietly into the passage and down the long tunnels that led to hogsmead dumbledore suddenly pushed a half open door the full way open and said we best get ready to go after them sir what about you know she gone missing mcgonagall asked as if shocked i am not surprised and i know very well where she went dumbledore said with a sigh had i realized it at the first of the year then many students wouldnthave been taking you re a trusting man dumbledore moody voice growled from the room it is one of my greatest weaknesses the great headmaster admitted we all trusted her we all thought she was different remus growled obviously more angry with himself then anyone else there was i actually trusted her even after what her brother did dontfeel bad remus tonks said comforting clara evelyn tricked all of us and i promise that fucking bitch of a death eater will pay everyone in the cells looked up as a door open and a figure strode down the hallway harry could tell as the figure stopped in front of their prison that it was a female there was something familiar about her too the figure seemed to notice his stare and said in the sweetest voice possible recognize me potter his mind reeled and he said slowly professor evelyn she took down her hood and stared at them all as if they were little bugs yes professor evelyn oh i adore my last name it my husband you know or at least it was before he was killed had you knew my maiden name i doubt you would have trusted me what going on lavender asked with fear she stayed between seamus and dean and her eyes held sheer fear dear girl i am a death eater evelyn said i ve been one for as long as i could remember i more well how do i say this i more celebrated here then my little brother is you know i grew up in canada with our dad while he grew here with our mother harry noticed with alarm that her emerald eyes suddenly changed into a watery yet blunt gray color that made his blood boil had he had seen those eyes before he would have known right away not to trust her you know who i am potter or at least who my brother is she whispered dangerously but with an amused look in her eyes clara a weak voice said from the hallway the dark lord would like to see you ahh peter we were just talking about you evelyn said as she straightened her long black robes peter pettigrew looked at her nervously but there was more confidence behind his eyes while facing her then anyone else harry had seen him look at he knew now who evelyn reminded him off when she was angry you re name was clara pettigrew wasntit yes she said whipping around to face them again most people thought i died in the first war you know but i showed up in england last year claiming to have gotten a light case of amnesia i fooled old man dumbledore and i fooled you potter harry glared at her and then moved his glare to the fat little man in front of him and it intensified you pettigrews just have to keep ruining my life dontyou why yes we do clara said right away it our jobs now peter the dark lord wishes to see me yes sister he replied and the two walked off talking silently that why she wanted to know what our wands were made of why she wanted to see how we could all duel and why she wanted to know about prophecies god i so stupid harry yelled and hit his head on the metal bars whoa there bud we re still going to need you to escape dean said and pulled him away from the bars making sure not to touch the wall behind them harry looked around then said i know this place pardon lavender asked as she knelt down beside him in my dreams i ran through this area once usually i in a dark always with walls made of flesh blood and bone if i right that hall is down there he pointed to the left through that poor evelyn and pettigrew went through should be just a plain hallway with no blood in it but i positive we dontwant to go down that hall he said it d be a nice change from this someone across the hall said to him anything would be better then this a person in the cell beside them said no it not it going to get worse harry said nervously hermione ginny said after a moment as they continued to walk towards the cave in hogsmead can i ask you something of course you can hermione said as they moved through the tall grass how did you know harry was gone when you were in the hospital wing she questioned i saw it in my sleep she said after a moment of hesitation you know sometimes when you care about somebody and they get in trouble you can just feel it happening inside of you well that what happened but i suppose since this is harry we re talking about i not only felt it but i saw it too that makes sense when you think about it luna said off handedly but said nothing else about the subject as they reached the mountain said ready ron asked them all as he moved in front of hermione a little bit yeah everyone said in their own different ways and all of them started going through the cave mark and nicola stuck together in the middle of the group and close together from fright there was an occasional growl heard which made all of them scared hermione kept mumbling under her breath and her wand was in her hands tightly she seemed to be muttering the words to spell what spell is that neville asked it wouldntbe something you have heard of she said it was something moody taught harry and i during the summer what it for ginny asked then screamed as a wolf appeared out of the cave walls it bared its sharp looking teeth then pounced at them elementum bestia exitium hermione yelled and pointed her wand directly a head of her a beam of bright orange light shot from her wand and hit the wolf which in turn actually exploded in front of them what the hell was that ron asked with shock that was the spell to kill elements in animal form she said breathlessly and they continued on their way lavender leaned against the cell bars watching death eaters start opening them and force the people to walk down the hallway that harry said they wouldntwant to go through what happening she whispered as she turned and face the three boys the ritual beginning harry said we re too late nothing going to stop this now dontbe so pessimistic harry someone will help us they always do lavender said the one that always acts the hero is usually me he yelled the last word to get his point across oh shit she muttered then backed away as a tall death eater approached their cell well who do we have here the sadistic voice said if it isntharry potter harry eyes narrowed and he said malfoy what are you doing out of prison couldnttake the dementors anymore he smirked as he could almost hear malfoy sneer behind his mask you best remember your place potter or else someone might die malfoy hissed angrily you best remember your place malfoy or else there isntgoing to be a resurrection tonight and old voldie wontlike that much now will he lucius yanked back his hand and punched harry in the face through the bars in the cell harry stumbled backwards but seamus and dean stopped his fall he stood up straight again and glared at lucius ignoring the purple bruise that was starting to appear on his face and the shooting pain that came with it he turned slightly and said to someone else we re going to have some troubles with these four i see really malfoy they re just children another voice said that made harry blood run cold he knew that female voice anywhere and anytime he heard it he wanted to kill something we re more then just children lestrange and dontyou dare forget it harry hissed at her she simply pulled out her wand and muttered stupefy he saw no more how many of these stupid wolves are we going to keep running into ron growled angrily he wasntan expert at the spell to kill elementals but he was quickly getting the hang of it as many as vulcan wants hermione said through clenched teeth and she killed another one with a wave of her wand there was a growling sound then something else shot out of the corner hermione eyes followed it then she said elementum bestia exitium much to her shock though the spell simply crashed into the creature and rocketed off its body luckily though hermione magic wasntput to waste because it smashed into one of the shadow wolves what is that nicola asked with terror as it slowly moved around the corner it a snake mark said and backed up some ron and ginny both got a terrified looks on their faces and ron said that s that voldemort snake he knows we re coming neville said know any spells for this hermione i might but i ve never used it before she said and took a step back it wontkill it but we might be able to get away well i dontthink we have much of an option ginny said as the snake drew closer she once again held her wand in front of her then said shakily persona flamma it missed nagani or whatever voldemort snake is named but it did hit the wall there must have been some kind of flammable liquid on it because a brilliant purple fire roared in front of them nagani twisted and hissed angrily trying to find a way to escape its imprisonment hurry hermione screamed as they took off running down the tunnels again they could hear the angry snake not far behind them and its shadows were clearly seen on the walls surrounded by a beautiful purple light there a door here neville said in a slightly high pitched voice well open it ginny growled at him snapping him out of his panicked state neville yanked open the door as fast as possible and everyone piled in he closed the door mere seconds before nagani would have reached them all breathed in relief until nicola let out a tiny scream and said the wall had blood on it hermione eyes snapped towards the wall and she said we re almost there we can only go up luna said suddenly as she stared around the corner not caring if she had her hand on a stream of blood the others looked around the corner to see a set of stairs heading up well let get moving ron said after a moment and started leading the way up the stairs harry groaned and opened his eyes he looked around with confusion only to realize he was chained to the wall at that moment he felt like mentally hitting himself he had literally seen this before harry he heard dean say from his right you alright mate as best as i could be for getting punched then stunned he muttered back and looked around curiously he hadntrealized until now how many half bloods there was at hogwarts there was a lump in his throat though when he realized that more then what was there had been taken many of them had probably been killed in the process of being dragged to their current location he felt something cold shoot through him and he looked up just in time to see voldemort himself walk into the circular room as you know today will mark a great in our history voldemort said in his low snake like voice this will be the day the legendary half blood prince will rise again will all of your help as impure and pathetic as you all are bellatrix added from her position beside evelyn harry noticed for a minute then voldemort eye seemed to twitch at that statement but he wisely chose not to point it out as you can see along with the prince he waved his arm to vulcan floating spirit beside him as he started walking across the room towards where harry was we have a second guest of honor with us today the legendary harry potter my so called defeater he laughed evilly as he walked up to harry enjoying the scenery potter it the last any of you will ever see harry said nothing but he narrowed his eyes dangerously voldemort returned to the middle of the room and then vulcan started speaking we need to collect the blood now it was only at that moment did anybody realize there was a large cauldron in the middle of the room bubbling away harry got a terrible feeling of dejavu as he continued watching the cauldron this looked extremely similar to what he had seen in his fourth year during the tri wizarding tournament voldemort raised his wand into the air and started saying an incantation harry couldnteven think of trying to learn he said it that fast what he and everyone else noticed in the room was a white hot pain in their right arms as the word prince in the carvings on their arms split open again and blood started spilling out instead of just falling on the ground though thing little streams of blood rose into the air in front of them and floated over to the cauldron where they fell in harry noticed that part of everyone arms healed and only the words half blood were left now that we have the blood of the new half bloods vulcan said we need two sacrifices as well as some flesh from my descendent he glided around the room and stopped in front of a hansom 5th year and a muscular 7th year these two will do harry closed his eyes as they were unchained but he could hear them being killed and felt like he was about to vomit when he heard little random sounds of things being thrown into the water suddenly he felt himself being unchained and dragged to the center of the room my descendent vulcan said while looking harry over their eyes met and he said you are not afraid of me or anyone else in this room are you i can see hate anger and disgust but the presence of fear is absent he said nothing in reply and closed his eyes as a silver dagger was brought to his left arm he felt like screaming when they actually cut it he did shake like mad though and groan in pain had he opened his mouth he was 100 positive he would have screamed from pain be careful with the blood vulcan muttered if there too much or too little it wontwork harry heard people being unchained and were being pushed out of random doors that had appeared what going on seamus said suddenly we re getting rid of you a death eater said as he closed the door behind harry dean lavender seamus and himself like hell you are harry growled and twisted in his grasp so the man let go of his arms he then punched him with all the force he could knocking the man unconscious turning quickly he looked at the other shackles and attempted to undo lavenders damn it why wontthese fucking things open he roared for a minute then jumped as they disinigrated off his friends wrists well that was lucky what going on in there evelyn voice sounded as the door started to open we re just going harry said and they four took off down the corridors potter and his friends have escaped they all heard her yell back to the other death eaters but they didntlook back to see what happened they just continued running like there was no tomorrow do you know where they put our wands harry asked after a minute no dean replied damn he said as they continued running he heard what sounded like a second group running but he ignored it suddenly they turned a corner and hit a dead end the sound of death eaters all over the place searching for them was heard just our fucking luck he snapped what do we do now lavender asked with a slight note of hysteria in her voice i dontknow we re kinda trapped seamus replied sarcastically both were obviously on edge as they continually looked around the corner shut up would you harry growled at them from across the hall there was a thin line of blood running down from his forehead and he looked extremely pissed off you guys there something coming dean muttered and backed up a little bit shit harry muttered that when it hit him he had seen this before in a dream he knew exactly what had to be done after checking his neck for something he said i know what we have to do come here quick the other three moved over to him and he pulled out his time turner from underneath his shirt nobody knew about it so nobody had even bothered checking for one he threw it around all of their necks and turned it enough to take them back a few minutes he removed the thin gold chain from around their necks and tucked the object back in his shirt suddenly they heard footsteps coming towards them that us we ve got to go he said and led them away down the hall look in there ginny said suddenly she was looking through a hole in the wall what is it neville asked curiously they re cells hermione noted and there people in them ron finished those are people from school i recognize them luna said suddenly there the keys over there ron said pointing to the other end of the hall if only someone could fit through there we can mark and nicola sounded together and without waiting for a reply the two oddly small children pushed their way through the wall and ran down the corridor grabbing the keys let them out hermione said they nodded and started unlocking cell doors letting grateful people out harry lavender dean and seamus escaped one of them said everyone off looking for them now we better find them first mark said stand back they heard hermione call deletrius one minute the wall was there the next minute it was gone nikky mark hermione said suddenly lead them back to the castle and get dumbledore nicola was about to argue but mark pushed her down the hall and yelled follow us hurry they traveled as far as they could until mark heard yelling and stopped what wrong nicola asked that harry he replied and looked around then said bravely keep going i going to find him but hermione said i dontcare he helped me with dudley so i going to help him mark said and took off down the hallway nicola stared for a minute before continuing on her way back to the castle meanwhile hermione ginny luna ron and neville were on a wild goose chase around the bloody castle as were the death eaters and harry lavender seamus and

comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound note yes i am making a sequel just so you all know and also there are 3 chapters in this story so it almost finished most of you will be able to guess how much more is left after the end of this chapter important many of you thought that the time turner was to make two copies of them running around but it wasn t if you think back to the third book at the end there was only one harry and hermione at the end so there only one of them now it confusing yes but they only used the time turner to get away but that doesntmean it wontbe used again achilles they will be talking about this war for a thousand years hector in a thousand years even the dust from our bones will be gone achilles yes prince but our names will remain prince hector achilles troy lavender collapsed to the ground panting her face was red and there were beads of sweat on her hair line i dontknow how much more running i can take come on lav just keep going seamus said dean ran over to her squatted beside her and said get on hurry she got an appreciative look on her face and climbed on deans back he stood up and walked over to where harry was while supporting here know a way out yet not a clue he replied suddenly he heard the voices of the senior malfoy crabbe and goyle this is ridiculous they canthave gone that far malfoy was saying goyle you are a menace i surprised the dark lord let you live after you let them escape goyle stuttered something then stopped and said do you hear breathing the four of them held their breath and backed up into the shadows as far as they could praying none of these three idiots would find them suddenly there was a series of bangs and the three death eaters fell to the ground unconscious harry had heard the voice that said stupefy three times and admitted that was a pretty good shot for someone his age mark he whispered and his cousin came out of the shadows in front of him hiya harry what are you doing here he whispered angrily yanking him into the shadows i came with nicola ron ginny neville luna and hermione he whispered hermione here harry asked in a panicked voice his eyes widening yeah she told nikky and i to lead all the captives we got out back to hogwarts and to get dumbledore but i heard you here so i told her to keep going mark said you had to get my saving people thing didntyou harry groaned yup he said you should be thankful they would have caught you he right you know lavender said from her place on dean back suddenly there was a crashing and a door to their left flew open evelyn came through she looked at malfoy crabbe and goyle on the floor then at the five people in front of her i found them she yelled harry frantically searched his pockets only to remember in vain that the only thing he had on him right now was his time turner but he couldntrisk either of them seeing it lavender jumped down from dean back and said like hell you have she punched evelyn in the face with every amount of strength she possessed less then a second before evelyn hit the floor she kicked her in the stomach knocking her unconscious bloody hell all the boys said together they then heard footsteps drawing nearer come on harry said and they all took off down the corridor again nicola shielded her eyes as they reached hogsmead compared to the gloomy atmosphere in the blood castle and in the cave outside around hogwarts was perfectly cheerful there had been no wolves or snakes in the cave this time around although she had no clue why come on she yelled and started running back to hogwarts the large group of people followed her closely all a little jumpy about what they had been through when they reached the hogwarts grounds nicola saw hagrid in the distance supervising one of his exams and yelled hagrid the half giant looked over and his small eyes widened with shock wha goin on nikky the captives we know where they are she panted out hagrid eyes widened and he said the password to dumbledore office is voldemort go up and tell him the rest of you head up to the hospital wing everyone nodded and headed into the castle ron face scrunched up with disgust as a wave of a terrible spell swept upon them beside him hermione had a hang over her mouth and nose trying to keep the terrible smell out but it was all in vain behind them neville eyes were watering ginny was trying not to sneeze or cough and even luna was aware of the smell as she fanned the area in front of her face what is that ginny asked after a moment her face had turned slightly red from trying to keep all her breath in it smells like well i not really sure but it smells like something rotting hermione said and i not sure i want to know what it is no probably not ron agreed what are you doing here someone said from behind them and they turned and saw a death eater standing there just before the person attempted to curse them ginny and luna both tackled the person into a wall ginny covered the person mouth with her hands and luna grabbed his wand away where are the rest of the captive neville asked slowly they all got away and now i know why the person muttered as best as he could while being smothered suddenly there was an explosion from somewhere down in the halls and the walls started dripping more blood i dontlike this hermione said neither do i ron agreed the pinned death eater took his chance and yelled potter friends are down corridor c they never even got a chance to run before several secret doors around them burst open and about 12 death eaters came into the room alright now this is getting stupid seamus growled as he opened up yet another door that let to a brick wall no it not it really smart mark insisted it a good way to trick your enemies when you re trying to get away yeah and we re proof of that seamus muttered that true mark but i agree with seamus on this one harry said angrily as he checked the stone wall just in case there was a secret passage behind it but found nothing but solid stone he then continued walking on down the hallway towards the next door this place is huge we haventbeen walking in circles because i haventseen anything familiar yet either lavender noted sounding highly intelligent which wasntvery her it keeps getting darker dean said it must be getting closer to night i think at least it was morning when we came mark informed them hermione freaked out about neville and ron even asking about the exams she didntcare about them at all you re kidding right lavender asked no he insisted suddenly harry shushed them as he pressed his head against a door not ever far from where they had been he muttered something under his breath then turned the knob this time there was no brick wall but a long dark hallway i guess this is just a good a way as any he said after a moment of hesitation suddenly they all heard a distant yet clear echoing yell of potter friends are down corridor c hermione ron harry muttered quickly and started running down the corridor not caring about who he might run into stop lavender started to yell but seamus and dean covered her mouth with their hands something had been lurking in the shadows of the wide hall harry had heard lavender yell though and turned around his eyes grew wide as a shadow wolf crouched in the corner he backed up some knowing there wasnta way in hell he could stop one of these from hurting him without magic after backing up so much his back touched the wall but he didntstop there instead like in many horror movies one stone under his elbow sunk into the wall and the floor he was standing on as well as the wall spun in a circle so he was in an entirely different room this room wasntjust a stupid dull room that would have been a waist of his time no in fact this room was the opposite it was full to the brim with wands he looked quickly around only to realize that his search would have been in vain there was no way in hell he d be able to tell his wand from everyone else s mr ollivander might have been able to but not him he thought of summoning his wand but then he remembered that he d need his wand to do that in the first place closing his eyes tightly he muttered come on magic dontlet me down again i need to find my wand accio suddenly he heard a sound and his eyes snapped open some of the wands rolled off the pile as one shot out into his hands he knew its dark surface anywhere plus the initials hp on the bottom were a dead give away accio he said against concentrating on lavender seamus and dean wands they too flew into his hands alright he muttered and took a deep breath he looked around for something else finding an old burlap sack in the corner inrata extendio he muttered and waved his wand it didntappear to do anything to it at first but when he started piling all the wands inside it was obvious that he had made the inside of it bigger while the outside stayed the same after managing to pile all wands in it without breaking them he shrunk the sack then stuffed it in his pocket heading back to the wall he managed to find the stone that would take him back and the wall flipped around again harry got out just in time to see the creature about to pounce on an injured dean who had attempted to try and protect his friends elementum bestia exitium he yelled and the magic shot at the shadow wolf destroying it wha you found your wand dean said and pushed himself off the ground i found everyone s he said and held out his friends wands each grabbed their own feeling a lot safe now then they had before lavender i want you to take this tiny pouch inside of it is everyone wands keep it inside your pocket or something if i keep it i ll probably end up breaking it he said and passed the mini sack to her she nodded and stuffed it gently into her pocket then said now what we find out where that voice came from he said the area they were in had been devoid of any bloody walls until now that is the walls suddenly started oozing the thick red liquid that cantbe good mark muttered no probably not seamus agreed they all started running down the corridor when harry noticed a little sign on the wall it said corridor d have you ever heard the expression all roads lead to rome he asked after a minute yes everyone replied well i think all these corridors lead to the same place remember we saw some going one way and some going another i think we must have turned somewhere by accident and this one leading us back to the center he expected them to be horrified at that statement but they proved to be true gryffindors no one winced paled or said anything to show they were scared lets go dean said confidently smiling slightly harry continued leading the way down the hall students dumbledore voice echoed around the great hall i would like to be the first to tell you the grand news that majority of the captives have returned back to hogwarts a bunch of people whooped and cheered there are still some students missing though he noted gravely four are captives and six are students that went after them i dontbelieve a genius is needed to solve who they are parvati leaned against the table more she was sitting back to back with nicola she knew all the other sixth year gryffindors plus mark and luna were still back there she had known they were leaving and didntgo with them for a purpose she had wanted to go but had agreed that someone needed to stay behind to keep them informed about what was doing on she clasped onto her uld pendent and looked at the writing on the back and saw the words help written on it while everyone was talking she jumped up and hurried to the head table sir they need help now parvati said sternly dontask how i know but they need it dumbledore nodded then said in almost a whisper to something invisible standing behind him remus tonks get some order members together it time to go after them all that was heard was the light footsteps of two people although many people were a little surprised when the doors suddenly opened without any known person touching them and then closing again once in the main hall they took the invisibility charms off themselves and remus said who do you think we should get moody kingsley podmore and those other good fighters and siri never mind she said sadly sirius will be there helping us fight remus said after a moment i ve known him since i was 11 years old and he d never pass up a fight especially when his godson in danger he might not physically be there but i know now that his spirit will be praise that tonks said and followed him down the hall but we re going to need someone to show us the way i think i know the right people to do it he said simply are you sure potter will come clara we cannot have any mistakes malfoy growled as he nursed a broken nose i can assure you he ll show up lucius evelyn replied coldly unlike you i ve studied them for nearly a year enough time to know who they are besides do you honestly think potter wouldntshow up for his friends lucius was about to reply when a voice that could chill the bone said clara is correct potter will show up for his friends master everyone in the room said and bowed as voldemort walked into the room followed by another figure voldemort turned to a circular cell in the middle of the room and said friends of the almighty many death eaters laughed hysterically at that harry potter i d like you to meet the beginning of your friend death i introduce to all of you in this room the half blood prince vulcan took his hood down and for a split second people around the room thought it might have been harry but as he stepped out of the shadows it was obvious it wasn t although the hair was very similar a little bit different and in the dark he looked like him in the light he looked like a monster of some sort his eyes were a pale blue like they had always been except they looked like the eyes of a dead manand his figure was different then it was when he was simply a spirit his skin was more of a greyish color his limbs seemed to hang loosely at his sides unlike potter who seem to always be tense on one side of his face there was a large red mark that looked like he had been burnt badly and on his hands were two holes anyone who knew the story about the half blood prince could tell that was where his hands had been nailed to the cross like jesus christ and many romans ex during the end of spartacus ginny let out a small whimper at the sight of him but it wasntheard and she grabbed onto ron arm luna shivered slightly and shifted closer to neville hermione on the other hand stood up and glared at him this interested vulcan greatly and he strode over to her when he was about a foot away from the cage he said you d be potter girlfriend yes she said nothing but the look on her face told him that she was my descendent will show up vulcan said to everyone then with master signal we shall strike that when it hit hermione like a ton of bricks vulcan had over looked on thing in planning his ritual when he returned to the land of the living he would not be fully alive nor would he be under his own command now he was simply a pawn of voldemort s all my have bloods have escaped master vulcan said to voldemort not all of them voldemort replied simply i am aware that potter and his three other half blood friends are still here in the castle somewhere neither the dark lord nor the half blood prince were aware that at that very moment had they have looked up they would have seen harry potter dean thomas lavender brown seamus finnigan and mark evans looking down on them all we have to get down there harry muttered preferably in a way that ll shock them enough to give us some time to not only get the others out but to attack we could always get on that big hanging chandelier over there mark suggested like they do in the movies everyone looked over at the large hanging object and seamus said that might work as long as we put cushioning charms on the inside of it it ll work alright harry said alright when we fall mark you get them out using the alohomora spell you learned early this year lavender seamus dean starting firing as many curses at as many death eaters as you can what are you going to do lavender asked i going to distract voldemort and vulcan it ll be tuff but i going to try and get vulcan out of the way first he explained damn straight it going to be tuff another voice from behind them said all of them turned and saw gemma evans transparent image floating a little ways behind him it going to be almost downright impossible you know well there must be a way to do it lavender said if there a way for not someone to survive the killing curse she said slowly there away to defeat vulcan potter harry you do know that he cantkill you so that always an advantage to you voldemort doesnteven know this donttake him lightly though i dontplan on it harry replied but do you have any clue how to get rid of him she frowned and said i do harry but this is one of those things that i forbidden to help you with the forbidden forest is forbidden mark said suddenly that doesntstop people from going into it this is true gemma replied but not in my instance there a powerful magic that is allowing me to be here right now if i tell you i wontbe allowed to come back to help you anymore well actually i ll be allowed to come back to give you one warning whenever i choose but that it do you really want to keep coming back gem i can see it you miss life and it hurts you to be here a lot of the time harry said to her they could see a single silver tear roll down her cheek and vanish into the air as she said no i dontreally want to be here but i have to be you need someone to help you harry i do have people to help me harry said slowly i ve got four right here with me now and there five more down there plus more at school i only have the dursleys for physically related people left along with mark and his dad and that it but you know all my friends and everyone else i love makes up for that go back to where you want to be gemma go back with mom and dad gemma could see that it was a little painful for him to say but his words were sincere a smile appeared on her face and she said alright this is how you re going to have to do it why hasntpotter shown up yet bellatrix asked crossly harry potter might be a lot of things vulcan said from his position by the cage but one thing i can tell you he isntis stupid a little dense at times but not stupid and i dontmean with school work there are many ways to be smart and stupid you re only saying that because he your descendent she snapped i am saying it because it true vulcan replied coldly never underestimate your opponents lestrange it might just be the end of you voldemort said nothing but took that sentence into mind he underestimated harry potter many times and had always come out on the lower end but not alone he took lives with him but still it was always that boy that stopped him there was a sudden sound of snapping metal above them then many death eaters scrambled as the huge chandelier from above crashed on the ground it did kill some in the process and the glass that was on it s go he heard a voice he knew all to well without anyone knowing what was really happening curses started flying from one end of the room to the other voldemort saw the three half bloods were shooting them but he failed to notice mark evans tiny figure run towards the cage potter he said coldly as harry potter approached him and vulcan you should have listened to vulcan when he told you i wasntstupid harry said crucio voldemort yelled suddenly harry managed to dodge to the side just a second before the torturing curse crashed into him at full force he was glad he had too vulcan i can handle potter stop the others voldemort said coolly yes master vulcan said and moved towards the middle of the fight that had broken out mark manage to get to the cage without being spotted and said alohomora it opened quickly and they all got out where are our wands ron asked i think they re right there mark said pointing to the other side of the room in a quick effort they all ran over the glass that was spewed all over the floor and grabbed their own wands lavender ron muttered then ran over to her bellatrix had been sneaking up behind her and was about to curse her when he yelled stupefy lestrange looked over and dodged it but because she threw herself onto the floor she cut her hands on the glass lavender shot around and yelled ron bellatrix started throwing curses at them again and it took both of them to fight her but they were standing furnunculus ginny yelled and one death eater face and hands were covered by great throbbing boils the person dropped his wand with shock obliviate someone said and the spell shot at neville progeto he said and it crashed into his shield and then back into the caster waddiwashi hermione yelled and a lot of glass shot at a few death eaters that had been approaching mark without him seeing the glass didntkill them but it did make most of them drop their wands and all of them were pinned to the wall incendio someone else yelled and the fire lightning curse shot past hermione and she spun around just in time to see a death eater fall to the ground in pain the death eaters hood fell off and she realized it was the same one that hurt her last year she looked around quickly and saw that it had been harry to shoot the spell that saved her from whatever curse that would have hit her harry look out she screamed he spun around but was hit by a curse that made him fly backwards and hit the floor painfully hermione looked at who did it and saw evelyn standing there proudly you bitch she screamed and threw a curse at her evelyn yelled in pain then the two started duelling each other harry pushed himself off the ground and he saw that hermione was handing herself very good against evelyn but the more they fought the more death eaters showed up they re fucking multiplying he said and pushed himself up off the ground stuefy silenco one fell to the ground and the other couldntproduce very good magic petrificus totalus he yelled causing another one to fall to the ground crucio harry tumbled to the ground in pain his scar felt like it was splitting and sweat was pouring down his face he noticed for a minute that it was voldemort doing it he held out his wand and said persona flamma but he wasntaiming for voldemort instead he was aiming for evelyn who had just thrown hermione to the ground and was starting to mutter the killing curse the blonde haired woman looked up just in time for the emerald green flames to crash into her she let out a scream and fell to the ground she forgot all about stop drop and roll but it wouldnthave done her any good because that was enchanted fire hermione got up quickly and moved away from her she was bleeding terribly looking around quickly she saw ginny was unconscious as was seamus dean was wearing down luna looked like she was about to faint lavender face was red and she was panting badly they wouldntbe able to keep going for much longer suddenly there was a bright flash of light and everyone looked over to where it came from dumbledore lavender yelled from where she was standing death eaters started scrambling away as dumbledore and the order members that were there started fighting vulcan hadntbothered to fight before now he considered himself above that but he knew albus dumbledore was a threat and shot a curse at the old man needless to say dumbledore wasnthit his shield came up too fast hermione suddenly yelled crucio it hit vulcan and he fell to the ground and winced heavily but the curse fizzed out like it had on harry last year when he cursed bellatrix vulcan got up and glared at her he didntbother throwing a curse at her he just punched her in the face harry didnttake to kindly to this though he looked around wildly for the one thing he needed to get rid of vulcan be careful with the blood vulcan muttered if there too much or too little it wontwork the memory flicked through his mind quickly and he remembered what gemma had told him if the half blood prince got the blood of one more half blood in him even after he was alive again then the ritual magic would kill him but there was a catch harry needed to get the blood into him with the dagger that had been used to take some flesh out of his arm after looking around he finally saw it it was thrown carelessly to the side as if unimportant harry reconiged it from before too it was the one wormtail had used in his fourth year to draw blood from his arm making a mad dash towards it he had to slide on the floor which was painful thanks to all the glass and crashed into the wall with his very injured arm grabbed the dagger as fast as he could he ducked under bright jets of light that were flying everywhere voldemort didntsee him which gave him a huge advantage harry looked around quickly and saw evelyn on the floor the flames slowly disappearing off her and saw ron taking out bellatrix as best as he could lavender lay unconscious his eyes landed on hermione who was fighting vulcan she was close enough to him to get the dagger into him suddenly voldemort turned around and he said potter fancy meeting you here avada kedavra it happened so fast harry didnthave a chance to react but someone else did he felt himself pushed to the side and saw someone else being hit by the green light when he unshielded his eyes he saw the small figure of mark evans on the ground dead voldemort laughed evilly and harry felt like his lungs had just collapsed he couldntbreath he couldn t how could someone kill a little kid why had mark done that in a rage harry brought the dagger up and then down quickly harry sliced voldemort arm and much to his horror the blood that poured onto it was black voldemort hissed in pain and growled big mistake potter he pointed his wand at hermione no you made the mistake he said hermione she looked over at him quickly and he slid the dagger on the ground she picked it up and he yelled stab him without thinking she quickly stabbed vulcan right where his non existing heart should have been there was along pause as his eyes widened then he started to let off steam hermione stared in disgust as he slowly fell to the ground in pieces voldemort stared in shock and noticed dumbledore heading towards him he also noticed many of his death eaters were captured we ll meet again potter and it wontbe so easy to beat us next time voldemort hissed then he was gone along with his surviving death eaters hermione fell to her knees in shock and harry ran over to her quickly and hugged her tightly she burst into tears and harry looked up at ron quickly he was staring angrily at the spot in front of him where he had almost beat bellatrix the three of them looked over at where marks body laid unmoving all over the floor people were dead and unconscious mostly it was death eaters that were dead but there was one or two order members tonks and remus who were pretty beat up but alive came over and remus said we have to go now mark was all harry said as he held his shaking girlfriend author note i so cruel i canteven believe that i killed mark but i did say someone was going to die in this chapter actually a lot of people did almost done and thank you to all my great reviewers you guys are the best wiz1 yeah i ve had these parts planned out in

author note at the beginning aboxforpandora lily didntget it from merlin grave someone gave it to her its not really relevant right now schnuff no i dontknow those novels but i ll take it as a compliment the reason the time turner wasntused before all that was because i forgot about it ladyvohn lol thanks and good luck i particularly liked the twist of harry being possessed myself i like the song in that chapter too sailorsuns ok then quizgirl true but if harry used the time turners what could he have done walked up to his past self i d think harry would curse another version of

blanket of fear it only hits harry how important he really is when people start seeing him as the light that allows them to see under this blanket along with his friend he must battle the horrors of the past present and possible the future to begin the end of the war hopefully before it hits hogwarts what happens when people start disappearing from under dumbledore protection and one of the famous trio disappears it up to the last two plus some more friends to find a way to save all the people that disappeared because they cantfight this war on their own warning dark themes will be mentioned a lot and if worst comes to worst i ll rate this r because of that there swearing mentions of suicide murder rape gore bloody scenes and other dark things like that honestly though it not as dark as i make it sound i done i actually done whooooooo does the happy dance bet jess will die of shock when i tell him lol i cantbelieve it the only other fics i finished before were one shots and two chapter ones legend of gryffindor is a couple years old and it crap too trust me on that elements of life kinda fizzed out within the first few chapter in my mind so in an attempt to keep it good

their way to email them to me instead of reviewing it laughs yes this is the last chapter of this fic sighs and yes i will be announcing what the title for my next fic which is a continuation on this

chapter although it not going to be exciting it enough to end this oh and i am going to try to make this a clean chapter as in i going through it to make sure there not that many stupid mistakes author notes dontcount laughs there is only so much we can learn and live hannibal by thomas harris harry laid in a bed in the hospital wing he stared at ceiling blankly hermione had moved from her bed over to his and currently had her head on his shoulder her eyes were closed but she was awake he could feel her shaking over on hermione original bed nicola sat with her knees pressed against her chest tears were streaking down her cheeks silently and she was rocking back and fourth her clothes were wrinkled a little from twisting and turning in her sleep her dark red hair which lavender did to take her mind off of what had happened was the only thing neat about her appearance at the moment over on his bed ron was asleep as was luna neville had been able to leave awhile ago so did ginny lavender dean and seamus were also still here but aside from that the wing was empty all the other captives had been cured easily while they were still fighting in the blood castle madam pomfrey was going around with her daily potions for everyone to drink there was many blood replenishing potions to be handed out after they had returned and they all agreed that it was the most disgusting potion that was ever created ron suggested one of snape relatives must have made it to torture people harry suddenly sat up and bringing hermione with him everyone that was awake stared at him i canttake it in here anymore he said looking around we just cantwe just leave i sorry mr potter but that is not allowed right now the healer said dontmake me have to stun you to keep you here ms granger you should be in your bed hermione shot her a look and the healer said nothing else to her although hermione did get harry to calm down a little bit when madam pomfrey left lavender went over and sat down beside ron she shook him lightly and he woke up saying i dontwant any more potions oh hi lav ron i think we need to talk about something she said quietly then the two began talking in whispers so no one else could hear did it hurt him when he died nicola asked suddenly nobody could tell you but it happened so fast that i doubt it harry said slowly choosing his words carefully so they didntcome out too harsh sounding he was one of my best friends you know it hurts losing a friend she said sadly i know it does nikky god donti know it he replied sadly nobody had said anything else about the subject at all that day harry was the last one to be let out of the hospital wing and when he entered the crowds of gossiping hogwarts students many people stared at him as if he was some walking freak show nicola was seen outside crying with richie and rose a lot all of them had lost one of their good friends professor dumbledore had gone to mark father himself and had told that him his son had died he also gave him his body it wasnteven a week later when mark was buried and his father brad evans had moved away from privet drive and out of the eyes of everyone else remus and tonks as well as all the other order members that had been there had been treated and all of them were physically as good as ever now there had been a total of 10 order members to go there that night the only ones that survived were remus tonks moody kingsley and dumbledore the only one that harry knew who had died with podmore the other four he had never met before the news spread around the school like wildly fire that clara evelyn was a death eater and the sister of the infamous peter pettigrew it was also known that she had died she hadntburnt to death but would have had she not have taking her life with her owns hands so she wouldnthave to suffer by burning to death she used the killing curse on herself ron and lavender had broken up they were a little icy to each other at first which was very uncomfortable to everyone but later on they seemed to get along better with each other lavender had proved to be brave in the face of danger braver then anyone else would have thought the blond girl could be she wore her battle scars proudly and wasntafraid to give anyone a piece of her mind anymore facing death head on had given her new confidence for things such as standing up to girls that ridiculed her and boys that harassed her no one messed with her anymore like they had before the name of mark evans was whispered by everyone at least once in the school everyone made up different stories about how he had died and the truth became the less popular one nobody wanted to believe that the little first year had done something as brave as throw himself in front of the killing curse for his cousin even if it cousin was harry potter hermione and harry had become much closer then they had before this all had happened one was never seen without the other and if they were alone you could assume the other was gone for only a few seconds or they were only around the corner nobody knew exactly what happened in the blood castle but all the people that had come back told them what they had gone through it was all brutal and twisted yet everyone wanted to hear all about it they heard stories about the ritual and what happened to harry and the two other boys that had been killed they told about how mark evans and nicola granger had saved them they told how mark heard harry and went to find him while nicola led them back nobody was sure what happened after that though the only thing they knew for sure was that the half blood prince was dead along with three students five adults on there side and a lot of death eaters many people explained about how they had seen voldemort and hadntdied hermione pointed out to all of them that voldemort took no interest in them once or ever harry did more then just kill the half blood prince by using voldemort blackened blood he proved to all the death eaters and to everyone else who was there that voldemort the great leader of the purebloods was indeed a half blood he honestly wondered how his followers took this he knew it wouldntmake a difference though blood types didntmatter but he also knew that if voldemort said this he d be nothing more then a hypocrite the end of the school year was quickly approaching none of the people that missed their exams had to do them they just got their marks from all the work and tests they did throughout the year snape was extremely livid when harry passed third highest in the class the only two that beat him were hermione and ebony moon draco malfoy had come up as a close fourth life in the castle was slowly becoming normal again at least as normal as possible in hogwarts classes had stopped now since there was no point to keep going after their exams were done dumbledore had gotten a downpour of owls from parents of the children that had been taken out of school asking if they could return dumbledore only wrote seven words to everyone those words were we welcome them back with open arms hermione still refused to talk to her parents who insisted that not only she come home and stay away from hogwarts forever but her older sister insisted that she dump harry to put it simply she dumped them instead harry had gotten a letter from mrs weasley saying that she was dreadfully sorry for what she had said when they first got back from being held hostage it all seemed to happen ages ago to harry she was also sorry about not apologising sooner and that she hadntbeen in her right mind at the time she knew there was nothing that could have been done to save charlie or percy it was quite a shock to harry when katie explained that there was a graduation ceremony he had never heard of it before at hogwarts but realized it was to be expected they couldntjust let the graduates leave without giving them recognition katie explained that cho and dave had made excellent speeches in front of everyone although cho had messed up on hers a couple of times harry remembered that it seemed like ages ago when he first had gotten his crush on cho she had been in fourth year while he was in third year and now she was graduating and he was becoming a seventh year finally the end of the year feast came harry hermione ron neville lavender parvati dean and seamus all sat together and nicola and luna were right at their backs they all ate mostly in a roaring silence waiting for dumbledore to make a speech they all knew he was going to mention what happened as the last of the desert melted away from the golden plates dumbledore stood up and anyone who had been talking hushed one probably could have heard a pin drop in hagrid hut from there if one tried alas another year has come and gone it is a wonder where the time goes once it has gone when i myself was graduating from these very halls many many years ago that is one thing i wondered and to this day as i watch group after group of students leave i still wonder where the time has gone we must learn to cherish it to all the seventh years that are leaving you will always be welcomed back here with open arms and to all the students who will be returning to us enjoy your time here even if it is only a year his eyes flickered over to where the sixth year gryffindors sat before i get into my serious speech i would like to announce the winners of the house cup this year in fourth place with 357 points is slytherin in third place with 375 points is hufflepuff in second place with 410 points is ravenclaw and in first place with 422 points is gryffindor everyone clapped when their house was called and the gryffindors cheered loudly for winning six years in a row now dumbledore stared at the ceiling of the great hall at the bright sky on it that would be slowly dimming into a sunset soon after a moment he looked down at the students and said as you all know many of our students and many others have died this year this is not a reason for us to give up hope though no their deaths should give us a reason to continue fighting he paused again then smiled in spite of himself and said this is the first year that i am not positive what to say there was a rumble of quiet whispers that was quickly silence there are some lessons in life that we will all learn and at this moment today i will give you the advice i gave one of my more danger prone students he chuckled lightly as everyone stared at harry then turned back i told this student in his second year here that it is not our abilities but our choices that make us who we really are that is something all of you must be able to understand at one point or another two years ago i also mentioned choices in my speech about cedric diggory he paused and stared at the ceiling then continued kathy vance james taylor percy weasley charlie weasley sturgis podmore mark evans cedric diggory and sirius black a few people whispered his name and looked on in confusion but nothing else was uttered about the name of the famous escaped convict these lives were taken mostly this year one last year and one the year before plus many more lives have been taken this year and two years ago as well remember them i will repeat my words from two years ago for you although do not become angry with me if i cannot remember it precisely i am merely an old man with a fading mind remember not only cedric but everyone else who has died fighting for light remember when not if anymore when the time comes when you do have to make the choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to some of the finest people in the world because his path collided with lord voldemort which path do you all believe they took the silence that spread across the room and harry heard a few people whispering something but he couldntquite hear it he assumed it what about dumbledore question i want you to remember that people will die in this war a lot more people will die then they have in the past two years do not be discouraged take it in accept the deaths and use them as determination to free us from the dark plague that has appeared over us embrace any light you can find and embrace the people you love the end of the year has come and you are all going into the unprotected world some of you we keep track of everyone looks at harry again others we can t i wish for everyone to return here next year dumbledore said the last thing i have to say to all of you is do not fear voldemort fear of a name only increases fear of the things itself do not be afraid of his name and do not be afraid of him draco dormiens nunquam titillandus with that he sat down a few people whispered and harry noticed there were many tears streaking down people faces behind ginny at the ravenclaw table he could see tiny nicola shaking in tears again hermione had nagged harry and ron to pack their trunks before but old habits die hard and they ignored her now they were packing everything hurriedly because the train was leaving the next morning bright and early like it always did ron was no where in sight though having gone off to track down some of the books he had lost after much persuasion harry managed to get hermione to help him pack a little all that consisted of though was her lying on his bed suggesting to straighten things out and passing him an occasional book he didntmind though it was only her company that he wanted so you and nikky are staying at grimmauld place this summer harry asked yes we might stop by home sometime during the summer just to pick up our stuff but that it she said with a sigh nikky is so sad about mark and she doesntwant to go home either so it like we donthave a home anymore a home is where the heart is isntit he asked remembering one of aunt petunias little wooden signs she liked to put up in her house when someone was coming over she smiled and said well then if that true i know where my home is harry smiled at her then started packing more things how d you know where i was what do you mean she asked curiously you got into vulcan castle he explained there must have been something guiding you oh yeah this did she explained and handed harry back his mother pendent i guess you can say your mothers love led me to you he closed his eyes smiling and then placed the pendent around his neck again when he did he made the golden chain of his time turner visible at the neck of his t shirt hermione recognized the chain anywhere and grabbed it quickly yanking the time turner out of his shirt what the bloody hell is this a time turner where d you get it dumbledore he wouldntanswer in a straight out answer but in a question why d dumbledore give it to you she questioned he thought i d need it this year and i did mostly to catch up sleep harry explained he got up and looked out the window a frown appeared on his face what wrong hermione asked what am i going to do with griffy this summer he cantcome with me to the dursleys he explained well i suppose hagrid could send him to grimmauld place like he is roller and athena hermione said with a shrug good you ll take care of him for me right he asked her you bet i will she said with a sigh as she picked up a book it was one of their defense against the dark arts text books i still cantbelieve evelyn was a death eater i cantbelieve she was pettigrew sister harry spat with disgust as he took the book roughly from her and threw it into his trunk angrily we ll be getting a new teacher next year hermione noted just like every other year he sighed she knelt down next to him then said i think we should go see hagrid i also need to find ron to tell him that he has to pack you re done arentyou yeah you go ahead i have one last thing to put away he said she nodded and walked out of the room and down the stairs harry reached under his pillow and pulled out two pictures one was of his parents and their friends from seventh year and the other was of him ron and hermione from first year he looked at the pictures then harry muttered i wonder if sirius and remus have families out there somewhere he placed the pictures in his trunk then got up and walked out of the room hi hagrid harry said as he and hermione walked up hand in hand to him he was sitting outside with his pant legs rolled up and with fang at his feet ello arry ermione he said with a large smile at them wha can i do fer ya i was wondering if you could send griffy to grimmauld place i cantreally take him to the dursleys harry explained course i can hagrid said with a wave of his shovel like hand thanks harry said with a wide smile hagrid studied them for a minute then said ya know you two remin me of yer parents arry the two blushed deeply then hermione said you will be careful this summer wontyou course i will i plan o seein the end of this war he insisted that great hagrid harry said with a large smile the small giant stared at them and hermione asked how grawp i haventheard about him for most of the year aww e better ten last year can actuall keep up a conversatio wit me he replied proudly that great hermione said excitedly you two best be off he said after a moment tis gettin dark an i bet arry didntfinish packin yet eh harry gave him a guilty smile and waved goodbye as hermione started dragging him away see you next year hagrid ron sighed and finished throwing his things into his trunk he had no clue where harry and hermione were at the moment but he knew they were probably somewhere together he moved from his slouched position to a straight one on his knees and looked around the room it felt right to have everyone back here again all they d need is harry but he would be back soon only one year left neville said as he stared at the ceiling from his bed i know i cantbelieve it dean agreed do you guys know what you want to do after we graduate seamus asked i want to be well in fifth year i thought maybe i wanted to be a healer but i didntget in potions so i think i going to do something with herbology neville said with a shrug you know i thought i had my career picked out but after what happened this year i not so sure dean said same here ron and dean echoed harry suddenly came through the door and all the others stared at him where hermione neville asked she went to get some sleep so what are you guys talking about he inquired what we re going to do when we graduate seamus said so what are you planning on doing he remembered wanted to be an auror last year but he wasntpositively sure this year in the summer he had heard tonks complain about the ministry enough to quit that why she had been able to come to hogwarts this year kingsley was still working there but he didntlike it that much i dontknow anymore he said he had no clue anymore he didnteven know if he d live to see his 18th birthday what comes will come he said to himself the next day hermione ron ginny lavender dean seamus and nicola got the shock of their lives no longer were the carriages pulled by invisible horses to them on the train everyone went in their own directions for the most part harry hermione ron neville ginny and luna all sat together in one compartment though this year flew by neville said compared to being in a cell in voldemort house yeah ginny agreed she no longer feared speaking his name out loud neither did luna neville and ron still winced at the name some but it wasntas bad as before ron didntyell at the person that spoke that word anymore at least mark never got to come home harry said sadly he was so young but he will never be forgotten hermione said from her position in harry lap praise that ron said when harry had to go to the bathroom once he bumped into malfoy and expected him to spit in his face or something like that but instead the blond just nodded and continued on his way this confused him greatly but he didntmention it to anyone else how are you getting back to the dursleys harry hermione asked he had gotten an angry letter from them saying he could find his own way home my car remember he said dully oh right she replied you have a car ron asked with amazement i won it he explained luna looked over the top of her upside down copy of the quibbler and said that was lucky luck had nothing to do with it he replied i saw it happen you saw it happen neville asked slowly harry shrugged and said it only happened that time you mean you actually saw the future luna asked with interest donttell madam trelawney she ll be jealous hermione said and everyone laughed harry did but then he frowned he knew that the divination teacher wasntas much of a fraud as even he had thought she was at one point of time the prophecy once again loomed on his mind and he realized he hadnttold anybody else it yet he contemplated telling them about it at that moment but he decided that it wasntthe right time he d tell them when he thought it was right harry spent most of his time on the train talking to hermione while ginny and luna played exploding snap and ron and neville had a game of chess neville was actually fairly good at it and gave ron a challenge a little bit of a challenge that is he the still the master without a question harry felt a tug of something inside of him as if he was leaving behind his home and he knew they were almost at king cross hermione had fallen asleep sometime on the way there but woke as the train started slowing down as they all slowly got off and started wheeling their luggage towards the gate to the muggle world on their trolleys hermione looked back at the train and said they did a great job fixing it up fixing it up ron asked oh right i keep forgetting you werenthere hermione said at the first of the year the train crashed bloody hell he said after some time of waiting to get through the barrier between platforms nine and 10 harry ron and hermione finally ran through it they all laughed as they almost crashed into each other harry noticed that remus tonks mad eye kingsley and the weasleys were all waiting for them ron lavender voice came suddenly from the crowd can i talk to you for a minute sure he said with confusion and followed her away harry smiled at them then said to hermione i ll miss ya mia but i suppose this is my last year with the dursleys yeah she said and laughed as he hugged her and picked her up and spun her around i ll miss you too i stuck for about a month in ron ginny and my sister be nice to her he said while leaning his chin on the top of her head she just lost her best friend i was planning on it she said and kissed him on the cheek ron laughed at lavender and gave her a hug i guess i ll talk to you over the summer then he asked you can count on it he said with a smile see ya lavender he then walked over to where harry and hermione were and yelled get a room they moved away from each other blushing a deep red you can do that later in the summer he said and threw an arm around each of them when i donthave to see it clearing his throat harry said so what happened with you and lavender we decided that we were going to be good friends you know like brother and sister also we made a compromise if lavender hears about any girls liking me she ll tell me and vice versa i not going to let just any guy date her he said you mean someone like you hermione asked with a laugh well he has to be up to my standards ron laughed they walked over to the adults and mrs weasley asked good year kids they all smiled at her and said yes remus smirked and said to harry in a whisper so mrs weasley wouldnthear got your car here harry molly will do herself in if she knows your driving it around no doubt he agreed tonks then pushed remus out of the way and said gonna miss your girlfriend potter shut up tonks he said with a laugh no word on brad evans yet he just dropped from the globe or at least england it seems kingsley said suddenly potter moody said if the dursleys give you any trouble write us you ll be gone from there this year before you can start using magic out side of school i believe remember to write us every three days no less or we ll come to see if anything wrong yes sir harry said and saluted him jokingly moody simply rolled his eyes nicola walked over from saying goodbye to rose and richie and said i ready to go now i guess we ll see you in a month harry ron said yeah be careful hermione warned him threateningly i will be he said and gave her a kiss then nodded to remus harry waved goodbye to them all and walked to the street with remus when making sure no one was watching he enlarged harry car be careful harry or hermione will kill someone he explained with an amused smirk donti know it he said with a smirk remus handed him his keys and helped him put all his things into his cars bye remus he called out as he drove away and back towards the dursleys he knew petunia was aware that he would be allowed to do magic outside of school soon this is going to be one interesting summer he said to himself with a smirk author note well i done i
