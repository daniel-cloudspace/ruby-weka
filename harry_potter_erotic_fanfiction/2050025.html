my computer was going under upgrades and i only got it back a few days ago now then i would also like to say i dontmind getting flames but when i get one like the one i got a few days ago i really do feel like killing for something like that if you know who did it kick him in the back for me also so you know i well keep posting this story no matter what others say so dontworry those of you who really like it now on with the show chapter 15 dragon hunt telepathic 27 october 1996 a d 14 05 pm charley walked up to his bothers and nodded to them gifting them with a serious glare now i want you all to understand that i only letting you come with me because i think this is only a young dragon so i not expecting it to be too dangerous however you can never be too sure with dragons even young ones i expect you to stay close to me at all times do exactly as i say when i say it and keep you wands ready fred and george nodded with their normal cheeky grins on their faces while ron just looked nervous about going into the forest but he was determined this was the perfect opportunity for him to learn something about dragons and this one being so conveniently close to hogwarts looked like a good one to start with charley studied them for a long moment before he nodded and led the way into the forest with long confident strides none of the dragon hunters spotted the cloaked figure lurking in the undergrowth that followed them as they moved deeper into what had been his home many years ago it had been his home in eons past but even though so much time had passed to this day it still remained his home and he felt that the forest itself knew him no animal or beast would dare to attack this cloaked hunter who seemed to ooze danger the first sign that a dragon was living in the woods was found a half hour later on one of the oldest tracks to be found within the forest charley looked over the half eaten carcass of a deer noting that it had been killed not too long before he knew that the kill was fresh and he took particular note of the tracks around the body ron and the twins stood right behind him as he made his examination ron looking a little green and the twins unusually solemn well definitely a dragon it eaten not to long ago so we can hope that it was happy with this meal and will not be so inclined to start getting sassy with us he commented before getting to his feet he had been careful to examine the bite marks on the lower half of the carcass and had noted that most of the blood had been drained from the body ron looked at the body one hand over his mouth and nose to help block the coppery smell of fresh blood and uncooked meat how do you know a dragon did this i mean there are other things in this forest that can do that charley nodded and smiled at his youngest brother pleased that he was asking questions true but the last time i checked there were no animals of any appreciable size in this forest that would take its time with its kill it takes time to drain as in suck the blood from a deer of this size the size of the prints suggest the thing is as large as two horses and i d say it is a young dragon that is still growing and that is definitely a reptilian spoor he said pointing to the set of four prints next to the body and the disturbed ground that suggested a sweep of tail fred was looking in one of the prints while charley was talking hey what is this he said pulling a silver colour scale out of the print that was large enough to fit in the palm of his hand charley looked at the scale and noted that it bore a couple of small scratches as though it had been pulled off the body but knew that it was more likely to have fallen from the main body and that the scratches were the result of irritated scratching that my brother is a dragon scale and i think the beast is malting which will not improve its temper any i ve never seen a silver before must be older than i thought or it might be a new breed i have never seen before he looked worried at the thought fred nodded and placed the scale in his pocket then followed his brothers deeper into the forest everyone had their wands at the ready ever now and before the site of the kill was hidden by forest undergrowth he glanced back wondering if this might be a huge discovery a new dragon species after the brothers had left the clearing a figure slipped through the undergrowth and up to the kill he scowled as he looked around him taking note of the half eaten carcass and knowing only too well that normally his dragon would have eaten all of the kill and a few more as well she still is not eating probable harry sighed and looked up to watch the forest where the brothers were venturing in search of his friend they were not very far ahead of him and he needed to keep it that way better get moving and get this over with he set out to follow the team at a smart pace without making a sound his cloak falling out behind him in a brief flare of silver tonks looked at the still suffering silvenestri and sighed she was alone with the dragon hermione having recently taken a path back to the school that was very unlikely to bring her face to face with the hunters tonks did not want there to be any chance that hermione would be caught with her and the dragon its all right silvenestri harry will take care of everything just rest and you ll feel better for it i know you didnteat much but i bet you are feeling better than you did before she walked over to silvenestri and rubbed her chin softly silvenestri nodded her head a little and purred softly at tonks soft touch and even opened one eyes outer lid in mute appeal another sigh escaped her when in answer to the appeal tonks rubbed a spot that was starting to itch thank you and yes i am feeling a little better than i was but i need more time her voice was low barely audible as she was very aware of the danger that the dragon hunters represented while she knew that the dragons were a protected species and the hunters were not going to hurt her merely remove what they assumed to be a wild dragon from the vicinity of the school and to a safe reserve she was not inclined to be either hunted or removed nor was she happy with the notion of being recognised as a greater dragon shhhh save your strength and dontworry about harry he ll be safe and he ll be able to stop any one from seeing you tonks assured her softly and settled down next to silvenestri after a moment she began to sing softly to the dragon and the looming circle of trees seemed to amplify the song causing it to carry though the woods it was a song her mother would sing to her whenever there was s storm when she was younger and would be frightened charley heared the sound of singing coming from up ahead and froze listening carefully before he relaxed it was not the song of a dryad or other wild sprits that could pose a danger to his brothers but a human song sung in a soft and melodious voice a decidedly human voice and a soft soothing song to that any mother would sing to calm a scared child hey do you guys know if anyone has gone missing in these woods over the last couple of days he glanced over his shoulder at his brothers while listening to the singer the twins shook their heads in a prompt negative but ron scowled before shaking his head in the negative he moved up closer to charley unwilling to raise his voice if there was a dangerous creature somewhere in the neighbourhood and this was the forbidden forest after all there was always something dangerous lurking around no tonks was at the castle but she and harry daughter silvenestri left the other day he said that they were going into hogsmeade to get out of the castle for a day or two the little girl wanted to explore and visit hogsmeade alone but harry asked tonks to go with her no one is missing as far as i know charley nodded having heared about harry and the little girl he was looking after before continuing on into the forest and not noticing the cloaked figure that was moving parallel to them harry had been moving alone side of them for a few minutes now any sound that he might have made was hidden by the sound of the wind moving in the canopy of the trees he moved in the lower branches of the trees ghost like a wraith and his eyes never left the weasley brothers down on the forest floor it was time to distract the hunters and harry was still torn as to what he must do but he would not have anything happen to part him form silvenestri george was the first to hear the low whistling sound and paused reaching for his twin who was frowning and now glanced behind them charley paused as the whistle wafted eerily through the forest and ron froze looking about him not knowing what to expect at a signal from charley they moved back along the path they had taken trying to find what it was making the sound after a moment of cautious creeping and intense listening to the low whistle the sound stopped and the sharp cracking sound of a tree branch snapping off from its parent was heard charley glanced up and threw himself at ron and yelled for the twins to move the four red heads dived out from under the falling branch that came crashing down to lie where they had been standing only seconds before what the hell did that fred stared up at the tree and then bent to examine the branch he whistled softly at sight of the clear cut marking the branch charley stared at the cut for a long moment then looked up into the tree unable to see the point from which the branch was originally cut he knew that it had to be fairly high up in the tree and the cleanness of the strike sent a chill up his spine a single cut i dontknow what i do know is that it was a clear cut and it was a single fast stroke something is not right about this he whispered something is very wrong he looked at each of his brothers wondering briefly if perhaps he should not send them back to hogwarts but that would mean sending them alone through the forbidden forest be on the look out all of you the three brothers exchanged looks ron gulping visibly and staring up into the trees each considered the other for a long moment and they nodded agreeing to watch each other backs silently and walked on charley sighed and slipped around them into the lead harry sighed softly as he watched the four young men vanish into the trees yet again he was seated on a branch mid way up a tall tree down the trail from where the incident happened and he extended his hand before him after a moment to receive the magically returning sword from seemingly thin air he twisted his wrist to catch the hilt of the blade as it spun in the air as it appeared not considering the danger or catching the spinning device he had hoped that charley would have sent them back why did you not send at least ron back he sighed and shook his head it was dangerous for charley to continue with his brothers but it would be dangerous to send them back too he had known it was not likely to work but he had to try well i ll just have to try again the trail divides into a fork just ahead and i had better make certain you take the right trail harry stood carefully balancing on the branch and transferred the sword to his left hand removing his wand with his right chanting a summing charm on the next tree he twisted the charm delicately so that instead of summoning the tree to him he appeared on a designated tree branch but instead of pulling the tree to him he went to the tree repeating the charm and the delicate twist of the magic required he travelled in this manner until he reached the fork in the trail where he must decide quickly how best to delay the brothers or better still how to get them to abandon the search for the dragon entirely ron was leading when they re come around the bend in the trail to see the fork he hesitated before continuing on calling over his shoulder to where his brothers followed though none of them were as yet in harry line of site which way charley ron was using a lighting spell the tip of his wand glowing brilliantly to enable him to see where he was placing his feet in this dim area of the forest charley came into view the twins on his heels and glanced quickly around getting his bearings before he could answer however that haunting whistling came again considering the events that had occurred last time it had been heard charley dropped into a crouch and everyone glanced wildly about looking for trouble duck ron yelled something silver and vaguely giving the appearance of a spinning disk appeared flying out of the woods ahead of them and whirling over their heads with an odd whistling hum a great resounding crack echoed throughout the forest and a series of sharp reports as tree branches crashed into other branches drew all eyes up into the forest canopy the sound of the tree falling sent them all scuttling backwards and they watched as the tree crashed to the ground ahead of them coming to rest so that it effectively blocked one fork of the trail ahead fred climbed to his feet and stared at the fallen giant then walked over to the tree as charley checked on first ron and then george he had to push his way into the tangled mess of branches to angle himself so that he could get a good view of the tree trunk and the very neat very precise cut charley i think we are being hunted this was done on purpose not by mistake charley glanced at the tree more concerned with picking himself up and eyeing the now blocked trail which was the way he had intended to go the tree had fallen in such a way that it blocked the access and unless he wanted to take his brothers over some very rugged and dangerous terrain he was not going to be going in that direction to take the other fork was going to add unwanted time to reaching the most likely place to find the dragon i think your right fred he stared at the fallen tree his frown deepening as he considered who would want to delay him or stop him from finding the dragon it was for the creatures own safety that he was here hunting it ron walk up and around the tree as far as he could go before the matt of broken and dangerous branches stopped him and then angled toward the other side heading for the unblocked fork in the trail i he was cut off as once again there was a weird whistling and the silver disk came back into view this time aimed at another tree ahead of him felling that tree would block both forks he backed a step and followed the arc of the disk and his eyes widened as he caught sight of the shadowed form charley third tree on my left ron cried out bring his wand up to fire a spell at the tree fred and george quickly aiming their wands charley was lightning fast not wasting breath or time on replying but spinning to fire off three jinxes in quick succession the spells were all aimed not at the figure itself but at the tree and at the branches surrounding branch where the person was sitting the younger brothers followed his example their jinx spells all aimed around the branch the person was seated on the sound of a body hitting the ground with a respectable thud followed was heard just before the crack of the tree hit by the spinning disk shattered the quiet of the forest fred and george both started to run as fast as they could to see who it was who had been attacking them harry layed on the ground and stared up at the canopy of the tree above him and closed his eyes with a groan that was a stupid mistake to make and he deserved the tumble for his carelessness next time i sit on a higher branch and dontbe seen there is nothing wrong with ron eyesight he could hear the sounds of the brothers as they came closer and he managed to draw his hood to shadow his face as fred and george pounded closer fred slipped and slithered to a stop staring at the figure lying on the ground it was a tall man who if he had been standing would have measured around 6 3 tall he remained lying on the ground his silver armour glowing softly in the dim light a metallic silver cloak around his shoulders and his face hidden beneath the cloak hood george came to a halt beside him and eyed the odd choice of clothing with disbelief ron and charley run up to join them and charley winced but stopped himself from going to the man aid it was obvious that the fall had dislocated his left arm but he had to remember that this individual had been threatening the safety of his brothers he could see about medical attention when he had some answers who are you and why have you been attacking us charley growled his wand pointed at the man and looking as if he only wanted an excuse to fire off another spell the man stirred and barked out a short harsh laugh as he motioned behind ron and charley heard again that whistling and shoved ron to the side even as he bellowed for george and fred to get their heads down the whistling filled the air and charley looked over his shoulder to see the silver disk coming back at them fast and low at waste hight and he twisted striking out at fred to take him down flat to the ground as the disk came in at his back the stranger leapt to his feet and extended a hand and the spinning disk resolved itself into a sword which was caught neatly by the hilt in a flash the figure threw itself at the nearest tree before any of the weasley could gain their feet a word of advice never leave an enemy unguarded for a second time for this hunt to pick up the pace you have until midnight to find this dragon or i assure you that you will never find her until i ready a wand appeared grasped awkwardly in the fingers of the dislocated arm and the stranger vanished then appeared on a tree further from the watching brothers vanished again and was gone fred slowly picked himself up and stared at the tree from which the stranger had vanished after a moment he helped his older brother up and tried to calm his racing heart he had caught the flash of that spinning sword just before charley had kicked him clear thanks he managed to whisper i hurt ah charley is quick guess you have to be when you hunt dragons i know just how fast they can be i he got fred out of the way i just could not reach the sword in time it it would have killed fred i have to be more careful through a haze of pain that made it increasingly difficult for harry to think let alone cast the repetitive modified summoning charm harry moved through the forest clinging to the need to reach tonks and help he needed something done about his shoulder and he heaved a sigh of relief as he glimpsed silvenestri gleaming hide through the trees silvenestri was resting beside tonks curled up into a neat compact ball of gleaming muscle and silver hide her tail wrapped tightly around her sitting with her back nestled to the warmth of the dragons hide and beside the huge wedge shaped head was tonks sing softly in a very sweet low voice for a moment harry allowed the song to surround him marvelling at the gentle sound that lulled the dragon to sleep and rest a soft sound stirred tonks who stood and looked around the bulk of the dragon to see harry hit the ground on the far side of the clearing his left arm hanging at his side with a soft gasp she moved away from the dragon harry tonks please say you re good at healing charms harry said driving his sword into the ground and pulling his hood back from his face ah no i not but i can get that shoulder back into position with out magic if you like tonks hurried over to harry and threw her arm around him supporting him as she guided him to silvenestri side anything just do it harry grated out past the flair of pain where her hand rested against his shoulder the pain he had been suppressing in the need for immediate action finally breaking from his control and hitting him full force he closed his eyes against the pain that was flaring thought his shoulder and telling himself to hold still and take whatever tonks needed to do tonks felt around the shoulder joint well aware of the pain she must be causing harry and when she was sure that there were no ligaments in the way to pinch she grasped his arm and began to rotate the arm she could clearly see the sweat breaking out on harry face and heard the hiss of breath at the flare of pain and with a sharp short motion she popped the arm back into place harry gasped but otherwise made no sound that might alert anyone who might be in the vicinity she had no idea if he had succeeded in turning the hunters aside that is the best that i can do here it will need time to heal and you really should see madam pomfrey and get it properly checked she ran a hand over harry good shoulder harry shocks his head and carefully took a series of slow and deepening breathes until he trusted himself to speak cantnow charley charley and his brothers are about a half hour away from here i have to keep them occupied i can see that silvenestri needs another few hours before she is recovered tonks looked up at the open area of sky judging by the light that the sun was approaching early evening and would be soon setting the day had seemed so long to her but perhaps it had raced for harry well if you like i can help slow them down what have you been doing so far silvenestri stirred one lid lifting and harry reached out to stroke her back to somnolence shhh sleep and get well we can manage harry tested his arm pleased that the excruciating pain had abated somewhat but the arm was stiff and sore and he knew that he was going to be restricted there was no help for it however it was not an injury he had ever sustained before and he fervently hoped he would never again have a dislocated shoulder nothing much i can do if i do not want to openly confront them i ve just dropped some branches and a tree of two in their path i have been trying not to cause any injuries he tried to ignore the vision of his sword coming in at fred back and again blessed charlie quick reflexes i dontthink i have much of a choice at the moment i will have to take a more straight forward approach he allowed tonks to steady him as he wavered a little pushing his arm a touch too far and inciting another wave of pain tonks considered what might be best to do silvenestri was in the middle of digesting her meal and sleep would help heal her if the dragon remained here and resisted the urge to wander then she could assist harry and perhaps the best way to do that would be to split up well if you like we can divide and conquer i ll take charley and ron and you can take the twins sound fair they had to do something and if he could separate charlie from the others then it might make things easier but would charlie permit himself to be separated with a sigh harry nodded and retrieved his sword then removed his cloak and passed it to tonks you ll have more use for this than i will i know how to move in these woods without making a sound and there is nothing wrong with charlies hearing tonks smiled and wrapped the cloak around herself and inhaled deeply of harry scent thanks but you had best make certain that they dontsee you seeing if i have this then your disguise is gone she warned as she watched harry give his sword the once in a search for any nicks in the blade i know harry nodded and told her quickly where the hunters should be about this time after giving her a quick kiss he was gone at a flick of his wand into the trees again and moving quickly to where he estimated the weasley hunter should be tonks inhaled deeply her eyes going to the sleeping dragon and then she was off running silently through the woods the clock pulled tightly around her shoulders thanks to the

though he had been doused in ice water albus dumbledore was settled deep in his high backed chair reading over some reports that seemed to absorb all of his attention harry had heard that there had been an attack by death eaters in the vicinity of the school and he wondered if that might not have something to do with dumbledore preoccupation when he should have been in the great hall dumbledore professor dumbledore sighed softly as he considered the appearance of the death eaters so close to the school it was disturbing that they were becoming so bold but there was little that he could do at the present time other than ensure that hogwarts was protected to the best of his abilities the recent attack had disturbed him but not enough to cause him to consider disrupting the schools limited number of occupants over the christmas break sending them to their various homes or to carers assigned by the ministry if parents and relatives were out of the country or incapable of taking the students at this time was far from his preferred option the students remaining at hogwarts after all were those who had nowhere else to go to protect the students and staff he had been working on strengthening the wards that protected the castle and grounds and devising variations that differed from the usual wards one would expect to find surrounding an institute for magical education there was no need he thought to make it any easier for voldemort minions by using the same old same old besides variety was the spice of life he had just finished working out the latest variations on the major wards surrounding the castle itself when his door opened and a silver cloaked man strode in and stopped abruptly he knew that his presence had been noted and curious about this invasion into his inner sanctum dumbledore remained in his seat with his head bent over the papers on his desk what would his intruder do if he thought his appearance had not been noted harry harry sighed the professor had made no move to indicate that he had noted his unexpected visitor which meant that if he was lucky and extremely careful he might manage to get out of this with dumbledore none the wiser with a half step back into the shadows nearer the door he watched to make certain the professor did not move and then slipped back out onto the landing by the gargoyle he cursed softly under his breath as he whispered a quick summoning charm damn it all what is the use of having a marauders map if i keep forgetting to use the darn thing note to self check the map stupid before you barge in then get the feather or whatever it is you need with a flurry of material a cloak appeared before him and he sighed softly as he drew it about him the world darkening slightly as it always did when he donned the invisibility cloak he should have been better prepared for the unexpected to happen he should have taken the cloak with him before leaving from rowena rooms and donned it before he came in search of the phoenix feather dumbledore well that had not been quite so entertaining as he had hoped it would be how dare his mysterious visitor back out of the room and not go about his business so that he might learn more of the man still appearing to study the report he flicked his gaze about the room even leaning back in his seat with his eyes narrowed and murmuring about the need to work a charm to enchant a tree or two in the forbidden forest ah now that was interesting rowena ravenclaw was floating up through his floor and looking about expectantly she even looked quite shocked to see him there perhaps this might not be so straightforward after all clearly rowena had not expected to find him there but had expected something or someone else to be here harry safely enshrouded in the folds of the cloak harry stepped back into the office in time to see rowena float up through the floor and to the upper level of the office she settled herself into one of the headmasters overstuffed armchairs and grinned at him inclining her head toward dumbledore letting him know that she could in some fashion see or sense him at least she was not in the room to see my first grand entrance he mused i only hope that the professor cantsee me i ve been invisible around him before and he seemed to sense that something was wrong dontlook up professor just read your papers and let me get the chance to get over to fawkes dumbledore ah albus watched as the man shrouded in the invisibility cloak walked with exaggerated care across the length of the room now that is interesting an enchantment to shield your face to shadow and distort but still what an uncommon likeness to hmmm he watched the slow silent progress remembering to shuffle his papers and resisted the urge to grin wickedly as the invisible man froze with a small gasp this is far more entertaining than eating dinner he mused i do hope minerva keeps me some sweet rolls though his invisible visitor moved closer to fawkes and dumbledore considered calling a halt to the matter there and then the phoenix was a rare and wondrous creature who had great magical abilities certain body parts were requirements in powerful potions and spells and he wished no harm to come to his familiar he and fawkes had been together for many years and he would not permit harm to come to his friend even though he knew quite well that fawkes was perfectly capable of defending himself with a sigh he straightened in his chair stretching and giving himself the chance to glance up toward the upper level of the office as he suspected the shade of rowena whom he had always suspected roamed hogwarts but until this day could not say that he had actually seen was still in the room and absorbed in watching the invisible intruder now just what are they up to he was about to make a comment when the intruder bowed respectfully to the watching phoenix and leaned forward but remained a good two steps back from the perch harry i dontbelieve how nerve racking it is to have to cross this room with him sitting there i almost sure he doesntknow that i here but i dontknow he not an easy man to read i wish rowena would stop grinning he managed a small and polite nod to the watching ghost and froze at the rustle of paper a panicked glance at the headmaster revealed him to be sitting in his chair still a bundle of papers now in hand and seemingly taking no notice of him at all i should have gone back to her room and waited until the map showed he had gone down to the great hall ah damn i ve come too far now to run and hide like a little kid the girls will be back soon and i have the spell to cast i need that feather he stopped two steps away from the phoenix who was watching him with bright eyes feathers ruffled though he did not seem to be alarmed he knew without a doubt that somehow fawkes not only knew that he was there but could see him perfectly well taking a deep breath he bowed from the waist and looked up to meet the bird brilliant gaze there surely had never been so beautiful a creature as a phoenix he mused good evening fawkes i dontmean to disturb you or the professor but i find myself sorely in need of a feather from a phoenix tail could i trouble you to ask that you provide me with one the bird clicked his beak eyes bright on the shrouded figure standing before him harry again bowed remembering the lessons he had been taught about such creatures by his long dead mentor the dragon lords had known a great deal of information about magical creatures and his teacher had stressed repeatedly the need to be polite to creatures that held the level of magic a phoenix claimed a creature so totally infused by magic must never be underestimated or insulted and should never have any material component from their body stolen such would curse the spell for which the desired item was required to fail i assure you that i need the tail feather for a good cause fawkes it is to help fight against voldemort and it is very very important a quick and slightly panicked glance at the desk revealed that dumbledore was searching through a draw for something and he looked quickly to the bird once again after a long moment in which he could feel the weight of the creature gaze on him assessing him harry breathed a sigh of relief as the phoenix plucked a flowing feather from its tail and stretched out toward him thank you he breathed bowing a third time it is for a good cause fawkes he started for the door immensely relieved that he had managed to acquire the feather and could now escape without the professor being any the wiser and was only three steps from the door when the rustle of brocade robes froze him in lace going somewhere with that young man spinning around he found himself to be under the scrutiny of serious blue eyes the professor was standing behind his desk and rowena was hovering on the upper level of the office and she certainly was not grinning now harry uttered a brief and blistering curse that would have startled filch into retreating pale faced had he heard it caught in the headmaster office with an item that was seriously magical in nature and wearing his fathers invisibility cloak if dumbledore recognised the invisibility cloak he could very well put two and two together and come up with harry potter dare he just bolt out of the office or perhaps a more subtle approach was called for he could not expect rowena to take a hand in this she had not been keen on the idea of him coming to visit fawkes in the first place and every mistake he had made this evening had been his own he was going to have to get out of this himself and not involve anyone else especially not rowena ravenclaw silvanestri or hermione and certainly there must be no mention of tonks perhaps his disguise would stand up to the headmaster scrutiny and he might still wriggle out of disaster my apologies for disturbing you professor dumbledore just needed to speak with fawkes over a matter of magic i ll be going now since it was obvious that he was watched he slipped off the invisibility cloak dumbledore dumbledore leaned forward and rested his hands on his desk one hand resting on the wand that lay there he would need to take care as he had no true idea of the abilities and potential of his visitor he had a school full of students to protect not to mention a vicious and evil adversary to fight and he had no indication if this was friend or foe despite fawkes giving the individual a feather he needed to make certain that this was not one who did not oppose voldemort there were many who wished to stay out of the conflict to come taking neither side but some of those supposedly neutral bodies had their own agendas he would not face more than one opponent at a time and if this man was a threat he needed to know it and a good evening to you too what is it you that you require this feather for sir his hand closed around the wand and he walked around his desk not openly threatening but warning that he would take action should the need arise i dare not let my guard down with this one i know nothing of his ability and strengths or weaknesses he came to a stop with the desk at his back and half the rooms distance between himself and the intruder harry harry smiled hoping that dumbledore could not see it through the shadow of the magic that disguised him i have a need that requires i use this phoenix feather nothing more i had hoped to speak with fawkes without troubling you but now he bowed to fawkes to acknowledge the birds cooperation i ask that you place trust in my intentions and permit me to go on my way albus what am i going to do he doesntknow me in this guise and i canthurt him or kill him because he is need for this war even if i am the one prophesied to finish it if i can take him down without levelling the school i dontreally know how powerful he is but everyone says he the most powerful wizard in the wizarding world equal to voldemort or better i wonder damn prophecy say i the one to do the job though how do i get out of this without fighting him if i have to take him down how do i do it without going to full strength dumbledore dumbledore considered fawkes for a lengthy moment and than stared hard at the stranger albus sorry but only my friends call me that name and i am quite certain that i have not previously given you that privilege you can call me professor and if you want to keep and use fawkes feather then you will have to do better than that he said waved his wand to clear an area of the room subtly moving aside certain items of a somewhat volatile nature that looked to be quite harmless if the stranger standing before him took it into his head to start trading spells he did not want to take out half of hogwarts by accident responding to the magic used in the room the phoenix feather flipped out of harry grasp and floated to the floor to one side with a click of his beak fawkes took off from his perch and landed on the floor inclining his body protectively over the feather harry startled harry whipped out his wand a duel i demand that the referee be of my choosing he looked over to the fire to where rowena now hovered rowena would you care to be the referee for this match rowena ravenclaw foolish harry very foolish but i can not permit you to lose face now i think dumbledore suspects who you are else he would already have taken action against you and that spell was not aimed at you young and foolish but this must now play out you called the duel not dumbledore and all i can hope to do is ensure that hogwarts remains standing and that you do not get out of control the ghost nodded aware that dumbledore was watching her and from the expression in his eyes he was not eager for this duel to take place he was only too aware of the artefacts of power in the office at this time and the potential for disaster in too many ways harry was a dragon lord but she had to hope that the influence of the headmaster and the teachers from hogwarts as they had trained his burgeoning young talent would exert influence over the wild streak of the old lords if they were fortunate such teachings would temper the dragon lords tendency for heavy handedness that harry had been displaying of late they needed harry strong but not out of control to face voldemort i can at least impose limits as referee and i know that dumbledore at least will take the hint i give him if only to ensure that hogwarts remains standing sorry albus but take a fall on this one for the good of us all of course i agree to referee the duel i need to curtail harry use of magic forgive me albus but at least he will not be wildly throwing around rune magic she lifted a ghostly hand in a gesture to take position all weapons are permitted and legal spell castings no fire charms or high level curses only too aware of the professors startled look at the limits she had set on the duel involving physical weaponry rowena took up a position in the air above the two men first to fall losses begin dumbledore weapons weapons in a duel of magic that has never been permitted dumbledore noted the slight lifting of the wand eyes narrowed as he recognised the power of fawke feather contained within the wand and understood what it was the shade of the founder intended disgusted at her intention that he take a fall he fired a disarming charm first and was unsurprised that his target managed to roll out of the way of the feint the true second level disarming spell hit his target as the off balance duellist landed on the carpet and the wand flew out of his hand and to dumbledore waiting grasp ah dumbledore murmured i win with a flick of his wrist he sent the wand sailing toward fawkes who lifted from the floor with the tail feather in his beak and grasped the wand mid air in his talons the phoenix flew to his perch where he set the wand down before settling himself the feather still grasped in his beak the phoenix felt rather smug that his master had won so quickly and decisively harry a snarl escaped him and his hands were moving before he even realised what he was doing i dontneed a wand to beat you old man rowena no harry get a grip on yourself you cantbreak the conventions of the duel she was afraid that it was already too late the duel is over victory is awarded to albus dumbledore even as she spoke she knew that this time the dragon lord in harry was rising too quickly for the old harry to win control dragon lords had never taken kindly to defeat dumbledore dumbledore looked on as his opponent drew his twin blade from the folds of his cloak where it had been concealed and knew that there was going to be more to this duel he recognised what was happening and knew that action had to be taken to contain the nature of the beast that could yet destroy them all he still had hope that they could temper uncontrollable power into something beneficial i might be an old fool but i not a total idiot i think i need to take precautions gathering magical energy he reached for the familiar touch of his staff particularly that of minerva harry now let get the real match started harry voice had deepened settling to a baritone as the power flowed through him why didnti just jump instead of roll i i have no choice do i the struggle within the young man was deep hidden beneath the rising power flows and his hands caressed the hilt of the exotic weapon i need the feather tonight he watched as dumbledore moved carefully to one side a slow cautious step the old man did not move like an old man and the fire in harry flickered brighter sword moving into a guard position and the magic of the weapon blocking the disarming spell that hit it it was enough to shock harry into realising what he was doing dumbledore dumbledore narrowed his eyes as the disarming spell was deflected into a wall the sleeping headmasters in their paintings began to stir some who had been awake and watching beginning to take exception to the goings on in their office he must not allow them to distract him and he wanted to bring harry back to himself but not give away that he knew who this tall young man was i know you but i do not see that i have to reveal that we need you strong not uncontrollable and a danger to everyone in truth you can be more of a danger than voldemort has ever been perhaps i do need to take that fall perhaps i can talk you around bury the dragon lord and bring out potter interesting trick you have there care to explain how it works i d love to know how you managed it harry harry pulled back his arm raising the sword in his hand above his head so that both blades were sticking out on ether side of his head he gathered himself feeling the thrill of battle surge through him even as something deep within him recognised the man he was about to decapitate what dumbledore professor i no i cantdo this i must not do this rowena there was a positively demonic look to harry as he prepared his advance sword raised above him and that fire in his eyes was pure dragon lord suddenly fearful that she was going to need to help albus take out a bigger threat to peace than voldemort rowena prepared herself to take action if the professor looked to need it was that a suggestion of intelligence returning to harry eyes was that the faintest suggestion that harry was not lost to the dragon lord and yet might contain that awful potential for power and mayhem harry what was he doing he could not seem to stop the words from flowing out of his mouth or his hands from gripping the sword he had been duelling the professor and the result of that had been idiotically predictable so why did he want to take the professor apart there was something wrong with him and he had to take control he could not permit this to happen but i am still standing and i will not be bested by an old fool who panders to the limitations of lessors who purport to be greater than their powers none of todays arrogant little upstarts who purport to be wizards know how to resist simple charms and spells none of you know how to craft armour made to resist the most basic of spells my armour is superior to anything you have and my sword will come to me at the utterance of a word and none of you have the power to contend against me no one else matter it does not matter what others do it does not mater what you do know me and my power he did not recognise his own voice he wanted to scream as he felt the muscles responding to instructions he did not give he hated the power coursing through him he would not sit back and let this terrible semblance of the arrogance of the dragon lords rule him he was better than this he cared what happened to other people he did care and despite what had happened in the past that had caused the death of his godfather he did care for this old man he felt his arm drop and fingers release the hilt of the sword at the exact moment to effect a prefect casting he heard his oddly distorted voice and the snarl of satisfaction and superiority and he wanted to scream a warning now dodge this old man dumbledore i feeling my years today he dropped to the ground and allowed the blade to spin harmlessly over his head wake up harry i can feel you starting to fight it he was remotely aware of the blade carving an arc through the air and of rowena dodging it which he might have found amusing at another time since she was already dead but for now he had other things to think on the braggart that was pure dragon lord had given him the clue to take him down and if harry could not regain control then he was determined to do just that he climbed nimbly back to his feet refusing to acknowledge the twinges of old bones and muscles protesting the need to move so fast he might be old but he was not in poor condition and he was still up to a fight well now you just threw away your weapon i have won he felt the movement in the air and heard the shouts of his predecessors warning him of the blade return he saw the dawning horror in the eyes that told him there was something of a significant altercation happening between harry and the dragon lord within him and with a quiet sigh he made his decision he had to take down the man and hope that they could wrest harry from the powerful possession of that arcane power he wielded or he had to take a fall and hope that harry would respond bracing himself for what was to come and hoping that it would not be obvious he prepared a powerful charm spell with binding elements and noted the horror in the green eyes now if only he could hold harry there and banish the dragon lord rowena he cantbe so fool as to forget the sword to think it is out of the fight rowena watched the swirl of the sword the rise to the apex of the arc and that timeless second before it began the return spin to its wielders hand she reached a hand instinctively toward albus but knew that she could not pull him from the line of the weapon she noted the small shuffle of slippered feet the half turn secondes before the strike and knew what he was about harry no no i cantlet it happen please duck oh please duck now harry stared with wide eyes as the blade come back from the up stairs room of the office the magic of the sword ensured it came right back on the exact course it had taken to reach the apex of the throw and that now placed the weapon at dumbledore back duck the single word of warning exploded from him he noted dumbledore move to take the half step that would see him safe but at the same moment he saw something else the wall behind the headmaster desk was suddenly full of a very familiar figure that sent a chill down his spine as the desk lifted to the energy released by the poltergeist appearance not now peeves harry thought and horror filled him as the desk rammed into the old man unprotected back knocking him directly into the path of the blade with something that sounded suspiciously like a sob he turned his head away from the horror he was about to cause minerva mcgonagall albus is not one to miss a meal i wonder what is keeping him her fellow professors minus hagrid were enjoying the meal watching the banter of the students who shared the dinner with them she was pleased that so few needed to remain at hogwarts for the seasonal break she was a firm believer that family needed to be together at christmas but there was always some who had no place to go for them hogwarts tried to rise to the occasion and give them a memorable and enjoyable christmas come now someone is trying to take one of fawkes feathers the touch to her mind was unmistakably dumbledore and she was on her feet without thinking the three other house head were likewise up and moving and she spared only a second to motion to some of the teachers to remain and watch the children she did not need to alarm them but then she was running from the hall who would dare to try to steal one of the phoenix feathers such highly magical creatures were well capable of defending themselves and albus was afraid of no one could it be that he was actually afraid for whoever it was intent on stealing the feathers one of the most magical items of a phoenix it was purely dumbledore to worry about the perpetrator of course what more could she expect from the leader of the light dumbledore peeves you bungling idiot why did you have to barge in now of all times no nooooo not me it was not me he could hear peeves as he wailed fleeing the office and the result of his foolery perhaps after this the poltergeist might curtail his annoying activities for a week at least dumbledore lay on the floor listening to the outraged tirade coming from every picture on the walls of the office his predecessors were horrified at the goings on and he wished they would shut up so that he could concentrate if this had not pulled potter back from the brink of losing himself to the ancient magic then nothing would and he would not know until he could see the boy eyes his hand was clamped over the bloody stump of his wand arm the sword at least had been razor sharp and had severed the limb cleanly at the elbow he had no doubt that madame pomfrey would be able to repair the damage but he hated the necessity of remaining in the hospital and there was little doubt that that was exactly were he was going to find himself very soon now there was a clunk and thud and he saw the blade lying on the floor near him and resisted the sigh that held promise that potter was suitably horrified with how things had turned out and was now more him self i sorry i sorry the whisper was in harry voice undisguised and barely audible rowena horrified she stared at the tableau around her the office rang with the outrage of the past headmasters before her dumbledore lay still and harry was staring at his hands clearly in a state of shock the double blade resting at his feet where he had dropped it if dumbledore had intended to shock him out of the possession he had certainly succeeded but now she was afraid that harry was lost in the shock and was going to be incapable of functioning while they did not need harry to be a true dragon lord they certainly did not wish him to be a vegetable either first thing was first though and she drifted over to the fallen headmaster who stirred as he felt her cold touch get the boy to wake out of the shock he whispered revealing to her that he was well aware of his surroundings you re a tough old bird albus dumbledore she whispered i ll be a dead tough old bird from blood loss if you donthurry up he tartly commented harry he felt the chill of the ghost as she came to him her touch to his cheek enough to wake him from the horrible dream that had seemed to envelope him it had to be a dream but when he looked around him he found that the dream was frighteningly real do you intend for him to bleed to death while you simply look on rowena scowled at him harry for goodness sake snap out of it we can talk later but for now you have to stop the blood flow and get him comfortable and get the hell out of the office before anyone else comes peeves will have the entire castle in here soon peeves where but the poltergeist was gone and he was alone with a ghost a phoenix that was giving him very dirty looks and an old man lying bleeding on the floor what have i done later rowena almost snarled we will talk about the dangers of being a dragon lord later when there is more time he stumbled a step forward and that movement seemed to snap him out of the dream state of disbelief the practical training of a dragon lord now reared within him as intent as it had been on killing the professor moments before now it was concerned with keeping him alive he knelt beside the professor ignoring the pool of blood he knelt in and reached to lightly touch the stump damn why do you want fawkes feather the whisper startled him and he only hoped that his disguise would protect his identity from the old man why do i want fawkes feather he shook his head slightly how had it all gotten so out of hand i needed need the feather for a ritual it was my intention to invite you but he could not go on instead concentrating on easing the blood flow of the severed limb and dumbledore did not speak again seeming to be content to lie there and permit the man who had been trying to kill him to now save his life i dontunderstand what happened why i suddenly tried to kill him at rowena glare harry shrugged slightly had he intended to invite dumbledore to the ritual for the life of him he did not know what he had been thinking i think the hospital wing is the only place you will be going now he glanced around and noted the phoenix watching him with bright eyes accusing eyes and harry wondered if fawkes would still give him the feather he needed the cooperation of the phoenix or the spell would fail but lying was definitely not a good idea in front of such a creature he could only do the best that he could and hope that fawkes would believe him or forgive him i am so expelled when he finds out it was me who did this i sorry i never intended it to come to this harry pressed his fingers against a pressure point just above the elbow and felt a small surge of magic move through him he was horrified at what he had caused and that supreme confidence he had in the prowess and abilities of the dragon lords quailed under his fear and rising anger he was better than such barbarity and it had taken such a brutal act to make him see what he could all too easily become there was more than a grain of truth in the legends of the dragon lords look what he had already done he had mind wiped some of the best people he knew people who were trying to save both the wizarding world and the muggles and he had treated them abominably look at what he had done to ron though he still felt that ron had deserved it but to so brutally and thoroughly beat him when he was so out of the boys league he had had no right to do that and charlie how could he ever look charlie in the eye again twice he had mind wiped him he had a lot of thinking to do if he was not to become the a typical dragon lord the ritual needs to be done rowena hovered near him get a move on hold here he gently moved two of the old man fingers to the pressure point it will help control the bleeding we have to go rowena warned knowing that time was running short and she dare not chance the resurgence of the dragon lord he did not want to move he did not want to do the thrice damned ritual any more but something good had to come out of this horror if he could perform the ritual and perform it well then some good might still come out of this mess he tried to still the trembling the training of his dragon lord mentor suggested that that was shock and he needed to get control of himself he found the headmasters cloak lying over a chair and draped it over dumbledore to keep him warm and hopefully out of shock which would only complicate madame pomfrey treatment and finally walked over to stand before fawkes perch i have not been getting alone with the man but i dontwant him dieing on me i never meant for any of this to happen he thought to himself i really need to hunt down and kill that poltergeist again he inhaled sharply at the thought a very dragon lord thought he realised and that frightened him he was aware of the bird eyes firmly on him and he felt the weight of that look and knew that he could not hide anything from the phoenix this creature was more than capable of knowing him as both dragon lord and as harry i need to learn how to merge the two selves together he noted the birds head dip and knew that fawkes had followed the thought and was judging him the door to the office thumped against the back wall as it was thrust wide open and professors mcgonagall and snape appeared in the doorway behind them harry knew that at least the other two house heads must be waiting and guessed that at some point he or dumbledore had triggered some form of magical alarm what on earth is mcgonagall face paled when she saw albus dumbledore lying on the floor his right arm missing from the elbow down and an unknown man standing next to fawkes albus the ghost stood between them separating harry from the irate professors and he saw dumbledore lever himself up a little and whatever action they would have taken on their own was stilled by the headmaster they looked between the unknown man and the headmaster and harry saw hands twitch but their wands remained down and not raised threateningly at him harry looked at the four professors and nodded to them there has been a misunderstanding i need to ask fawkes for a feather nothing more he looked to the phoenix and bowed respectfully i am sorry i did not mean for any of this to happen i know that i have a problem and it must be dealt with and it will be please i need to see to this ritual and for that i need the feather it may save lives later fawkes seemed to weigh the whispered words and his eyes never blinked as he stared at the armoured figure towering over him there was nothing threatening in harry now and he sensed genuine contrition and true determination to see that he controlled the wild nature of the dragon lord and that natural arrogance with a click on his beak the phoenix dropped the feather before harry and permitted him to reach forward and take it with a quiet sigh harry nodded and bowed to the bird thank you may i have my wand too he slipped the feather into a pocket hidden within his cloak and waited the phoenix again clicked his beak and harry reached to curl his fingers about the wand he froze as fawkes mantled and lightening fast the bird stabbed at his hand with his beak but that beak did not draw blood instead a controlled bite a warning and harry felt a surge of magic and understood that it was a warning with that the bird took wing and landed before dumbledore magical tears already weeping from those bright eyes harry picked up his wand and with a deft flick of his wrist it was gone into the folds of his cloak fortifying himself with a deep breath he turned to face the assembled professors i believe that professor dumbledore needs your assistance i have no wish for another needless confrontation he looked to the ghost of the founder half hoping that she would order the group out of his way but rowena remained mute watching but taking no further action he knew that he had damaged his standing with the founder but he also knew that she was willing to help him overcome the urges of the dragon lord this night had been a mistake but one he was to learn from and come from a better person please move i dontwant to hurt any of them enough hurt has been done already though if snape is going to be difficult i wouldntmind throwing him around the room a little the thought caused him to wince already a hint of the dragon lord returning and that simply would not do he was going to have to gain control of these urges perhaps i should simply allow silvenestri to finish that staring contest they started professor mcgonagall flitwick and professor sprout moved out of the way but professor snape remained standing in the doorway staring at harry they may be afraid of you but i not a quick flip of the wand and muttered incantation saw harry wand fly from his cloak and into snape hand harry seemed to shudder and a hand lifter imperiously and the great two bladed sword on the floor was suddenly in the air and flying into his hand he had not even consciously thought to summon the sword and he could feel the stir of the dragon lord within him but he could see that old man on the floor and the phoenix weeping to heal him and he fought to keep his sanity he tilted his light and was unaware that the light showed his lower face clearly displaying a cold and calculating smile to those who watched the portraits of the headmasters were silent now each of them looking worried but snape remained facing off against harry with wand in hand do you think you can take me snape or is that famous slytherin cunning going to save you he could hear that deep voice again and feel the pull of muscles as his sword once again was raised ready for another throw dontmake me do it you greasy git no i wontlet you i wontdo it he fought against the urge to throw the blade and he could see snape wand rise to cast a spell and he could almost see the snide comment the potions master was going to throw at him enough the quiet voice sliced through the air and both sword and wand were lowered without conscious thought at the authority it carried dumbledore slowly climbed to his feet his wand grasped in his left hand his right arm missing from the elbow that is quite enough both of you snape permit him to leave undisturbed his eyes were serious as he turned his attention to the armoured figure go do what it is you must but see to it that no danger comes of it to hogwarts he moved between the potions master and harry and his gaze never moved from the shadow shrouded face with a gentle sweep of his remaining hand he motioned toward the door harry took a steadying breath forcing down that arrogance once more and with unfeigned respect for the old man offered him a bow and a small apologetic smile i am sorry that things got out of control i shall go and if it please you and you are still capable know that you can witness the ritual if you wish he glanced at the other professors who were watching him as though they expected him to explode and wondered if he might not himself he did not know himself this night and it frightened him but he was not alone and he would have help to control this thing that constantly rose within him and frightened him with such terrible behaviour he then looked around and found rowena floating over everyone heads still keeping between him and the group by the door though she was watching dumbledore and he could not mistake the respect he saw there for the headmaster rowena can i trouble you to gather everyone and prepare we need to make ready for the ritual and i ask that you tell the others to disguise their identities he saw the watching professors flick their eyes up to the ghost and the recognition that came over them as they realised who it was who floated in the headmasters office he was thankful that she smiled at him as she faded away and guessed that she now trusted him enough not to lose control again or perhaps trusted dumbledore enough to know that he would not permit matters to get out of hand dumbledore sighed drawing every eye back to him as he looked around the office i need to have a few words with peeves well now you do realise that i must know who you are but first dumbledore bent down carefully and harry winced as he picked up his severed arm and looked at it with detached interest making the hand wave at him once or twice he nodded his head as fawkes rose to perch delicately on his shoulder i ll just get this reattached first if you dontmind should not take too long i presume that you will be performing the ritual within the great hall yes i thought so snape flitwick madame sprout would you see that the students are safely in their house common rooms minerva come with me to the hospital if you would we need to talk harry nodded once in respect to the headmaster as he left the office mindful of how snape glared at him but the potions master made no move to delay or stop him dumbledore had thought that he would never escape from madam pomfrey he had opted to use the floo to reach the hospital wing to expedite the healing of his arm but he had known that the school nurse would not wish him to do more than rest and sleep to aid in the healing process with her healing magic and a selection of powerful potions she had had little difficulty in reattaching his lower arm he was well aware that he needed to rest to aid in recovering both his strength and from the blood loss but he felt that he needed to be present for this ritual if only to keep his professors from interfering he opted to escape madam pomfrey while she prepared a bed for him by using the floo system and popping back to his office deciding to walk down to the great hall to gain additional time to think events had all too quickly gotten out of hand and that was unfortunately all too common where dragon lords had been concerned the legend could be quite frightening and it was unfortunate that they had had trouble but done was done and there was no going back at least he knew exactly what it was that harry was into and forewarned was forearmed he need not tell anyone about the exact nature of the incident or who was involved but he knew and that was all that was important nor would he permit harry at this time to realise that he knew precisely who it was who had entered his office cheeky boy no humility about dragon lords and you are far from controlling that arrogance but you are aware now of the dangers i will give you time to absorb the lesson and see how well you cope with the knowledge about yourself harry was seated in the headmasters chair at the head table and was flanked by three people two to his left and one to his right knowing the identity of the dragon lord dumbledore had no doubt who it was who accompanied him but he was not of a mind to share his suspicions with any of the professors who waited for him to one side of the head table the little girl who was dressed in a silver cloak and who wore a black dress with jet black hair and whose green eyes seemed to look into your soul was undoubtedly silvenestri and now he had a good idea of just who silvenestri was the disguises were magical in nature and quite well executed but what did he expect dragon lords were nothing if not proficient in spell casting next was a young woman seemingly no older than any of students from the sixth year her hair a rich violet colour and her eyes a deep blue she too wore a silver cloak and beneath its folds her robes were black the third gave the appearance of being older than the eldest of the girls by a mere few years and had light brown hair and clear coloured eyes she was sitting on the arm of the chair dumbledore normally occupied in which harry now sat and one hand constantly ran through his hair her black robes peeked from beneath the silver cloak and little of her figure could be seen beneath its enveloping folds the nightly feast had been cleared away and the tables drawn to the sides of the hall making room for this ritual that dumbledore was admittedly curious to see harry had gone to a great deal of trouble to gather that phoenix feather so the headmaster was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and permit it to be undertaken within the hall here there were a great many safeguards that would permit him to take action should anything disastrous occur the hall was empty of everyone but the head boy and head girl at this time who were both ravenclaw and he wondered if that was rowena choice to have them present or if harry had asked for them and if so why the four professors who were the heads of the respective house of hogwarts minerva snape flitwick and sprout were standing in front and to the side of the head table dumbledore returned he sight to the man seated in his place judging whether he was in the presence of the dragon lord or harry or perhaps that third persona that they needed to strengthen the one who was a combination of the best of both persona s harry was drinking something from a cup while rubbing a hand gently up and down the brown haired woman back in a caress that caused the professor to wonder if there might not be help in controlling the dragon lord persona from that quarter it was amazing the power of love as borne out by lily potter love for her son perhaps there was help here to control that more violent personality and to allow the harry he knew to come to the fore and control the legendary temperament of his other self resting in front of harry on the table lay the great two headed sword and the wand that dumbledore had recognised as harry s the feel of the phoenix feather at the core of that wand was unmistakable to him the tail feather taken from fawkes rested near the wand along with a second feather some scales that he thought might be from merefolk and a long strand of pale gold hair of a colour and texture he associated with the mane of a yearling unicorn interesting choice of components he mused silently harry looked up and dumbledore wondered if he really saw that momentary flash of relief in his emerald green eyes the eyes were a far more vivid and deep colour than harry natural eye colour and he wondered why he had not chosen a different colour to disguise himself it was of no consequence though and he watched as harry drew the others after him as he came closer harry ah albus professor he recalled that he was being presumptive and insulting to name the headmaster so familiarly albus dumbledore murmured which drew a rustle of consternation and surprise from the other professors albus harry offered a small bow of gratitude at the concession he wondered again if the headmaster had recognised him but felt certain that if that were the case he would not now be standing in the great hall no he had not been recognised but he had to be more careful please have a seat i offered seats to the others but they declined my offer i fear that they do not trust me he noted the headmasters newly healed arm in its sling as he escorted dumbledore to the high chair and saw him settled there with dumbledore settled into his seat harry adjusted his hood slightly in what he recognised as a nervous gesture and sighed he had to get on with this and trust that he could control both himself and the magic or he would forever live in fear of the power within him it had seemed easier to control the dragon lord arrogance since tonks had joined him and he wondered if perhaps she might not be his greatest salvation tonks was standing at his side as he preferred her to be and he turned to her finding himself presenting her in a rather formal and courtly fashion to the old man i like you to meet my lover silver the little girl is called gold and last but by no means least is my friend violet dumbledore watched as silver enveloped harry in a quick hug while the other two smiled and shook their heads as though amused by the two and your name sir before we go continue dumbledore inquired after harry gave silver a quick kiss on the cheek harry straightened to his full height the illusion gifting him with a couple of inches extra elevation and smiled pulling back his hood to reveal long black hair tried back in a neat pony tail and dark emerald eyes looking he bowed formally to the professors gathered he knew that if they saw through the illusion they would see him as a somewhat older version of harry but he had tried to model himself after sirius black you can call me nameless at this time that is the most appropriate name for this ritual i need some help it calls for three people of at least 15 years of age and six years of magical study to be safely performed as you can see gold is much less than the required age and rowena being deceased is unable to full fill the task i ask that one of you assist in filling the vacant place he removed his sword and the wand from the table placing them within the folds of his cloak as he waited for the professors to decide which of them would take the vacant place if none of them would then he was in serious trouble unless either the head boy or head girl would agree to perform the ritual he was hoping that dumbledore was curious enough to order one of them to comply dumbledore considered the professors in silence for a moment and then stood slowly he was tired he had lost a lot of blood and he would by far prefer to be tucked into bed and working on that resting that madam pomfrey had insisted on however he needed to know what was happening in his school and weakened as he was he still had more than sufficient power to act should the need arise i will not ask that any of you take part in this unknown ritual i will take the vacant place you will all stay back and be ready for anything should there be a problem minerva nodded once sharply and glared at nameless in clear warning that if anything happened to the headmaster he was gong to regret it snape looked upset and about to protest but a shake of dumbledore white maned head silenced him and the remainder of the professors nodded in agreement nameless seemed to hesitate and then nod in agreement gathered up the four items on the table and finding rowena at the far end of the table moved to join her silver and violet stood behind him and gold moved out of the immediate group standing to one side harry looked at dumbledore but new he dared not protest the professor had so much experience and would undoubtedly be capable of protecting himself if something went wrong if anyone survived a disaster during the ritual it would be the canny old man who had forbidden his staff to participate rowena are the circles readied he called over to rowena the circles are ready to be moved where do you want them right here he indicated the centre area of the great hall and motioned gold to remain back as the ghost drifted toward the area rowena floated in the centre of the hall and began to chant an eerie sound echoing oddly in her ghostly voice none of the watching professors could understand her spell though dumbledore looked to be listening hard harry hoped he would not recognise the language though he supposed it did not really matter at some time he was going to learn that harry was the dragon lord but at least not tonight the chant seemed to gather power and strength at the peak of her chant the cleared area in the middle of the hall became eerily light and five glowing circles appeared rotating in mid air the circles slowly settled to the floor as the chant slowed and rowena fell silent harry surveyed the four circles checking the accuracy of their placement and noted the professors murmuring about the ancient rune denoting the elements one in each of the four outer circles the inner fifth circle contained the four elemental runes and a fifth rune to act as the focus in the centre all of the runes were glowing with a pale purple light dumbledore looked up from the rune circles to watch as the man who called himself nameless passed the hippogriff feather to violet and then the unicorn hair to silver before he moved to face dumbledore and held out the merfolk scales to him you are to chant the spell written into the elemental circle for water i ask that you trust me and leave the rest to me albus nameless placed the scales in his hands and dumbledore was pleased that the boy voice did not betray any fear that anything might go wrong in the casting of this ritual harry or rather nameless appeared to trust that he would not deliberately mess up the ritual harry watched as dumbledore nodded agreement to him and walked over to the water circle he held his breath as the headmaster surveyed the runes within the circle and with a softly uttered word he placed himself at the edge of the circle the ring of light flashed for an instant and at a motion of the professors newly repaired arm now out of its sling the light gentled and resumed its rhythmic rippling the circles attended by silver and violet took longer to calm as they took their places and he had to admire the old wizard skill it reminded him that for all his power he still did not know enough to go against the old man without a great deal of luck harry placed himself at the circle on a diagonal opposite to that occupied by dumbledore and calmed the light quickly as it reacted to his presence ensuring that everyone was in their place he drew a deep breath and leaning forward he placed the phoenix feather within the circle and began the chant the level of the light flared and acquired a red glow that danced like fire he watched repeating the chant as tonks placed the unicorn hair within the circle she stood at and began to chant after the first run through a flush of green rippled through the light she repeated the chant as dumbledore began his chant placing the merfolk scales within his circle harry was on the third repeat of his chant as tonks began her second and dumbledore spoke the first round of the chant and the professors deep voice caused his circle to flush aqua blue by this time his own circle was flickering and dancing flame and he knew that dumbledore was not going to disrupt the ritual as he began the fourth round of the chant hermione placed the hippogriff feather within her circle and began the first cadence of her chant he fell silent as he completed the fourth round of the chant his circle now leaping flame tonks completed her fourth round and was bathed in forest green light strong and steady at the completion of his fourth round of the chant dumbledore appeared to stand at the edge of a rippling pond full of blue water and hermione completed her fourth round to stand on the edge of a soft white light that seemed to echo a roaring wind harry turned his attention to the fifth circle the light from the four elemental circles seemed to flow into the centre circle and mingle running into each other dancing around each other as one all four of the casters spoke the final cadence of the rune chant their voices echoing and merging into one and the centre circle was filled with the illumination the sharp tang and electricity of high level magic was in the air rising on a higher and higher beat as they brought their chants to a crescendo he held in mind the words of the fading chant as he whispered in the maelstrom of forces his summons it had to work and at this moment he knew that it would indeed work with confidence he sent his summons out into the gathered magic i summon you who are the leader of the forgotten he repeated the mantra over and over again as the combined voices of the elemental casters fell silent and the roar of the magic filled the great hall all at once the four elemental circles flared with light forming columns of fire emerald and aqua and white pure light to rise higher and higher until they struck the enchanted ceiling of the hall for a moment the soaring arches of the gothic architecture was plainly visible as the enchantment clashed and then the columns shrank diminishing swiftly to play within the circles once more before flickering out with the dying of the light harry looked immediately to the central circle where the lights swirled and danced four colours combining in a multitude of combinations uniting and dividing and forming into a shape slowly forming and dissipating as the light swirled and eddied and then reforming again and again something formed within the circle harry held his breath as the shape become more solid with each cyclic swirl of light until he found himself staring in rapt fascination at a tall young man with draconic wings arching from his back long hair swirled around him in the currents and eddies of light revealing to the rapt watchers the unmistakable pointed ears of an elf nameless found himself smiling and suddenly fighting against the resurgence within him of the dragon lord he would not lose control now though and he fought down the surge remaining in control of himself as he whispered his success the forgotten have returned thanks to the following

other items in this room of mine a n i must say it is nice to be wonted and you my faithful reviewers have shown that in your comments i must say i look forward to your comments on this chapter anyway enough from me on with what you re really here for rise of the dragon lords chapter 9 chapter 9 home telepathic deaths realm harry and silvenestri found themselves in the midst of the black and purple mist that marked the realm of the dead harry looked around searching for a landmark that he might recognise or for death himself moving in the mist silvanestri peered about her with wide and wondering eyes i wonder if he would like it that i dropped in again or if he might not be too pleased to see me harry mused to himself while peering into the mist how the devil are you supposed to find anything in this mist he was uncertain about time in this place and how much might have passed before the sound of horses hooves come from somewhere behind them tuning around to peer into the mist he winced as the hooves seemed to come once again from behind him and he turned searching for the source of the sound mist swirled around them and from within its dark depths something lighter moved and gradually the white horse he knew as binky emerged from the mist and walked over to harry and silvenestri seated astride his back was death who once again was draped from head to toe in black robes and cloak harry looked up at death expectantly as he approached and he could feel the weight of that strange gaze on him and his companion silvanestri moved uncomfortably beside him but she remained silent and did not flinch when death dismounted and stood in front of them well mr potter what are you doing here this time death said in that rich but cold voice of his the blue glow from his eyes seemed to suggest amusement at this return visit of harry s to harry it did not seem that death was at all surprised to see him harry knew that in the face of death he must be careful but he must be true to himself death could be a prickly fellow and he had his own views on reality and morality that were unique to a creature that reaped souls i am here to make a deal moving himself to stand before silvenestri protectively while also thinking if what he was about to offer might possibly be enough to get silvenestri into his time death looked at harry for a long moment and eventually gave a short sharp nod very well mr potter what is it that you offer harry i take it you want your friend here the lovely silvenestri to accompany you to your time you do realise do you not that it simply is not done there are rules that even i must obey your companion should she go forward would be and yet not be a few thousand years old what are you offering that might convince me to permit this thing from happening harry drew in a deep breath well aware that what he was promising would not be so easy to accomplish i ll close the portal under the ministry of magic for you if in return you will ensure that silvenestri gets safely to my time deal harry said glancing up at death and looking him right in those blue glowing eye sockets death raised a bony hand to rest on his jaw as he thought on this he admitted somewhat unexpected offer his eyes never leaving harry face the gate beneath the ministry of magic he considered to be a personal affront and one that had annoyed him for some time which considering his age through the ages was rather a long time he personally loved the paradox of time very well mr potter deal but i make one condition myself you will seal the portal and you will do so within one week of your return do this and i well send silvenestri to the woods out side your home of little whinging remember that i give you one week or silvenestri will be returned to her own time line harry nodded once accepting the conditional he knew that death might well have refused his offer or placed some other much more unpalatable condition on the task this seemed more than fair at his agreement death raised again his skeletal hand and silvenestri vanished seeming to become a part of the mist harry felt deaths burning eyes on him as the mists began to swirl thickly around him and he knew that he was moving through time faintly mixed and blended to be a part of the mist itself he could hear that rich and chilling voice did you recall our last conversation mr potter did you recall that the physical form has a memory of what it should be or did you forget you are after all merely a teenager harry and in many ways your body has much more innocence than your mind it remembers and seeks to return to its appropriate place in time and space but have no fear you will at least remember all that you learned 08 august 1996 13 03 pm a d it must be soon he ll return soon tonks was seated in the living room of harry suite of rooms magically placed within the bedroom at privet drive when the sound of a thud and a grunt came from harry bedroom tonks was on her feet in a flash and running into harry room to see harry slowly getting to his feet and staring at first his arms and then legs turning his hands over and over and shaking his head slowly as though in disbelief harry tonks almost screamed and jumped harry giving him a large hug and a kiss on the cheek she never saw the somewhat dazed but definitely pleased look that crossed harry face before she brought her hand around and slapped him across the face where the hell you been she yelled after letting him climb back to his feet her hands on her hips as she glared at him awaiting his answer harry blinked away the shock of such a contradictory greeting and with a much more careful smile he returned the hug while rubbing his red cheek and then completed looking him self over the fading voice of death returned to him and sighed as he understood deaths warning and amusement he was sixteen damn i am going to have to re train my body i no longer twenty two looking up at tonks harry could see the concern for him in her eyes and the worry his trip had caused her i fine tonks really just a little tired from well it hard to describe but i cantrest yet i have to meet a friend of mine before any problems might arise care to join me he said to her putting one arm around her shoulders and giving her a small smile hoping that for now she would accept this he really had to find silvanestri before the dragon panicked or was discovered tonks nodded and followed harry out of the room knowing only too well that determined look in his eyes fine but you had better tell me what you did while you were gone or i will hex you into next week she made no move to remove harry arm from around her shoulders finding it rather nice to have that weight there it had seemed to be so long since he had left and really it had not been long at all merely a few hours but that weight was reassuring and produced a rather nice warm glow deep inside rather nice to have that arm there she thought where are we going harry tonks said after they left the buildings behind and entered the woods harry had been silent looking around him as they had left the houses behind as though he was only too happy to be in the open air harry glanced at her and smiled as he moved a little ahead of her his hands pushing braches out of the way and holding them long enough for tonks to walk through before releasing them and moving ahead of her again it just up ahead tonks trust me harry said leading the way through a thicket of thorn bushes and he smiled when he saw his destination he motioned ahead to show her the old cave where he had lived for three years here we are just wait here please and i ll just get my friend harry gave tonks a reassuring smile and walked over to the cave mouth pleased when tonks trusted him enough to wait as he had asked he knew that she must have been burning with questions but she had not snowballed him with an avalanche of demands that he explain but how much longer that would last he was uncertain certainly she was going to want some explanations when she saw his friend approaching the cave he calmed his thoughts and reached out with his mind calling out to silvenestri he could only trust that death had kept his word my dear you can come out now i have brought a friend to meet you from deep within the cave there was a rustle of movement and then silvenestri was there in her human form she walked out of the cave and hurried up to harry who picked her up and held her close the dragon gone human buried her head into his shoulder shyly at his encouraging murmur silvenestri looked up from harry shoulder and at tonks who hair was at this moment a bright pink and the dragon child gave a small chuckle then turned to harry dontleave me alone like that again harry she admonished him in a small hard voice then she looked back over to tonks and gave a small little girl shy smile tonks looked in stunned surprise at the little girl with her silver hair and star blue eyes a child where had harry gotten a child and what had she been doing in a cave it made no sense so who is this harry some competition for your heart maybe or some one else she was thinking furiously about what possible effects might be generated by that spell for all she knew this child was his daughter from where ever when ever he might have gone harry certainly did not look old enough to be her father but who knew what effects that time spell might have had just how long was harry gone for harry hours for her but for him harry smiled at silvanestri and positively beamed at tonks and after putting silvenestri down he walked over to tonks and gently but quite firmly hugged her no competition i ll settle for the only woman in this clearing but you will have to share me with silvenestri tonks for my little dragon here can be quite demanding sometimes harry finished with a smile down at the little girl and then reached out and messed up her hair a little smiling at the hard look the little dragon child gave him for his affront to her draconic dignity tonks looked at the little girl with a smile and after a moment she crouch down to her level hello silvenestri my name is tonks and i am very pleased to meet you how old are you and could you tell me where you re mum and dad are she said tilting her head slightly so that her hair hid her slightly pink cheeks at what harry had said she was also highly amused and could not hide the chuckle at the look silvenestri was giving harry for messing up her hair silvenestri looked tonks in the eye and after a moment began to sort out the mess harry had made of her hair as though he had unforgivably made her unpresentable in public quite clearly and calmly she spoke to this odd pink haired woman who she was certain she was going to have to learn to like whether she wanted to or not clearly harry thought a great deal of her my mother died a week before i was hatched and my father died a little before harry is my friend and i let him ride me when ever he needs me tonks blinked looking stunned for a long moment before she looked at harry and raised an eyebrow she lets you ride her when ever you need her hatched she sounds like an animal or a bird more than a quite charming little girl she said getting back to her feet and looking back down at the little girl who had narrowed her eyes at the animal comment harry had winced at the animal comment and sighed softly i wouldntsay that again if i were you tonks she is more than big enough for me to ride her when the need arises here i ll show you silvenestri would you change to your true form please harry said stepping back away from the child and pulling tonks with him he shared a conspiratorial grin and wink with the child and wondered just how tonks would take what was to come tonks looked at harry and then at silvenestri as she started to blur and grow in size and tonks moved closer to harry as she watched the little girl transform her eyes widened as the child grew and altered until she was in her true form her wings half stretched and sitting in a fashion rather reminiscent of the sphinx her head held high while looking down at the two who watched her transformation oh my god she a a dragon tonks whispered in awe as silvenestri lowered her head and playfully and gently nudged tonks with her nose harry smiled at tonks and then reached up and started to rub silvenestri nose while tonks just looked in shock at the silver dragon before her tonks she wonthurt you in fact she well protect you if i am not around as she knows how much i care for you he looked into the starlight eyes of the dragon knowing that silvenestri knew how he felt for tonks he wanted both of the ladies in his life to understand and like each other tonks nodded and slowly in a dazed reached up and started to run a hand gently over silvenestri nose oh harry she is beautiful and do you mean what you say you like me as more than a friend tonks said the last part to harry while still running a hand over silvenestri nose her eyes however firmly on the young man standing so close to her she could not help thinking about his diary and what she had read over the day what he had written there and what he now said filled her with a glow of warmth harry nodded once decisively and pulled tonks closer to him with a confidence that far exceeded his sixteen year old looks and while still running his hand over silvenestri head he leaned in closer to her harry smiled and then with infinite gentleness he kissed her while his free hand moved around her hips to draw her closer tonks closed her eyes and let the kiss deepen feeling the warmth within her grow at the confidence of the warm body pressed to her own a boy his age should not be this good she hushed her dazed thought not able to do more than enjoy the sensations tonks was short of breath when harry finally let her lips go with a small shiver of regret that the kiss had ended she looked up at silvenestri who was watching them with a questioning look and tonks gave a small smile and rubbed a little harder along the dragons jaw what never seen two people kiss before silvenestri tonks queried with a smile bring both of her arms around harry neck pulling him in for another deep kiss which he made no effort to avoid the dragon snorted softly wondering what was so fascinating about pushing lips together but the two humans were obviously enjoying it no i have spent all of my time in caves and forests with harry and he never left my side not even to go after some of the village girls who seemed to want to chase him around a great deal of the time i never did understand why they kept coming around he does not seem to want to avoid you that much is certain silvenestri nodded her head at them then with another soft snort lowered her head and butting her nose against them both demanding some attention tonks smiled pleased to no end that harry seemed not to have consorted with other women in the past and then kissed silvenestri on the tip of her nose marvelling at the warmth and apparent softness of the dragons skin i think i love you to silvenestri now harry shouldntwe be getting back home and let me guess you will want another room done for silvenestri here she said looking back at harry and giving him a smile harry smiled back and nodded as silvenestri blurred into the change and returned to her human form and impulsively she jumped up into harry arms and hugged him after he let go of tonks she wanted her own hugs tonks smiled at the little ones affections for harry and the little girl jealousy that was quite endearing and lead the way out of the forest and back to number 4 privet drive it was sun set when harry still carrying silvenestri and with tonks leading them arrived at the dursley and walked up to the front door on the walk back tonks had told harry everything that had happened to her over the day he had been absent right up until harry had returned she even told him what dumbledore had said to her and waited for him to consider the information finally harry nodded and leaning forward he planted a quick kiss on her lips before looking at the door to number 4 well i think he was right about one thing tonks frowned looked at him for a long moment and then smiled me too now all we have to do is make sure he does not keep us apart tonks finished by reaching out and taking silvenestri out of harry arms settling her on her own hip and giving her a quick reassuring hug harry smiled nodded once and open the door to number 4 only to be hit by his aunt and uncle at the same time yelling about what time of the day it was and the inconsiderate young upstart that he was harry looked at silvenestri and then tonks and walked by them and sat down on one of the steps on the stairs looking then at his red faced relations with a small sigh of resignation tonks leaned against the wall with silvenestri in her arms after they both looked at harry half expecting him to say something the dragon child expected to see him rend these obnoxious and hideously impolite and noisy people limb from limb but he just sat back and listened to his relative rant in silence silvanestri growled low in her throat but tonks hushed her quietly and assured her it was going to be alright this was just something that happened on a regular basis yes i know what the time is but i had to pick up a friend who will be staying with me until school starts and before you say anything tonks will be feeding her not you harry said when their individual if simultaneous rants paused for breaths to be taken you know i think we should have just walked right by and not stopped to take this harry thought to his friend while watching as his relatives blinked he thought they rather resembled owls when they did that and silently apologised to hedwig for even entertaining the thought silvanestri blinked at him slightly stunned by the outburst harry seemed to take in his stride petunia looked to tonks to see silvenestri in her arms and acquired a pinched look about her face before she flashed them with a hate filled look whose child is that did you kidnap her you little freak she spat at harry while moving to stand behind vernon a growl from deep within harry was suppressed with difficulty but resisted the urge to teach them just how fed up he was with the treatment he had been taking for the last 15 years he rose to his feet in an oddly graceful movement and pulled out his wand aiming for the two who made his life a living hell you are to leave her alone his voice came out as a deep growl if she comes to me and says that you have abused her in any way i will come and personally finish what mad eye moody started the other week do i make my self clear tonks looked at harry with wide eyes never having seen him like this in the time that she had known him the anger for these people that he felt was radiating from him in something like the manner in which a power plant gives off power vernon dursley looked scarred for a moment but got his backbone back fast when he remembered harry was banned from doing magic outside of that institute for psychopaths he called a school nice try boy but if you use magic outside that school you ll get expelled from it he said with a nasty smirk and lot of confidence looking harry right in the eyes true i cantuse my wand outside of hogwarts but what if i should use something else hmmm harry smiled a sweetly innocent smile putting his wand away he nodded to tonks his eyes meeting hers and clearly saying that he had been taught some new and interesting things while he was away tonks nodded back and quickly worked her way past the confrontation taking place and started to go up the stairs to harry room leaving him to deal with his aunt and uncle and a little scared of the look in harry eyes tonks had just entered harry magically modified bedroom when silvenestri was pulled gently from her arms and she looked up in shock as the girl was taken from her by molly and arthur weasley then strong arms closed around her and mad eye moody held her his magic eye looking down at harry on the ground floor glancing quickly around the room she saw that dumbledore was sitting in one of the chairs by the fire with bill and charley weasley flanking him in the manner of two honour guards what moody what is going on here why are you all here tonks said well aware that she was not only help physically by the man but was also in the grip of a binding spell moody kept the binding spell up though neither his good eye nor his magic eye ever left harry downstairs she did not know what to make of this confrontation and she prayed that silvanestri would not panic it was dumbledore answered her turning his gentle eyes to her and there was a hard glint there that was far from reassuring we are here to see if the unthinkable has happened we are here to determine if harry has learned the dark arts and it would seem that we need to learn where he got this child from he spoke quietly and with great dignity as though he had all the time in the world while studying the child fighting to get out of molly arms tonks spared a valuable second or two trying to throw of the holding spell but was far from surprised when she failed moody kept renewing the spell as quickly as she worked against it and deciding enough was enough she looked at silvenestri and tossed her head let them hear and realise that they could not treat them all like errant children they deserved some respect and consideration inform harry that he has guests she only hoped that harry and silvenestri had a way to talk to each other without screaming down the house silvenestri quieted in molly weasley arms and nodded she was aware that everyone looked at her and that none of them even tonks knew what she was capable of doing and she thought the looks they turned to her were rathe funny she did not know if she should be scared or not these people did not radiate hate and rage the way those nasty people down stairs had but she closed her eyes and reached for him harry some people are here i think they are going to try to take me from you be careful what is dark arts do you have any she opened her eyes and could see that everyone realised that she had power within her but she smiled sweetly knowing that some fun was about to begin harry who was standing at the bottom of the stairs smiling knowingly at his aunt and uncle turning his head to look up the stairs and with a dismissing sniff at his uncle he started to walk up them placing his feet with care and confidence he missed the creaky ones as he went and sent his thoughts to his friend its alright silvanestri i ll deal with them just get ready to get tonks out of harms way harry continued to climb the stairs and then he was standing in front of his door moody watched as harry walked up the stairs noting the quiet confidence in that stride this was not a nervous student coming before a group of teachers but something else again and he focused his magic eye on harry noting the amount of power and confidence he generated was far more than he had shown when he was here a week ago moody was quietly impressed and curious this would be undoubtedly interesting harry paused before the closed door and gestured at the door and under his breath whispered come to me my cloak in the room everyone even mad eye moody looked up in surprise as the silver cloak whipped itself into the air across the room before disappearing through the narrow gap in the doorway that harry had caused everyone in the room had either seen or been told about the silver artefact at one time or another and they tensed as they exchanged glances silvanestri giggled the door opened bill looked from the bedroom door from which the cloak had appeared to where harry was now standing the cloak having settled to rest around his shoulders the silver folds hid most of his body and the hood was pulled up concealing most of harry face well what was the point in that he said quietly with his wand at the ready eyeing the silver folds of the cloth curiously good question and one to which i dontknow the answer at this time but harry is defiant i can feel his defiance clearly enough feel too not just his power curiously his mind feels older moody thought while he kept tonks under the holding spell and reflected that he was only just managing to hold her she had gotten stronger over time and kept throwing the spell off faster and faster he was quite pleased with her progress harry fought down a quiver of unease and brought back to mind the years he had grown in the past while he might look sixteen again he was something more than a student now with a confident smile at them he turned his eyes to molly who was holding silvenestri around the waist i think it would be a very good idea for you to let my friends go now or i can promise that you will all find you have bitten off more than you can chew harry glared at moody and let his voice slip into the dragon lords deeper register while pulling his wand out and pointing it confidently at charley he knew that his choice of target would be surprising to them but none of them knew just who and what silvanestri was and charlie could be the most dangerous to silvanestri as he was the one who knew the most about dragons dumbledore considered harry for a moment seemingly not surprised at all by anything that had thus far happened and nodded to moody who released tonks but removed her wand from her in the same move tonks joined harry who stepped around her placing himself in front of her that is one old man now silvenestri and then you can all leave this house and i will see you at hogwarts on september 1st as always dumbledore shock his head gently and said no harry your are going to explain to us everything that you have done over the last 24 hours everything that happened since you left this morning harry smiled and turned slightly to face tonks and handed his wand to her without them seeing i ll say this much to you professor death will not like you messing with a deal i have made with him i suggest that you let silvenestri go in a low voice so only tonks could hear he whispered to her can you get this room large enough for silvenestri to reach full size in under a minute tonks nodded and taking a deep breath she started to make the room grow larger with harry wand shocked to feel the power it held compared to her own wand she was afraid of the confrontation building but she trusted him dumbledore and the others looked around the room as it warped around them growing larger and larger harry what do you think you are doing dumbledore murmured as he rose and moved next to molly who was starting to have trouble holding silvenestri as she struggled trying to get to harry the little girl had even bitten molly on the hand in an attempt to get out of her hold and to reach her friend harry smiled then looked over at silvenestri and shrugged change my friend and show them what they have walked into we will deal with changing their memories later in a blink silvenestri smiled and stopped fight molly and her smile grew into a draconic smirk as she started to blur her eyes almost glowing in glee at the fun she was about to have with these lesser wizards molly and arthur both backed away from this child dropping her to the ground as they retreated and dumbledore too stepped back quickly moody looked on with interest as his magical eye told him that this child was under some form of powerful illusion type spell bill and charley weasley looked on in shock as silvenestri started to grow in size the next thing dumbledore knew he was face to face with a monster of legend a large silver dragon wings folded close to its body as the room was only just big enough for its body to fit without crushing half of them two large horns were atop its head each horn a good three feet long there was no spines running down its back or along the tail that folded neatly close to its left legs what the hell is this dumbledore whispered as silvenestri lashed her tail around and knocked molly and arthur across the room with the hit knocking them out cold but not harming them to badly charley sucked in a shocked breath the history of dragons was a necessary part of his studies to attain the position he now had and he knew exactly what stood before him a silver dragon but they are extinct he said in complete shock his voice showing both fear and respect for this beast of legend professor albus dumbledore i would like you to meet silvenestri my friend and companion drawing on the teachings of the copper dragon lord harry set a shield about himself that would negate any magic one of them might manage to throw at him he reached deeper drawing on his powers reaching for the spell that was going to make this terrible hash of a home coming alright now say good bye to her and forget ever seeing her harry thrust one hand up in the air to release the spell memories are a very valuable thing dumbledore they hold power for good or ill now its time to forget having seen silvenestri and myself today so until september 1st a bright flash of light emitted from harry hand and enveloped everyone in the room but tonks and silvenestri when it faded everyone was gone harry was standing next to the fireplace when tonks could see again and silvenestri was still in her true draconic form and still standing where dumbledore had been the dragon looked bemused and not a little upset that her game had ended before it had really begun harry ah what happened to everyone tonks asked walking over to him and watching as silvenestri blurred changing back to her human form before she jumped into the chair dumbledore had been sitting in when it all had started to go wrong well if the spell worked and i do not see why it should not have done so their memories have been altered so they all think that nothing happened to me in the past 24 hours if i placed just the right amount of power into the spell then there will not even be a problem at hogwarts silvenestri should be allowed to come with me at the start of the school year and no one will comment on her presence harry frowned as he considered the exact amount of effort he had placed in that spell but when he looked at tonks he smiled he was sure that he had gotten it just right and he looked at silvenestri who was falling asleep in the chair tonks followed harry sight and smiled then noticed her wand lying next to silvenestri on the chair harry how did you get my wand back moody had it in his robes didnthe she queried taking it and placing it in its holster then handing harry back his own wand harry smiled taking his wand the spell i cast holds everyone but the caster in a moment in time for one minute per person in the room that means that i had nine minutes to alter everyone memories with additional memory charms and to get your wand back harry by then had walked up behind tonks and warped his arms around her tonks noted that harry had also seemed to have found and retrieved the broach for his cloak as well and just smiled at him leaning into his arms but how come they were gone when the spell was over instead of still being here harry chuckled and just shook his head slightly before he leaned close to tonks ear some mysteries are good for people to figure out themselves now help me get silvenestri into your room since i think that you will be staying with me tonight he touched his lips lightly to her earlobe you re awfully confident arentyou mr potter harry waggled his eyebrows at her and tonks smiled but i think you might be right this time tonks looked down at silvenestri and then at harry will she keep this form over night or should i make my room larger now harry also looked at silvenestri still holding tonks and enjoying her warmth against his body he was very glad to be back with her and after this awful scene he was looking forward to being quite alone with her i would make it bigger now just to be safe tonks nodded and managed to get out of harry grip slapping him lightly on the arm as a gentle reprimand for imprisoning her when she had work to do walking over to her room she started to make it larger even as the lounge shrank back to its usual proportions harry picked up silvenestri and joined tonks and they entered the bedroom where he placed silvenestri on tonks bed and he pulled the blankets over her and planted a light kiss on her forehead by way of a good night tonks watched harry with a gentle smile liking this new view of the teenager who seemed to be anything but a teenager when he turned to her she lead the way to his room and quite promptly informed him that he could get those lecherous thoughts right out of his mind they were going to be getting a good nights sleep after all mr potter i have to be certain that you love me i dontdo casual she mused as they settled to talk there would be nothing physical between them until she knew he loved her and it was not just a crush on either of their parts as the night grew late they talked about the seven hours he had been gone seven hours for tonks but so much longer for harry tonks would know much of it before morning if not all there was to know thanks to the
