 a n well that chapter was short but big hints big hints read between the lines people if you want to guess where this is all going jkr own hp and co and i own the rest alright that is out of the way chapter six a bet is a bet is a bet it may be that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong but that is the way to bet damon runyan harry and hermione did not go to the library to enjoy the dessert prepared instead both of them headed back to their room neither felt good about eating at the moment and both felt horrible about ron had said or failed to say harry could not help but feel like he had lost his friend his first friend it hurt him a great deal almost as bad as during the triwizard tournament he felt like ron no longer trusted him hermione felt torn she never was as good of a friend with ron as she was with harry she doubted that she and ron would even be friends without harry but now she felt guilty because she was dating harry but felt joyous at the same time harry was the best thing that had every happened to her and ron wanted her to give him up just to make him feel better about himself she felt guilty because she was being selfish but she knew her answer i love you hermione whispered kissing his cheek and i you mione harry returned the kiss he pulled back and looked at her eyes trying to see past her tears are you okay yes she whispered just like harry to care about her when she should be worried about him but the question is are you fine he looked at her for a few moments wiping off the stray tears on her cheek he felt lost his first friend was gone and he had no idea what the weasleys would think about him i really dontknow i just want to let tonight pass and start my training tomorrow i want you to stay by my side forever if that is too much to ask he looked up from the floor finding a smile and fresh tears within her eyes why are you crying because hermione whispered surrounding him with a hug and her love the lost look on his face as he spoke shook her soul so hard he needed her more than either of them had realized before and she was not going to let ron or anyone take her away from him now let go to bed she watched as the smile she loved grew back onto harry face alright harry opened the door for her before closing it behind himself hermione slipped out of his reach and headed toward the bathroom grabbing a large shirt from one of his drawers you change out here and then you can freshen up hermione said through the now closed bathroom door harry did as she asked and looked for a book as he waited he kept his shirt on incase someone came in on them as they studied he wanted to read to her like he did the night before it was something that he had enjoyed doing knowing she was listening to him and only him he turned when he heard a knock on the door figuring it was ron he walked over and nearly threw the door open if you haventcome to apologize then you can leave harry said before the door was even open my dear boy what must i apologize for dumbledore asked with a chuckle sorry sir harry said stepping back into the room come in he offered but dumbledore just shook his head thank you for the offer dumbledore said with a smile i know what can go on in a teenager bedroom there was a twinkle in his eyes as he spoke we have done nothing sir harry said not making eye contact he suddenly felt a wave of guilt wash over him for other reason than sleeping with a young girl that alone is not considered appropriate to most but as quickly as that came a comforting wave over came him and he relaxed i know that harry dumbledore chuckled once more but i can back to give you two these back from inside his robe he withdrew harry and hermione wand where harry started to ask dumbledore placed them in harry outstretched hands after your original confrontation with mister weasley you dropped them dumbledore said with a smile you will need them tomorrow oh and hermione i will not put harry through too much harry turned to see hermione wearing another one of his t shirts like she had the night before she was blush as she looked over his shoulder good night and harry be ready tomorrow at nine you may accompany him hermione if you choose to with that dumbledore smiled and left the couple to themselves harry turned around to hermione finally giving her his full attention you are very sneaky harry said trying to be angry with her but the smile on her face only made him love her even more she looked lovely with the shirt ending right below her underwear he right now wanted to lift her into the bed and kiss her senseless he held out her wand now let get to bed hermione took it promptly you choose a book hermione asked as harry closed the door he shook his head he was trying his hardest not to wrap his arms around her as they spoke you mind if i choose you go right ahead harry said walking over to her and kissed her lightly on the lips be quick about it though harry walked over to the bed and got underneath the covers as he watched hermione he found himself without the need of madame pomfrey anymore the dizziness was gone he no longer felt any pain within his chest maybe dumbledore was right maybe hermione did have something to do with his healing hermione searched the bookshelves carefully she knew which book she wanted and she also wanted to torture him slightly she knew he loved to be as close as possible but what amazed her the most was that she could send those types of feelings through a male alright that enough harry said he climbed out of the bed quickly and ran over to hermione side pick a book which one hermione asked turning to face him anyone harry said he placed one hand underneath her legs and lifted her off the ground supporting her back with his other hand you are going to bed now he turned around and with some luck hermione grabbed the book she had wanted to read she giggled as he carried her to the bed he gave her a questioning look as he placed her lightly onto the bed what you re so cute hermione said getting under the covers he slide in by her and gave her another questioning look before she giggled once more never mind she said shaking her head alright mione harry said moving right beside her what book are we reading this one hermione said positioning herself on his shoulder she showed the book to him winnie the pooh harry could not help but raise an eyebrow to her why this one harry said flipping through the pages of the book he was expecting to be reading hogwarts a history again this did not look like something hermione would normally read he had never read it only heard about from dudley as he complained about having to read it from harry cupboard this is a children book right he asked trying to shake away from previous thoughts yes harry hermione said lifting up so she could kiss him lightly on the lips and now you get a chance to read it she cuddled up to him once more as he opened the book she knew he never had a childhood and she wanted him to experience some of her joys from hers this is my favorite book my father used to read it to me when i was at home harry just nodded as he opened the book chapter one in which we are introduced to winnie the pooh and some bees and the stories begin harry read some little emotion flew through his heart as he began to read to her he enjoyed this story as it progressed and found himself wishing that he could have a small son or daughter to read it too looking down at the sleeping form of his girlfriend harry knew he had found the person that he would spend eternity with closing the book he put it with his glasses on the nightstand and turned off the light he brought her closer to his chest kissed her lightly on the top of her head and drifted slowly off to neverland harry woke to the soft sniffling of someone he reached for hermione instinctively hoping she was alright she was not by his side but she was in the room he could feel it in his bones reaching for his glasses his eyes began to adjust to the darkness mione angel he called trying to find her he sat up and looked toward the chair by the bathroom there was a shadow of someone hunched over he climbed out of the bed and rushed over to where he perceived hermione to be angel harry hermione voice said as he got closer he felt something rush toward him and tackle him he grunted as a full mane of bushy hair caught his breath and fell onto his back hermione what wrong harry asked she began to cry into his chest her sobs nearly overwhelming him harry dontleave me hermione whispered into his chest i gave you my word i wouldn t harry said trying to calm her down you gave me yours too he ran a hand through her hair and then kissed her head lightly why did you say this i got a letter hermione whispered as she broke out into sobs he could not get anything out her as she tried to breathe so he slipped his hand between them and found the letter in her grasp he gave a slight tug on it only to feel her pull back mione harry said kissing her head lightly you have to trust me do you trust me a nod into his chest can i read the letter she nodded once more will you give it to me she shook her head as he began to rub her back alright alright he chuckled a bit he knew she was stubborn and it was one of the qualities in her that he loved why not she said something into his chest but he could not catch a word of it mione you need to speak coherently dontread it aloud hermione said letting harry take the letter from her dear miss granger if you are reading this then your family is alive and well including your sister in order for them to stay that way you must give us your precious by the end of the month or they all will die lord voldemort the entire letter was written in blood harry felt his hand crumple it up as he tried to continually comfort the angel on his chest we re telling someone no we can t hermione finally looked up at him her eyes pleading with him he ll kill them you cantlet him do that you can t hermione grabbed tightly onto his shirt and shook him once or twice as she spoke hermione i ll do everything in my power to help them harry said as she turned back into his chest but we need to tell someone because as of now i cantdo anything to help them maybe serge will get them but i swear to you he will pay for what he has done or will do he harms one hair on them he will not survive our next encounter he said this was a great deal of force and made her look him square in the eye she needed to know he was there she needed to know that he would do anything to protect her and her family i love you mione and damn it if you want the moon on a lease you ll get it i will kill voldemort for you just so you can be happy his tears had joined hers now as they cried but his were tears of want he wanted her to understand that nothing would change how he felt about her and there was nothing he would not do for her hermione stayed close to his chest she needed the closeness since that letter came a short while before harry woke up an owl came and delivered the letter to her how it found her she had no idea she believed herself to be safe here with harry and at dumbledore s now some bastard had found her hermione needed harry to help her get over this and she needed him to do something thank you harry hermione whispered into his chest can we go back to bed she looked up at him pleading she needed the comfort of their bed and their covers but most of all his arms wrapped tightly around her alright my angel harry said lifting her like he had the early in the night harry stood with much difficulty trying to find his balance and keep hermione safe in his arms at the same time he did eventually find his balance he carefully placed her back onto the bed and pulled the sheets over her before lying down as well she cuddled up immediately and held him tightly dontleave hermione voice pleaded with him the rare emotion that she spoke with shocked him the passion and want and love and everything good under the sun were within her voice i cantlove harry said lifting her head to look at him i here he touched the center of her chest right above her heart i here and you canttake me out of there with all the magic in the world as long as there still is a beat in your heart you will know my love and as long as there is one in my i promise you will be happy hermione nodded into his chest as she pulled him closer i love you mione he said as he began to give her a small back rub he wasntgoing to fall asleep for the remainder of the night he promised to protect her and if that meant missing a few hours of sleep then he would hermione finally calmed down and returned to a peaceful sleep or at least that was what it felt like to him she was breathing deeply now and a tear had not fallen since she climbed onto his chest his angel was safe and he would remain awake to make sure of it clucking the letter in one hand harry began to rub her back once more with his other she let out a soft sigh clinging to him even harder he knew she was safe now with that smile on her face hermione awoke opening her eyes slowly to find two emerald green ones staring deeply at her a smile grew on her face until she noticed the small hint of red in them his smile only grew larger as he kissed her forehead and began to watch her once more harry yes love harry said playing with her hair did you go back to sleep hermione asked sitting up the night before was coming back to her and she began to feel guilty about it he shook his head by kept his smile did you sleep yes but hermione started but he placed his finger over her lips then everything is right in the world harry said replacing his finger with his lips you still tired she shook her head trying to speak again but harry placed his finger over her lips once more then i suggest you shower hermione nodded amazed at the calmness in his voice i love you harry hermione whispered kissing his cheek thank you i love you too mione he lay back on the bed but did not close his eyes he stared at her for a few moments before she started to blush what she turned away and was not used to that kind of attention harry just smiled at her time to start the day harry said hermione nodded and got up from the bed she gathered her clothes for the day and ran to the bathroom quickly harry watched her as she did all of this still taking in the night he just had hermione spent the entire night on his chest and he could not stop staring at her something about the way her mouth formed a small smile as she took a deep breath or when her brow furrowed for a moment before relaxing he now began to wish she had sleep longer he enjoyed just watching her your turn hermione said stepping out of the shower she took an extremely fast one not bothering to wash her hair today she wanted harry to be wide awake and maybe a nice long shower would do that i want you awake for today dumbledore is speaking to us yes and i speaking to him too harry said sitting up he still held the letter in his hand hermione froze where she was hermione we have to talk to him about this she nodded once and he climbed out of bed to wrap his arms around her deep in him he knew she had not though about it at all since she feel asleep again and taken her shower you have to talk about this i know but her voice trailed off as she clung to him once more she did not want to seem weak but every time she thought of what could happen to her parents and her sister oh god her sister had barely lived and was turning eleven this year she wanted her so badly to come to hogwarts to see this side of the world and now mione if a single hair is off place on any of them your mum your dad your sister harry said this forcefully they are your family and now are apart of mine my family is the only thing in life i care about anymore and i need my family you are the most important part of my family and if something happens to you or anyone you care all you have to do is tell me hermione nodded once more but made no move to let go of him i ve got an idea what she looked up at him the questions beginning to work through her mind we are going to bring that large chair into the bathroom and you are going to sit on it as i shower the words were out of his mouth fast that he could stop them it truly was the only idea he had at the moment she wanted to be close to him but did not want to rush their relationship you d have to keep your eyes closed and he began to stutter and could not find the words he knew his face was bright red as was hers but she made no move to let him go are you sure hermione asked uncertainly she liked the idea of being close to harry even if it was only a few feet away but in the bathroom as he showered yes harry said seeing the look on her face he trusted hermione with so much more that maybe she realized and he wanted to know that not matter what he trusted her i want you to feel safe and since you dontseem to want to get out of my arms i highly doubt you d want to be alone in the room for a while could we move the chair to the door hermione said i just dontwant to intrude on something i not supposed to see yet harry looked down at her and saw the mischievous glint in her eyes but i do want to know you are near me alright harry said with a smile he was trying hard not to show the blush i sorry about suggesting that right away i know you wanted to take it slow hermione leaned up and kissed him gently you were thinking about me hermione said as she pulled back and that is the way i like it she giggled once before loosening her grip around him harry released her waist and picked up one of her hands as she let go of him they proceeded over to the chair here she finally let go and allowed him to carry the chair to the bathroom door you sit harry motioned she mock glared at him for a moment before sitting now let me shower then we will go and enjoy breakfast together she nodded as he grabbed his clothing and kissed her forehead as he walked past her you will stay there right she looked at him almost glaring at him for questioning just checking he said with a laugh i see you in a bit love with that harry turned and walked into the bathroom shutting the door behind him hermione let out a sigh watching the door that harry had just walked through she knew he was looking out for her and trying to protect her but who was protecting him seeing him care the way he did about her only strengthened her resolve to bury those memories of emptiness or just down out and destroy them he would be loved even if she was only one who loved him for who he was not who he may have defeated can i come in grace voice said from the other side of the main door sure hermione said almost getting up from the chair one look at the bathroom door made her stop and sit back down the door open hermione watched the door open slowly and as a tawny cat come bounding into the room and onto her lap crookshanks he spent the night with me grace said walking in she looked like she had just woken up as well i hope you dontmind not at all hermione said absentmindedly petting the cat you really like him dontyou grace nodded as she took a seat on the bed grace looked up at hermione questioningly you mean crookshanks grace asked from the looks on her face hermione could guess who the other person that grace did not voice was both of them hermione said with a knowing smile grace looked down blushing well i have to say that both of them are already taken hermione said keeping a small smile on her face i know but harry was the first boy to be kind to me grace said looking up at hermione other than my father i know what you mean hermione said harry was the first boy that wasntmean to me he was also my first real boyfriend grace looked down once more but hermione knew she had to keep speaking this young girl remaindered her so much of herself that sometimes it was scary right down to the shyness and lack of confidence in her appearance you will make a lot of men jealous some day i ve told her that since she was born hermione turned to see serge dressed like the first day they had met him sorry but she wasntin her room and i figured she was talking to you we were just talking dad grace said standing up she walked over to her father and gave him a hug morning she said as she released hermione could not help but cry a bit as she watched the interaction she began to remember how her dad would come and wake her up like serge just did mione are you okay harry called rushing out of the bathroom immediately he was by her side trying to help her stop the tears what wrong nothing she whispered trying to hide the tears from an on looking serge and grace it silly really she did not want anyone to see her cry harry just shook his head and pulled her into his embrace mione if this is about what i think it is harry looked at her pausing as he tried to get her to look at him he had felt her pain in the shower and cut his short it was not horrible until he heard the door open a second time and then he barely had his pants on he still did not have his shirt on but that did not matter what mattered was the angel he was trying to calm down mione she nodded once he looked over his shoulder to see serge and grace still standing by the doorway we ll be down in a few minutes harry vaguely saw serge nod and pick up grace as he left the room it silly dontworry about me hermione said trying to wipe a tear again hermione if you are worried about your parents then that is natural harry said holding her head in his hand he began to rub his thumb across her cheek trying to calm her down i feel lost without mine mione it is natural to feel that way and i already told you if anything does happen to them or to you especially you then voldemort will not survive our next encounter he kissed her lightly on the cheek trying to get her to look at him thank you harry hermione said resting her head on his shoulder she loved it when he held her close where she could feel his breath against her hair just knowing you are here helps lighten the load the same for me mione harry whispered as he stood up taking her with him same for me he smiled at her and kissed her head now let me finish dressing and then we ll go have breakfast hermione looked up at him her face blushing wildly hermione did not realize that he did not have a shirt on she loved how his body felt against hers and how the slightest touch to her skin caused a shiver down her spine but how could she not notice he did not have a shirt on alright hermione said letting go of him she sat back in the chair and let him walk into the bathroom to get his shirt he put it on and quickly brushed before walking out of the bathroom she picked up his hand and gave him a soft kiss let go he nodded once before they headed toward the door once again they entered the dinning room with everyone and like the day before everything stopped as they entered hermione just shook her head and let harry lead her over to the same seats as the night before as they sat everyone else began to eat but no one talked harry slowly began to put food onto hermione plate as he noticed ron had stood up and left along with ginny dontmind them bill said with a smile he looked up over at the older weasley as harry put food on his own plate ron hasntquite gotten over what you talked about last night well he ll be over it by the end of the day serge said looking up from his plate him and harry are sparing later today what do you mean hermione asked her ears peaking up from the word sparing well harry training session starts today and i want to know his limits serge said he put up his hand and began to silently count down on his fingers as he counted down to zero harry watched mount weasley explode what do you mean sparing mrs weasley said standing up mrs weasley we are not going to argue like last night serge said with a chuckle in his voice i dontknow if you ve noticed but harry is the only one who has survived an assault from this voldemort character the ideal scenario is that he will have all the help he can get before heading off to fight voldemort and winning in order to do that he needs the love of his girlfriend and the trust of his best friend your son ronald i want ronald to be in top form for this and that means the kid has to get over whatever lovesick notice he has rolling through his mind but why must he fight harry if he hates him as much as he does right now mr weasley asked serge harry felt the need to ask this too but mister weasley beat him to it well i figure between the two of them they knock enough sense in each other for ron to get over it serge said with a smile when you say sparing do you mean boxing harry asked as he took the rest of the conversation in in one sense dumbledore said harry looked over at the older man and could not find the twinkle in his eyes or a smile on his face you two will fight and try to get over this problem that ron has started for you neither of you will be harmed in this with the exception of bruising and sore muscles it is of the utmost magnitude that you two solve this dispute before your training begins harry how are you going to get him to fight me harry asked looking over at hermione she looked worried about this and gave her hand a gentle squeeze well see here is the hitch in our plan serge said looking over at mister weasley the man nodded once before serge continued i ve talked it over with arthur and he and i ve come to the decision that in order for ron to really fight you there needs to be something for him to gain serge looked over at hermione and harry could see the sadness in his eyes as he did so what will he be gaining hermione asked she did not like the way serge was looking at her with pity in his eyes he will be told that the winner is allowed to go on a date with you serge said harry felt the rage beginning are you insane harry stood up and yelled there was no way he was going to fight ron over hermione hermione had made her choice he was her choice what the bloody hell kind of plan is that i ll ask you once harry serge face turned cold as he stared back at harry watch your language in front of my daughter i agree with you harry dumbledore said standing up from his chair harry turned toward the older man and glared at him it was probably dumbledore idea in the first place i have often not agreed with my grandson methods he often is irrational and does not fully comprehend some things but as my idea did not work last night he has requested that his way be tried harry relaxed slightly taking comfort that dumbledore would not force him to go through something as stupid as this harry relax and let me say something hermione said standing up she picked up his hand and tried to calm him down the others may not have seen it but she did she saw the small bolts of lightning escaping his eyes as he raged he nodded once but the bolts remained as he glared at serge now why did you want to do this she glared at serge but felt it was right that he had a chance to explain himself well if we give him a chance to fight for you maybe he will get the idea knocked through his head that harry will do anything to protect you serge said smiling i saw harry fight and i think he ll give ron a good run for his money what if he doesntwin hermione asked she had seen harry fight and she felt confident about it but that did not mean she was not worried he ll learn something in the process serge said trying not to make eye contact some stupid fight to see how much i need to learn is not worth it harry said crossing his arms he felt like he was close to leaving the room there was no reason for him to fight ron over this why should i prove my love for hermione when the whole world knows that i love her already ron doesn t serge countered he stood up and placed his hands on harry shoulders only to be thrown back several feet and crash through his chair donttouch me harry said i told you i dontneed to prove me love to anyone beside myself and hermione if ron canttake it then he can go straight to harry hermione said turning him to face her calm down harry body relaxed she could feel it underneath her hand now you hermione walked around harry and began to point at serge who had just hopped back onto his feet she wanted him to stay were he was and not move so she could yell at him how dare you try and mess around with our lives like this push ron and harry into a fight over me when we already had one one that i might add ended badly she was in front of serge now poking his chest what gives you the right to interfere in our lives if you take a step back i ll tell you serge said after a few moments hermione did and finally noticed the room had turned deadly silent i mean i d step back too but seeing as i can t why not hermione asked eying him wearily she took a step back into harry arms and brought her hand up to her mouth trying to cover the gasp serge legs up to his torso were frozen to the ground the light blue ice reflected the light neatly as hermione looked at everyone faces they all seemed to be in shock from what she did serge looked down once and wore a smile on his face that is why did i do that hermione asked finally regaining her voice no less than harry did when he hurtled ron to the door or me to the floor serge said as he removed his glove on his right hand a small white pick axe appeared out of the liquid light and began to take apart the ice harry we ve talked it over with both dumbledore and serge and they both believe that ron will not simply accept the fact that you two are going out mister weasley said trying to help them understand the situation harry did not care at the moment what mattered was they wanted him to fight over his hermione his hermione that chose him over everyone else in the world and that was all that matter in his mind does ginny hermione asked as her mind began to go over everything they had been told we believe she does half heartedly serge said shaking off the final bits and pieces of ice then i ll spare her hermione stated what harry asked surprised at her ginny has to realize too that i love you and nothing is going to change that hermione turned to look at her boyfriend and if i have to knock some more sense into her too then i will she said this all with a smile and gave him a small kiss what do you think i should do harry said he looked at hermione trying to find the answer he did not like the idea of fighting his first and one of his best friends try and bring our friend back hermione said she wrapped him in a hug followed by a passionate kiss she tried to let him know no matter what the outcome she was his by the look on his face when she pulled back he knew already i ll fight him harry said as hermione turned around in his arms i wontlike it but i ll fight him very well dumbledore said harry could tell the man was trying to smile and show a good mood but something was troubling him after breakfast harry you arthur and i will discuss some things and serge will prepare hermione for the bout with miss weasley for know let just enjoy the meal and discuss some happier matters when is moony coming back harry asked as he helped hermione back into her seat he wished to speak to the old marauder about sirius since they had not had a chance to talk as of yet in the holiday he and tonks are out looking up some information for me and will return within a few days dumbledore said he can explain it to you when he returns harry harry do you know what you and hermione did mister weasley said once harry had returned to his breakfast hermione and grace were rapidly discussing how to take care of a cat and what hogwarts was like no harry said and shook his head i assumed wandless magic harry what you did is called elemental magic if i am correct mister weasley said looking at dumbledore dumbledore nodded once before looking toward serge who had returned to his meal everyone turned to look at him as he continued to eat but looked up confused slightly why everyone staring at me he asked with fork half way between his mouth and plate would you please explain to everyone what elemental magic is dumbledore said harry let out a breath he had not realized he was holding the twinkle and smile were back in place in the old professor now he asked placing his fork down on his plate dumbledore nodded his head once i was saving that for the class this year what class hermione questioned harry could not help but chuckle it was so like hermione to immediately get into a conversation if school was involved i would be providing some assistance to the dada teacher this year on certain material but from the looks on my grandfather face he wants you all to know about it now serge shook his head elemental is a broad term one with many definitions for now and time sake i will break it up into four different groups lightning water ice fire and shadow these magic forms mean nothing more than what type of magic you may specialize in often people have no preferences they just work with all four but with weaker results but when someone is able to use said elemental magic wandlessly they are the specialists and usually are restricted to a single element that way but cast it with a great amount of power and density both hermione and harry and i suspect your son ronald as well are specialists so we can use wandless magic hermione said nearly jumping in her seat with glee she had always wondered what it would be like in one sense yes serge said but i believe that harry will be the one out of all three of you to fully exploit wandless magic harry looked up from his plate what do you mean fully exploit wandless magic harry asked not really wanting the attention well both hermione and ronald will be able to do some wandless magic serge said trying to explain everything but with you you will be able to do more difficult spells with less movement and the same amount of thought as you would with a wand harry just shook his head and rested it in his hands why was he always the special one how do you know this hermione asked shocked at the statement she knew harry was powerful but this completely surpassed the ideas she had of his strengths well you were able to freeze my feet to the floor but from the look in your eyes i could tell you wanted me to stay put and did so without actually knowing what you did serge said with a smile harry on the other hand has already surmounted a small amount of control over his abilities when he destroyed that door putting that much power through a small concentrated source is incredibly difficult and when he threw me to the ground he had to use a great amount of magic to control that much power i weigh a great deal and my hands still feel numb and i was surprised they werentburnt it was because you were on the ground hermione said softly harry looked over at her before she sighed once electricity makes a current and the current went through serge body you sent such a powerful surge through that it hurt his hand to stay on and had to pull off kind of like that i think serge said with a smile there more to it than the muggle aspect of electricity but the basic principles are the same can i finish my breakfast or is there going to be anything else he sat back down in his chair and did not wait for an answer hermione and grace had turned back into their conversations and dumbledore was talking to mister and mrs weasley about something harry we ve got five galleons riding on you so you better win fred said looking over at george who nodded both held large smiles on their faces who took a bet against you harry asked sorry harry but when it comes to ron and his anger he about as bad a ginny bill said especially on this matter charlie said with a smile what do you mean harry asked intrigued by the bet well before we met you at the memorial service bill started he leaned forward on the table so harry could hear better all ron could talk about was getting with hermione basically he had this plan set out and when he saw you and hermione together he must ve snapped charlie reasoned but why bet against me harry asked well he was receiving some hand to hand training from bill early in the summer charlie said from the training he improved since day one bill agreed not good enough fred said with a knowing smile harry will win george said i not so sure boys arthur added his two sense in ron has had the extra training that harry hasn t wanna double it the twins said in unison i ll get in on this serge said harry turned to him shocked how could everyone be betting on this he did not even know if he was going to win from the sounds of it he was probably going to lose no you still have to take me to diagon alley grace said from across the table if i win i ll get you a pet serge reasoned this brought a smile to grace face so what is the bet now bill asked fifteen sounds good serge said pulling a small pouch off his belt he opened it and took out a stack of coins from it i ll pay for five he set the stack of coins on the table if all of you are in on this arthur said trying not to make eye contact with his wife i ll put five down on my son very well dumbledore said with a smile and twinkle in his eye now that is all settled harry you will have about an hour before your bout hermione a little bit longer than that harry i would like to speak with you in my office harry nodded and stood up from the table i ll be back shortly love he kissed the top of her head grace and i will wander for a bit hermione said looking to the younger girl she reminded her of a young friend that she had in elementary school and if juliet ever got back the two of them were sure to be best friends harry must have felt her feelings because she felt the small squeeze from his hand and the caring look in his eyes washed away her pain i ll be there in a few minutes serge said from his seat arthur and i have to discuss a project i need his help on alright join us in the study dumbledore said directing harry to exit the room sir there is something i need to talk to you about harry said feeling the letter in his pocket is this about tom dumbledore asked as they entered the study harry nodded as he took a seat dumbledore sat behind a large wooden desk not unlike the one in his office hermione got this last night harry took out the note and handed it to dumbledore trying to remain calm dumbledore simply nodded once as he handed the note back to harry i want to thank you harry dumbledore said looking at harry with pride in his old eyes for what for taking care of hermione during this tough time in her life dumbledore said harry blushed underneath the gaze as the professor continued minerva and i both knew that the time would come when her family was subjected to this kind of attack but had not predicted it would be so soon in all aspects hermione has been able to handle this better than expected and i can speak for both of us when i say we are very proud of both of you you for taking care of her when she needed it the most and her for looking out for you because you are too stubborn to see your own problems at times harry was shocked for a moment before speaking thank you sir harry said trying to comprehend it all still i do have a request that you send someone to get them back not look for them get them back here with hermione i would go myself but i have no idea where to start he spoke forcefully he knew he was about the only student who could speak like this to dumbledore and at this point felt grateful for that fact i will send someone by the end of the day to go and attempt to return them safely dumbledore said he gave harry a smile and it comforted his a little i hope that this will satisfy the need to help hermione and let me make this clear you are not to go off half cocked and try to rescue them yourself i believe this would upset hermione more dumbledore raised an eyebrow and harry shrunk back into his seat everything sorted out i hope serge said walking into the room his glove was back on his right hand and walked with a cane yes now you are to help harry learn some basic skills before this bout dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eyes harry i will make sure everything is prepared for the person to search for hermione family you know what that means right serge said as dumbledore left what harry asked as serge walked behind the desk means i ll be the one to look for them serge said he gave harry a smirk as he let him comprehend it all harry understood that serge was related to hermione but did not know how or why he was to be the one to get her family all he cared about was that he succeeded now there is something i want to give to you you gave it to my grandpa several years ago he reached underneath the desk and pulled out a large sword in a sheath godric sword harry whispered as he reached out to take it yeah when we started to plan this bout i had grandpa al get this from his office serge said allowing the harry to take the sword you will be using it to fight with harry looked on a wonder at the sheath rubies donned the sheath and glistened in the morning sun alright now that you have that out serge stood up from the chair he removed the glove from his hand and taken his cane up in the other like the first time he saw it two white curved blades appeared on each end of cane he put the glove back on and walked around the table i going to teach you some basic techniques to use mind you i using a completely different weapon then you but with some help i think i can help you know what to expect from an attacker when you do something alright harry said standing up from his chair he unsheathed sword and looked at it for a moment it felt heavy and although it looked powerful harry began to wonder if he could use it effectively and fast enough to combat the ruby on the handle was a nice touch especially the dancing flame within he began to swing it once only to have the sword be accompanied by a bright light he turned his eyes away and felt the weight of the sword grow less in his hands bloody hell serge said harry turned back to look what was once a great sword thick and powerful now was a thin long blade with only one edge sharp harry could only guess that the one edge was extremely sharp the ruby on the handle remained but the handle itself was smaller how did you do that do what harry said looking up from the blade it felt more comfortable and natural to be in his hand like this he swung it once and smiled at the feeling how easy it was to do so change it like that serge said it just felt awkward in my hands like it was before harry said swinging it once more now i dontfeel strange or nothing harry what you just did was an incredible amount of wandless magic serge said stepping closer to him it called a katana may i see it harry cautiously held out the katana something within serge eyes told him not to trust him as harry held out the katana he noticed serge left arm flinch and out of instinct gracefully swung the blade to meet serge incoming one good very good serge said getting into a fighting stance harry took to holding the katana with both hands and stood facing him a successful parry now i going to swing my lower blade to you followed by my upper one i want to block both of them harry looked at him confused at first but nodded he watched the lower blade swing forward and harry met it before catching the upper one with the blade again good i dontthink you ll have any trouble using that is that all i going to get harry asked feeling more dread over come him the extent of his training was summed up in five minutes a large knot began to fill his gut as serge nodded but what i going to teach you is to focus your element or innate through your weapon serge said with a smile now point the tip of the blade to me harry did as he was asked letting his left hand drop concentrate on sending the magic through the weapon the katana should amplify the strength of the specialized magic you choose to do harry nodded once before trying to take in the power he had earlier in the day he closed his eyes and concentrated trying to get something to happen he dove deep searching for his love for hermione and brought that to the surface to use as the catalyst and with a smirk he felt the power release shit harry heard something drop to the floor and opened his eyes to see flames covering his sword what harry dropped his katana in shock how did i do that i dontknow serge walked forward he picked up the blade in his covered hand and lifted it carefully i was sure you were a lightning specialist i was positive he began to mumble to himself as he examined the blade and hilt you cantbe him you cantbe they re heirs who heirs harry asked feeling intrigued by serge ramblings serge looked up at harry and held the katana in his hand and gave the hilt to harry harry took it back as serge walked wordlessly to his cane and picked it up harry do not worry about that at this time serge said placing a hand on harry shoulders you will know in good time you will know everything you will need to know before this year is out serge smiled once before leaving the room at a feverish pace harry fell back into the chair by dumbledore desk trying to figure out what happened and the dread kept mounting
