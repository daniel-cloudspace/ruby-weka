while fine the door to the room above the kitchen slammed and silence fell through the house after 15 minutes of yelling and shouting now the only thing james potter could hear was his wife sobbing in the kitchen he walked back down to the kitchen and sat next to her he put a hand on her back to comfort her but lily kept crying into her hands and rocking back and forth in her chair don t he told her that prat isntworth it that prat is our son james lily looked at him with tearful eyes or at least what has become of him he looked at the table i dontknow what to do anymore we ve tried everything flashback mum dad what are you doing here young harry asked as he entered the headmaster office and saw his parents sitting there with worried looks on the faces his friend followed him in professor mcgonagall told me dumbledore wanted to see me sit down harry james ordered his son you can leave this is a private conversation he told harry friend who quietly turned on his heel and closed the door behind him what going on harry asked suspiciously as he took his seat we want you to have a second sorting lily told her son what why i end of flashback knock knock knock james came back to reality as he heard a knock on the kitchen door both he and lily looked up and saw sirius was standing in the doorway waiting for their approval to come inside lily shot her look at james he knew what she was thinking about he nodded and invited his friend to sit with them trouble in paradise sirius asked trying to cheer the coldness in the room james and lily looked even more depressed than before gee i sorry i didntmean to upset you guys it not you sirius james said it harry again oh sirius said he sounded like he didntwant to drag into another harry conversation they had those quite often lately since harry came back for the summer well i dontwanna add troubles with the ones you already have with your kid so i ll just go and see you tomorrow yeah sirius got up and tried to make a quick exit through the door but didntget the chance to leave before james shut it with his wand locking sirius in so he couldntescape sirius i need a favor james said quietly sirius turned around to face his friends he had a fearful expression on his face he didntsay anything for a moment because he knew james wanted him to respond and sirius knew exactly what the favor he wanted to ask him was he finally cracked the silence was just too tensed oh no no he shook his head forcibly sirius please james pleaded lily looked at him hopefully her great emerald eyes wet from tears no james come on you want me to no i cantget in there please dontmake me prongs for the sake of our friendship if you want it to last please dontmake me do this sirius was now down on his knees begging james with couple of real tears in his eyes you are our only shot sirius lily said with a sob please try and talk to him maybe he will listen to you but why me sirius whined why not moony he knows him better he teaches him and he knows what he like it a full moon padfoot james reminded him sirius muttered a simple oh james went on and besides you re his godfather not moony yeah but that is suppose to take place after you die sirius muttered we ve tried everything sirius everything even the best psychologists and healers couldnthelp him lily said of course you took him to a muggle shrink what you d expect sirius took james glasses off his face and put the tip of the ear piece in his mouth oh so let me get this right you re saying you re a wizard and that your parents want you to suffer and be a good gryffindor is that what you called that thing umm yeah i see i see well i can write you a prescription for some drugs they should help and while the effect is taking place i ll just give you this beautiful white robe you should get along absolutely fine with it just let someone else feed you sirius imitated in an old wise man voice james snatched back his glasses from sirius who was still on the floor cleaned the tip of sirius spit and put them back on looking very angry will you stop messing around and get serious i am sirius oh forget it james clearly he not mature enough to handle a 16 year old boy lily sounded irritated so when you grow up sirius let us know until then we ll just leave the situation as it is lily spat angrily and crossed her arms but dontcome crawling back on all fours when we wontspeak to you oh well fine sirius got up i guess it time to fulfil my duty as a godfather he walked to the door and just before he left he looked back to see two slightly cheerful faces looking back at him but if that kid of yours starts to bite i have to say that i ll bite back he went up the stairs muttering to himself had to get in there did i a n okay short chapter i know next chapter hopefully will be coming soon i have matriculation exams this month and i hope i could write in the evenings that was just something that was sitting in my head for quiet a while but i didntknow how to start it at first i thought i will start it from the beginning of harry first year but then i got that rebel harry idea and i put it all together and here is the result so did you like it what do you think what should happen next i already wrote the draft for the second chapter and it a conversation between harry and sirius and you ll find out what really going on with harry but i still dontmind getting some ideas for it cause i not very happy with what i wrote please dontflame me for making harry out of character but you must remember that it my story meaning i making the plot and changing the characters the way i want and if you dontlike it you donthave to read it but still thank you for reading the first chapter also please note that in the summery i wrote what would have happen if disclaimer i dontown harry potter a note to all the readers i revised this chapter because people didntlike it before i thought that the previous idea was good but i guess other people didntfind it interesting and believable so i made changes big changes but still saved some stuff i did it because i want people to like my story and not to stop reading it and if they found it boring and very bad planned i d make sure it will be good until they ll like it so here you go the revised version and please review if you liked it better than before if you cantreview again because of problem because you reviewed it before please please review anonymously but with you pen name so i ll know who you are there something you must all remember this is an alternative universe fanfic and most of the stuff that we read in the books didnthappen here sirius and harry parents are alive and harry a slytherin and voldemort is dead and so on and so forth on another subject this story wontchange because of hbp events it has its own universe and i ve got it all planned out and of course there wontbe any spoilers if some things might remind you of scenes from hbp please note that i thought of them before i read the book and not after revan00 dontworry i not abandoning this story i quite like writing it badger dude when did i said that i remember saying that this story might have a romance for harry in later chapters though if you meant this it wonttake a big part from the plot than i guess i was wrong writing the scenes with ginny has been fun and it did take a lot of the plot but other than that there more to come and to expect to nimbirosa and the rest of you who were confused some of you asked how come harry was defeated so easily and quickly by dean the thing is that it not he didntknow how to fight he just didntwant to but now he realized his mistake he wontstay quiet and he will go and fix it more to know about this subject in this chapter and next thanks for everyone else who reviewed and read have a fun reading and do not forget to review chapter 10 the explained and the unexplained harry watched his reflection in the mirror his face was a bit pale but nothing more serious than that he was alone in the boys loo back at hogwarts as he needed some time by himself just to think about some things that bothered him what just happened his voice echoed in his head i let dean thomas take me down without even trying to fight him back what kind of a sissy am i he held on the sink sides tightly and his knuckles went white from the grip like he was afraid to fall and this was his only way to support himself without taking his eyes off the mirror he reached for the tap turned it on and allowed the water flow down in the sink he cupped his hand to fill it with water he closed his eyes as he splashed the water on his face he felt the cold drops slowly dripping down on his cheeks and forehead caressing and tickling him and distracting him for a short moment before he went back to reality he was quite dazed from the whole scene back in hogsmeade he was knocked down by dean thomas a gryffindor a mudblood he will say it to him right in the face if he has the chance no matter how many times he will hear sirius yelling at him to shut up dean deserved this title after what he did to him he felt nothing but hatred towards him right then and he loathed him more than ever before not only he had ginny but also because the treated her like trash harry touched his cheeks in try to see if the whole thing was real what is happening to me am i losing it ginny was right i am a coward coward for not defending myself and my honor for god sake i a slytherin i should have found my courage and fight him like a winner like a real slytherin would have done and not depend myself because ginny weasley was there that girl is nothing but trouble said a voice in harry head i know i trying to stay away from her but still there something about her i cantget away from it like a magnet which draws me to her every time i near her harry defended you have to pull yourself together she will only cause you more pain isntit enough what she done to you thus far no good will come out of it but you know this is fixable so go on and fix it but i coward the voice called whispering inside his head and mocking him i am not a coward harry wasntaware he shouted at the mirror since the room was empty he could hear the word coward playing over and over again in a series of echoes then prove it the voice dared harry let out a long sigh and for a short moment considered hitting the mirror with his fist but he kept his temper down with a last look at his reflection he caught the look in his eyes they were dark green from anger not their usual emerald green fine he said as he left the room i will he walked to the great hall for the halloween feast and found it decorated as it always was on halloween there were pumpkins floating in the air scary faces craved on them and candles placed inside of them illuminating the house tables underneath with soft dimmed light the house tables were filled with all kinds of sweets and special meals for the feast served on the festive golden plates screeches could be heard from up above the crowd of students and teachers and when harry looked up he saw a pack of bats flying close to the enchanted ceiling of the hall there you are blaise said when harry sat down next to him and helped himself to his first dish i thought you were going to miss it wouldntmiss it for the world said harry trying his best to smile the thoughts of the hogsmeade trip were still floating in his head but soon those thoughts were replaced by the halloween spirit and they cheered him up this halloween will be the one this school will remember for ages is everything set up blaise nodded a smirk playing on his lips yep just like you told me he checked his watch and added let see if it will be right on time shall we oh it should start in 4 3 2 1 and he ended with clicking his fingers right then a few sharp whistles came out of nowhere those were soon enough joined with tails of smoke in many shapes and colors sparks of dust sprinkled on the crowd of the onlookers and some of them oohed with awe as at least 15 fireworks zoomed in the air and over their heads everyone was hypnotized at the marvelous display a few minutes later everything went quiet after each of the fireworks exploded with a loud crack and produced all kinds of shapes and forms they spattered the remaining dust around the hall as soon as everyone was sure it was over every student in the hall broke into applause even a few teachers seemed to enjoy it dumbledore was one of them and he seemed to enjoy it the most when harry looked around the staff table he was sure dumbledore nodded to him with a small smile harry never had talked to the headmaster more than a student should have but his parents were in good terms with him how did he know i was up to it i hope i wontget in trouble for it despite that harry couldnthelp but laugh along with blaise after it all ended it was planned that most of the dust will fall right above the gryffindor table sneaking a look at ron weasley harry saw him coughing out a small cloud of glittering dust from his mouth and he laughed harder blaise sighed with satisfaction ahh thanks harry for convincing me to do it merlin knows how boring this school can get sometimes even around the holidays we all need a bit of action and a laugh or two from time to time say how many were there harry asked it seemed like there were less then than fifteen fourteen you re right i counted twice i think i lost one when i dropped the bag sorry you dropped the bag you klutz i know sorry but i think someone ran into me while i was talking with pansy and caused me to drop the bag it was weird though i didntsee anyone around but pansy well maybe you were just nervous around her so you imagined it you still haventtold me what exactly happened with her anyway you still lost one so you owe me 10 sickles for it fine i ll pay you back later oh look harry said suddenly pointing in the direction of the staff table where on the right end sat filch looking very furious at the filth the fireworks left around the hall i reckon he wontsleep for days just because of it he sniggered gosh too bad draco wasnthere to see it blaise said with another sigh he would have loved it harry looked around and realized draco was indeed missing where is he blaise shrugged indifferently in the common room i guess what is he doing there harry asked confusedly frowning avoiding being here of course when that didntseem to make any sense whatsoever or answer harry question blaise went on he doing it every year on halloween haventyou ever noticed harry was shocked hearing this news every year how is it that draco had managed to avoid halloween for the past six years without harry noticing it how come he never talked about it and what did that make of harry who supposed to be draco best friend he never knew about it nor did he ever notice draco reaction to halloween like blaise had was harry so self centered that he didntpay attention to his best friend are you serious he asked blaise nodded but why i dunno i guess he doesntlike halloween that much that why i didntask him this morning to come to hogsmeade with us he been a bit funny lately dontyou think i suppose blaise shrugged again harry got from his seat not feeling hungry anymore or in the mood for the feast come on what where to blaise was taken aback by this to see if he all right come on we ll grab something from the kitchens later he said reluctant to leave the feast or his plate of apple pie blaise joined harry and they left the hall for some reason harry could feel someone was watching him leave but he didntreally care about that right now at the moment the only thing that occupied his mind was whatever was going on with draco harry mind was so busy in trying to think and figure out what would make draco escape the halloween feast every year that he didnteven notice or cared that the head boy just ran into him on his way to the great hall from the grounds harry and blaise just hurried themselves down to the dungeons the slytherin common room was almost empty there were only two second years talking by the fireplace harry didnteven care why they were there and not at the great hall enjoying the feast like everyone everyone except draco who they found in their dormitory there was something fishy going on harry could sense it they caught draco in a very odd situation draco was leaning over an open window by his bed the cold night air of the season blew into the room and a few candles went out draco looked like he was about to sneak out of the room at the sound of the door opening he froze and slowly backed away from the window but did not turn around he reached forward again and closed the window letting the room fill with heat again then he quietly spoke what are you doing here he asked he bowed his head and his back still turned to them it was like he knew it was them even though their eyes did not meet shouldntwe ask you that harry asked taking a look around the room what going on why werentyou at the feast why are you trying to sneak out of the window and why is my trunk open he said once he noticed his trunk was pulled from under his four poster bed and it was open he hurried to see what happened his clothes and books and other personal belongings were all messed up inside it wasntthe usual mess harry left behind but worse bottles of ink were broken and had stained a pair of socks and a few pairs of underwear a few pages from his transfiguration book were torn out and some clothes were poured out of the trunk to the floor like it exploded among them was the most personal and important object of all his father old invisibility cloak which he nicked just before returning to school you went through my stuff harry felt his face flush as his temper started to rise did you take my invisibility cloak draco no whoa hold on with the questions will you i can explain draco said now finally looking back at harry than let hear it harry demanded you had no right to use that cloak it not even mine my father will kill me if he finds out i took it i haventused it yet so what gives you the right to go through my stuff and take whatever you want i didntshow it to you so you could use it without asking me i never even said you could use it harry let him talk blaise interrupted attempting to cool him down fine go on draco talk draco lay down on his bed and adjusted the pillows behind his head to look better at harry i wasnttrying to sneak out i just opened the window to get some fresh air he said calmly and my trunk what were you looking for just a quill and a bottle of ink i desperately needed to write a letter and i just ran out of ink and my quill broke i couldntfind my spare one i didntthink you would mind if i borrow one from you no of course i dontmind harry said calming down a bit but he was still curious and missed some answers who was that letter you wrote for my mother if you must know she owled me and said she felt a bit sick this past week and i got worried so i owled back i sorry for trashing your trunk here let me fix it he pulled out his wand and said the spell the contents of harry trunk flew back inside and everything was clean and fixed again so you didntuse my cloak harry went on after he had slid the trunk back under his bed no what for what would i do with it walk aroundthe school and scare first years to death that could have been one great halloween joke blaise said excitedly you should ve seen what we did in the great hall earlier i thought i heard some explosions draco said softly you didntbomb the hall did you because if you did at least i hope a few gryffindors were scarred draco didntsound like he was joking even when he talked or joked about hurting gryffindors like he always did his tone was different harry thought he was being weird this calm manner didntsuit draco he never talked like that there was always something that bugged him and made him irritated but not now harry thought he would ask about his behavior later after he will get all the answers to his questions draco why werentyou at the feast he continued to investigate draco shrugged didntfeel like it oh so you didntfeel like coming to the halloween feast for the last six years draco blinked once looking confused what are you talking about he asked with the new quiet tone in his voice harry was feeling angry again he was tired of draco mind games you know damn well what i talking about dontlie to me draco blaise said you ve always been avoiding the halloween feasts all right so i think it about time you ll tell us what bothering you yeah what going on blaise added for a minute no one spoke harry waited for a respond but draco just glared at them he started to doubt draco wasnteven listening to them then draco sighed heavily and buried his face in his hands he raised his head to look at them and whispered all right i ll tell you he motioned them to sit and they sat down on the closest bed and waited for him to speak again it been fifteen years he started but added no more harry was about to open his mouth and urge him to continue but draco held up a hand and went on since my father swore he will revenge the dark lord death how silly is this hua it is fifteen years exactly today it may sound a bit lame but every year on halloween i sit down and pray that he wouldntdo anything to fulfill this promise which means he after your parents and godfather he said to harry now i dontknow when he will act but i sure he will eventually and since the dark lord was killed on october 31st i think that when my father will strike when exactly again i really dontknow that why i shut myself out because i concerned about the actions he might take and i wish he would stay low not because i care for his safety but for you parents i care for their lives harry and i dontwant you to suffer from losing them i sent letters to mother telling her to convince him not to do anything but nothing is definite she says he starts to gather power to rally more unconvicted death eaters to join him on his mission he certain that what the dark lord would ve wanted them to do harry had no chance to respond to that the door to their room burst open again and two people stood at the entrance the first a short boy harry saw earlier in the common room the second was none other than professor snape and he looked livid harry never saw him looking more menacing than now here he is professor squeaked the second year boy thank you mcneil i can see him perfectly by myself snape said coldly potter come with me to the headmaster office this instant he ordered wh what did i do harry stuttered like you dontknow the professor said harry exchanged looks with blaise who looked as frightened as he was now potter i haventgot all night for you harry gulped with fear all he did was trying to put some fun in the school he got up from the bed and followed snape up to dumbledore office where he only visited once before in his first year when his parents tried to convince him to take a second sorting to no avail your parents have been notified and soon will join us there but sir i dontunderstand harry said confused why do i need to go to the headmaster office i only did it for the laugh did it for the laugh i wonder what your parents say when they ll discover their son is a death eater a son of two aurors what an outrage what harry yelled how dare y fizzing whizbee said snape right then they reached the stone gargoyle on the second floor i wouldntfinish that sentence if i were you potter you re already got yourself in enough trouble he walked up the spiral staircase now revealed behind the wall after the gargoyle sprang aside harry followed quietly but was furious inside how dare snape call him a death eater snape didntknock on the oak door of dumbledore office but burst in without an invitation harry walked in sheepishly thank you severus for kindly bringing here mr potter sit down harry dumbledore said calmly gesturing one of the chairs in front of his desk there were three chairs there harry guessed the other two will soon be taken by his parents he sat himself in the middle one professor why am i here harry dared to ask dumbledore harry i afraid a grave thing happened not long ago but i cannot tell you more than that not until your parents will join us it was difficult and almost impossible to contact them harry heart skipped a beat at that but we found them at the ministry after they had received an emergency call from work they should be here shortly harry relaxed again when he knew lucius malfoy didnthurt them and that they were all right even though they didntget along sometimes he still cared for their safety harry dumbledore and snape waited until his parents will arrive neither of them said anything while they waited snape stood in the back of the room looking at dumbledore silver instruments harry bowed his head trying not to look at anything particular and sensing dumbledore gaze upon him dumbledore looked very amused and he was tapping his fingers on his desk as a distraction or if it was to get harry attention harry didntknow other than the sound of dumbledore fingers tapping on the desk in the same rhythm there was an owl outside in the cold night air and it hooted sleepily professor mcgonagall quietly entered the room about five minutes later accompanied by james and lily potter who looked very concerned unsure why harry was afraid to look at their eyes so he kept his head bowed professor dumbledore called mcgonagall causing dumbledore to look up as though he haventnotice them come in he got up from his seat and went to greet harry parents with a handshake albus james greeted shaking the old professor hand as did lily from the corner of his eye harry noticed snape wore an ugly sneering look on his face when his parents entered the room it was no secret he despised them and sirius ever since their hogwarts years james lily please sit down dumbledore requested james and lily took the vacant seats on either side of harry chair harry now felt that enough courage was built inside of him to finally look at them he looked first at his father sitting on his left but james did not look back at him but stared pointedly at dumbledore harry turned to look at his mother but she now bowed her head and was wringing her hands uncomfortably in her lap he felt disappointed his parents werenteven trying to look at him he wondered what dumbledore could have possibly told them about him that made them act so uneasy around him he couldnttake it anymore the words just burst out of his mouth i not a death eater he cried lily gasped placing her hand to her mouth and she and james turned to look at him questioningly at once well no one said you are harry dumbledore said he did harry said looking around at snape he felt a bit weird talking like that about his head of house but snape started it james got up from his seat and walked slowly to snape who straightened up here we go again snape one thousand students in this school and you got the nerve to go straight to my son and accuse him without any proof whatsoever are we back to being twelve then i thought since you became a respectable professor in this school you would grow up but accusing your own house student of being a death eater my son you got yourself really low this time snape looked like he was about to pull out his wand and hex james right then and there but before he could manage it dumbledore called gentlemen please there is no need to fight we re here because there something we all need to solve no one here is accusing young harry of anything james turned around and sat back down of course not said lily furiously unconsciously putting her hand on harry in a comforting way the small gesture made him smile there is no way in the world my harry lily dear i haventexplained anything yet may i please do it now dumbledore interrupted lily nodded but first severus minerva could you please leave the four of us alone certainly said mcgonagall and she and snape left the office dumbledore turned to look at the potters and got straight to the point around the end of the great halloween feast we had tonight a spectacular display of fireworks had been made by none other than our harry even if it was without permission he will not get punished for raising the school spirits everyone enjoyed it it was well planned and i thank harry for doing so even if he thought it was meant to be a prank but a few minutes later harry and his friend left the feast why i dontknow harry was about to explain where he and blaise went off to but dumbledore held up a hand and he went on the head boy came to me right then looking utterly horrified and said the dark mark had appeared over the castle the three potters all gasped at the sudden news so we tried to stay calm in order not to alert the entire school the staff of teachers and i went outside and there it was glittering in green but it wasntthe usual dark mark it looked a bit different professor flitwick suggested it was another firework and we indeed saw it disappeared a few seconds later and that why we re here right now but i didntdo it i went back to my dormitory you can ask harry hurried to explain harry i do not think you are responsible for this dumbledore said calmly though that not the reason i called you all here tonight i do think the firework that was set outside used to belong to you right then something made sense i lost one in hogsmeade somebody must have taken it it must have been a student and it easy to change the shape it creates it says so on the sticker placed on it i agree said dumbledore a student did it but whom exactly this person must be someone who wanted to scare to warn from something but my guess is that because this person might be too young to join the death eaters he faked the mark was it on his or hers own accord or under someone orders i hope we will soon find out okay then why are we here if harry isntguilty you said there another issue said james well it does link with this incident i assume that was a sign that something is about to happen and since we all know what happened fifteen years ago we should prepare you for the worst harry didntknow if he should mention what draco just told him about his father would draco want him to tell that it was quite personal wasntit and it will put his father in azkaban and draco might get in trouble but then again it all his parents ever wanted to do lock lucius malfoy in azkaban and if he will not say anything something unexpected might happen to them so what will it be his parents or his best friend thankfully when dumbledore spoke again harry wasntin dilemma anymore it is rumored the death eaters out there starting to gather power again i want you two to be careful if you feel like you have to go back into hiding he said to james and lily and of course harry is safe here that is until the holidays when remus will look after him until they will join you of course harry thought i also in danger voldemort was about to kill me fifteen years ago and if lucius malfoy want to revenge his death that means not only sirius and my parents are in danger but so am i after dumbledore ended the discussion harry once again said goodbye to his parents and returned to his dormitory it was way past curfew and everyone was already asleep and he didntwant to disturb them he would tell them tomorrow what happened if they d ask and they probably will he had troubles sleeping that night his mind was swirling with images of lucius malfoy pointing a wand at his heart and from its tip a streak of green light exploded he woke up several times that night and checked around the room to make sure the only malfoy there was his best friend when his mind wasntthinking about his death dreams of ginny weasley occupied it sometimes they met in an empty corridor and she looked at him with disgust or horror just when he realized he had the dark mark tattooed on his hand and sometimes he was back in hogsmeade main street and she was bending over him again but she was laughing at him for giving up a fight for dean and chickening out i not a coward harry mumbled in his sleep when he finally managed to get some november finally entered the next day harry woke up that morning with puffy eyes caused from lack of sleep he dressed quickly and left the room before any of his roommates could get the chance to ask him what happened last night he would tell blaise and draco when they asked him but not now and he was sure to not bring the subject up himself when he stepped into the common room a group of students gathered around the notice board a new sign has been pinned there and it said how to prove you re not a coward easily just join us on this saturday november 6th for the new and improved dueling club all sixth and seventh year students are welcome to come and join first to fifth year students are allowed to come and watch see you there that sign was teasing him it was like the teachers all knew how he felt at the moment and decided to taunt him he stayed in his place staring at the flier and reading the title a few more times he rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasntdelusional he decided to depart the common room quickly before people flooded him with unwanted questions uh uh uh not so fast potter said someone from behind before harry had managed to escape he turned around to see theodore nott standing on the other side of the common room with folded arms and raised eyebrows hurrying somewhere nott asked sounding interested just breakfast harry replied with a smile he knew what he wanted but he was not going to tell him i didnteat much at the feast last night so i ve heard i also heard that you know nott if i cared i would really want to hear that but i don t so go gossip with the rest of the girls will you and he left feeling quite satisfied with his answer but theodore didntlet it drop when he arrived to the great hall for breakfast he seated himself next to harry you know rumor has is that you good old harry potter finally came around and joined the dark side he whispered right then four other people came to sit in the table around harry draco and blaise sat across from him both looking very smug and crabbe and goyle sniggered to themselves as the sat next to them only in your wet dreams nott replied harry smiling despite himself come on harry what was that scene about last night when snape came and took you to see dumbledore blaise asked people said something about you conjuring the dark mark perhaps you d like to go into detail on the subject erm not right now i won t come on look around harry everyone knows by now they re all looking at you harry looked around the hall people were indeed casting him suspicious looks while whispering among themselves like he didntsee blaise i was with you all day yesterday when could i possibly find time to go outside and conjure the dark mark technically you werentwith me all day yesterday blaise corrected oh yeah well if i joined the dark side then so did you harry said leaning back in his seat and folding his arms what that suppose to mean you know i dont harry didntcare anymore that nott crabbe and goyle and probably the whole slytherin house and all the people around would hear it he had to say it relax blaise all i mean is that the mark was only a firework someone who not me set off it wasntthe real mark that why i was sent to see dumbledore he thought no snape thought i owned it that why you are just as bad as i am i hua blaise stuttered perplexed i know harry smiled now pass me that coffee pot will you i dontwant to fall asleep in class i had no idea okay now leave me alone ron or i ll bat bogey hex you ginny shouted storming out of gryffindor tower she tried to slam the portrait of the fat lady on ron as he managed to get out the fat lady cried out but ginny did not care ron however tried to apologize for his sister behavior and then set off again and ran after her not paying much attention to ginny threats i swear ginny if i catch you around this guy one more time i ll owl mum and you ll be back at the burrow weeping when errol will be the only one who will listen to you sob and that is when he not passed out i said okay didnti she said angrily the last thing i need right now is a death eater in my life good because you wonttalk to him or mention his name again and if i catch you even trying to look at his direction i mean that it it over all right i got it now shove off she quickly snuck into the girls bathroom somewhere she could stay away from ron and ron without any choices left had to stay outside and wait for her to come out so he could keep nagging her about that topic hermione then came over well she asked ron shrugged helplessly you know i dontreally think he done it dontyou take his side hermione i not i just saying it not something he would likely do oh that right i forgot you know him so well ron said sarcastically and hermione rolled her eyes that slytherin death eater bastard git ron suddenly bellowed and made a group of girls who just left the bathroom to scream sorry he said embarrassed ron dontwork yourself up like that she fine she told you she fine hundreds of times this morning you re too protective over her she can protect herself very well she a very strong witch ron ignored her and slightly pushed open the bathroom door and peeked inside there was no sign for ginny and the room was silence if she was crying he would hear her i cantsee her ron whined oh i sure nothing happened to her what will she do drown herself in the toilet jump out of the window she too short ron and besides she sane hermione said she definitely not sane when she around that potter bloke ron argued peeking inside the bathroom again if you really want to know she already left what when ron looked surprised around the time you yelled git i saw her leave with all the girls great then why am i here peeking inside the girls bathroom and missing breakfast i starving ron said striding to the great hall well it was quite funny when people shot you weird glances and thought that the gryffindor prefect is a pervert she giggled hermione ron yelled and that made her only laugh harder but unfortunately for him ron couldntfind his appetite once he arrived to the great hall no matter how loudly his stomach grumbled he kept stabbing his toast with his fork but did not eat it he couldnttake his eyes of harry potter who was sitting over at the slytherin table laughing with his friends all right stop hermione said taking away his fork you ll make a hole in the plate eventually look at him what so funny when was it said that serving an evil deadwizard can be a hoot stop thinking about it ron you re driving me crazy with all these rambling no see what bugs me even when people found out what he is he wasntexpelled from school i bet just from the grin on his face he didnteven receive detention and look at him he always has to be the centre of attention thinking he has such influence on people maybe he imperioused snape and dumbledore or obliviated them so he came out of this innocent i bet there isntone innocent thought in his mind he complained ron ginny barked come of it will you hermione i dontknow how you can stand him shut it ginny you stay out of it warned ron why are you all pissed off today anyway didnthermione tell you she looked expectedly at hermione ron followed her gaze and looked at hermione confused oh right sorry it slipped my mind hermione said and banged her hand to her forehead umm ginny and dean broke up yesterday you did ron asked looking back at his sister yep we had this huge fight and it wasntworking anyway and he was so irritating so i broke it off thank god ron sighed and leaned back in his chair he caught ginny and hermione confused and furious looks and quickly added er i mean he wasntgood for you i told you from the very beginning not to go out with him i know the bloke and he didntseem serious with you i told you i not approving you re not approving anybody ginny snapped standing up from her seat and getting ready to leave well that s that because i care for you sure ron you care for me so you decided to run my life for me you tell me where to go what to do who to date sorry i meant who not to date and who i canttalk about or look at well you know what i sick of it i only one year younger than you i a prefect and i a grown up person mum doesnteven tell me what to do anymore so why are you because someone has to put some discipline in you ron retorted you say it like i a rebel like i dontlisten to anything you or other people say to me and that not true i dontneed you to make my decisions ron if you really care for me how about the next time i ll date someone you wontsay anything and just accept my choice no way he protested but just then hermione hit his stomach with her elbow under the table oww what the hell was that for he looked at hermione and she just raised her eyebrows at him hinting something oh all right fine he finally told ginny while rubbing the side of his stomach the anger on ginny face was replaced by a smile really she asked half believing what she heard was true yes but as long as it not that death eater potter ginny seemed to consider it for a second before she smiled again fine she said and she took off she ll find a loophole in this agreement i know it muttered ron taking a bite off his toast without even noticing harry disappeared from the hall and it was time he will eat something maybe hermione said but remember you promised you will stay out of her love life let her be if she was to make a mistake let her suffer alone dontmake that mistake for her she needs to learn how to deal with life now come on grab a last bite of toast because we have transfiguration now harry remembered he forgot his transfiguration book back in his dormitory once he got it he left the dungeons without hurry even though the bell just rang and he knew mcgonagall would take points from him even if he was being late by one minute because she always was there before the bell rang so he took his time there were a few people around him who hurried to get in time for their lesson probably with snape as they turned the corner leading to the potions classroom soon the corridor was deserted again the only person walking there was him though not a minute later he heard footsteps again as he was about to take the stairs leading back to the entrance hall the girl who just descended them was now standing in front of him he took a quick look at her her red hair was resting on her shoulders and her slim hands holding her books securely to the front of her body he couldntbelieve how odd these coincidences had become excuse me she said trying to move past him not even registering who he was as she was in hurry harry instinctively grabbed her arm to stop her from going any further her books fell to her feet and she stiffened at his touch hold on he said her legs froze her breath choked and her heart beats seemed to stop when she heard his voice she gulped with difficulty and all she wanted right then was to dash away from him as fast as possible she tried to jerk her arm from his hand but he held her tight so she gave up but did not turn to look at him i um she began trying to find the right thing to say but her mouth was dry and she couldntform whole words still holding her arm so she wontrun away which he knew she would the second he will let her go he said tell him i ll meet him on saturday at the dueling club tell who she asked still not making eye contact with him your git of a boyfriend mr thomas tell him to come if he not afraid he said coldly reminding himself of the way snape usually talked must be a slytherin thing he thought i sorry i cannot do that she said with a hoarse voice and why that he finally tilted his head to the side to get a glimpse of her red hair can you please let me go she said obviously wishing to change the subject the bell rang five minutes ago i really late for potions so you re a prefect that doesntmean i allowed to be late for class and besides i want to be there on time but because of you she tried again to get away from his grip but did not succeed please let me go she begged her voice a bit shaky please she finally looked up at him her look in her eyes was pleading scared here they were in an empty corridor alone just like in his dream she looked at him fearfully because he was a but he wasnta death eater you re not afraid of me are you he asked with a frown though he knew she really was there was no other way to look at this situation differently as he understood what he done he quickly let go of her arm and just like he predicted she quickly bent down to gather her books i not what you think i am she slowly rose from the floor and looked at his eyes again she didnthave to say anything he already knew nodding once to her be backed away from her and went up the stairs thinking all the way to class that somehow he must prove her he wasntguilty a n okay so what do you think i still not sure about how long it ll take for them to stay like this but i reckon not too long you all must remember patience is the key word now dontbe lazy and shy please review this chapter it the longest one yet and it was difficult to write and revise since i needed to think of something different then the one i had before i hope you like this more thank you for reading and for your patience disclaimer i dontown harry potter a n i so sorry you guys had to wait so long most of you probably thought i abandoned the story but let me assure you one thing i will not leave the story unfinished i have written so many lonely scenes that i want to include in later chapters and i ve got it all planned out in my mind until the end that there is no way in the world i will stop writing it you ll just to wait sometimes because i do have private life it also because i ve got too much to include that it takes me long periods to update and when you ve got loads of things to write you something get stuck and you dontknow how to write it well so you ll be please with it what i mean is that i had a major writing block and my computer also suffered a few virus attacks so i needed to fix it before i could actually continue writing and in addition to all that my beta had troubles with her internet so she couldntemail it to me you probably dontknow but i keep updates on this story in my profile here on so if you really want to know what up with the next chapters drop by from time to time in my user page just click my pen name and you re there one last thing before i thank all my readers another reason why it took me so long to write this chapter is because it spread to 29 pages now the thing is that if you read the whole 29 pages at once you ll get a bit overloaded so i afraid to say that i split this chapter into two parts trust me it better this way but dontworry chapter 12 which is the second part is already written and is going through beta process now chapter 13 is still at the works this is the last time i answering reviews via the chapter i going to answer them using new feature of replying to reviews so you ll get them back in your email box sleepyheather it will lupin in charge as you ll read in this chapter who stole the cloak was it even stolen guess you ll have to wait and see ocean shadow we shall see and harry has to be a bit ooc because it is an au story but sometimes he acts like canon harry would um i wonder why shadylion i listened to your advice and i hope this chapter and the next will be more descriptive thank the rest of you who read and reviewed i am really glad that most of you liked the second version of chapter 10 better than the first enjoy this chapter as well and i ll be very happy to read your reviews chapter 11 secrets five minutes later harry was sitting next to draco in transfiguration smiling broadly despite himself and why wouldnthe as he took his seat just behind weasley and granger table he heard the most amusing thing whispered to hermione by ron something that sounded a lot like looks like he imperiused mcgonagall too otherwise she would have turned him into a rat and wouldnttake 10 points from slytherin he was fifteen minutes late and you saw how he entered the class like he owned the damn place too bad hermione was too concentrated copying notes from the blackboard like mcgonagall asked them to and ignored him completely harry was practically enjoying seeing weasley driving himself mad like that it was also really funny that whenever mcgonagall turned her back to the class harry was throwing small paper balls at ron from behind he and draco tried their best to suppress their laughs as harry kept doing it until ron finally got really pissed and couldntignore them any longer he turned around to glare at them very red faced and gave harry the nastiest look he could manage at the moment harry then seized the opportunity with a fake yawn he stretched out his right hand purposely letting his sleeve slide down and revealed his forearm ron fearfully glanced up at his exposed skin no dark mark was burned upon harry flesh like he had thought harry knew it wasntvery convincing since the death eaters had the mark on their left forearm and right now his left hand was still hidden under the plaster cast however ron didntseem to know this little fact and he just continued to gape at harry in disbelief how thick is he harry thought weasley didntyour mother ever told you it not polite to stare draco asked quietly enjoying the plan harry came up with ron turned to look at him putting his fuming look back on his face leave him alone draco i donthave time to use the cruciatus curse on him after class harry commented seriously then perhaps after dinner draco suggested playing along ron made a soft whimpering noise and gulped with difficulty um no sorry i already have plans after dinner to kill a first year hufflepuff you see he thought it would be okay to run into me and then walk off after saying a simple sorry well you know i donttake a simple sorry as an apology certainly not draco said shaking his head that prat so what are you going to do to him i think i ll start with harry began to say but was cut off by mcgonagall mr potter and mr malfoy she called warningly ron immediately turned back to his table i guess we ll have to take care of weasley some other time then draco whispered but loud enough for ron to hear him yeah harry whispered back guess i ll have to take off this cast first i ll need both of my hands to strangle him then i ll stun him so he wontscream when i ll use the cruciatus on him how does that sound like brilliant draco said but then he caught another suspicious look from mcgonagall and they got back to copy notes from the blackboard after a moment when it was safe enough he whispered quietly so only harry would hear him this time when are you really going to take that off he indicated the plaster cast on harry left hand i dontknow it itches now so i guess it healed and i dontfeel any pain in my shoulder anymore i know it been only two days but i really sick of it it was very tiring sleeping on my right side for couple of nights in a row maybe i ll step by the hospital wing later and see if i can take it off when harry looked up again he saw hermione comforting a very harassed looking ron and he smiled to himself in satisfaction that will teach weasley not to talk like that about me behind my back oh come off it ron you dont really believe they were serious do you hermione said on their way to defense against the dark arts they were just trying to scare you for the fun just dontlet them get to you they were serious hermione potter said he ll kill a hufflepuff kid tonight after dinner ron argued oh and you believe him tell me ron is there a logical explanation why he would talk about killing someone when he knows you re hearing him and you could get him caught to show me he is really going to finish me off oh that a load of rubbish she huffed not so far from there three slytherins were walking out from the hospital wing to the same class blaise looked at harry annoyed while draco rolled his eyes at his two friends no i will not let you copy my notes harry blaise said firmly holding tight to his school bag so harry wonttry to snatch it again while he also bragged he could use his left hand again to do so you should ve listened in class and not fool around with weasley luckily i chose to sit next to a quiet ravenclaw or else i would have ended up like you two chasing after some sucker to do all the hard work for you i not going to be that sucker harry not again anyway he added quietly fool around with weasley that was a good one draco chuckled harry cast him a dark look but turned back to blaise with disgust ugh the way you said it sounded like you were implying something he said with a shudder well maybe i not talking about this particular weasley if you know what i mean blaise replied with a knowing tone in his voice harry rolled his eyes and draco spoke again funny i remember him saying something like he starting to let go of her and that she not his type yeah right blaise snorted you should have seen him at hogsmeade after he got stunned by thomas i saw him waking up in her lap draco quickly caught on and changed the subject wait a minute he got stunned by thomas as dean thomas dark bloke gryffindor mudblood he said incredulously blaise nodded that the one draco started to laugh his head off harry began to feel his anger rise he didntexpect such behavior from draco and he wished that for once blaise would have kept his mouth shut could you stop talking about me like i not here harry said crossly all right all right i going to the lavatory i ll see you later draco said and blaise tell harry when you see him that i was stunned to hear such shocking news that he couldntovercome a mudblood he added as he walked off blaise chuckled at the comment but stopped when he saw harry looking at him grumpily sorry he said apologetically after a few seconds of silence between them harry saw blaise looking around nervously checking for pansy he said amusingly no blaise replied seriously he held harry by the shoulder and stopped him from walking i need to tell you something before he gets back what is it harry whispered unsure why since no one was around i remembered it this morning but i couldnttell you when he was around guess who i saw entering the hog head yesterday blaise said harry shrugged draco father lucius malfoy harry asked in dismay his face fell at blaise nod and he could feel his heart racing wh what was he doing there i dontknow but he looked suspicious if you ask me i think he saw me but i not quite sure i was talking to pansy at the moment so i guess he might have missed me listen donttell draco i told you that he will be all moody again all right all right he said sincerely and they continued walking to their class harry was wondering what lucius malfoy could have done in hogsmeade especially in the hog head a bar that didntexactly matching his social level he was starting to get worried lucius malfoy was so close to him that day which also happened to be the 15th anniversary of voldemort fall was it just a coincidence are you okay you seem quiet all of the sudden blaise commented no i fine just thinking harry said quietly he forced himself to forget about what bothered him right now and looked amused again say about pansy you guys hit it off blaise face flushed it was rather rare to see blaise blushing even if he was a bit shy sometimes but ever since he started to like pansy he used to blush almost every time their names were mentioned in the same sentence it was okay he mumbled did you ask her out i didnthave time to he said looking uneasy with the subject i heard what happened to you and i came right away to check you re an idiot harry said blaise gaped at him well you could ve forgotten about me and done something about yourself for a change i was fine if you haventnoticed i not the idiot around here you are when are you going to ask out the red head stop chasing her around and get to the point mind your business will you harry spat i have no intention in asking her out right so you just kissed her and wooed after her for weeks now and you re not interested in her at all wooed her i cantbelieve that just came out of your mouth and yes i not interested in her she weasel sister and thomas girlfriend i dontbelieve you blaise said and caused harry to sigh with annoyance if what you re afraid of is mine and draco reaction then dontworry about it we wontmind just get over your denial and define what you re feeling towards her because it looks bad when you re walking after her like a lost puppy oh shut up harry snapped and finally they entered the class and after that they didntspeak about this subject again ten minutes before the lesson was over professor lupin asked everyone to put down their quills as they did some theoretical studying lately and got their full attention i sure you all have seen the signs about the new dueling club that taking place this saturday everyone nodded and lupin began to pace around the class a few students approached me with questions before the class started so i wanted to clarify what you will be facing there you ll be paired with someone from a different house you wontget a chance to pick your opponent since the selection will be randomly it wontbe like the dueling club you had in your second year hopefully it will be more experienced more challenging and more difficult you wontbe asked to disarm your opponents but to attack them a series of confused whispers interrupted his speech and lupin hurried to explain more of course you ll be protected so you wontget seriously hurt i saying seriously hurt because you can get hurt if a spell was to hit you so you ask yourselves what is the purpose if no one can get hurt how do you call who won well the purpose of the dueling is to see who knows how to avoid spells and how to counter attack it will be simply just spells we practiced throughout your last six years here nothing dark and dangerous and the first person who has the least ability to attack back is the loser any more questions a hufflepuff girl raised her hand yes sir the sign didntsay where the club will be held lupin nodded slightly yes that is because it isntsettled yet i shall tell you the exact location and time by our next lesson on thursday right now the headmaster and i are debating whether it will be in the great hall or somewhere else right miss granger lupin gestured to hermione hand professor is there a chance we ll be dueling with a seventh year student she asked excitedly no i afraid not seventh year students are might be just one year ahead of you but they are more experienced and their classes are slightly more advanced granger looked a little disappointed with his answer the bell just rang and everyone headed to the door in order to get down for lunch we ll talk about it more on thursday lupin called before they all left the classroom harry are you coming blaise and draco asked together when they saw that harry stayed behind go without me i ll catch with you later he said when they left and only he and professor lupin were left in the class harry walked towards him hello harry is there something i can do for you lupin asked just noticing he was there yes i need your help a few minutes later after harry finished explaining everything to lupin silence fell between them in which each of them thought to himself for a moment about what harry just requested harry felt a bit awkward asking for lupin help he never asked for anyone help before because he never needed it he always did things by himself but this time was different this time he really needed someone to help him i dontknow harry lupin sighed and looked worried please professor it really important to me i wouldnthave asked for your help if it wasn t do your parents know about this no at least i dontthink they do and please remus they cantknow they have enough on their minds right now harry pleaded again lupin smiled feebly at something harry just said it was the first time in years maybe ever since harry had attended hogwarts six years ago that he called him by his first name it wasnt professor or just lupin it was simply remus without knowing that what might have been just a simple slip of the tongue touched his heart lupin thought to himself it meant that harry wasntall closed up inside like he thought but kept within himself a soft side that no one yet had the chance to break through maybe now he succeeded to make a small crack all right i ll help you he said and watched harry face lit into a wide grin you will harry asked almost not believing his ears yes i will meet me here tonight after dinner i ll see then what i can do for you on the afternoon ginny was trying to study in the common room for a defense against the dark arts exam she had on friday but couldntconcentrate it was hard enough to put up with ron and hermione bickering over nothing again but it wasntwhat made her mind wander with her thoughts before ron came over she and hermione had a conversation she couldntget out of her mind right now flashback ginny sat in that same armchair only 20 minutes ago trying to think of something that she had just been asked by dean when the portrait hole opened and hermione climbed into the common room and sat next to her hey ginny have you seen ron she asked ginny shook her head absently still thinking to herself and not paying much attention to her friend we said we d meet in the library but i guess he blew me off honestly i dontknow how he managed to achieve eight o w l s if he hardly studying hermione ranted ginny did not reply which made hermione a bit suspicious are you all right ginny she asked what ginny said finally snapping out of her thoughts oh i fine dean just came over and tried to convince me to give him another chance i was just wondering if i did the right thing breaking up with him i mean you want to get back together with him i thought you said he was getting on your nerves he does but i dontknow her voice trailed off i ve almost accepted but then i told him i would have to think about it maybe you should think this through before you decide anything or maybe you should start over hermione suggested if you really cantstand dean there no reason why you should take him back why dontyou go for someone who different than him someone like neville for an instance neville is really nice and i heard he really fancies you she said encouragingly neville really ginny grimaced but i dontlike neville i mean i like him but not like that and there no way in the world i would date him it was bad enough going with him to the yule ball he always stepped on my toes while we danced that why i ran from there and met michael at the thought of michael ginny couldntsuppress a groan and covered her face in her hands god do i really have that rubbish taste in guys no of course not i dating your brother am i not hermione joked and they both chuckled maybe you just haventmet the right one yet hermione said soothingly ginny looked into blank space again hermione was always helpful with such sort of things and maybe she was right maybe she shouldntget back together with dean and should move on maybe neville is the one for her no snap out of it weasley you re hallucinating she told herself hermione voice got her attention once more i know there is one guy who really right for you i mean just by looking at him i can tell that you ll be right for each other she said ginny shifted in her armchair to a more comfortable position interested to hear more who he she asked eagerly do i know him oh you definitely know him let see you two love quidditch you hate studying yet achieve great grades and both are too stubborn to admit what you have feeling for each other maybe you have met the right guy but you just haventgiven him a chance now it was as clear as glass ginny knew who she was taking about and she had no passion talking about him it will only upset her anyway hermione ginny sighed heavily wishing to drop the subject ginny i saw the whole thing from the three broomsticks i was there remember and you cantfool me about what i saw what you saw was dean stunning him and then me waking him up because i wanted to be nice that all end of story was it really just that hermione asked quietly leaning over and looking at her closely ginny avoided her look but somehow it made her feel like it was burning her skin and she couldntget away from it anymore yes she said firmly looking up again hermione arched an eyebrow and ginny knew she couldntavoid her knowing look anymore it was enough lying to herself but to someone who wanted to help her she sighed again no but it not that simple he was there lying on the ground unarmed and i couldnthelp myself but feel a bit sorry for him and mad at dean for doing this to him when all he tried to do was help me i dontknow why i felt like that maybe it was because he wanted to protect me or the way he acted all heroic and caring for my sake i tried to think how he would have treated me and how would it be if i was walking with him to hogsmeade and not with dean how would it be i dontknow yet it still all blurry to me i donteven know if it ever clear up what with all that death eater business do you really think he could be a death eater hermione asked i would think so as long as i donthave a proof that he not end of flashback you are so immature ronald weasley hermione shouted ginny found herself back in the present where ron and hermione were still fighting ron was making lame excuses to why he went down to the quidditch pitch to fly with couple of friends instead of meeting hermione in the library hermione looked livid her face red like she was holding her breath to stop herself from shouting even louder at him she looked like she was about to explode ginny couldnttake it anymore for god sake i dontknow why you call yourselves a couple all you do is arguing why dontyou lock yourselves inside a broom cupboard and snog for a change so some of us could actually study she snarled ron and hermione who apparently forgot ginny was sitting close to them stared at her in surprise she said no more and gathered all her books and fled to the library before they started another row while she was still there harry didntwant to fill draco and blaise in what he asked from lupin whether it would interest amuse or bore them he wasntsure it was a private conversation either way and he wasntsure he would tell them about it at all so he stayed quiet all during the day careful not to let it slip out even though his insides were screaming to get this out because he almost never kept a secret from his friends he always told them everything but this time he had to draw a line he wanted to keep it for himself for a change just to be safe his excuse for not walking with them back to the dungeons right after dinner was rather lame but yet somewhat true even though he wasntreally going to do it now he told them he was going to talk to the ravenclaw quidditch team captain about the match they re having right after the holiday break now however he was going to meet with lupin he would talk to the ravenclaw captain sometime tomorrow morning instead he wasntsure if they bought it or not but was pretty certain they would eventually ask him where he was when he ll be back in a few hours and not right away he shook all those thoughts out of his mind and hurried to professor lupin office when he got there the door was already slightly ajar waiting for him to push it and come inside he hesitated whether he should knock on the door or just come in without lupin invitation he finally decided to knock before entering when there wasntany answer he peeked into the room it was empty so he let himself enter the professor office thinking there was no point staying in the hall though he had visited this office several times before harry never took a good look at it seeing he had some time now he took a look around at the very end of the room was a desk dusty and full of paperwork dried quills and empty goblets the shelves hanging on the walls were mostly packed with books on a long wooden cabinet under the window on the right sat a few tanks and cages each one held a different dark creature harry remembered they d studied a few years ago right when he ran his hand over the cool glass of a snake tank completely fascinated by the creature harry was startled by a voice i thought you ll be here by now harry turned around professor lupin was standing at the door holding a tray with two empty mugs and a steaming kettle in the dim light of the room his features looked more apparent making him look a few years older than he actually was professor harry said a bit nervous about entering his office without permission i didntmean to intrude lupin waved his free hand dismissively no need apologizing harry you re not intruding at all i have invited you here tonight have i not he walked into the room and stopped by a small rounded coffee table that sat near two patchy armchairs by the burning hearth i left the door open for you on purpose so you will come in while i went down to the kitchens to bring us some tea i thought it would be nice to enjoy it while we sit and discuss what we are going to do before we actually begin he settled the tray down on the table seated himself in one of the armchairs which emitted a small cloud of dust in the contact with a faint poof sound and poured the hot tea into the mugs you are more than welcome to sit down and join me he offered harry vaguely nodded and made his way to the free armchair and accepted his mug from lupin you know there are some very enthusiastic house elves down there in the kitchens i almost came back with a cart full of biscuits and cupcakes he chuckled quietly harry mouth bore a small smile they looked terribly depressed when i had to refused to their generous offer because i was full from tonight dinner you see but it turned out it was their huge prominent eyes that misled me harry snorted on his tea he knew how house elves normally looked and acted when they were treated nice and fairly since they once had one when he about five though he didntremember how he was called he remembered that his dad brought him home one rainy day from work they kept him for a while until his dad had to give him back for whatever reason he couldntremember he could still feel how sad he felt when he was gone but what would you expect from a five year old boy who thought the house elf was his pet or a family member by himself anyways why dontyou tell me what we re really doing here lupin said suddenly harry realized they had been sitting there quietly drinking on their tea for a few short minutes without saying a word to each other harry thought whether to tell the actual truth or come up with an alternative reason he hadntgiven lupin a satisfactory answer why he wanted to do this and he knew he will have to tell the truth sooner or later if he wanted his full help he couldntavoid this anymore lupin would not help him if he didntget a satisfactory answer why lupin went on are you so interested to enrich your knowledge in the subject it seemed to me like it is extremely important to you to know more than you already do why couldntyou just open a book and learn it by yourself harry swallowed without thinking some sort of an explanation escaped his mouth is it wrong to think about the future to be prepared for something that is bigger than what we can face here at hogwarts of course there nothing wrong with that lupin hurried to reply i was just interested to know what your full intention is why do you really need my help harry does is have something to do with the dueling club a bit yeah harry said look if i tell you something do you promise you wontlaugh at me or tell anyone lupin stared at him for a moment and then seriously said go on i want harry started thinking how exactly to phrase what he wanted to say so it wontsound silly i want to look good at the dueling club ah i see lupin said slowly and by looking good you want to learn some more spells that could help you win your opponent and also can help you in the future harry nodded well i dontmind helping you learn more things that will help you in the future but as for the dueling club i think we can put it under the cheating category wontwe the purpose of this dueling club is to see what exactly you learned during your six years here and if you get extra help from me your professor it d be exactly like cheating everyone is going to use their basic knowledge not something they learned in less than a week just to show off well i understand that i do but i still want to do this it has nothing to do with showing off look if you wonthelp me i didntsay that i just saying that we can find other solutions well what if it isntjust about the dueling club what if it is more a personal issue that i cantexactly tell you about lupin brows furrowed why cantyou tell me if you re in trouble harry i not harry cut him off i just i canttell you for now i need to know that you re going to help me with this like you said you re my professor and as my professor you suppose to teach me there was a long moment of silent neither of them spoke harry watched lupin eyes dart from side to side as though he was reading and knew that he was thinking what he should do finally lupin looked up at harry and said all right i ll teach you thank you harry said with a small trace of smile on his lips you re not aiming for someone in particular are you harry lupin suddenly asked harry didntexpect that question after a long pause in which his mind was racing with possible excuses he finally managed to stammer out a no okay then lupin said putting his now empty mug back on the table and getting up from his seat get up we will start with something small for tonight harry did as he was told lupin instructed him to pull out his wand and stand right in front of him they went through some basic things and simple spells that harry already knew but was glad they did as he found he forgot a little bit of this and a little bit of that from lack of using those spells over the years he accidentally blasted an empty wine bottle that sat on the desk which made him to groan in frustration and lupin to chuckle obviously amused that okay harry i think you ve done your share for tonight lupin said after the second time harry blew up the repaired bottle harry rubbed his temples in small circles trying to get rid of an uncontrollable headache that was currently forming you are probably tired let call it off for tonight we ll meet here again tomorrow at the same time yes all right harry said in a worn out voice i didntthink there much to teach you that we already been though in class years ago but i guess i was wrong if there is something in particular that you would like to learn look it up first go to the library and search for something that is not so difficult to learn in less than a week okay he said i better hurry back to my dormitory before filch will catch me wandering in the hallways in this late hour of the night it way past curfew right good night and good luck lupin called before harry closed the door of his office and walked down to the dungeons he fell asleep at once when he collapsed on his bed not even bothering to change his clothes for the next few days harry had to bear the unwanted questions from his friends asking where he went every night after dinner in addition to that no one seemed to believe that he wasnta death eater he had to tolerate people staring at him and whispering to themselves every time he went past them he was getting really pissed off and tired of this and wished it would die down soon he hadntseen or heard from ginny in days the last time he saw her was their encounter in the dungeons it was frustrating knowing that she was scared of him of how the rumors made him into something he wasn t he found that he was missing her presence around him not seeing her every day was like having something missing from his agenda sometimes he was feeling rather sorry that he didntwait and listen to what she had to say that day in hogsmeade instead of just taking off remembering that day in hogsmeade harry also remembered what he was preparing for for the past few days his mission was to avenge what dean did to him he learned a few tricks and new spells from a couple of books he found in the library and with lupin help he practiced more than he needed to defeat dean no one would call him a coward after the dueling club he promised himself only one problem was in his way how to get dean as his opponent that he had to ask from lupin he knew there wasntany other way is there a chance you ll be letting me pick my own opponent sir harry asked innocently on wednesday night after they d practiced a few more spells like i already said in class on monday harry the selection will be random you dontget to pick who you duel lupin explained how exactly does the selection work harry pressed on isntit enough that i help you get ready and learn more spells do you really need to know that lupin asked surely suspecting something i just dontwant to be stuck with someone who is rubbish i want a challenge someone i know i can defeat but not so easily harry said do you have someone in mind yes and i want to see how hard it will be to duel with him lupin looked at harry for a moment how do you know it d be hard how do you know this person isnta dreadful dueler because i tasted his power once harry said the words floating out of his mouth without thinking through i want to try him again what do you really want from him harry you said you re not aiming for anyone in particular lupin said watching harry very closely i not i dontwant anything from him it nothing personal i swear harry said defensively just the challenge okay lupin said slowly almost like he didntbelieve harry which he had a good reason not to because harry was lying i tell you what you tell me his name then i ll do my best so you two will be each other opponents you will you promise harry asked lupin nodded well if so then it dean thomas from gryffindor very well lupin said calmly well that it for tonight harry i ll see you tomorrow morning in class harry was leaving the office with a satisfied grin on his face his plan was going along really well so far the last part of it will take place on saturday remus lupin on the other hand was staring blankly into the flames dancing happily in the fireplace his mind was somewhere else worried that he might have made a mistake harry was acting weird he noticed he could sense he was lying about something but what exactly he told him so many things and reasons that he didntknow which one of them was a lie if not all of them he knew he shouldnthave helped him but he just couldntturn him down and now he had to keep his concerns for himself because he promised harry he wouldnttell it to his parents but was it a smart decision i hope you re not going to do something stupid harry a n well that the chapter again dontthink it took me this long to write this short one i already said there is a second part a bit longer which will come soon and i started to write chapter 13 as well so i d like to get your reviews now because they make me so happy thanks for reading disclaimer i dontown harry potter a n in this chapter harry is going to use the confundus charm since we never actually learned much about that charm from what jkr write in the books i totally made up how it works i just hope it will be understandable and reliable have fun reading chapter 12 dueling so you ve been a bit mysterious lately stated blaise the next morning they were heading for defense against the dark arts once again harry didntsay much to them all during breakfast he looked incredibly tired his eyes were bloodshot and he had dark circles around his eyes making him look rather scary looking a group of first years passed them and when they caught a glance from harry they shrieked and ran away as quickly as they could you dontlook good either people are starting to think that you are a death eater didntthey think that before harry growled in a low voice nah i fine i really tired that all been in the library for too long i guess been in the library please draco said sardonically you ve never set a foot there before why are you now i might ve been there a few times before without informing you and mind you that was when i only needed to look for something they have a wide selection of some really helpful books there you know you should try and visit there too sometime it wouldntkill you what were you looking for anyway blaise asked curiously a spell harry replied simply a spell yeah luckily for harry they reached the class just in time so he didnthave to explain more than that professor lupin asked everyone to take their seats they have all expected to hear about the approaching dueling club and when the last student sat down lupin clapped his hands once and smiled broadly i ve received the last details about the dueling club he said after discussing it with the headmaster we decided that the great hall will be too small so the club will be held on the quidditch pitch that way the whole school could also come and watch now for the timings seventh year students will be dueling between 9 a m to 12 noon then there two hours break during which you can eat lunch and then from 2 until 5 p m you will be dueling for your protection each one of you will be receiving this lupin took out something from his pocket and held it up for everyone to see it was a thin white plastic bracelet that looked just like the one that patients usually wore in a muggle hospital hey that my brother shield bracelet ron weasley called happily harry rolled his eyes great he ll have to wear something that is weasley made lupin chuckled yes it is and though it is very practical sometimes it can only protect you from getting seriously hurt please notice that it wontblock simple jinxes that can be lifted later like freezing charms or the jelly legs jinx for example he said the class went on as usual after that and when the bell rang harry once again stayed behind to talk to lupin after everyone left yes harry he asked i found this spell in a book i think it can be very useful harry explained what spell it called the confundus charm ah right it a good spell when it used cleverly lupin said with a small smile could you teach me how to do it right harry asked eagerly i can but i afraid i too busy tonight harry i need to get things ready for the dueling club i ve been meaning to tell you that we donthave a practice session tonight lupin said truly sounding like he was sorry harry looked disappointed oh that okay too bad we canttomorrow night either i ve got loads of essays to submit and i haventgot started working on them yet lupin seemed to think about something for a second and then he said you know i not teaching in the next hour we can practice it now if you dontmind missing your next class he suggested harry mouth broke into an expectant grin yes please i ve got herbology i ll do anything to escape that he said excitedly fine i ll write you a note and give it to professor sprout lupin said well dontjust stand there take out your wand if you wish to get started harry pulled his wand out and stared at lupin waiting for any further instructions i better put this on lupin muttered quietly he meant to put the shielding bracelet on his left wrist but then stopped and took it off or maybe not we wontbe able to know whether it worked or not we use here a spider lupin picked up a large spider he found crawling in the corner of the classroom and put it for harry on his desk harry looked at the spider he didntreally know what he should do with it he didntreally know what the spell will do to it right said lupin pacing around harry and the desk so the incantation for the confundus charm is confundo confundo harry repeated to himself memorizing it this charm is not simple but not too complex either with a bit of practicing i assume you ll get the hang of it what it does at first is creating a wave of confusion on your opponent he may hear correctly but wontregister what is said since he ll try to focus on what made him so confused his vision will become blurred and his eyes wontbe able to focus that way he wontbe able to concentrate like he normally would it will simply weaken him you should know though that the wave will last for only a few seconds and then will fade away after that your opponent will see whatever you want him to see if you really want to cast this spell on dean i suggest you dontstart with it but save it for later now to work this charm properly you need to think what exactly you want dean to see or believe and that way you can trick him and win the duel by confusing him to see something that only he will see so if i want to confuse the spider for instance to believe that i its prey what do i do harry asked how do i make it feel all the stuff you just described do i just cast the spell if so then why is it supposed to be difficult you wontbe able to cast it because it too hard to produce if you have not practiced it enough you need to really concentrate on what you want the spider to see or believe clear your head and think about the illusion the spell is suppose to create what you want the spider to see you as then cast the spell lupin moved to sit on his chair behind the desk folding his arms over his chest and watching harry closely the spider was now standing still on an old book that lay on the desk and harry looked at it carefully concentrating on what he wanted the spider to see he pointed his wand at it and called confundo nothing happened the spider rubbed his front legs together but stayed still harry tried again concentrating harder on his goal five minutes had passed and after several failures harry gave up he was panting heavily he didntknow it would be so difficult and frustrating it was so hard that it made him feel completely exhausted that okay harry it a hard spell to perform lupin said calmly watching harry catch his breath i think it better you forget about it no harry cut in his breathing are still shallow i want to do it i want to try again ron and hermione next lesson was charms professor flitwick told them to start practicing the time freezing charm they studied in their last lesson while hermione managed to stop her watch and the hourglass that professor flitwick gave her several times by now without any difficulties ron was rummaging through his bag looking for something he was starting to get worried he might have lost it somewhere but couldntremember where mr weasley squeaked professor flitwick as he came over why arentyou practicing the charm like everyone else sorry professor he said hastily putting his bag down but i cantfind my wand anywhere i think i left it somewhere he emptied all his pockets and twice he ran his hand over to his ears to see if he hadntput it there without noticing i know i had it earlier dontyou think you need to be more organized this is the second time you ve lost your wand ronald hermione whispered yes i know that hermione there no need to remind me great now i going to get a howler from my mum and a t if you wontdo anything in this lesson said flitwick an angry tone in his voice he then walked away from their table observing the other students wait ron suddenly called standing up flitwick turned around and looked up at him maybe i dropped it in professor lupin classroom may i please go and check there professor be sure to make it quickly flitwick said with a nod your grade depends on it ron quickly left the class and ran as fast as he could one floor below when he got there he saw lupin classroom door was closed he took in one long breath but choked in a fit of coughs when he heard a yell coming from inside the silent classroom once he relaxed ron looked up and down the corridor nobody was there but him he was sure the classroom was empty it didntsound like there was a class inside being in quite a hurry to get his wand and be back to his class he shrugged it off forcing himself to believe he was just imagining only then he heard it again louder than before but still not that clear it wasnta call for help but sounded like someone yelling out an incantation ron had no doubt about that somehow he had a strange feeling that something was wrong if he had someone else there with him to hear it they would have told him that there nothing wrong that lupin is probably teaching right now and the class is practicing as usual but ron didntthink so he recognized one person voice not several voices and the incantation wasntbeing repeated as if there was a group of students there studying thinking of one reasonable thing to do ron walked slowly to the door and pressed his ear against it inside there were two people having a conversation the first voice ron recognized was professor lupin s the second was quiet and muffled ron couldntidentify whom it belonged to ron didntknow if he should interrupt this conversation it could be very district or important but he didntknow what else to do he needed his wand or he ll fail today charms lesson he was about to knock on the door when he heard lupin talk with a tired voice if you want to do it then do it but i dontthink you can there was a sigh and a short silence followed ron pressed his ear to the door again listening carefully who is lupin talking to and what going on the person lupin was talking to was breathing rather heavily ron could hear his breathings and it sounded like this person was quite angry confundo yelled the other person by the tone of his choked voice it was obvious he was struggling to get the spell out of his mouth what spell is this ron panicked and then it hit him he knew that voice that harry potter with professor lupin he told himself and when the name of his sworn enemy popped to his head a sudden fear took place potter was casting a spell at professor lupin without thinking much he opened the door in a swift move and watched the scene that was before his eyes harry potter was pointing his wand at professor lupin he was panting and looked sweaty and tired but angry all the same professor lupin was sitting in his chair in front of harry only the desk separating them his hands were folded over his chest like he was waiting for harry to strike it was then when lupin acknowledged ron presence lupin turned his gaze to him and looked at him calmly like nothing was wrong he even gave him a small smile harry followed his gaze and looked at ron like he had just insulted him deeply he slowly lowered his wand looking impassive but yet menacing he folded his arms as well though not as same as lupin had it was as if he waiting for ron to leave right away ron tried his best not to look directly at harry i i sorry professor i heard shouts and i thought something might be he glanced briefly at harry fierce glare and finished the sentence with a hoarse voice wrong that all right ron lupin replied serenely why are you out of class be because i think i ve dropped my wand here somewhere i i came to look for it he replied shakily if that okay and i not interrupting anything no of course you re not you need your wand lupin said with a small smile he got up from his chair pulled out his wand and pointed it to where ron sat earlier this morning accio ron wand he called the lost wand rose suddenly in the air in the back of the class and flew right to lupin hand here you go ron he said as he walked over to him and handed him back his wand keep it safe next time ron nodded t thank you i ll do that he stuttered and lupin closed the door behind him once he was safely outside the classroom he leaned against the cool stone wall and sighed he couldntbelieve what he just witnessed to the rumors were all true just like he suspected harry potter was indeed a death eater checking the time on his watch ron saw it took him long enough to get his wand back and hurried back to charms he couldntwait to tell hermione everything he just saw and prove her wrong about potter harry felt like he had done something terribly wrong normally being caught out of class by ron weasley wouldntbother him that much even if he was a prefect but something told him that he wasntfeeling guilty for nothing the look on ron face when he opened the door told harry how shocked was ron to find him there in lupin class his face has gone completely white even paler than the usual bright shade of his skin what exactly did he see harry wondered he already knew ron was positive that he was a death eater so what now didnthe see him practicing spells with lupin just now or did he come to the wrong conclusion harry wasntsure what exactly ron had put into his head but he knew he will tell someone about it as fast as he could someone who is close to him that for sure harry could just imagine how ginny would react to whatever ron will tell her it will probably push her even further away from him these past few days that went by felt empty to him without getting a good glimpse at her red hair or hear her voice even if she sounded angry or scared it somehow made him feel whole whenever he saw her he didntknow why he didntknow how to get himself out of this situation after all it wasnthis fault everyone thought he a death eater he didntland himself in this position snape did why would snape make him the quidditch house team captain and then tell such lies about him like that he knew that on some level he had always hated him he had his favorite students draco was one of them but harry was never even close harry still couldntfigure out why he chose him as the quidditch captain and not draco if he hated him so much harry are you okay lupin asked still leaning against the door harry realized he was standing in place looking down at the floor and not moving he was staring into blank air clutching his wand loosely between his numb fingers yeah i fine he replied quietly no because it seemed to me like you were miles away for a moment there lupin noted walking over i said i fine harry insisted shaking his head out of his thoughts though he couldntget rid of the memory of the last time he saw ginny her face was as scared as ron had been just now it made him feel a little twinge of pain in the pit of his stomach just to picture her eyes wide with fear of him hurting her oddly enough thinking how they met at the beginning of the year he wanted her to get hurt as a payment for hurting him in the quidditch pitch but now he couldntbear the thought of see her getting hurt what changed when are you going to ask out the red head blaise voice rang in his ears um okay maybe you should forget about confundus lupin said looking nervously around his desk why harry looked up at him didnthe make any progress lupin pointed to the desk harry looked down and noticed the spider had vanished okay so it might be here somewhere harry said crouching down to look for it under the desk it a large spider it canthave disappeared so quickly we ll summon it he was about to call the summoning charm but then lupin pushed his hand back down i afraid our little friend has been blown up by you harry he said with a chuckle harry looked down at the desk again all he could see on the old book where the spider stood a few minutes before was a small pile of ashes which was still smoking great harry muttered running a hand through his hair i canteven do that right lupin checked his watch we do have some time left what do you say i ll get another spider from my office and you can try again maybe you ll succeed this time no it no use i cantconcentrate now there too much on my mind lupin looked at harry closely seeing how frustrated he was he decided that he shouldntgive up so quickly sit down harry he said and pointed to the closest table harry went to sit behind it and looked at his professor is there something troubling you something that isntrelated to the dueling club was it that obvious harry thought maybe he can help me more than blaise and draco could well as a matter of fact yes harry answered he could feel a hot drop of sweat sliding down from his forehead from his uneasiness and hurried to wipe it with the back of his hand ron made you feel nervous did he no it not him well it what he might tell people that bothers me more you ve heard the rumors haventyou oh i did quite amusing i might say lupin chuckled dontmind the rumors harry rumors arentfacts and in your case they re definitely incorrect no matter how hurtful they can get you should always remember that you know the truth you re not a death eater harry there always will be someone who has a rumor going around about someone else today it you and tomorrow it will be someone else when people will find out the truth they will come around and some might apologize harry let out a sigh in return yeah but it not just that how exactly he supposed to say it lupin eyes had a sudden twinkle in them and his lips formed a lopsided smile ah it about a girl isntit he said knowingly you re afraid she ll believe the rumors and turn her back on you right harry nodded you re good he said with his eyebrows raised and this girl i assume doesntknow how you feel about her lupin went on harry shook his head then he realized something i donteven know what i feel about her he mumbled i haventexactly told anyone about it either i see look harry he got back to business if you really want to do the confundus charm right you need to concentrate you cantlet other things occupy your mind as long as you keep things to yourself and wontlet them out it will only get worse you need to figure out what exactly you feel for this girl now if we want to make some progress today we need to help you concentrate meaning you need to let this out harry didntknow what lupin expected from him he may have told him he has a crush on someone but he definitely will not open out his heart to him and tell him all about ginny and how exactly he felt every time he saw her no he would have to protest he was about to tell that to lupin but then the professor spoke instead that why i going to give you this harry watched lupin turn around to his desk and grabbing a small spare piece of parchment from one of the drawers he held the parchment in front of harry harry just looked at him strangely how exactly is this parchment going to help me he asked frowning half expecting the parchment to grow a mouth and give him an advice lupin simply tore the parchment in half now he held two small square pieces of parchment both were the same size of the palm of his hand dontworry you donthave to tell me anything lupin laid the two notes on harry table side by side harry merely just stared at them not sure what to do with them like i said the best way to get you focused is to get those feelings out dontignore what you feel take out a quill and write on both papers the same thing write down her name and how you think you feel for her and you ll see you feel more relieved harry thought about it for a moment should he do it there was nothing to lose anyway thinking that this exercise might come out helpful he did as lupin had instructed him but then he found out he was stuck again he didntknow what he felt for ginny a few moments have passed and harry still hasntwritten a single word lupin waited and watched him with his dilemma harry was confused how is he suppose to get it out when he didnteven know what was there to get out here is my tip for you dontthink too much on what you should write let your mind flow and your heart speak for itself you ll write down the words without even noticing it lupin said harry pressed the quill to the parchment and closed his eyes and tried to picture ginny in his mind at first she looked as grumpy as he first noticed her on the train at the beginning of the year then her face was laughing smiling and looked amused and at last scared and annoyed he pictured her together with dean and he could feel his face flush red with anger what was it that he felt why was he angry seeing her with dean why did it made him feel relaxed when he saw she was happy and feel guilty when he saw her sad or scared she had such an impact on him so strong that it made him feel like his life depended on her he remembered how he told himself to stay away but was never able to do it he couldntmake up his mind so he knew he had a crush on her and he kissed her once though it didntturn out so well and he couldntstop thinking about her he didntthink a day was worthwhile if he didntget a chance to see her was blaise right after all i know you fancy her blaise voice teased him again just get over your denial and define what you re feeling towards her if blaise could see it why couldnthe was it a just crush he looked back at his past and tried to remember how he felt toward the other girls he went out with he never had the same strong feelings for anyone other than ginny no he told himself this is more than just a crush he slowly opened his eyes and looked down his eyes grew wide with shock to find that he actually wrote down words on the two pieces of parchment without even realizing it just like lupin said he stared at what his hand wrote the words were the same on both notes and he couldntbelieve he wrote them it just couldntbe for a short second he thought that lupin had taken the chance to write this down by himself when harry eyes were closed but that idea faded as quickly as it came when harry recognized the handwriting as his own surprised and yet pleased to finally get this out of his chest he stared at lupin who was sitting comfortably in his teacher chair did you do it lupin asked and harry nodded he shielded the two pieces of parchment with his hands embarrassed that lupin would see what he wrote lupin straightened up in his seat all right you feel more relieved now harry nodded again he was still a bit shocked and couldntform words not even to tell lupin that his plan was brilliant he simply smiled widely i told you now the trick is to keep one note with you all the time and the other you leave here on your desk until we ll finish practicing for today okay smiling despite himself harry nodded for the third time in a row he folded the two notes the one he kept in his pocket while he left the other lying on the table lupin went to his office and brought another spider harry focused really hard on it and on his goal he missed for the first two times but that was also because the spider kept moving around and didntstay put like the previous one and then on his third try after the spider stopped moving and harry yelled the spell the spider started to act differently it walked forward a few inches and lowered its head its pincers clicking eagerly all of the sudden try to move from side to side harry lupin whispered watching the spider with amazement as did harry harry slowly moved from side to side the spider gaze was locked upon him suddenly it bounced forward but harry escaped from it harry laughed he did it he made the spider think he was its prey the spider crawled on the floor and looked around to find its lost victim harry walked carefully behind it so it wontnotice him even though he was bigger than it the charmed spider didntsee him great job harry you did it lupin chortled clapping his hands he pointed his wand at the spider and said finite the spider came out of its trance and relaxed again like nothing had happened harry felt like he finally achieved what he wanted all along from the first time he asked lupin to help him that spell was all he needed to win the duel with dean are you sure that what you saw are you one hundred and ten percent sure hermione asked ron quietly over lunch when they insulated themselves away from everyone else so no one could hear them yes for the umpteenth time i just telling you what i saw ron whispered back hermione went quiet for a moment thinking of what ron had just told her and running it through her head over and over again no there got to be some logical explanation for it she hissed yeah that he threatening the teachers like i told you from the beginning stop defending him for once hermione and see the other clear and obvious side of the story besides you know i would never make up something like that i didntsay you are this is just so surreal he doesntact like a death eater in disguise beside what you say of course she added quickly why would he be pointing a wand at professor lupin isnthe a friend of his parents when you re given an order from your fellow death eaters you must obey it hermione no matter how close you are with the person you are suppose to kill noted ron and how exactly you know that hermione raised her eyebrows at him killed anyone lately ron no he cried indignantly sounding offended quickly he changed the subject back look i heard a shout coming from inside the classroom it wasntexactly a shout more like a curse or an incantation being said out loud it sounded like carefo no that not it can fun do maybe no that just doesntmake any sense whatsoever he was talking more to himself now rather to hermione and then shook his head could it be confundo she asked her eyes widening in shock yes that is it he nodded vigorously and you said lupin acted like nothing had happened after you entered the class and explained what you ve heard that right why what is this spell ron asked worriedly that the confusion charm ron a person uses it to make the one they attack with it to believe what they want them to believe to confuse them so potter used it on lupin to make him believe he innocent if you want to do it then do it but i dontthink you can that what lupin said to him it might have really pissed him off so he used it to show lupin that he can do it i told you hermione this is as bad as the imperius curse or obliviate well we bound to tell dumbledore but we cantnow we ll go to see him later after classes are over said hermione in a rushed voice okay hopefully potter wontkill anyone during the next few hours ron muttered harry watched ron weasley and hermione granger talking at the very neglected end of the gryffindor table he on the other hand was sitting alone not sure where draco and blaise were he had heard some mutterings about them staying back at the greenhouses because they had done something but he thought he d ask them about it later when he ll see them it was actually great because he wasntshowered with questions for once and he could easily watch the two gryffindors without any interruptions they looked a bit nervous and they were whispering to each other something that they obviously didntwant anyone else to hear from time to time one of them looked around to check they werentbeing overheard though there were millions of optional reasons what they could be talking about harry had a good clue what was the exact topic of their conversation without the need to eavesdrop he just couldntlet ron tell ginny what he was obviously suspecting she already believed he was a death eater and he didntwant her to believe whatever ron was telling his girlfriend at this moment harry wasntstupid he already knew ron was certain he was a death eater now he was going to stretch this rumor even wider because of what the thought he saw in lupin classroom then he would tell this to ginny and then she would get even further away from him so when granger took off early for her next class ron finally finished stuffing himself with food he stood up and strode out of the great hall harry walked after him twice as fast in order to catch up with him when he reached him he surprised him by grabbing his shoulder from behind weasley could i have a word if you dontmind he whispered this startled ron and he stopped walking he turned around to see harry looking back at him with an unreadable expression on his face what do you want ron asked fearfully a shiver going down his spine harry got straight to the point you didnttell anyone by any chance what you saw earlier in lupin class did you ron eyes widened n no of course not i i wouldn t he stammered no because if you did i ll be very upset you would tell me if you told someone right i didnttell a soul ron said with a choked voice harry stared at him pointedly not even granger no i swear good keep it that way said harry with a small smirk and walked off to his next lesson yeah maybe you let me live until the end of the year mumbled ron behind harry back as soon as his classes were over he rushed back to hermione we cantgo to dumbledore he said at once why not she asked looking confused and you canttell anyone what i told you not dumbledore not ginny not anyone pretend like you dontknow anything about it either it has to stay between us we better not talk about it again too he said so fast he almost forgot to breathe ron you re scaring me did something happen she asked worriedly ron gulped inhaled a sharp breath and then said potter kind of threatened me not to tell what are you sure ron nodded he threatened you another nod that is exactly why we need to go to dumbledore then he is the only one that can put a stop to it potter cantkeep going around the school and threatening people whenever he wants so you finally believe me now ron asked you dontside with him anymore no if he threatened you than i guess i do believe you she said but didntsound that convinced unless you misunderstood him hermione ron hissed he told me not to tell anyone what i saw because then he ll be very upset his words she sighed okay let got to dumbledore she said and led the way to the headmaster office but ten minutes later ron and hermione left dumbledore office feeling disappointed with themselves nothing they d said seemed to convince the headmaster that harry potter was a death eater he told them that he trusted harry and that he believed in him dumbledore also wasntpleased to hear such accusations about his students from the school prefects and dismissed them with an assurance that there was nothing they need to worry about and that they shouldntbother him with this topic again great now i feel stupid hermione said once they returned to their common room they sat on the couch and stared at the fire distractedly sorry it all my fault ron said glumly could ve accepted a t in charms but nooo i had to go down to lupin classroom and see that see what ron and hermione turned their heads and saw ginny walking towards them she sat herself on the hearthrug and looked at them what did you see in lupin classroom ooh did you see the answers to the test i have tomorrow she asked excitedly rubbing her hands mischievously and grinning broadly no ron replied quietly and gave her a weird look ginny hermione scolded her mouth agape what ginny retorted defensively i could ve really used a bit of help but someone was too busy fine i will make you some notes but cheating is not the way to pass a test ginny waved her hand dismissively dontworry about it i wasntserious anyway i just wanted you to give up and make me those notes so what did you see in lupin classroom ron er once again ginny burst out excitedly ooh let me guess you caught lupin snogging a student she suggested no ginny a female student then she tried again hermione started chuckling ron rolled his eyes no ginny looked taken aback really i always thought he was a poof all the facts pointed it out he thirty something nice and still single well if not a student then a teacher perhaps snape no he not his type madam hooch trelawney eww donttell me it mcgonagall ginny lupin was not snogging anyone in his classroom ron yelled he also was not in any other intimate situation with anyone and nor was he naked or wrapped around the waist with a swim ring in a shape of a yellow duck a few people around the room cast them weird looks but he didntcare damn i hate it when you know the questions i want to ask ginny said in disappointment hermione was howling with laughter and tears were forming in the corners of her eyes ginny she managed to say once she calmed down she thought it best not to tell her who ron really saw doing what in lupin classroom ron lost his wand so he went to find it in lupin classroom but found a spider crawling on it and you know how he is with spiders well anyway he had no choice but get his wand back or else flitwick will give him a t so he bravely kicked the spider away and took his wand back yeah only he gave me a p because i didntmanage to stop my watch he complained ginny giggled well next time maybe you should let hermione pause time for you so by the time she ll finish her lame story you ll be back in class ginny entered the defense against the dark arts classroom on friday morning ready to take the test she studied for all week she reread the notes hermione made for her the night before and repeated to herself the main ideas she needed to remember when she took her usual seat at the front row professor lupin entered and ordered them all to clean their tables of all the unnecessary paperwork and sit down he began to pass them the exams and when he reached ginny he asked her to put all the notes she dropped on the floor in her bag ginny looked at him confused and checked the floor for any of her notes all she found was a folded piece of parchment that she was positive didntbelong to her she opened it to check just in case but found inside something very unexpected ginny i thought i told you to put that in your bag lupin said put it away now or i ll have to fail you he warned ginny mind had floated to somewhere else and the professor voice barely registered inside she couldntstop staring at the note she held in her hand what kind of joke is this ginny suddenly felt a hand grabbing the note from her palm and putting it in her bag luckily it wasntprofessor lupin but good old luna who didntwant her friend to fail the test ginny smiled weakly at her as a thank you and shook her head forcibly to restore her thoughts back to the test it was hard to concentrate after what she read in the note but she felt like she did pretty well the bell rang and they all submitted the tests ginny felt like she needed to get out of there as fast as possible luna caught up with her and stopped her in the hallway ginny looked like a mess and luna began to worry what is it ginny didntyou do well on the test ginny shook her head no it not that it went fine luna looked at her suspiciously are you sure because you read that note that professor lupin almost failed you for what didntyou study at all ginny ran a hand through her hair absently i did i studied all week long it wasntthat kind of note anyway and it didntbelong to me either someone left it on the floor by my desk so i thought i should pick it up to see if it was mine so professor lupin wontthink that i tried to cheat on the test but it was mine it was something else she finished slowly she put her hand in her bag and started rummaging inside then pulled out the mysterious note and showed it to luna luna looked at the note with raised eyebrows and then back at ginny and you found it on the floor next to your desk ginny nodded isntit weird like the person who wrote it put it there on purpose so i ll find it but who could write such a thing a rackfet luna said at once without a doubt in her mind she handed ginny back the note and they walked to their next class ginny looked at her friend with a puzzled expression on her face this was one of the times that luna happened to invent a bizarre creature that no one ever heard of except for the readers of the quibbler what a rackfet again she asked like she forgot and needed to remember rackfets are very rare small creatures that have a lifetime of a week they usually pull stuff like that you know prank stuff until they die she explained with her dreamy voice sounding very sure of herself daddy magazine had a really fascinating article about them last month didntyou read it ginny wrinkled her nose she didntlike lying to her friend but the stories the quibbler came up with were just weird no i guess i missed that issue ginny mumbled quietly but as much as i would like to believe a rackfet wrote me a prank note i really think a student did it maybe not even as a prank maybe it was sincere honestly ginny couldntreally think of anyone in particular at the moment luna suggested it was colin creevey because he always sat behind her in defense classes ginny hoped it wasnthim colin is cute but i mean just cute like unicorn cute she said as an excuse but she didntknow what she would do if she ll find out it was really colin who wrote the note what would she say then she glanced at the caption on the note again a lost expression crossed her face who could have written it she racked her brain but couldntthink of anyone she hadntnoticed if someone had looked at her with affection recently well except for dean though she knew what his handwriting looked like and it wasnteven similar to the handwriting on the note and of course there was neville who she just found out liked her first there was neville and now colin she thought what is with everyone lately i not that popular the lettering still looked familiar to her but she couldntremember the last time she d seen it she decided to drop it for now concentrating on a conversation with luna about how well they did the test and somehow ginny wasntsure how the rackfers issue came up again saturday finally arrived and harry couldntwait until he d be dueling with dean time however seemed to go even slower than possible the buzzing sound of excited students filled the great hall over breakfast and soon the seventh years started their turn in the dueling club down at the quidditch pitch most of the school went to watch them duel and almost filled all the stands in the stadium harry saw all the seventh years gathering around a group of professors among them were the four heads of houses lupin dumbledore and also madam pomfrey and hagrid for some reason was also presents in the middle of the pitch stood a long stage and near the group of teachers was a small golden cauldron from where he was sitting harry couldntsee clearly what the cauldron contained inside but in the dark grey skies of november he noticed something thick and red shimmering inside almost like burning lava lupin began to describe the rules to the seventh years and shortly after that he turned to the golden cauldron he taped his wand twice and looked inside he called out two names the first turned out to be a ravenclaw girl and the second gryffindor boy the two of them came closer to lupin took a shield bracelet from him and put them on their wrists they got onto the stage bowed to each other and backed away a few steps from each other a second did not pass and each one of them yelled a different kind of jinx the girl smart as every ravenclaw ducked in time and escaped the spell that was shot towards her the gryffindor on the other hand got struck and his body immediately started to shake madly seeing he couldntfunction and continue the duel lupin called the ravenclaw as the winner of the first fight the ravenclaw house started to clap their hands and cheer for her and that how it went for everyone else some duels were short and quick while other took several minutes until someone was called as the victor harry and his friends spent lunch commenting on the duels they d seen and made suggestions and ideas how they thought they would perform they shook hands and made jokes with fellow seventh year slytherins that won on their duels harry was positive he would do well he had so much confidence that he couldnthelp but imagine what it would be like to finally get payback for what dean did to him he had a smug smile on his face but it slowly disappeared as he remembered his only concern what if lupin didntkeep his promise and didntlet him duel with dean how would he make the golden cauldron show his name inside together with dean s anyway he guessed he didnthave anything else to do but wait and see he trusted lupin would keep his promise and at last the sixth years were called at 2 p m to the quidditch pitch when they got there the stage looked way bigger than it looked from up in the stands when everyone finally gathered around the stage harry looked around a satisfied smile played on his lips when he noticed dean was standing with the rest of the gryffindors who thought to show up whether ginny told dean to come or not it didntmatter now because he was there he tried to search for her in the crowd but there were so many people there that he couldnteven spot the bright color of her hair the same group of teachers appeared after everyone settled and went quiet lupin got up on the stage and looked at them hello everyone he greeted happily glad you all came before we begin i want to clarify the rules since you already learned a few years ago how to duel we wontwaste time to cover what you already know so as you have probably seen earlier the cauldron picks your name with someone from a different house you ll get a shield bracelet from me and then you face your opponent you bow take a few steps back and then on my count you start dueling the attacks will only include light jinxes charms and spells it of course unnecessary to say that unforgivable curses are forbidden at that harry could feel everyone stares fixed on him he rolled his eyes in annoyance his insides just wanted to scream and tell them the truth but he refrained himself from doing that and gave them all an ugly smile lupin clapped his hands once that it so now i going to call two names and those two are going to be our first duelers he walked to the golden cauldron tapped his wand twice on it and a light red fume was emitted lupin looked inside the cauldron smiled and called ernie macmillan hufflepuff and neville longbottom gryffindor the first fight was over in no time though each of them was about the same level as the other they both suffered light injuries after a few spell casting lupin had to call it a tie the morale was extremely high the crowd cheered and made the air feel lighter other names were called and a few more duels ended before blaise got picked his opponent was a slim ravenclaw girl unbelievably the girl was announced as the victor a few minutes later blaise after being taken care of by madam pomfrey returned and waited with draco and harry looking very ashamed of himself for losing to a girl harry and draco did their best not to laugh at him amazingly draco opponent was ron weasley ron looked concerned though not entirely scared he exhaled deeply and held his wand really tight in his hand draco with a grin on his face got onto the stage and dueled with him a minute two minutes five have passed and the two were still shouting spells at each other draco eventually got tired of playing around he held his wand high and conjured up a very angry looking snake ron froze at the sight of the snake and stood in place motionless not doing a thing but keeping his distance away from the creature draco seized upon the opportunity and shot a freezing charm at ron ron body went rigid and fell to the floor with a loud thud and draco was called as the victor then when lupin called out the first name of the next two duelers harry was surprised to hear he called out for dean quickly and nervously harry caught lupin eyes and then saw him secretly tapping on the cauldron one more time lupin looked inside the cauldron again and called harry potter slytherin then there was silence like people tried to hear carefully if they ve heard right then a wave of whispers filled the air and when harry got up the silence returned harry didntcare however he was finally going to get his vengeance at dean and after that no one will call him a coward anymore smiling inwardly harry got onto the stage after he took the shield bracelet from lupin he rolled up his sleeves and put it on his wrist a sudden gasp escaped from most of his fellow sixth years looking at some of their faces he realized what the deal was about their eyes were fixed on his left forearm they were surprised to find that he didnthave the dark mark on it harry ignored them all and threw lupin a last quick glance he saw him nodding feebly at him for reassurance and it made him feel even more confident than before harry turned around dean was only a few steps away from him a stern look in his eyes he tightened the grip on his wand nervously harry didntwant to bow to him he just wanted to get it over with but according to the rules this was the proper way to duel so they bowed or at least dean had harry barely arched his back forward and then quickly straightened back up he took a few steps back and held his wand at the ready yearning to hear lupin voice call one ready lupin asked harry closed his eyes briefly and remembered the plan he had in his mind for the last week three two one protego he yelled immediately this was a good choice to start with as dean yelled the langlock spell as he heard one the spell hit the shield and bounced back missing dean by an inch harry was disappointed it didnthit him it could ve spared him a few minutes and a few spells they continued dueling one was shooting a spell and the other was avoiding it after a few minutes dean was bleeding heavily from his nose and harry was having a major headache harry realized his plan wasntgoing well as planned it was time for phase two despite the throbbing in his had he forced himself to concentrate really hard on what he wanted dean to see and believe all the practice he had with lupin about this spell was coming back to him dean was smiling enjoining the support the gryffindors were giving him he thought he had it that harry was going to lose harry was starting to feel the effects of the jinx dean hit him with starting to get worse and the weakness showed on his face that is why dean looked so triumphant he was positive they would call him the winner lupin was thinking on doing the same thing but then harry raised his wand confundo he yelled with difficulty dean didnteven have time to respond he didntsee that coming a streak of white light was shot from the tip of harry wand and hit dean in the chest dean staggered back a few steps and another gasp was emitted from the crowd ron and hermione exchanged looks with each other dean looked dumbfounded for a moment he blinked his eyes rapidly like trying to see in focus and then he shook his head and looked straight at harry harry throat went dry it didntwork he told himself panic rushing through his body his heart beating fast he didntknow what to do now the confundus charm was his only idea he didntthink to have a backup spell just in case that something like this happens he wished he would have practiced the charm a few more times and then he wouldnthave to find himself in this situation he knew he couldnttry again either dean will predict it and block it right away harry really didntknow what to do dean started to look around he turned in his place like searching for something and as harry saw his new behavior he smiled proudly to himself it had worked dean turned around searching for a missing harry even when harry stayed right where he was that what he wanted him to believe that he had disappeared i right here harry said in a singsong voice teasing him a bit dean turned around in his place and looked around again he couldntsee harry anywhere and he didntknow where he went he was so confused in the corner of his eyes harry could see draco and blaise looking at the scene with their mouths agape in amazement then it was the time to actually duel and have some fun well for harry anyway at first he shot a jinx that caused dean to feel like he cut his hands though it was only in his imagination then he hit him with a spell that caused him to fall down to the ground all this time dean was shooting spells all around the place not sure where to aim his wand since he couldntfind harry then luckily for him one of his spells hit harry in the chest he fell backwards and landed on his bottom they both stood up again at the same time what the matter thomas not lost are you harry asked mockingly as he saw dean looking around for him again then all of the sudden dean stopped moving and looked down at his feet and when harry least expected it he saw dean raise his wand at him he didnteven hear the incantation but only saw a ball of fire coming towards him in a speed he felt a sharp burn on his arm where he tried to protect his eyes in an instinct he was on the ground once again and looked to check his arm feeling a sharp stinging sensation on his wrist and then he saw what got burned it was the bracelet and right underneath it harry noticed a small red burn mark on his flesh he didnteven have the time to wonder how dean broke through the confundus charm he already had another idea hit the bracelet he told himself incendio he called not even bothering to stand up a long tongue of flam erupted from harry wand and hit dean in the wrist he yelped in pain and harry knew it worked and while dean was busy feeling his bleeding wrist harry had the chance to shot another trip jinx at him dean slipped backwards again and gasped for air as his body hit the floor he stayed lying motionless for a few seconds his arm staining the front of his robes with blood harry just watched him lying sprawled like that his mind blocking the cheers his fellow slytherins erupted with as he only heard lupin announced that he was the winner all he could think of was how weak dean looked at the moment when he wasntaiming a wand at someone who was defenseless harry knew he had looked the same way when dean stunned him in hogsmeade and frankly he didntcare about how he looked he was glad and not at all sorry that he finally made dean see how it had been for him a n that was long and thinking it was combined at first with chapter 11 well anyway i hope you liked it first i dontwant to elaborate about it in the next chapter so i ll say it here the shielding bracelet tore because it was sensitive to fire harry was actually about to tell ron to tell fred and george to fix the bracelets because they were defective like lupin said they cantprotect from everything i cut that out because it didntfit i also wanted to note that the idea of the shielding bracelet came before i read hbp so the idea wasnttaken from there now about the note ginny found i didntwant to tell yet what is written inside because i saving it for later but i sure you all have a pretty good guess what she read there it not so hard to figure out chapter 13 will discuss about it more chapter 13 is nearly finished now and i ll probably send it to my beta by the end of the week you can check my profile page once in a while to see updates on this

to writing since i started this story things are going to get more interesting now i hope enjoy your reading chapter 13 stupidity and lack of sleep rain was pouring down forcefully outside the castle now when november was almost ending it had been raining for days now almost nonstop winter finally settled down and it was expected to linger for a few more cold months although it was freezing cold outside the castle remained warm and held a comfortable feeling within the corridors and classrooms which everyone enjoyed apart from the sound of the heavy raindrops hitting the windowpanes it was a quiet night it had been the same every night since the dueling club ended in the slytherin sixth year boys dormitory almost all the occupants were soundly asleep occasionally emitting a loud snore or a muffled groan everyone was asleep besides harry for days he had found himself unable to get much sleep he lay awake in his bed tossing from side to side as if trying to find a comfortable position so that he might find it relaxing and let his eyes close minutes later he turned to lie on his back staring up into nothing as the darkness of the room enveloped him he held his duvet to his chin and drummed his fingers on the headboard of the bed while all sorts of thoughts swept through his mind it usually went back to focusing on one particular subject which he unsuccessfully had tried to avoid while trying to get to sleep her name was ginny weasley and no matter how much he tried she wouldntleave his head she was now a regular visitor who always came at night whether he was dreaming or still awake knowing he wouldntget to sleep in the next few hours he realized it d be best at least to think about things other than ginny the dueling club for some reason was the first thing that came to his mind ever since then he finally had his peace and quiet finally he could let out a sigh of relief because people started coming to apologize to him for giving him the cold shoulder or offending him in every way when they mistakenly thought he was a death eater all of them of course were slytherins at least those who werenton the dark side since harry never made friends with people from the other houses he waited to hear an apology from granger or her boyfriend or perhaps even from ginny but none came and he knew now not to expect anything from them the younger slytherins started to look at him with some sort of awe after his duel with dean thomas like he was their hero they made up some exaggerated nicknames for him like the best dueler in slytherin or in some cases the best dueler in school harry didntshow any signs of if he liked it or not because deep inside he knew it was all a lie without lupin help he would ve never gotten this title in the first place despite the reoccurring questioning harry never told anyone how he learned to do the confundus charm which was after all n e w t level spell he didntwant to give lupin away and tell everyone that the defense professor had practically helped him cheat it would get them both in trouble if any of the school staff found out their little secret from time to time harry had a chance to see dean walking around the school alone or with a couple of his mates he never saw him around ginny and thought they must have had a row or something every time he and harry passed each other dean would turn back and look at him sullenly clearly thinking it wasntover for harry however it was he had no reason to seek a fight with him again what troubled him the most was the fact that ginny seemed to keep her distance from dean surely they didn t break up more than once harry had thought it could be real but he didntwant to get his hopes up ginny and dean were too close and happy why would they break up it was amazing how ginny fought her way back into his thoughts once more maybe it was because he hadntseen her lately he d only get a chance to get a fair look at her during meal times but never had an opportunity to meet her alone again not ever since he ran into her on her way to class after the all hogsmeade incident he had with dean she always seemed to be around her friends and if they happened to walk in the same corridor she would never even look at him it saddened him even more than before it was absolutely exasperating to have such strong feelings for a girl who obviously didntfeel the same way about him it was eating him inside that she wasnteven looking his way anymore hadntshe heard he wasnta death eater where was she the day of the dueling club anyway was she still afraid of him after all harry listened to the rain outside getting stronger it pounded on his window forcefully tap tap tap god it drove him crazy why couldnthe just fall asleep a lightning struck a mile away and a flash of light lit the room for a second the thunder came a moment after and harry stayed still and listened to the storm outside he never liked rain he preferred snow in the winter and couldntwait for the weather to be cold enough for snow to fall snow always reminded him of good times and christmas christmas may have been right around the corner but it seemed like the good times had vanished for the time being harry just couldntcall himself happy at the moment what with ginny who doesntgive a damn about him or with lucius malfoy who could kill him and his parents anytime now the room was too dark for him now he needed light to think straight and to see that he was safely tucked in his bed and nothing menacing was near by reaching under his pillow for his wand and illuminating it he also found a small piece of parchment there he knew what it was and the reason he put it there was because of the advice lupin gave him he needed that note to be with him all the time when he was sleeping he kept it under his pillow and when he was awake he kept it in his pocket it was always protected even better than prisoners in azkaban harry pulled out the note from underneath his pillow and unfolded it he found that he could never stop looking at the words he absently scribbled on it days ago he got used to the fact that it was he who wrote them down but it still hadntdawned on him completely that what he wrote was actually true he knew somewhere in the back of his mind that it was true but just couldntaccept it it didntseem real to him he never felt that way so why now why about her of course he would never tell a soul or let anyone see that note then again he couldntpossibly keep it in his pocket forever when he got over the phase he having right now with ginny he will chuck that note into the fire before anyone could read it he was also afraid that if anyone did read it he d be so crimson with embarrassment and people would stop talking to him again stop liking him such things could easily kill his reputation in slytherin harry kept staring at the note in his hands he couldntread it perfectly his vision was blurry since he hadntbothered putting on his glasses to read it he already knew what was written on it he traced the black writing with his finger as though something would happen or maybe they will disappear he didntwant them to disappear it was proof his feelings were real hmmm mumbled one of harry roommates suddenly from the other end of the room wha potter put that light off you prick some of us arentvampires like you we actually sleep at night you know the boy hissed screw you nott groaned harry but despite that he extinguished the light of his wand stuffed it and the note back under the pillow and sank his head into it he closed his eyes shut forcing sleep to come and hoping that maybe the ginny in his head would be nice enough to let him sleep what was left of the night umm no still not waking up harry vaguely heard some voices some very annoying disturbing voices somewhere far away way behind knowledge he thought he was losing it completely going mental if he was hearing voices now he desperately hugged his pillow tighter and sank his face deeper in it maybe that way he wouldnthear them anymore the sensation of being forcibly shaken was barely registering in his mind just smack him on the head with a pillow or something always worked before something quite heavy but yet soft hit him in the face unexpectedly harry let out a low complaining groan wishing the attacking thing to disappear and let him sleep a bit more i telling you he dead he not dead you moron he breathing maybe he unconscious here try this suddenly an icy cold liquid flushed his face and harry awoke with a start his eyes were wide with confusion and shock his hands were flipping around maniacally running though his wet hair he blinked the water drops from his eyelashes not that it helped clear his vision since he was seeing blurry without his glasses either way laughter was ringing around the room when harry finally came to his senses whadehell he muttered his voice still husky from sleep good morning greeted draco lazily harry shoved his glasses up his nose and noticed his friend was already dressed for school and was leaning against the door blaise was standing in front of him with the now empty glass of water in his hand his face grinning mischievously what the fuck blaise harry demanded pulling the ends of a few wet locks of his black messy and currently damp hair i soaked well you wouldntwake up you missed breakfast his friend informed him he gave him a piece of toast wrapped in a paper napkin harry took it but merely stared at it before his eyes started to drift close on their own whoa blaise said clicking his fingers in front of harry eyes and they snapped open again wake up what is it with you you look like shit thanks harry mumbled sarcastically taking a slow bite off his toast no i really mean it you look absolutely drained what were you doing last night that was so exhausting he added an amused grin no what you think that for sure harry said i cantcatch much sleep lately he pinched the bridge of his nose when he let out a loud yawn oh blaise said stupidly but then added with a knowing tone you know i noticed that you have trouble sleeping when something is troubling you you think harry asked angrily he was already aware of that blaise frowned at him and again tossed a pillow at his face causing harry to fall back on the bed dontbite my head off i was just trying to help anyways you better get ready quickly classes start in ten minutes remember we ve got snape first you dontwant to fall asleep head in your cauldron in his class do you we ll meet you there he said joining draco at the door and leaving harry all alone you could ve at least brought me some coffee harry shouted after him get your own coffee he heard him call back he closed his eyes again savoring how good it felt to do that his eyes werentstinging anymore and he felt relief and dontfall asleep again harry let out an angry grunt and forced himself off the bed to get ready luckily he managed to get an e on today potion assignment and stay awake all through the double period they had with snape once the lesson was over he was on his way to the kitchens to grab a cup of coffee which hopefully will hold him awake for the rest of the day he was on his way for his next class when he crossed the entrance hall and saw two girls were coming his way they were whispering to themselves about something crouching over something they held together in their hands the first girl had brown bushy hair while the other had magnificent long red hair harry couldnthelp but smile when he saw her he felt he was blushing from the neck up and hated himself for it he lowered his head when they passed him embarrassed they d see his flushed face but they didnteven spare to glance at him well who could have written it then ginny whispered fiercely but harry happened to still hear her voice i have no clue i spent the last few days in the library searching for spells but i tried everything i know it wontdo anything hermione said maybe it just a simple note with nothing dark behind it this is stupid ginny said aloud and harry stopped to look back to see her raising her hands in defeat i giving up who ever wrote that note only wanted to drive me crazy ginny it not true hermione said patiently we ll figure it out we will find out who wrote this to you she was waving a small piece of parchment at her harry got a glimpse of a black line of words his eyes went wide as he saw what it was ginny sighed and came over to take it back she looked at the note again let out another long sigh and went up the stairs leaving hermione alone it finally hit him but no it couldntbe true he had both two notes with him all the time harry quickly started shoving his hands in all his pockets in try to find the two identical notes all he found was the one he already knew he had he was sure he took the second note from the desk in lupin classroom the other day he must have had but then again he couldntremember she couldntpossibly have it he rummaged through his bag taking out books and long scrolls of parchment but didntfind what he was looking for she didntjust hold the second note panic was starting to take over please tell me she doesnthave the second note nothing he only had one note and she by the looks of it had the other sinking to the floor in despair he gathered all his belongings and threw them back into his school bag he could hear the bell ringing signaling for students that the next lesson i was about to start people all around him hurried to their classes the floor trembled under his feet from all of them running together until the hall was completely silent again he got up and looked around suddenly seeing one girl watching him closely a frown on her face harry saw granger was about to say something but he turned his back on her quickly and walked to his next class ginny has the second note that was all he could think of while he was walking to class he was angry with himself angry of being too stupid and forgetting the other note and letting ginny find it he was supposed to keep it to himself not to tell her and now granger knows he wrote it why there had to be two notes in the first place who knows how many people already read it already talking about it behind his back laughing about him it was the last thing he wanted the last thing he would have expected to happen great just what he needed right now he can forget about sleeping for the next two weeks or so stupid stupid stupid on the afternoon harry had his team out on the quidditch pitch for a practice it was quite dark with all the black clouds in the sky and the sun only came out and shone one ray of light for just a second and then disappeared again the rain weakened by the hour but the team still complained about the rough conditions it was freezing outside but harry was determined to have a practice today why do we have to practice today whined jackson because our game against ravenclaw will probably be held under weather worse than this we need to get use to playing in these weather conditions harry replied raising his voice so the team could hear him over the loud whistles of the blowing wind he could barely see anything with his glasses on not to mention without them the rain drops kept spattering over his lenses and every now and then he needed to wipe them clean we re so going to catch pneumonia graham said quietly he teeth clanking it was hard to hear him over the loud whistles of the wind and harry thought he heard him adding i ha hate th this why wontwe just say we cantplay we ll fake someone got an injury that way ravenclaw will play against hufflepuff suggested blaise i remember flint did it three years ago with gryffindor no we cantavoid it now stop acting like a bunch of babies it d be only one hour harry said they started practicing harry could barely see what was going on but it sounded like it wasntgoing well the chasers kept flying into each other draco missed the quaffle at least five times and crabbe and goyle couldntsee where they were aiming the bludgers as the two angry black balls started soaring in the air almost knocking everyone off their brooms and harry situation wasntbetter he never even came close to the snitch this is bad harry thought he called a five minute break they all landed on the ground and headed for the changing rooms who that draco asked he pointed to someone standing at the entrance of their changing room the silhouetted figure held a cloak above its head shielding itself from the rain as harry and his teammates got closer a face started to be more visible it was hermione granger and harry could only guess why she was there what re you doing here granger he asked her came spying for her boyfriend about our moves what else draco accused putting on a disgusted face i donteven understand quidditch malfoy she retorted and not that there was much to see anyway even a one year old could tell you cantplay at this weather draco made an angry sound and walked into the changing room without another look at her what do you want harry asked again i came to talk to you people told me i ll find you here you must be crazy to practice in this weather i donthave the mood or the time to chat right now granger i have here six people who i need to train for our next match and i myself canteven see a damn thing with these on he pulled off his glasses and cleaned them with the hem of his wet sweater only to cause them to get dirtier he sighed in annoyance and meant to put them back on but hermione snatched them from his grip here let me she said she pulled out her wand and tapped the glasses with it impervius she handed them back and harry looked at her confused he tried them on and found that he could see hua thanks he mumbled almost inaudibly but she gave him a small smile harry looked at her and sighed he knew what she wanted to talk about and he wanted to tell her something as well that why he didnttell her to leave when he saw her he knew that if he gets himself into this now he will never be able to concentrate on their practice today look whatever you want to tell me just do it later i really cantright now fine i ll wait she said and turned around to leave i ll meet you at the entrance hall when you finish your practice harry nodded and entered the changing room he grabbed a towel and wiped his face dry what did the mudblood want draco asked nothing harry replied he then had a short talk with his team about how they should play and it seemed to have helped a bit half an hour later harry called the practice over he walked back to the castle dreading of what granger might tell him she probably wanted to let him know that she told ginny he was the one who wrote the note she found when he entered the castle he looked around and then spotted her sitting on the stairs with a book open on her knees he walked to her and when she spotted him she stood up and put the book in her bag she turned around and walked up the stairs come after me she said simply harry walked behind her they didntsay anything else to each other until they reached the fourth floor and harry saw she was heading to the library merlin granger is there a day you dontcome here this is the most private and quiet place i could think of do you have any other suggestions she said a broom cupboard maybe she laughed lightly dontbe ridiculous potter if ron catches me with you in a broom cupboard you know well enough what he will do to you they walked into the library hermione gave madame pince a small smile and then headed to a table in the back of the room which was hidden behind high bookshelves he thought it was good that way no one will see them together but what makes you think that we can talk here without letting the mad librarian over there to kick us out for disturbing the silence of the library he hissed at her madame pince isntmad she just misunderstood she knows me well enough and she trusts me now sit down hermione indicated for him to take an empty seat while she sat in the seat across him so i know you wrote the note she said getting straight to the point yeah i ve already realized that he said quietly bowing his head in shame you donthave to act like that there is nothing wrong with having feelings for someone you too can act like a normal human being who has emotions you donthave to shut yourself out harry looked away staring out of the closest window and watched the sky turning dark blue while the rain kept pouring down if you haventtold her yet please don t hermione voice stuttered he could hear confusion in her voice you you dontwant her to know it you no i don t but she should know hermione insisted she out of her mind trying to figure out who it is who wrote that note she should know and you should tell her harry let out a hollow laugh she not even close is she she doesnteven think i might be the guy who wrote it does she hermione didntsay anything for a moment and harry knew he was right ginny didntcare about him well maybe she just needs someone to help her get on the right track ginny is just so confused right now she doesntknow what she wants if you let me talk to her i said no harry said firmly i dontneed you ginny or anyone to take pity on me i dontneed or want your help with this that note was never supposed to get to her i wanted this to be kept quiet obviously i failed he sighed heavily let face it she not feeling the same way for me and if you tell her it me she ll only be disappointed i just wonder what dean might say about it hermione cast him a weird look what dean got to do with oh tell me you re joking she said as though waiting to hear him to abort what he just said joking about what he asked her confusedly merlin i thought you knew knew what what is it he pressed hermione clapped her hand to her mouth and started muttering to herself goodness the all school knows it for weeks and he still living under a rock dean ginny they they ended it like a month ago at hogsmeade on halloween right after when you were unconscious they got into this big row she actually defended you and he wanted to know why after that she told him it was over and he left she helped you wake up and tried to explain but you didntlisten to her i think that what caused her to turn her back on you she angry because she finally realized you cared for her but then you were all cold to her again and that where you are now she explained harry looked horrorstruck he ruined it ruined everything he could have had with her if he only just stayed back and listened to what she had to say then maybe now he wouldntbe here talking to hermione granger in the library hidden from the world he never felt more stupid in his entire life and he cursed himself for his stupidity he bore his face in his hands and then slammed his palm hard on the table causing hermione to jump a long moment has passed before she spoke again i i want to help you she said tentatively her voice was soft and he never heard her talk to him with that tone harry shook his head yeah i know i ve got serious problems i need help all the shrinks and healers didnthelp before but i ve got the feeling you can make some progress with me he said half sarcastically half seriously hermione had no clue what he was talking about she decided she d best forget it and explain herself no i meant helping you with ginny harry head rose up at once slowly he started chuckling silently you want to help me with ginny yes she said seriously i do but you hate me i hate you if you hate me than why are you here talking to me she challenged crossing her hands over her chest and leaning back in her chair watching him fumbling for words he opened his mouth several times to respond but couldntfind anything to say to that she was quite right he didnthate her he didntreally have a reason to she on the other hand should hate him for all the horrible things he had done and said to her why do you want to help me because this situation is exhausting the two of you you re too stubborn and she too blind if you let me help we might fix this she cares for you i know she does otherwise why did she break up with dean because of you why did she care enough to help you wake up that day why did she say you kissed better than him harry eyes lit up and his heart jumped all the way to his brains she said that hermione nodded hua hua let me help you but harry looked over to the window again doesntknow if he should believe the things she said again he was feeling like he should back off and give up this phase will eventually fade away but it not worth it she in her own perfect world where i donteven exist hermione moved to another chair in order to catch his look ginny insists on staying in denial when she not one hundred percent believing what she feels or what is the truth but if you flash it in front of her eyes she ll realize that she was wrong harry wanted to believe her she was saying all those comforting things to him for the first time ever since he realized he fancied ginny he had someone to talk to openly about it and it made him feel more relieved she understood how he felt and what he was going through she wanted to help him get ginny but then something still didntseem to make sense and why do you want to help me what will you get from it well if my plan works you and ginny get together and hopefully be happy what i get from is just your kindness instead of saying get lost mudblood she said it in a fake low and manly voice you could just say hello you know as a sign of gratitude for what i did for you i guess i can do that he said quietly but what if your plan wontwork or why would she even want me i already tried getting her attention it didntwork i blew it long time ago when i first had a chance all she thinks when she sees me is what is this death eater want from me now hermione didntgive up she could see he had a very low self esteem when it came to girls and she wanted to fix it for him okay first of all you can count on me that my plan will work i know ginny and i know what i doing so just trust me on this secondly trying to get her attention by being rough on her isntthe way to do it you need to be gentle to know what she wants i ll help you there dontworry and lastly nobody not even ginny still thinks you re a death eater we all know the truth now well then it could have been nice to apologize harry spat suddenly feeling angry now you know the truth but you did think i was one at first did you if i hadntshowed it to everyone you would probably still believe those rumors hermione flushed a very faint color of pink okay i admit it i misjudged you but it was really only because ron said you threatened him and then there were all these scenarios that he pointed out to me it was pretty convincing after he said you were casting a confundus charm on professor lupin and he acted like nothing happened harry looked at her with his mouth agape so that what he thought i d done she saw his mortified look and she hurried to explain but then at the dueling club we realized we realized we were wrong about you and it was all just a big misunderstanding she exhaled heavily because she almost forgot to breathe i really sorry i should have said it before but i really am truly sorry harry sat quietly for a moment going though what she just told him when did i threaten him he finally asked after a long pause i was only joking at first i wasntseriously going to use an unforgivable curse on him why would he say i threatened him he said you told him not to tell anyone about what he saw in lupin classroom or else you d be upset okay i find this whole thing quite ironic because he swore to me he didnttell you about that when he actually did but it wasnta threat i only said it so he wonttell ginny whatever he came up with because then i really will be upset in case she believed whatever he d say to her he must have misunderstood me is all hermione looked at him apologetically well i didntknow that i guess things have gotten out of hand haventthey yeah i guess so he said quietly for the first time in what must have been like two hours a long silence fell between them harry realized it wasntweird at all to talk to her all those years he mistook her thinking the same as his friends were thinking calling her names because she wasntlike them but in fact she was more like him and she must have suffered all those years because of him so what will your boyfriend say if he finds out you were talking to me and helping me get his sister behind his back harry asked oh he ll probably freak out and get really mad at me but eventually forgive me because he loves me then again ron and i have always shared different opinions about almost everything the library was now closing and he and hermione got up to leave they were the last people except madame pince who stayed there dinner was now being served in the great hall and harry was in a particularly good mood now thanks to her they descended the stairs to the great hall together no one was in sight to see them talking to each other god i need a smoke harry said suddenly that must have caught hermione off guard for that she turned to look at him with her eyebrows raised i used to smoke something like three years ago when i was too stupid to notice it then my parents caught me and that was the end of it i just have the need to have one right now there too much going on too much pressure dontworry it will all be over soon now what you really need to start doing is to think of a christmas gift for ginny i beg you pardon harry looked at her as though she d gone mad she went on as if she hadntheard him i recommend you buy her something nice but not too fancy try to think of something she will like oh dontlook at me like that i think it d be a good thing to start with keep it as a secret for the meanwhile just think of it secret santa she added mysteriously once they reached the entrance hall and she hurried to the great hall hey granger he said before she went through the doors she turned around and looked at him i just wanted to say thank you and that i sorry for everything i did to you she nodded and smiled kindly apology accepted harry suddenly felt an enormous weight lifting off his shoulders now he has to figure out what granger meant by the secret santa comment it was saturday morning and it finally stopped raining the air however was still cold outside and wild winds were still blowing occasionally so harry draco and blaise stayed at their dormitory where a nice warm fire was burning in the small hearth of the room as there was a last hogsmeade trip before the holiday they decided to go to the village later that day right now draco was lying in bed reading the previous day paper blaise was tossing a paper ball he made from his unsatisfactory transfiguration homework back and forth at the wall with his wand and harry was making a list of suggestions for gifts he could buy ginny for christmas right now he had a sheet of paper only full of doodles of little stick people which were meant to be him and ginny kissing he couldntthink of anything to get her but knew there had to be at least one thing she would like after a few minutes of racking his brains and finding nothing he had the courage to ask some help say blaise if you were a girl what would you want me to get you for christmas blaise turned and look at him with a puzzled look on his face are you implying something or is there a redhead girl you want to get a christmas gift for harry couldnthelp but gave him a smile and he felt himself blush from the neck to the roots of his hair the latter he admitted he got used to the fact that blaise and draco didntcare he liked ginny as long he didntbrag too much over it like blaise did with his crush on pansy blaise played along leaning against the headboard of his bed well okay assuming i a redhead girl who also likes quidditch i would have wanted the new broom on the market tearing tiger roar harry burst out laughing at the imitation of blaise roaring and holding his hands like tiger claws yeah problem is i only have like 10 galleons worth allowance that i saved for the last six months and i need to buy presents for seven people maybe i ll get her a scarf or a hat or some other rubbish girls like jewelry draco said from his bed harry turned to look at him his face was still hidden behind the paper you might consider buying her a jewel or something that what girls like perhaps you didnthear me draco i have a low budget harry said a bit louder as if to make it clear to draco what he was saying i did hear you but there an advertisement here for a new jewelry store down in hogsmeade they re having a special offer for the holiday really low prices on everything in the store he said finally moving the newspaper off his face let me see that harry said taking the paper from him he looked at the ad and saw the pictures of all kinds of beautiful jewels the prices flashed in and out of the frame the prices were indeed low compared to other jewelry stores and harry thought it would be a great idea to stop there later and buy something for ginny hey what that said blaise suddenly he was sitting on the carpet now and had the paper in his hands he looked concerned over the front page draco did you look at this your father is mentioned here harry and draco swooped next to blaise as he laid the paper on the floor the front page of the daily prophet bore the headlines massive death eaters breakout from azkaban this is yesterday paper i just got around to look at it draco commented they all began to read quietly last night minister of magic cornelius fudge had confirmed to the press that azkaban prison had a breakout of no more than seven convicted death eaters this is the first time anyone ever succeeded breaking out of azkaban the ministry right now has no idea how seven death eaters managed to escape from the dementors guarding the prison the scene is now investigated by expert aurors however that the ministry does have speculations that lucius malfoy a respectable known wizard who was also suspected to be a death eater more than a decade ago but got off when proved his claim that he had been under the effect of the imperious curse before you know who big downfall was behind the whole incident malfoy right now is suspiciously missing aurors and dementors have been placed by his home fudge did not want to elaborate on what else the ministry forces are doing at the moment and if indeed malfoy had anything to do with the breakout but a source within the ministry who wished to remain unnamed has told us that it was hard not to see that malfoy is planning to get back at sirius black for killing he who must not be named for fifteen years now and was only waiting for the right time to strike it obvious mr malfoy is trying to gather as much power as he can he probably one of the few people who know where black is hiding and he about to do something about it with the help of the escaped death eaters malfoy is at large at the moment and very dangerous no one can predict how he managed to help them escape where they are all hiding and when they will strike fudge is extremely worried about the public safety but yet trying to stay calm at the press conference last night fudge agreed to say the names of the escaping death eaters this is a warning for each and every one of you if any of you see the following please alert the ministry of magic immediately rodolphus lestrange rabastan lestrange bellatrix lestrange walden mcnair bartemius crouch jr antonin dolohov and augustus rookwood these witches and wizards are extremely dangerous please be careful until an official announcement of their captures will be released for more information on sirius black and lucius malfoy please read page 4 columns 2 and 3 at the bottom of the article was a row of pictures which held the names of the escaping death eaters along with the word wanted above each photo and at the center of the page were two more pictures the first was of lucius malfoy sneering at the camera the other of a very young version of his godfather harry never seen sirius so young but he noticed his spirit never changed the sirius in the picture 15 years younger was winking at the camera from time to time and holding a huge grin on his face after finishing looking at the paper harry looked over at draco his head was bowed his fist clutched tightly and he had a dark expression on his face harry wasntfeeling so cheerful himself he knew that meant that he and his parents need to be really careful right now more than everyone and he wouldntbe surprised if they needed to go back into hiding draco got up without saying a word and left the room closing the door to their dormitory quietly as if not to disturb anyone on such a quiet sunday morning harry and blaise exchanged worried looks harry at least would expect him to burst out and get really upset but the serenity in draco behavior was quiet disturbing what do you reckon will happen this christmas blaise asked in a hushed voice harry sighed his eyes drifted back to the photo of draco father in the paper i dontknow let just hope it will be a happy one for all of us the great hall was decorated in its usual holiday decorations and the twelve giant christmas trees the enchantment ceiling of the hall reflected the snowy weather outside and gave the feeling as though the light white flakes were falling into the castle harry had done all his christmas shopping that afternoon in hogsmeade and spent the rest of the day in the three broomsticks drinking butterbeer with draco and blaise draco seemed to be feeling a bit more cheerful since that morning but blaise and harry knew there was something he was trying to hide they werentsure how draco christmas would be with just him and his mother alone at their big mansion whereas his father was still missing along with the other escaped death eaters which none of them had been caught yet the thing that sucked the most was that neither of them could invite draco to spend christmas with them blaise was leaving with his parents to his relatives in ireland and harry parents will never let him get into the house especially with the current situation with draco father and sirius being at their home later that evening right before dinner harry had a little chat with professor lupin who told him he would be taking him to his parents and spend the christmas with them like it was planned you can spend the train ride with your friends he said and when we get off in london you ll join me harry was sitting in lupin office in front of his desk with lupin was sitting on the other side are we going into hiding he dared to ask he was afraid of asking the question and the answer he would get in return he didntwant to go into hiding he wanted things to be normal where sirius could walk down the street freely without fears that a death eater would catch him and not in his animagi form and where all the death eaters are locked behind bars in azkaban and where his friends didntneed to worry about anything but school exams i really dontknow harry lupin replied sincerely could be could not i guess we ll have to wait and see professor dumbledore said he will let us all know when would be the right time to do that he still thinks you re safe when you are and that there is nothing to worry about even with the breakout from azkaban harry asked incredulously yes even with the breakout your house harry is very guarded place both of your parents are aurors and they trust dumbledore you do trust dumbledore dontyou well yes i guess he said quietly he remembered how his parents always praised dumbledore for being the greatest wizard in the world harry looked down at his professor desk and sighed heavily then his eyes spotted a familiar yellow parchment which was lying open on the desk lots of black dots were moving there and harry leaned forward to catch a better glance at it with lupin watching him questioningly is that the parchment that i gave you on halloween harry asked with curiosity not noticing that he prying is it really a map yes it is lupin replied with a light note in his voice it not just a map it the marauder map harry looked up at him and raised his eyebrows in surprised you mean you sirius and my dad did that he asked with wonderment of course he knew all about the time when his father and his friends called themselves marauders he spent years hearing all kinds of funny stories they did while being at school and he recalled he once heard about a map which filch confiscated during their sixth year lupin nodded yes along with peter he said harry face soured at the mention of the traitor name lupin didntseem to notice it and continued i dontknow how it got into your hands harry but i ought to let your father and sirius see it again it has been such a long time since we last seen it what does it do exactly harry queried well it a map of hogwarts it shows where everyone is at this moment and all the secret passages that we knew about lupin explained harry wrinkled a brow what secret passages at that lupin must have noticed he said something harry shouldnthave known the ones that your mother will kill me if i ll tell you about harry let out a small chuckle lupin then reached to map ready to roll it up when he suddenly stopped and looked at the map intensely and his face paling in an instant harry watched him swallow hard and get to his feet his hands shaking harry i there something that came up he said rashly still staring at the map with the same stunned face i ll see you later let yourself out okay and before harry could ask what was wrong lupin was out of his office running down the hallway the marauder map still clutched in his hands harry wasntsure what exactly caused this sudden change in his professor behavior but was sure it was none of his business so he left the office only to remember his own concerns he was concerned about draco and about his family and one of his biggest concerns was if ginny will like the present he got her or not so after dinner he waited for granger outside the great hall he wanted to ask her what she thought of it he still couldntbelieve himself he was on speaking terms with her but she wanted to help him and he really needed her help as she left the great hall she was walking along with the two weasleys now how he was supposed to get her alone without making it look suspicious without thinking much he called her and said the first thing that came to his mind before they will disappear up the staircase to gryffindor tower oy granger he yelled the three gryffindors spun around ron expression changed in a second to a scowl harry stomach lurched as ginny eyes narrowed when she spotted him but hermione features stayed natural umm professor snape he he asked me to call you to his office hermione made a move to come down the stairs when ron stopped her whatever for he asked him sharply honestly ronald it going to be fine hermione said to him with a roll of her eyes stop being too protective of everyone she gave him a quick peck on the cheek before coming down and joining harry to the direction of the dungeons as they reached the dark dungeons harry pulled her behind a suit of armor i feel like we re sneaking around to snog he muttered he looked around carefully to see nobody was around and then pulled out of his pocket a red velvet box in a shape of a heart opened it and showed her the necklace he picked for ginny what do you think he asked it was a silver chain with three pearls the one in the middle was big and pink while the two on either side of it were white but smaller oh it lovely she said leaning down to the red box to examine the necklace more closely is that real silver yes the pearls are real too then he murmured do you think she ll like it if she won t then she a fool hermione replied with a snicker this must have cost you a lot yeah pretty much harry voice trailed off well she deserves something nice right harry looked up to see her smiling fondly at him dontdo that he said icily before she ll sigh or say awww hermione raised her hands in defeat haventdone anything she said innocently so have you decided what you re writing her on the card i need to write a card harry said in surprise all this time he was busy thinking of buying something nice for ginny that he totally forgot he also needed to write her a card hermione cast him a pointed look every christmas present should have a card from the sender but i thought you said i should keep it a secret for the meanwhile i did but that doesntmean you dontneed to write a card she said i would love to help you there as well but i think it should be personal and come from the heart hermione then handed him the necklace and walked off up the stairs back to the entrance hall that night it was the last night before it was time to leave for the holiday after harry was all packed up and ready to head to bed he finally found the time to write ginny her card it was around one in the morning but he didntcare from the few cards he bought to everyone he found just the one he thought looked nice on the wrap of the necklace box it had two little snowpersons on the front which were holding their stick hands together and snowflakes in shapes of tiny hearts were falling around them an hour later when he thought he had finished and came with a good result he suddenly remembered he needed to sign it well of course he couldntwrite his name if it was suppose to be anonymous he finally came up with something that he had heard a few days back and thought it was perfect when he was finished he put it on the golden wrapping of her gift and hid at the bottom of his trunk and went to sleep the morning after had arrived too quickly and harry never thought he will relive a d j vu like he was having at the moment he was having trouble waking up again but of course being sunken deep with sleep he didntrealize it until someone was giggling like an eight year old school girl and something was poking his right cheek annoyingly harry slapped it away but the giggling only went stronger there were also sounds of clicking and flashes of light which harry had no clue in his state of slumber what exactly caused them mmwha a squeaky voice said along with other kissing noises hawwy musht wake up because he shoooo gownna be late for the twain it said in a mock baby voice go way harry groaned hiding his head now under the pillow i dontwanna get up hawwy i lurve you the annoying voice said happily and harry heard more giggling leavemealone but hawwy i luuuurve you the annoying thing kept poking his cheek even underneath the pillow it found its target and made those stupid kissing noises blaise i swear i going to kill you if i get up he threatened sleepily half aware of what was going on it was the same story all over again only this time harry wished he wontget showered unwillingly he just didnthave the strength to get up and get ready he was too tired and wished to sleep a bit more i not blaise harry dontyou recognize me i thought you loved me harry it me ginny said the voice which now was unsuccessfully trying to imitate a girl voice argh let me try whispered someone harry was falling back to sleep and didntcare who it was his shelter pillow was lifted off his head and he groaned again hiya stud suddenly whispered a soft sexy feminine voice in his ear which harry too clouded with sleep mind still knew that blaise could never in the world make it sound so perfect it reminded him so much of ginny was she really there no she couldntbe could she oh what a perfect dream he having ginny harry mumbled softly and opened one eyelid expecting to see the beautiful freckled face of ginny weasley but instead finding none other than the doggish features of pansy parkinson smiling brightly at him argh harry yelled and in less than a second he was at the other end of the bed clutching his sheets closely to his body and hiding any uncovered part from pansy prying eyes a good wave of laughter erupted around the room there right in front of his bed stood his two best friends draco was struggling to breathe a camera in his hands he obviously just took another picture as harry saw he already had a bunch of them scattered on the floor next to him was blaise holding his stomach and rolling with laughter his hand was dressed with the most repelling sock puppet harry had ever seen it had full red lips at the front and drawn black eyes with long eyelashes so that what was kissing him gross harry mumbled you probably got your germs and flees all over my beddings now he complained bitterly to pansy sweeping with his hand invisible germs off his blanket where she sat a moment before oh it okay for us to share spit but not for me to sit next to you she asked her eyebrows raised and arms folded together please dontremind me of that horrible incident it a scar for life may i remind you potter that you kissed me she said sounding a bit offended now harry groaned i was probably drunk then he said how did he even got into the situation of kissing pansy he totally forgot ginny it was all because of her what are you doing here anyway it the boys dormitories pansy put on her face a confidant smile and said well draco and blaise came for my assistance when they couldntwake you up we had quite a show here with ms puppet that blaise made she said referring to the ugly sock puppet blaise was now taking off his hand and took a few pictures she then threw the last picture draco took at harry lap anyways guys i going got to make some last minute packings see you on the train she said and walked out of their dorm room harry glanced down at the picture now sitting on his bed he was too scared to even look at it he simply grabbed it forcefully and crumpled it into a ball i want those pictures destroyed he said through clenched teeth and before he managed to launch himself at the pile of the other pictures on the floor blaise held him back while draco picked them up na uh draco said this is for bribery he said amused while he waved them at him as if it they were saying goodbye to him and it was the last time he was ever going to see them you see blaise and i thought we ll show it to your precious ginny in case you wontcancel the game against ravenclaw after christmas i sure the weaslette will love to see them how many times did he say her name last night blaise blaise made his all so famous thinking face umm six if i not mistaken harry face was all red from embarrassment i was not talking in my sleep he insisted yes you were and it was so damn hilarious blaise countered harry was tired listening to this he was now fully awake and he needed to get ready to leave and have a proper breakfast first fine whatever he said lamely but i not canceling the game we re playing after christmas and that is it and i dontcare who you ll show those pictures to by all means be my guest honestly he did care if they ll show it to ginny but he knew all too well that she wouldntcare about it at all he wasntone of her concerns so why should she care about him dean neville colin and michael dean neville colin and michael those four names ran through ginny head over and over again she was trying to figure out who could be this mystery guy who wrote her the ghost note as she called it lately because it seemed like neither one of them was him she started to point it out to herself and even written it down in a list dean her last boyfriend she was the one who broke up with him he tried to get together with her they were together for nearly five months problem was that she knew his handwriting too well to know that it didntmatch the writing on the note colin as she was told by luna always seemed to be around her because he fancies her she had the courage to come and ask him if he write her the note but he swore it wasnthim she knew he was being honest with her so he was immediately off the list next was neville whom she d been told not too long ago that he fancied her but lately she d seen him around susan bones and hermione made a note that they were indeed an item so he couldntbe the one and lastly was michael her first boyfriend they were only together for a short while and it was over six months since their breakup so if it was him why hadnthe said anything or why did he remember to let it out now she could just imagine him laughing at her face when she ll ask him about it so she was left with nothing or did she he couldntpossibly she thought no not him this is ridiculous harry potter couldntbe her mystery guy or could he the train station at hogsmeade was packed with students harry neck was starting to hurt from craning over their heads in try to spot ginny red hair all of it was to nothing he just couldntfind her right when he was about to give in he heard a familiar voice talking fast and in a tone of annoyance he knew that whenever he heard hermione granger voice ron weasley was with her probably arguing and is the reason why she sounded annoyed and usually wherever ron went ginny came after him harry was right about that hermione and ron were dragging their trunks to the station having just got off their horseless carriage they were too busy arguing about what sounded like homework they had gotten for the break to notice that ginny was looking unfocused barely managing to make her way through the crowd as she walked slackly behind them she bumped into a few people and almost dropped her trunk twice but then she stopped finally snapping out of her daze as she said goodbye to a few friends that passed her by harry thought it was the best time to give her the gift but how could he do it without even approaching her he spotted a first year and grabbed him by the shoulder the kid squeaked with a start but harry quickly shushed him want to make a few sickles he asked the boy he looked up at harry as though he went crazy but harry stuck his hand into his robe pocket and took out a small bag with ten silver sickles he was left as change from his christmas shopping you want them the boy looked up at him and nodded eagerly his eyes glinting at the small bag in harry hands harry smiled in satisfaction he led him to a far corner and when he was sure no one was looking at them he took ginny gift out of his bag all wrapped up nicely and handed it to him he bent down to match his eye level and then pointed out ginny you see that girl with the red hair he asked the boy nodded again vigorously you take that gift and give it to her if she asks you who gave it to you dontsay anything or point to me is that clear another excited nod if you tell her who you got it from not even one coin for you got it yeah he said in his squeaky voice harry got up on his feet and pushed him forward good now go he watched him run to ginny and then tugging the end of her scurf from behind she turned around and looked down at him the boy simply gave her the gift and harry could see she was amazed to receive it he could read her lips saying who gave you this but he just shrugged and disappeared into the crowd neither ginny nor harry could see him and harry thought he had done a great job because if he would have come back straight to him his cover would have been exposed right away ginny was still surprised to receive the gift harry could see her staring at it and examining it closely she them noticed the card and quickly opened it a minute after her mouth opened speechlessly and harry felt satisfied with himself he knew he was blushing a little and did his best to hide it someone pecked him on the back he turned around to see the small boy waiting for him with a small grin on his lips and his hand already stretch forward harry as promised gave him the small bag of money and the kid disappeared from sight before harry managed to say nice doing business with you ginny walked slowly behind ron and hermione into an empty compartment they found they all sat down as the train started to move ron found it suddenly rather weird that she was too quiet all morning he turned to see her staring at a package in her hands wrapped with shiny read and gold paper hey where did you get that from he asked her some first year kid gave it to me she said softly barely paying attention her eyes were still focused on the card hermione moved next to her and looked at the card same handwriting she whispered i know ginny said you dontthink that kid what no hermione dismissed how is it possible that a first year will have such curved and neat handwriting and write such beautiful words no way i guess you re right ginny said quietly ron cleared his throat as if to let them know he was still there am i missing something ginny has a secret admirer hermione said cheerfully a secret admirer ron asked almost not believing he started to chuckle no way do you know who it is probably dean ginny replied it must be him would she force herself to believe it is dean will she be disappointed to find out if it werenthim ginny couldntanswer those questions because hermione interrupted her before she could think it over well come on open it i want to see what you got she said keenly ginny tore the shiny wrapping and discovered a red velvet box in a shape of a heart she slowly opened it and gasped when she finally saw what was inside it was a beautiful silver necklace with three magnificent pearls the minute she saw it her heart softened she loved it it must have cost him quite a lot she thought whoever he is she knew she must find out who is it she immediately put it on blocking the comments ron threw at her at that and she couldntstop reading the card it was too beautiful to take her eyes off it same as the necklace word for word she read and reread it until she memorized it by heart dear ginny i was sitting and thinking what i should write to you it was a hard task to come up with words all what came to my mind were happy christmas and a happy new year but i knew it wasntenough not for you you mean to me much more so i thought that maybe it was time that i should let my creative side if i have one to take over i wish you this year to be happy to be loved to be grateful that you have healthy life and that you are safe to know that i here thinking about you all the time i hope you like my gift as i spent hours thinking if it will suit you well a pretty neck like yours deserves to wear something nice so finally happy christmas yours truly your secret santa right then ginny knew she wanted to meet him no matter who he was she would accept him a n please review i worked really hard on this chapter the next two or three aregoing to be quite important to the story i ve been really looking forward to writing them disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter 14 christmas surprises as evening enfolded the sky with navy blue velvet the train started to slow down harry watched outside the window the tiny shimmering lights of london growing brighter by the moment soft snowflakes were falling casting a smooth layer of white onto the pavements and rooftops it was apparent that christmas spirit was already in the air guess we should get up blaise said as he saw people strolling down the train he started to gather his belongings my parents are picking me up we re flooing straight to ireland from the leaky cauldron to my aunt philly he said as he fastened his cloak tighter harry got up as well i need to wait for professor lupin to take me home that is if i going home he added glumly the two of them started to get ready to leave only draco remained seated looking sullenly out of the window blaise eyed harry awkwardly and harry sat next to him quietly your mum coming isntshe he asked him draco body tensed up and his face stiffened he barely said a word since they left hogwarts which to harry great disappointment made the train ride less fun than he had wanted it to be draco let out a small sigh before he got up as well and pulled his trunk off the luggage rack it going to be okay draco harry continued trying to sound yeah we ll see he relied with a dark tone in his voice harry knew what he was thinking it would never be okay from now on his father was on the run from the ministry aurors after he helped at least seven death eaters escape from azkaban nothing would be the same again but harry had no idea what else to say to his friend he guessed that if it were him in the same situation he would have acted the same way draco was trying to enjoy life school and friends but lately the relationship he had with his father was unsettled and made him become moody and depressed most of the time the train finally came to a halt and draco quickly muttered a faint happy christmas before leaving blaise and harry alone in their compartment without even glancing at them once harry had the feeling he was holding himself from bursting into tears of fury as he sensed earlier a broken tone in his voice and noticed his eyes begin to swell and redden poor fellow blaise whispered and harry couldntagree more they got off the train onto the platform and started looking around for a familiar face oh there my mum i gone see you after christmas harry blaise waved harry off and went to join his family harry found himself alone where all the students around him were joining their parents on the platform he started to search for lupin but it was impossible to see anything among all the witches and wizards around him he also wished he could have had a last glace at ginny before christmas but he couldntfind her either suddenly he heard lupin voice calling him from behind harry over here harry turned around and saw his professor waving at him over a crowed of heads harry dragged his trunk over to him glad he finally found him ready to go lupin asked he looked exhausted more than usual anyway the train ride probably wore him out because the next full moon was only a week away er yeah how are we getting there he wondered why he didntconsider it before professor lupin gave him a small reassuring smile your parents arranged us a ministry car he replied he led him through the magic barrier in the wall between platforms nine and ten despite the strange looks they received from some muggles who were around they walked casually out to the snow covered muggle street where an old fashioned dark green car waited for them a driver wearing an emerald green velvet suit was sitting by the steering wheel about thirty minutes later they arrived to a small village which was almost hidden behind a forest just as small just a bit south of london they pulled right in front of a two level cottage house which was right at the centre of the village to harry godric hollow was a convenient quiet place to live in and even though it was packed with muggles and his family was one of the only few wizarding families that resided there he loved living there the evergreen trees he used to see all through his summer holidays were now covered with a thick layer of pure white snow the houses around had been ornamented with all kinds of tiny colorful lights and christmas ornaments they got out of the car and lupin started to drag their trunks to the front door while harry took his broom in one hand and hedwig cage in the other and carried them to the entrance as well they got inside quickly and put all their things by the door and closed it quietly harry started to sweep the snowflakes off his cloak and then hung it on the coat hanger while lupin walked into the living room harry heard him call james lily we re here harry looked around the house where christmas decorations were already hung everywhere it sure was pretty looking it looked like his parents really put a lot of effort to make it look nice this year but other than the christmas decorations harry didntsee anything or rather any one else in the house where had his parents gone did they have last minute christmas shopping to do or did something happen to them and lucius malfoy was here and already captured them harry head started to spin around as worries and concerns overflowed him again and he couldnthelp but start to panic a second later he let out a long sigh of relief as he heard his mother familiar giggling coming from the kitchen why didnthe bother to look first before coming up with suggestions he cursed himself for his overreaction he walked over there pushing open the kitchen door to greet his parents but instead of walking in to let them know he was home he quickly spun around and swore under his breath at the sight of the two of them snogging under mistletoe his father was holding in midair over their heads with his wand merlin you two are disgusting harry commented as he strode back to the living room and slumped down on the couch helping himself to a ginger cookie from a plate that was placed on the small coffee table a few seconds later james and lily walked in very red faced lupin who was reading a magazine in the armchair by the fire looked up and saw their messy appearances and started chuckling as he realized what happened you walked in on them he asked harry amused harry groaned yes and believe me no child should see his parents snogging like they did just now he threw them a very disgusted look hello i home he said to them as though it wasntobvious lily quickly recovered from her embarrassment she walked over to her son sat next to him on the couch and leaned to kiss him on the cheek hello honey i sorry about before we didnthear you come in harry pulled his face away from her mum he whined wiping his cheek honestly what was she thinking he was bloody sixteen years old not four lily ignored him how was your trip home she asked interested fine he replied with a shrug he took another bite to his cookie before his mother snatched it from his hand and put it on the table hey i was eating that he complained no you re not dinner is in less than half an hour i dontwant you to stuff yourself with cookies she scolded and stood up and no shoes on the sofa please she said throwing his feet off the armrest and onto the carpet thank you harry watched her walk vigorously back to the kitchen where ham and chicken pie scents filled the air he then turned his head suddenly to his father who was sitting next to lupin you got her pregnant didntyou he said flatly james looked shocked by his son remark his mouth fell open wha of course i didn t why will you say that well i guess we all noticed the mood swings said a voice from the door harry looked up and saw sirius there chewing on a blueberry muffin cupcakes are in the kitchen if you want some harry he said with a wink hey sirius harry said brightly his mood changing the instant he saw his godfather whoa wait a minute james called holding his hands in front of him as to stop all happenings his voice turned into a whisper lily is not pregnant i think i would ve known if she were thank you very much besides we arentthinking of having more children good because i d hate you if you were i happy being an only child harry said retrieving his cookie from the table and stuffing it in his mouth sirius walked in and sat on the carpet next to james feet so james how do you explain her ambition for perfection lately i noticed the house looks a lot cleaner and tidier and the food he took another mouthful bite from his muffin hmm delicious harry suddenly chocked on his own cookie and tried to swallow hard lupin patted him hard on the back to help him and when he was able to breathe again he said you mean you didntbuy these he asked disbelievingly referring to the very tasty cookies mum actually made them lily potter was known as the worst cook in the world it came to situations where the fried chicken shrank to the size on an egg or where the soup came out dark green and crusted or even where the chocolate pie tasted as completely different that was also brown as sirius once said so that was one of the reasons why harry couldntwait to get back to hogwarts every summer he wouldntsuffer his mum cooking for months and have a delicious meal three times a day she did james said i was surprised at first too but she said she got some cooking advices from a friend so i didntpush it and she not pregnant he hissed at the knowing look sirius gave him it the christmas spirit that getting into her sure sirius said waving off we ll see in nine months and then we ll decide if santa thought you were a good boy this year james and lupin couldnthelp but snigger but harry didntfind it quite funny and scowled he better not he warned narrowing his eyes at his father i forbid you to knock up mum james and his two best friends burst out laughing even harder than before hey you re not my father you canttell me what to do i a grown person james said mockingly still laughing harry couldnthold on any longer and let out a laugh of his own joining the other three men then after they caught their breath back and calmed down lily sweet voice came from the kitchen boys dinner ready they all got up lazily sighing in satisfaction and walked over to the dining table james patted on harry back and gave him a smile well it good to have you home son harry leaned back in his chair and rested his hands over his now full stomach he felt as if he had eaten what seemed like three meals at once he felt very fat at the moment even though it didntshow on him this was the best dinner his mum ever made he was so full that he knew he couldntmove for a while that was incredible he breathed a wide dreamy smile on his face if this was supposed to be just an ordinary dinner he thought what christmas eve dinner will be like lily smiled sweetly at him why thank you harry i glad you liked it sirius wiped his mouth with the back on his hand and sighed merlin lily who thought you to cook like that she chuckled it was just molly weasley i came to her a few days ago to ask her for suggestions for what to cook to christmas eve and she thought me a few of her secrets at the sound of the name weasley harry head perked up weasley he asked her as if he didnthear her right yes you met her harry dontyou remember if i recall one of her sons is at your age ron i think his name is yes i remember werentyou two friends harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat er well not exactly that guy is a complete git you see he said hey donttalk like that james rebuked the weasleys are friends of ours so do respect them i didntknow you were still in touch with them harry said of course we are lily said you know what how about we pay them a visit this week harry you should come with us maybe you ll get a chance to know ron a little better she suggested looking hopeful erm no i dontthink i would he mumbled quickly trying to think of a good getaway excuse i have homework to do yeah a lot a lot of homework snape overflowed us with assignments he said confidently satisfied with his answer and the fact that lupin couldnttell he was lying he didntreally fancy going over ginny house and sit around while his mother praised ron as a wonderful guy and ask him why they werentfriends he did however fancy seeing ginny again well you can skip it for a day couldntyou i sure you can manage it she pressed well i of course he ll come james finished for him and with that the conversation was over harry knew he couldntobject his father final word he will now have to go with them to the weasleys just his luck harry woke up the next day feeling like he had slept for two nights straight he guessed his mum let him oversleep since it was a holiday and there was no school that day it was good anyway because he needed to catch up on sleep turning onto his side and glancing at the alarm clock on his bedside cabinet his slightly heavy from sleep eyes shot open when he saw that he hadntoverslept at all the time was only seven in the morning he grabbed the clock quickly and checked closely if it didntgo off to his great disappointment he heard its soft ticking sound and let out a loud groan of frustration as he slammed back on the bed again despite his desperate tries to get back to sleep he couldn t he was now fully awake and he hated himself for it with nothing better to do he threw the covers off himself and got out of bed went into the bathroom to wash his face brush his teeth and change his clothes he went down to the kitchen expecting to see everyone already sitting around the table having breakfast but instead he found it completely empty he guessed he was a bit too late to join them because all the plates and dishes were sitting dirty and empty in the sink no one was around but harry knew they must be near by so he wasntworried he helped himself for a cup of coffee and thought to read the morning paper but a sudden roar of an engine caught his ears coming from the backyard harry curious to what made the rusted sound quickly dressed warmly and stepped outside into the cold snowing backyard there he found sirius standing by his old bike his bike now harry corrected his mind and his father sitting on it heating up the exhaust a black helmet on his lap instead of on his head hem hem harry cleared his throat loudly enough for the two men to hear him they turned around and looked at him his arms folded over his chest waiting for their explanation as if he was a teacher who caught two students doing something out of bounds and not just two students two marauders at that i do believe that my bike you re riding on father he said in a cold voice james gave him a scowl and sirius immediately approached harry harry i glad you re up we were just warming it up for you it time to have your first go dontyou think funny i would ve thought you would care to wake me up first sirius harry said still not very impressed where is mum he craned his neck over sirius shoulder to see his father james turned off the motorbike engine and silence finally fell over the peaceful neighborhood she went with remus to diagon alley to do some last minute shopping since it not so crowded at this hour of the day oh harry said shortly and then a light laugh escaped his throat oh now i get it mum not around so you re in a hurry to have a go on the bike because you know she forbids you to ride it nice one yeah well that another way to look at it sirius said with half a shrug as he turned to look at james for a quick moment harry slowly walked forward okay i ll tell you what dad you give me the first go before mum gets back home and i in return wonttell her you rode it and what makes you think i will allow you to ride it james asked also folding his hands over his chest thinking he has advantage over his son well that is my bike now that sirius gave it to me harry pointed out easily a mischievous smirk playing on the corner of his mouth and since it mine i might not allow you to ride it so hand over the helmet pop or mum will be very cross with you james knew that his son had a point lily would kill him if she finds out he put even one finger on the thing on the other hand she would be cross with harry instead of him because he was the one who actually got to ride it harry saw his father pout and reluctantly got off the bike with slacked shoulders and the helmet held under his arm as harry made his way to him slowly he could hear him mutter something incoherent which he swore he heard the words git and slytherin included harry however couldnthelp but snigger and feel victorious when he heard him donttake it too bad james sirius said trying to cheer up his friend but failing miserably as james shot him a sharp look and sirius back a step in respond okay james turned to harry but at least let me show you first what you need to do he suggested as he turned the engine back on the black helmet still under his arm but before harry could hop on the bike he sirius and his father were all started by his mother hard voice if you two wontstep back from that thing right now you re going to spend christmas eve outside in the cold and for all i care sirius can try and make room for you in his doghouse they turned around to see that lily and remus were back earlier than they had expected and now she was standing at the backdoor her face as red as her hair remus was just behind her holding two brown paper bags at her exclamation sirius immediately blushed and said sorry i afraid i invited princess to chew some leftovers tonight you re on your own harry turned to look at his godfather in disgust princess was none other than the neighbors french poodle what sirius asked innocently she said she clean sirius shut up you re not helping james hissed turn off that damn thing before you wake the entire neighborhood lily yelled at her husband and he immediately obeyed and then turned back to her his head bowed down at her furious gaze at him harry mirrored his father position and looked down swinging his foot at the soft snow on the ground if it was a question what was louder his mother screams or sirius old bike then his mother would have won easily he doubted the neighbors were bothered by the motorbike running but was sure at least one person woke up to the sound of a very livid lily potter get inside the house she ordered in fury and when neither of them moved too stunned by the sudden change of tones she suddenly screamed now and in less than a second they were all back inside lily started pacing around the kitchen table eyeing her husband and son wrathfully but other than that she did not say a word remus and sirius watched at the three potters but remained quiet james finally felt like breaking the deadly silence hmm lily dear he tried to say softly but the nervousness was evidence in his voice we didnthear you guys floo in he added a smile which he quickly removed at the sight of her red face bad choice of words dad harry thought shaking his head explain yourself james she said sharply ignoring what he said er explain to me she cut in not giving him a chance to respond why our son was about to ride that thing when we both agreed that he too young for it that he probably not responsible enough for that yet we agreed to let him use it when he turns eighteen did we not james eighteen harry and sirius yelled in the same time both gaping at her this is ridiculous harry protested completely outrageous lily you cantkeep him away from a birthday present sirius reasoned it silly then sirius you should have given it to him in two years he too young for it lily retorted we already talked about it when harry asked his hands on his hips dontget into this harry sirius whispered to him and harry moved his hands back down not to spite his mother more james ran a hand through his hair lily please it not that of a big deal we were just trying to have a bit of fun dontyou dare making excuses james potter she said crossly did you even think what would have happen if a muggle would have seen you flying on an enchanted motorbike above the neighborhood some auror you make sirius leaned down to harry ear and whispered again maybe they would think they were still sleeping and it was all a dream referring to the muggle lily mentioned or that they were a bit stoned harry added and suddenly he and sirius burst out laughing hard james however didntfind it so amusing especially when lily accusations fell all upon him and here he thought she will get mad at harry not him come on lil we meant to take it for a spin around the valley no one would have seen us there he defended harry couldnthear it anymore he hated when he parents fought even though it happened ever so seldom and right now he hated them fighting on christmas eve morning and ruining the whole christmas spirit they were trying to create last night so instead of doing it the gryffindor way which was probably the best thing he would have done if he were noble enough and take the blame on himself so it will end quickly he elbowed sirius in the stomach and eyed him suggestively why would he get punished for something sirius was to take the blame for anyway sirius gave him a fake smile of thanks when harry smiled brightly at him before he interrupted the heated row between the potter couple ending it up with the two of them holding each other in apology at that harry slipped quietly back up to his room before he heard his mother storming on sirius for his recklessness much later that day sirius head popped in behind his bedroom door is it safe to come out now harry asked behind the latest copy of one of his quidditch magazines i think so james and remus managed to calm her down eventually sirius said as he walked in and flipped through some other magazine that harry had left on the floor along with the rest of his mess i sorry harry about before it really could ve been fun if she would ve allowed you to ride it maybe we can make her leave the house a bit longer next time you know we ll make something up james will go with her so it d be just you and me yeah then she ll murder me in my sleep hell she ll just scream and knock the wind right out of me harry replied hollowly rolling his eyes yeah your mum can be quite loud sometimes i do remember that back at hogwarts she never stopped yelling at james when he hit on her harry head perked up mum didntlike dad hitting on her sirius laughed and sat on the chair next to harry desk and looked at him are you kidding she hated him well at least she pretended to hate him for the first four years when he chased after her then she gave up and agreed to go out with him on one date so he ll be happy and shut up then leave her alone problem was that she fell for him on that date and since then she couldnttake her hands off him you dontsay harry marveled he never heard that story before and wondered why he should ve known by now how his parents got together he knew they met at hogwarts but never the full story it really inspired him all jokes aside now i think you really are going to be someone older brother soon sirius said suddenly in a soft voice going back to the magazine still in his hands for a minute he wasntsure harry had heard him because he didntsay anything but when he looked up he was surprised to see him frozen up his hands were fidgeting and his face paling wh what did you say harry asked shakily well sirius said slowly closing his magazine shut whether you like it or not your parents love each oth oh cut that out will you harry threw his own magazine at sirius accidentally hitting his face with it as he got up from his bed and stormed back downstairs his fists clutched and his shoulders set up mum james and remus who were decorating the christmas tree in the living room turned their heads at the sudden shout and saw harry running through the house calling for lily while evidently searching for her they moved away from the tree so they would see what the fuss was all about just as sirius ran down the stairs and lily came out of the laundry room holding some clothes she was sorting out what is it harry she asked calmly her soft tone only made harry feel angrier he was taking deep breaths now his anger radiating off of him and his face reddening are you are you am i what dear she asked confused harry clenched his teeth preg harry dont james remus and sirius yelled at the same time james and remus were holding their hands out as if trying to make time stop and sirius stopped halfway down the stairs his right foot still in midair and his face grimacing as harry finished the word nant all three other men froze as though time really did stop their blank faces matching lily seemed to be more confused than before her mouth opened slightly in question her brows furrowed and her head tilted to the side in a small angle pregnant she repeated where did you get that idea from harry harry eyes quickly darted to his father then to sirius and back to his mother no no one he said managing an embarrassed smile he took another deep breath and mastered up all his courage so so you re not pregnant he asked tentatively she let out a small laugh of course not she said lightly and like one person james sirius remus and harry all let out a long relieved sigh james walked up to her holding her delicate hands in his are you sure he asked quietly obviously afraid she will start shouting at him again yes i certainly think i would ve known if i was did you all think i was pregnant well yes kind of james said slowly rubbing the back of his neck well there were all those mood swings and all those sudden changes that made us wonder lily wrapped her hands around his neck i just wanted to make this christmas perfect that all what with remus here with us and the fear of the death eaters threat to get us i just wanted to make you all feel like home and forget about troubles right now but oh james next time just ask me okay erm o okay james said while rubbing his hands up and down her back to calm her down no harry said sharply lily and james broke apart and turned to look at him no next time no more kids you two keep your dirty hands off each other got that everyone smirked at that but harry didntfind it a matter of laughing about he was totally serious here james let out a fake disappointed sigh and looked at his wife pretty green eyes i guess it also harry decision isntit she gave him a playful shove and turned him back to decorate the tree along with remus and sirius oh harry would you come here for a second she asked her son as she went back to the laundry room harry followed her wondering what she wanted now his mind settled on one thing only hey i not going to change my mind about it or anything i pretty satisfied being an only child and i d like you to keep it that way thanks he said folding his arms over his chest showing he already made up his mind lily smiled at him she put down the clothes she was still holding from before actually i wanted to talk to you about something else oh harry said stupidly erm okay what is it about she seemed nervous all of the sudden well i dontknow how to say it i was just sorting put your laundry and i found something i think i shouldnthave fell across she shoved her hand to her pocket and pulled out a yellowish scrap of parchment i found this and i thought it was something i can throw out so i opened to see if it was important and well i sorry i guess i shouldnthave done that it personal and it yours so take it she handed it to him and he suddenly realized what it was how could he forget about it he took it from her and looked at it to make sure it was really the same piece of paper he thought it was he unfolded it and there it was his own handwriting formatting six simple words written in black ink now that his mother has seen it all he could think of was why he had written this so everyone could find it and read it and for a minute he thought it was best to just tear it up but he couldn t it was evident that what was written there was true and suddenly he realized he couldntbe angry at his mother he couldntfeel sorry for himself that another person had read this note and found out what he truly feels he felt relieved and when he looked up at his mother he gave her a small smile it no big deal he said shrugging she seemed to relax and without making harry see it coming she hugged him oh harry i so happy for you mum stop it he whined freeing himself from her motherly embrace honestly what do you think you re doing she whipped a lonely happy tear from her eyes and smiled warmly at him do you want to talk about it i thought last night at dinner you wear keeping something from me when we talked about going to the weasleys but then why would you want to stay away because mum it a bit complicated and not to offend you but i dontwant to talk about it and i ll appreciate it if you wonttalk about it to anyone no one knows she asked stunned my friends kind of already know and that doesntmean i need to go out and shout it so the whole world will find out he turned around and started to walk in the direction of the living room thanks for giving it back to me though christmas eve dinner has been spectacularly delicious much to everyone delight it was apparent that lily really worked hard to make it taste and feel perfect she really had outdone herself later on that evening all five of them sat together by the living room fire talking about almost everything sharing jokes and simply enjoyed hearing the music playing on the wireless sirius challenged harry into a game of wizard chess and looked like he was loosing greatly remus then took the opportunity when everyone were together and cleared his throat to get their attention i have something to say if i may he began they all looked up to him expectedly and he inhaled deeply before he went on there is something that i kept quiet until now and i haventtold you this before because i didntwant to add weight on your shoulders now that we are done with celebrating i think it is best i ll just share it with you what is it moony james asked becoming curious well for starters there this he said pulling out of his pocket the yellow map harry had given him at halloween and laid it on the table so everyone could see it at the sight of it james lily and sirius gasped in disbelief is it james started and remus nodded in confirmation i had it for couple of months now harry actually was the one who found it and gave it to me he explained but that not the real piece of news i wanted to share i want you all to calm down first when they just glared at him he cleared his throat again and then went on okay then well this might be a bit of a shock to hear so dontsay i didntwarn you just spill it out remus sirius barked impatiently okay here we go a couple of days ago when harry and i were sitting in my office admiring the map something caught my eye among the hundreds of names that appeared on the map there was a particular one that i wasntexpecting to see the name was peter pettigrew another gasp emitted from everyone mouth including harry this time no they said in disbelief their voices hushed with surprised horror remus nodded and went on i thought at first that i wasntseeing right that i imagined it because i was looking at the map and telling harry about how we made it so i thought yeah we and peter as well but i realized i wasntimagining it at all sirius then got up and walked to where remus sat and snatched the map from the table in a quick move he there at hogwarts how did he even get there lily asked worriedly her eyes wide and fearful well i remus began but then he stopped when sirius pointed his wand at the current blank surface of the map and muttered i solemnly swear i am up to no good slowly the map of hogwarts appeared but only a few numbers of dots were shown next to several names of teachers and students who stayed in the castle there were no less than fifteen people in the whole school and peter name wasntone of them i dontunderstand sirius muttered and shook his head he not there that little rat escaped again james exclaimed banging his fist hard on the wooden coffee table accidentally making harry jump remus stood up and pointed his finger at james a small smile tracing his mouth a rat exactly they all listened carefully now you see as i was trying to explain peter name appeared together with the names of two students when i looked at the map when i ran to meet them and asked them if they d seen someone suspicious who didntlook like he belonged there they said they haven t so i let them be then i looked at the map again and peter name was still there the hallway we stood in was practically empty and small so there wasntany place he could have hide in or escaped me then when i looked back at the students again i noticed a little bump moves inside of the boy trousers pocket and then it hit me he was hiding in there remus finished explaining his story and crossed his arms over his chest looking quite proud of himself sirius looked stunned to hear this in his rat form he said in a whisper that sneak how do we get him now remus who were those students you mentioned were they slytherins do their parents were considered as death eaters harry do you know them he said it all so quickly that harry felt his head was starting to buzz with overload what does this means now first there was the threat the lucius malfoy was starting to gather power in order to kill us and be in control again and now there was this fact that peter pettigrew was at hogwarts he was so close to me he could ve had killed me by now he could have finished it but he didn t what was his plan anyway harry fingers started to rub at his temples as a headache started to form remus held sirius by the shoulders and pushed him down gently onto a comfortable chair sirius then sank his head in his hands and sighed in attempt to relax sirius calm down please lily begged remus looked at her lily it all right i know you are all worried but we know where he is right now we are going to catch him and he will pay for what he done he sat back down and looked at sirius as to what sirius asked i believe those students arentharmless they re gryffindors for that matter yeah so was peter and look where he ended up james said darkly his hazel eyes turning almost black as anger seethed inside of him true remus shrugged but we re talking about ron weasley and hermione granger two of the school prefects you know the weasleys they re in the order so there nothing to worry about and as for hermione she is actually one of the best students in harry year a muggle born in fact i think they just dontknow that the rat is actually peter harry started to have a coughing fit after he took in all what remus just said why does all his trouble always have to be connected to the same people why does ron weasley have to be involved in his life so much you okay there harry james asked his attention now on his son reaction you do know them right harry relaxed breathed deeply and then rolled his eyes of course i am and somehow i knew he kept a rat a rather old rat in fact but never realized there was something suspicious going on there i should have though my friends and i used to bet on how long it will take that thing to drop dead we always lost because it seemed to be the in the same perfect shape every time we seen it we used to think he changed rats when they died so we didntput a lot of thought into why this rat is living for so long he explained james sighed heavily so here we go that ron weasley kid is keeping him he concluded and then turned to his wife who was sitting still in her place on the sofa she looked up at him already knowing what he was thinking lily i think she nodded i ll floo call molly first thing in the morning and let her know we are coming to visit usually on christmas mornings harry would jump right out of bed as dawn breaks sprint into the living room and start to tear at every wrapping of his presents without even considering waiting for his parents to wake up and join him but this christmas morning started different this year harry not only was too mature for that but he also felt like spending every free minute he has at sleeping as much and as peacefully as he could james and lily found it odd that the time was close to 10 30 and their son was still sleeping in his bed wasnthe keen to open his presents they asked themselves he used to love it so much when he was younger do you reckon everything is all right with him james asked his wife before sipping from his coffee mug his brows frowned slightly he not ill or anything is he after all it could only be from your cookin oww i was just kidding you know he exclaimed when she pushed his shoulder hard he fine she said firmly her teeth clenched together in annoyance lily could only guess why harry chose to sleep this late this morning of all mornings it was obvious to her he wanted to stay away from the weasleys and stay at home instead he acted weird when she told him last night he would have to come with them or else it would be seem rude if he chose to stay at home just so he could sleep when she told him he then started to stutter and quickly headed to bed he probably just tired from school work she said i ll go wake him up we need to be at the weasleys in about an hour when she walked into harry room he was sleeping silently in the darkness she walked over to the window opened the blinds so white wintry sun rays broke into the dusky room harry let out a low complaining groan when the soft light hit his eyes and he squeezed them hard turnitoff he grumbled still half sleeping lily smiled despite herself and merry christmas to you too dear she said sarcastically i afraid you have to wake up harry she said hovering over his face and seeing him looking at her blurrily through one sleepy eye why he asked grumpily pulling the quilt over his face and turning around so his back was now to her lily shook harry again not giving up just yet we need to go remember she reminded him and sirius is getting cranky because we said we will open the presents together so we are waiting just for you do it without me then oh no no she said grabbing his quilt despite his protests and throwing it to the floor you re getting your lazy arse out of this bed right now and you re coming with us to the weasleys and in five minutes time i want you dressed cleaned up and joining us near the tree for presents opening got that he only grunted in respond which she took as a sign of agreement and she left the room and went back down to join everyone else at exactly five minutes later harry was downstairs though still tired and sirius started prizing lily for her success of bringing him down they started opening the presents together and the room soon filled with the sound of ripped paper and with oohes and ahhs of excitement harry loved the presents he received his parents had given him two tickets for the upcoming weird sisters concert in the end of june sirius managed to get him a black leather jacket which in his words will suit you well when you ride the bike erm that of course when you turn eighteen he added when he caught lily watchful eye remus gave him a book about quidditch which he was glad for because he knew that if he would have given him any other book it would probably end up gathering dust on one of the shelves in the library draco sent him a nice watch which obviously he could afford and blaise sent him a leather covered journal to harry great surprise when he opened the first page he found a small note blaise left inside it said it a new year to make new memories which will be nice to look back at them some day just dontwrite too much about how much you adore her like she had in hers because that we are all going to remember harry couldnthelp but snigger at the comment it was now almost noon and remus hurried everyone to get to the floo sirius who was told to stay at home openly protested and turned into padfoot and started to growl and bark no sirius you are to stay here and that final dontworry we are going to get him and make sure he will get what he deserves james said to him and padfoot turn to look at him with cute puppy eyes i know you want to come and fulfill the promise you made me but we obviously wontbring him today we just want to think of a plan first then will see what we are going to do sirius turned back to his human form and pouted angrily fine he muttered and sat sprawled on the couch with nothing better to do but watch them floo to the burrow one after the other the hearth in the burrow living room turned green and the flames roared high and startled percy weasley who sat on the rug near the coffee table as he went over a report he was suppose to submit to the minister after the christmas break mother they re here he called out when he first person to come out of the fireplace was remus lupin percy got up from his spot on the floor and went to shake hands with the guests and wish them a happy christmas when the last person to floo in was harry as percy could see he cast him a dirty look before he excused himself from the room and gathered his things and went up the stairs not bothering to shake harry hand as he remembered him well from his days at hogwarts harry felt the familiar stinging sensation he felt every time someone looked at him like that just for being a slytherin it wasntlike he expected anything else here we go again he told himself molly weasley came into the living room holding a wide grin on her face after everyone dusted the black sooth from their robes she shook hand with everyone and was nice enough to ask harry if he was doing well harry wondered if she adopted her children or was just trying to be nice in front of his parents oh happy christmas to you all she greeted happily come on sit down she gestured to the small squashy sofas feel at home i ll just go and get some tea and biscuits be right back before they could say it wasntnecessary she already disappeared into the kitchen they sat themselves onto the sofas harry was feeling uncomfortable an unwanted and tried to distract himself by looking around the room he still wondered why his parents insisted he will come after all it wasntlike the weasley children liked him so he would feel welcome on the contrary harry looked around thinking this house is completely different from his own he was reminded of the jokes draco used to tell about their house of how small it was and that they all slept in the same room however now looking at it personally he knew draco only repeated what he was told by his father and noting more this house had a homey feeling lingering in it it was small but still nice and he thought he liked it in the corner of the room stood a weird looking grandfather clock it had nine golden hands and on each one was engraved the name of a different weasley five hands stood on the word home and harry guessed this clock showed where each member of the family was right now three other hands were pointing at traveling and one stayed on work as harry watched the pictures hanging on the walls and the ones that stood on the hearth he searched for ginny in them he found some when she was smaller her most recent one was of her and her brothers at the quidditch world cup so it seemed her hand on the clock was pointing at traveling and he wondered where she could travel at christmas with the snow falling outside then when he looked again the three hands that said traveling before now stood at the word home she was home she here harry thought and his heart began to race he felt quite hot and didntknow if it was because he sat close to the fire or just from thinking how she will react when she sees him sitting on her couch back in the kitchen molly poured the hot water from the kettle she set into cups the back door opened and a strong freezing wind blew inside charlie ron and ginny came inside snow in their hair on over their clothes and their hands holding a few paper bags that contained eggs fruits and vegetables they picked from diagon alley hey mum ron said putting down the bags he held onto the kitchen table as ginny struggled to close the door this is the last time we re going to find an open store in christmas morning got that he said while his teeth chattered from the cold oh please ron stop being such a baby charlie chided we got what we could they were out of lettuce and carrots mum what you got will be enough thank you molly said ginny will you please help me to put this tray in the living room sure mum she said after taking off her robes and gloves are we having company yes and i want you and your brothers to be nice to them molly said handing ginny the tray with the tea cups she nodded in respond while wondering why she would say something like that they were always nice to their guests she made her way to the living room with a smile but when she saw who sat there the tray dropped from her hands almost spilling the hot tea all over her and breaking the china if it werentfor professor lupin quick reflexes and attention when he stopped them in mid air before hitting the ground just by flicking his wand oh i sorry she muttered when lupin hovered the tray to the table and lily helped him put the tea back into the caps not missing a single drop i wasntpaying attention she said when she walked over to the table making sure everything was all right and nothing spilled she cast a quick glance at harry who sat next to his mother and was obviously trying to avoid her eyes by looking down at his lap that all right ginny lupin said calmly nothing happened molly then came bustling back into the living room holding another tray of many kinds of cookies and cakes here i sorry to keep you she apologized and put the second tray on the table arthur will be here soon he was called this morning to the office to handle some case something about blinding cameras or something like that i dontknow that okay molly we understand we do work at the ministry and know how crazy things can go there sometimes james explained with a light chuckle erm mum if you dontneed me anymore i ll be in my room ginny said in a soft voice all right ginny she said when she sat down in front of her guests and ginny went towards the stairs harry felt more relieved when she left the room he looked up now able to act like normal when he saw her enter the room her skin flushed from cold and her red hair covered with white snowflakes she looked heavenly and he couldntlet her see him looking at her like he wanted to kiss her on the spot he couldntlet her know she made him blush so he looked down at his lap avoiding her eyes afraid if he would look at hers he wouldntbe able to control the smile that wanted so much to trace his lips from the moment he saw her lily suddenly had an idea and she smiled to herself hey harry she said suddenly why dontginny show you around the house and keep you company i dontthink the matter we came to discuss with molly and arthur will interest you much harry stiffed and looked wide eyed at her why is she doing this is that the reason she made me come here she wants me to stop avoiding her doesntshe he began to stammer an objection but molly thought it was a great idea as well and called ginny back down ginny appeared in the living room more quickly than expected harry knew he heard her footsteps stop on the stairs when she heard his mum suggest her so brilliant idea she acted like she hadntheard a thing but harry knew she did and that she didntlike the idea their mothers came up with spending alone time with her right now wasnta part of his plan of making it easier to asking her out it will ruin everything he and hermione planned even if it did sound like a brilliant way to pass the time what is it mum ginny asked her shoulder slumped in disappointment because she knew what she was to be asked could you and your brothers keep harry company her mother asked nicely ginny couldntrefuse to her when she said it like that sure she said through clenched teeth come with me she said to harry when she spun around not even looking at him his mother gave him an encouraging look and he returned her a pointed stare in respond he could see lupin smile broadly at him but he chose not to look directly at him afraid to find out that he realized she was the girl who he thought about when he wrote the notes as part of his exercise to concentrate on his spells studies for the dueling club harry didnthave any choice left and got up and followed ginny up the stairs once they were on the first landing she turned to face him her hands on her hips and her look hard look i didntask for this and i not going to baby sit you until your parents decide to leave i going to my room and for all i care do whatever you like as long as it wontinvolve following me or breaking anything okay harry silently agreed it not like he was the one who asked for it his mum dropped this on him exactly as her mum did on her and it wasntlike he meant to follow her into her room or something when she turned around something caught his eye and he smiled despite himself nice necklace he uttered and she stopped slowly turning back around to look at him suspiciously did your boyfriend give it to you he did that on purpose he wanted to hear her saying that she and dean werenttogether anymore he thought it was smart to add the boyfriend comment because that way he wouldntexpose himself as her secret santa er no not exactly she stuttered suddenly nervous she held the necklace between her fingers and bit her lower lip it was a christmas present from someone else wontdean get mad that other guys sending you gifts he inquired i dontthink so she said we broke it off long time ago harry smiled inwardly when he saw his little planned had worked oh he asked as though surprised to hear i didntknow that i sorry ginny face suddenly hardened again yeah right you are probably thrilled right now arentyou you wanted this to happen from the very beginning you even said you would tell him about the kiss maybe i am a bit pleased he shrugged and took a step closer to her she didntget away you were too good for him you and i both know that she gulped hard and looked up at his face unaware he took another step towards her well he wasnttoo pleased when he heard you kissed me and that you liked it harry added licking his lips as he looked down at hers what was he doing how did he get so close to her and for the most important part why couldnthe get away before he will ruin everything he and hermione planned and then he remembered the plan he and hermione had first getting her a gift and writing her a card done then sucking up to her and compliment her okay he can do this you look he said gazing at her brown shiny eyes what she whispered her breath hitched in her throat pretty wearing that necklace he finished in a barely audible voice she blinked she wasntsure she heard him right did he just compliment her flirted with her perhaps done harry thought next step ask her out and when she agrees kiss her lightly he couldntwait he closed his eyes watching hers close as well and leaned his head down when what are you doing asked a voice from down the stairs harry eyes shot open and his head snapped up and he saw that ginny whirled around to see her twin brothers standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up at them with narrowed eyes waiting for an answer nothing she answered simply and turned to her room before any of them could stop her harry tried to avoid her brothers eyes he didntknow what to do he didntknow where he could go to hide but they were already moving up the stairs looking murderous harry slowly gulped and backed into the wall until he didnthave anywhere else to go when they were both cornering him you fred said in a low voice are a dead man george finished in the same tone harry was about to say he didntmean any harm when a strong voice came from behind leave him alone he said harry looked over their shoulders to see yet another weasley brother the eldest one if he could recall he too had a red hair but long and gathered up in a ponytail he was tall and broad and even when he looked bigger and more menacing than the two in front of harry he looked much nicer well he did tell them to back off of him but for what purpose did he want to beat him up by himself harry tried not to think about it bill are you serious fred asked his older brother do you know what he was trying to do with ginny george said did ginny ask you to corner him bill supplied they were silent for a moment then both sighed in union and said no good now leave him alone he did nothing wrong the twins backed off and went together to the second landing and harry felt his heart drop back to place they gave him quite a start he exhaled in relieve and thanked bill for his kindness you re harry right i recognize you because you look like you father and i heard him talking about you bill said offering his hand to shake harry s yeah harry said breathily i harry come with me downstairs will you bill offered and harry looked up at him warily bill chuckled wholeheartedly and clapped harry hard on the back almost making him stumble forward dontworry i wonthurt you harry followed bill back to the kitchen ron was there chewing on a cookie and when he noticed harry he choked wha what are you doing in my house he came with his parents and remus ron now calm down bill answered for him ron huffed took another cookie from a jar the sat on the counter and went out of sight dontmind them they re exaggerating bill said taking the cookie jar from the counter and placing it in the middle of the table offering it to harry harry helped himself for one and took a bite tasting the buttery texture that filled his mouth with each bite that okay i used to it by now they re giving me that all the time at school you re a slytherin right yeah harry replied slowly afraid this news will damage what he built just now with bill why are you asking no reason bill shrugged i used to have a girlfriend in slytherin when i was at my seventh year i had a great time with her but it didntlast and mind you i was a head boy you arentall that bad you slytherins not most of it are just all rumors the last one about me said i was a death eater really that a really nasty one you tell me harry shook his head going silence say what would you do if one of your siblings were dating a slytherin well it really depends who we re talking about here bill considered it wouldntbother me if it was charlie because well he 24 now percy is too proud and stupid to do something like that but he also so caught up at work at the ministry that he doesnteven considering dating anyone right now fred and george well if the girl is pretty enough they ll go for it but other than that i wouldntworry ron there no way in the world he would date someone from slytherin besides he has hermione and as for ginny well i guess i cantmake up her mind but if she does date someone from slytherin he has to prove he not evil or anything otherwise i ll kill him he shot harry a quick smile and harry felt himself starting to sweat in full swing now but i trust you harry you seem like a pretty decent bloke but if you hurt her like fred and george said you are a dead man ginny is closer to me than any of her brothers so do consider it that i am the most protective of her around here harry faintly nodded bill the big brother was giving him his blessing for dating his baby sister he cantmess it up now bill got up from his chair and for a moment harry felt like he was towering over him want a game of wizard chess harry smiled and nodded and bill went to get the chess set ginny was banging her head on her wall over and over again thinking how stupid she was he was so close to her that he almost kissed her again and she almost let him what was wrong with her she couldntbe having feeling for harry potter not again before it was just a stupid crush it was understandable then but now it way beyond just a crush it was feelings real deep feelings and she was suspecting something too something was different in the way he acted around her he actually flirted with her he never flirted with her before and if he had she never took it as a flirt but only as something annoying he said how had she even gotten herself into this she used to hate him like wanting to murder him hate him and now she was having feelings and he was acting strange he mentioned the necklace he noticed the necklace made her somehow tell him she broke it off with dean how how did he do that why did he do that was he her secret admirer did he send her the necklace did he write the note she found in lupin class no she thought shaking her head forcefully refusing to admit it there couldntbe a possible way he was behind it all it wasntlike him to pull stuff like that she had to know for sure she had to find out she grabbed for the handle and opened the door she went downstairs in searching for him she finally found him in the kitchen and he was playing bloody wizard chess with bill she screamed causing them both a start what bill asked innocently she whimpered in annoyance her nerves almost breaking at the sight of her big brother playing chess with with him she turned around and went up the stairs again and locked herself in her room banging her door shut behind her causing the entire house to tremble at the thud bill and harry looked at each other with same confused expression on their face shrugged and laughed it off ron wasnthaving a pleasant first day of christmas he wished hermione was there but she chose to spend the holiday with her family instead now he was having harry bleeding potter walking around the house and doing whatever he wants with bill accompany him fate was cruel to him he just knew it he was about to go up to his room when something from the living room caught his ears his parents were there his father just came back home and they were discussing something with the potter couple and professor lupin in hushed voices but what he heard was definitely clear molly dontyou understand lupin hissed you have a death eater under your roof at the moment we speak ron interested now hid himself behind the door to the living room and listened closely his mind went racing to the time he thought harry was a death eater but he saw it with his own two eyes that he wasn t they werenttalking to him then i dontknow what to tell you molly sighed it been in the family for so long fifteen years james asked do you really want me to believe you that my son my ronald is ron eyes widened what what he yelled suddenly forgetting he was eavesdropping to something he shouldnthear ron molly called out as she recognized his son voice is that you ron now felt defeated emerged from behind the door and looked down at the floor in embarrassment his hands behind his back yes i sorry ron where is scabbers arthur suddenly asked his son scabbers he asked in confusion his brows furrowing why are they bringing his pet rat to the conversation they had on him they were just saying that he was a death eater werentthey he s up in my room resting why may we see him for a second professor lupin asked why ron asked again we wonthurt him we just want to see him we re interested in him we want to see if he a truly magical rat since he nearly 16 years old that rather uncommon for a regular rat you know james said we re aurors you can trust us ron lily said softly arthur got up i ll go with you to bring him okay ron nodded and he and his father went up to his room to get scabbers a minute later arthur came down and reentered the living room holding the rat firmly in his hands the moment the rat laid his eyes on the three strangers in the room it straggled to get free and tried to escape dontlet him go lupin yelled what are you doing to him ron asked getting worried donthurt him ron that okay it not a regular rat his mum explained when she went to him and held him by the shoulders keeping him back while his father james and professor lupin disapparated where did they take him of course he not a regular rat you said he magical no ron you dontunderstand lily said walking over to him that rat is actually a human being an animagus he name is peter pettigrew and he a death eater and we had been searching for him for a long long time he sold us to voldemort in try to kill us what are you talking about you re wrong we re not wrong ron molly said calmly they took him to the ministry to get him to his human form and get him confessed he will lead them to the remaining death eaters he will give them names ron was trying to take it all in it was hard to believe aurors came to take his rat his old poor rat why would they do that if he was just a normal rat he realized they were right and he sighed his shoulders slump i sorry ron i ll get you a new rat molly said no he said quietly and looked at her eyes and she feared he wontgive up on his pet that easily then he surprised her by saying i want an owl lily and harry waited at the burrow until james and remus came back telling them that the aurors were holding pettigrew and that they will have more news soon harry was glad to hear they captured an escaped death eater and it was the death eater that sold them out that wanted them dead the one that pretended to be their best friend inwardly he felt a small part of his heart begin to feel more relaxed and safer they said goodbyes and apparated home they filled sirius of what happened and he got upset about how he wasntthere to do it himself he told them he now felt like he disappointed them and james assured him that they were proud of him just for being so brave but they couldntrisk him being exposed not even to the weasleys or let pettigrew know that sirius was hiding with them eventually he relaxed especially when they sat down for dinner i still think you should have brought him here and let me finish him off sirius grumbled we ll let you question him on his trial james said it was a long day remus sighed yeah harry agreed leaning back in his chair a sudden loud knock on the door caught them off guard they all looked at each other in puzzlement they werentexpecting anyone at this hour i ll go get it maybe it just a neighbor lily said getting up and walking to the door while holding her wand firmly they all looked after her to make sure it was alright and james meant to get up and watch her close but they all stood up at once when she yelled james harry quick they ran to the door their wands pulled out ready to strike but no one stood at the door lily was kneeling on the floor but she was alright the person she was holding in her hands wasntthough james carefully helped her moved the cloaked figure to lie on its back on the floor and gently removed his hood they gasped at the same time when they saw who it was his face beaten and bloodied and he was obviously unconscious from exhaustion draco harry yelled when he kneeled next to his best friend to take a better look at him a n finally it done the chapter i ve been looking forward the most to write i thought about it a year ago ever since i came up with this plot and i finally put it into words so please review it and tell me what you think because i dontwant to think it sat in my head for nothing for a year disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter 15 the truth about draco lily went to open the door her wand clutched tightly in her hand she hesitated for a second whether to open the door or not what if it wasnta neighbor and there was a death eater standing outside should she take the risk and see if she was right she decided to be the brave auror she was and also she knew the guys were right behind her watching closely and backing her up she lowered the wards securing the door and slowly opened the door to a narrow slit so she could take a careful peek outside it was now late in the evening and she could barely see the person standing in front of her due to the almost complete darkness outside she could hear this person taking short unsteady breathes please please open the door begged the stranger in a hoarse male voice and a faint help me was whispered desperately she realized that if there was a death eater standing outside her door she would probably be dead by now she felt sorry for the stranger begging her to let him in behind her back in the kitchen she could sense the boys starting to get up to take a look it all happened in a matter of seconds she saw him crouching forward and he gasped in what seemed to her like pain and she couldntlet him stand there anymore she quickly opened the door fully and as the light of the corridor hit his face she got a swift glimpse of his features she recognized the young man at once despite the abnormally white face that looked as if all the blood was drained from his body his bright hair was soaked with dark blood and he also had a deep bloody gash all across his face all the way from his left ear to his chin he then started to sway dangerously and his light eyes rolled to the back of his head as he finally collapsed his body fell forward limply and she managed to catch him before he hit the floor she couldntsupport his unconscious body for long he felt heavy and his weight in her arms her made her knees buckle and then they both fell down james harry quick she called frightened she didntknow what else she could do but she needed someone help first before she could clear her head and in less than five seconds all four men were there with their wands out ready to strike when they saw the scene before them they were shocked lily looked up to them silently her eyes asking for help james reached out carefully to the cloaked figure lying in his wife arms and turned him gently around on his back harry then let out a sharp gasp when he recognized the young man as none other than his best friend draco he called in alarm quickly crouching down to see him better lupin moved past them and locked the door putting the wards back up while james helped a shaking lily get up on her feet harry started shaking draco body gently but he didntwake what wrong draco wake up tell me what happened harry lily said looking down at the boy lying on the floor she put a calming hand on her son shoulder he fainted he canthear you he ll be all right we ll take care of him harry shook his head unable to believe what just happened let move him to the living room james suggested and then scooped draco in his arms and walked into the living room with harry lily and remus following him silently he gently put him down sprawled on the couch i ll go get some potions lily said and went upstairs should i remus began looking nervous should i contact someone the order dumbledore the ministry perhaps james looked around at him and nodded i think it safe to tell dumbledore first he said remus nodded back and went to use the fireplace and flooed to hogwarts harry sat in the closest chair to the couch and kept his eyes locked on draco unconscious figure he looked bad harry observed he looked like he just got out of a fight harry then remembered the last time he saw draco before he came back home draco acted so mysteriously like he knew something was going to happen to him harry thought he started to drum his fingers on the armrest nervously without even noticing he was doing so when a dreadful thought entered his mind harry gulped with difficulty as he went over it in his head could it be that he met his father and fought with him but how was that possible he thought that the ministry placed aurors guarding all around malfoy manor how could lucius malfoy passed by them without being seen harry kept watching his friend quietly when his mother entered the room she walked over to the couch and crouched down next to draco opening the cork of one of the potion vials she brought she poured two drops into draco mouth and then with her wand she began to heal his injuries the deep bloody gash on his cheek began to close slowly but leaving a faint white thin linear scar where it had been the natural color was back on his face in seconds lily gingerly cleaned the blood from his face with a wet cloth draco then stirred and flinched at the touch and let out a low pained moan suddenly his eyes popped open as he sat up in a swift move lily moved a step back to give him space but harry moved forward to the edge of his seat anxiously he watched as draco eyes took in his surroundings gazing fearfully at harry parents and then he seemed to relax when he spotted harry he heaved out a sigh and raised his hand to his forehead as though he was experiencing vertigo where am i he asked softly you dontremember harry asked gulping he needed to sound calm right now you showed up at my house a few minutes ago draco you were all cut up draco turned to look at him after looking embarrassed at harry parents i did he asked confusedly i i dontknow what i cantremember his voice trailed off but then he realized something but i not hurt well no lily quickly answered before harry even had the chance to speak she looked at him with a small sweet smile on her face to make sure he wontbe intimidated by her and james presence i healed your cuts and bruises you collapsed on our doorstep when he just looked at her even more puzzled than before unable to remember any of this she spoke again draco you do know who we are right you re harry parents he looked at harry when he said his name and then back at lily she nodded but then he looked over her shoulder and added and you re sirius black lily james and harry turned around to look at sirius with all honesty they forgot he was there he never been this quiet before it was so uncharacteristically of him harry frowned when he saw sirius his face was white as a shell and he looked frightened and angry at the same time james walked over to him and led him into the kitchen where no one could hear their conversation harry and lily turned back to draco who was now looking at his hands on his lap draco lily went on as if nothing interrupted them he didntlook up at her i know everything is really confusing at the moment but i need you to try and remember what happened tonight before you came here okay can you remember who hurt you draco seemed to think about it for a long moment before he shook his head he kept looking down at his hands and didntsay a word harry started to really worry now this draco in front of him was so unlike the draco he once knew the draco he met on the train when he first came to hogwarts this person was closed up quiet shy and gloomy the draco he knew was cunning mischievous fun and cheerful it was like the person in front of his was someone he never had met before draco he said catching his attention was it your father did he do this did you meet him we need you to remember anything you can so we could help you with every question harry threw at him draco just shook his head more forcefully than before lily put a hand on harry shoulder to make him see he was pressuring his friend too much and that he needed to calm down she then asked calmly and what about your mother draco this seemed to break him i dontknow he yelled and buried his face in his hands at the shout james came back from the kitchen now without sirius and stood at the entrance to the living room and looked uncomfortably at lily who looked back at him with the same expression harry moved to sit next to draco who still didntlook up at any of them but he didntknow how he should act around him he never had to do this before but it seemed like the right thing to do he tried to put a comforting hand on his friend shoulder but draco sensed it and jerked away before harry could touch him harry was only trying to be sympathetic toward his best friend but he wasntoffended by his reticence on the contrary he understood completely why he acted that way even if he tried to help it seemed like draco wasntasking for it so harry let him be and just sat by him to keep him company the fire in the hearth roared and the flames turned bright green when lupin came back with professor dumbledore who had a serious expression on his face but greeted them as happily as he could lily asked from harry to keep an eye on draco and make him feel at home when the four adults left to the kitchen to discuss the matter the two boys who were left alone in the living room did not exchange a word with one another for a while harry tried to offer him some of his mum cupcakes and even pointed out that this time they tasted good this made draco let out a small chuckle to harry delight but the guest only accepted a cup of tea so when harry entered the kitchen to bring him the tea he felt as though he was invisible with the group of adults sat around the table and had a very heated conversation harry noticed that sirius was missing and wondered where he went off to he walked to the counter when he spotted a steaming teapot and poured it into two cups not wanting the others to think he was eavesdropping on their conversation even though harry couldnthelp but hearing what they were saying he says he cantremember anything that happened he doesntknow where his mother is or who attacked him lily said explaining to dumbledore we dontknow how he even got here james added but sirius is not happy with his presence he worried he would help give him to the death eaters he only a boy james lily argued looking crossed you cantreally believe but his father is lucius malfoy lil exactly what if he had attacked him draco probably escaped from him and came here to the only person he trusts the most how did he come here james retorted maybe he apparated remus suggested or flew or maybe he even walked it could be possible he did collapse when he arrived and looked quite exhausted james didntwant to accept that how did he even know where we live he countered why dontyou ask harry remus replied gesturing at harry who was trying to dash from the room as quickly and silently as he could with a tray of two steaming tea cups in his hands harry harry stopped when his parents called him in unison he tried to look as innocent as he could and hoped they didntrealize he heard almost everything yes he asked we need to know exactly what you told draco about our situation james said him looking closely at him with prying eyes erm harry tried to find the right words to say but his father didntgive him the chance harry james scoffed and harry looked guiltily at the floor he my best friend of course i d told him everything but i trust my friends and if you don t then that your problem lily looked down at the table with disappointment she didntwant to show to her son and james looked really livid his face was turning red did you tell your friends about sirius i sorry you re sorry james hissed not wanting to shout so draco could hear them you realize how scared and angry you got sirius what if they told their parents what if that information reaches a death eater ears you do realize that draco father is one and that he after all of us with a group of escaped death eaters right harry didntsay anything whatever he could say to excuse himself would only make matters worse he didntrealize how this could be a mistake until now now sirius must be really upset with him james that enough lily said quietly harry you can go back to the living room we ll talk about it later you can tell draco that he staying with us tonight harry nodded but stopped when james called what in outrage he doesnthave a place to go right now james now is not the time to argue about that we cantkick him out it freezing outside where will he sleep she said her tone was hard same as her look showing him that he didnthave a choice but to agree with her i agree james dumbledore spoke for the first time since harry entered the kitchen i dontthink draco will be any danger to any of you however i think we should help him to remember what happened tonight it will help us all to understand better and see where we stand how are you going to make him remember remus questioned harry looked interested at his headmaster he may be blocking it all out of his consciousness but it still all there i positive dumbledore said i can perform legilimency on him and take the hidden memories to observe them more closely in my pensieve dumbledore pushed his chair back stood up and walked out of the kitchen and back into the living room everyone followed and saw that draco was now standing by the window watching the snow outside harry put the tray of tea he still held on the coffee table and watched as dumbledore explained to draco what he was going to do he calmed him down and said that it wouldnthurt and that he had nothing to be afraid of draco agreed and looked into dumbledore eyes harry watched silently as dumbledore searched draco mind for the happenings of earlier that night he gave no indication that he found something as he broke the connection he simply thanked draco and walked over to the fireplace i shall look at it in my office and let you know what i witnessed he said as he threw a bit of floo powder into the fire until tomorrow then have a happy christmas and with that he entered the green flames and flooed back to hogwarts harry stifled back a yawn this night was much longer than he expected it to be he wasntin the mood for tea anymore and he was sure draco felt the same he was also anxious to get to bed and avoid the talk his parents were about to give him i really messed up this time he thought especially with sirius he only hoped his godfather would forgive him for this after dumbledore left there was an uncomfortable silence in the room and tension filled the air lily was the one who dared to speak first draco we decided to let you stay tonight at our house you can stay with harry in his room if you d like we ll set there a bed for you there plenty of room for both of you draco nodded gratefully and smiled for the first time that night lily then turned to harry harry can you show draco where the bathroom is i sure he wants to get freshened up before going to bed when you re finished come down and we ll have a talk harry face fell at her last words but he only nodded and gestured to draco to follow him upstairs he showed him his room and where the bathroom was and gave him a pair of his old pajamas that looked like they would fit him that he could change into and handed him a towel so he could take a shower when he was alone and draco was in the bathroom he went back downstairs and saw his parents were already waiting for him in the living room remus was missing and harry guessed he headed to bed their talk did not go well as harry expected he got grounded again but because draco was staying with them for awhile or at least until they saw what dumbledore has to say he would have it at the summer holidays instead before harry went back upstairs he dared to ask where sirius went james explained that he felt it was too dangerous for him to be here when draco was around so he chose to leave for the time being harry hated himself at that moment he felt as though he made sirius go away he knew he must be disappointed in him but he hoped that he wouldntbe gone for long and the eventually he would forgive him he went back to his room with a heavy feeling in his chest that he couldntshake off lily came up after him to help make a bed for draco and then went to sleep bidding a small goodnight before she went the small gesture made harry feel slightly better because it showed him that she wasntas angry with him as his father and sirius probably were the boys went to sleep that night after a small chat about anything but what happened that night and soon harry was soundly asleep not knowing that the boy next to him was unable to close his eyes it was the middle of the night when a loud yell broke the silence in the house the first person to jerk awake was harry who felt his heart beat so fast and though that it might burst out from his chest from the force he blindly searched for the light switch of the lamp on his nightstand and turned on the light in his dark bedroom and then put his glasses on his face so he could see clearly even then his sight was still blurry from sleep he glanced quickly at the clock on his wall and saw it was barely after three in the morning he saw draco sitting up in bed and breathing hard his face was very pale and his forehead was covered with beads of cold sweat he was shaking his head forcefully and he pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes i ll kill him i swear i ll kill him he whispered as he began to rock back and forth on the bed draco what happened harry asked agitatedly but draco kept shaking his head and whispered i ll kill him the door to the room burst open and harry looked up to see his parents and remus all standing at the doorway with their wands out what happened james asked as he saw that the two boys were okay he then noticed draco behavior and looked questioningly at harry nothing he answered he just had a bad dream is all draco however groaned with seething rage it was not a dream he said firmly it was real i saw it happened i saw him kill her everyone looked alarmed at his words and lily quickly came over and sat next to him and put a comforting hand on his back but just like earlier that night he jerked his body away and lily pulled her hand back donttouch me he growled draco what are you talking about lily asked warily instead tonight i remembered what happened tonight he entered the house somehow he passed the aurors and he entered he sought her out and they got into this row i was in my room when i heard shouting and i came downstairs when it happened he wouldntstop with the cruciatus until she stopped screaming and lay still he used it at his own wife i just cantget the picture out of my head my mother dead on the floor draco began to sob and shake as tears leaked down from the corners of his eyes it seemed like someone had cast a silencing charm around the room no one dared to speak the only thing that could be heard was the blowing wind outside and draco sobs he then turned around and saw me draco went on fighting to speak with an aching throat i pulled out my wand to defend myself and all i could think of was that i wanted him to pay for what he done to her i wanted him dead so i started to throw curses at him and he fought back easily then the aurors outside must have heard the racket around the house and they ran inside he then threw one last curse at me i tried to escape from it it barely hit me and luckily all i got was a cut on my face it stung so bad that the last thing i remember before fainting was him disapparating i woke up several minutes later and the aurors were gone no one was around i dontknow if they were killed or kidnapped by death eaters or they went to get help i guess they thought i was dead so they left me there the only thing i wanted then was someone to help me harry always said that if i needed something i can come to him and without knowing it i was at your doorstep a second later i think i apparated without realizing it he paused to exhale deeply and that what happened tonight yet no one said a word draco looked grimly into space and said in a low voice that harry never heard him use before all i know that he probably after me now if he knows i not dead he will find out i still alive and he will come looking for me to finish what he started but i going to be prepared i not going to back down again i going to make him pay for killing her he then pushed the sheets from his body and walked over to the chair he had laid his robes earlier he pulled his cloak on and fastened it before putting on his shoes where are you going harry asked thank you for your hosting but i must leave before he ll know i here and come to get me i cantlet him hurt you you were so kind to me lily stood up and stopped him this time when she touched his shoulders he did not protest being held no draco dontleave you re safe here he not going to find you here you can trust us we re going to protect you from him and he is going to pay for what he done but you going after him or going to hid from him is not the answer let us do the job you dontneed to worry just sleep here tonight and tomorrow we ll talk with dumbledore and we ll see what we re going to do you re safe here tonight harry watched as draco nodded thank you he said as he took off his cloak and put it back in place but i dontthink i d be able to go back to sleep now dontworry i ve got some dreamless potion that will help you she said smiling kindly at him he sat back on the bed as she left the room to get the potion and he kicked off his shoes harry smiled slightly as he realized how significantly his parents changed their mind towards his friend in one night lily came back with the potion and draco took a mouthful sip of it and lay back in bed harry did the same without saying anything to the three adults and went back to sleep lily james and remus left the room after turning off the light and the rest of the night passed by quietly for all the inhabitants of the house the next day harry woke up to find draco bed empty fearing something happened or that he left at night harry jumped out of bed and ran downstairs to alert his parents of his friend absence as he burst into the kitchen he saw that draco was enjoying talking to his mother in a light conversation while his dad was reading the morning paper remus was mysteriously absent from the room and sirius well harry hadntseen him since the night before harry is something the matter lily asked with a concerned voice draco looked up from his cereal bowl with a slight smile on his face as a greeting but harry only sighed in relief now seeing his friend was okay no why d you think something wrong he replied coolly joining them at the table oh no reason really james said innocently folding the paper and having a sip off his coffee you just ran here like there a hippogriff running wild around the house and lost your glasses on the way lily smiled and draco choked on his cereal at the comment when harry realized he was indeed without his glasses on he was in so much hurry to let his parents know that draco was missing that he forgot to put them on so he could see clearly feeling stupid harry pushed back his chair and went back up the stairs to his room to grab his glasses and brush his teeth which was another small thing he forgot to do earlier he was back in the kitchen a minute later catching a smirk on draco face when he realized his mother has changed the topic of her conversation with draco he always been like that she said he was still wetting the bed until he was mum shut up harry called before she could finish that sentence she blushed and got up from her seat clearing her dishes from the table as harry sat back down at the table and poured himself some orange juice aw come on i want to know until what age you no you don t harry threatened through gritted teeth i ll tell you later lily said lightly as she left the kitchen oh i have plenty of those you should see his baby album too that it you re not my mother anymore harry called back at her james sniggered as he too left the room after her oh shut up i wonder where she got it from harry said to him but james simply raised an eyebrow at him and then he disappeared behind the kitchen door harry buried his face in his hands and groaned loudly sometimes i wonder if i adopted he mumbled tell me about it draco said in sympathy they had their breakfast while they looked over the paper there werentany news about what happened last night at the malfoy manor no report of any deaths not of aurors and nor of narcissa malfoy s or sightings of death eaters it was like it never happened harry started to wonder if dumbledore had anything to do with it maybe he tried to hush it up and asked the papers not to publish anything about it but then he remembered his parents probably haventyet had the chance to contact him regarding what draco confessed to them from last night as if they read his thoughts james and lily entered the kitchen again but now dressed with their cloaks on ready to leave we re going to meet remus and dumbledore at the ministry his father explained to the two boys we re going to see what happened with peter and then we ll discuss with the minister concerning your father draco draco nodded we re leaving you alone but you dontneed to worry the wards around the house are secured and no one can get in lily said but still i warning you two no flying motorbikes or even broomsticks until we re home i want to see the house as neat as we left it and i want to find you both in one piece i trust you to hold on to that she added warningly okay they both said at the same time draco voice had a light tone in it which made harry wonder if he found this all parents care amusing since he barely got it from his own folks remember harry you still got that detention james added but harry only waved him off why do they need to get so all worked up like that anyway we re going to be fine they ll be back in a few hours and see that everything went fine harry mussed and rolled his eyes lily and james then said their goodbyes and apparated away leaving the two boys alone in the big empty house so what do you want to do harry turned to draco he shrugged dunno what are you suggesting well the wizard chess is always a classic choice i have some of my zonko games in my room and there the muggle television but i think you d just find it weird why what that draco inquired harry pushed his chair back and mentioned to draco to follow him into the living room he pointed to the large television sitting in the corner of the room well basically it a box that runs on electricity when turned on it shows people talking and all like in real life it supposed to entertain but i never really found anything interesting in it we only got it because mum insisted yeah that sounds a bit boring so what kind of zonko stuff do you have draco asked and a small smile crept on his lips before the two of them raced up the stairs to harry room two hours had passed and they found themselves completely with nothing to do but lie still on their beds and stare at the ceiling harry found himself thinking madly of a good way to pass their time but no matter what he suggested draco didntlike it harry sighed as he rolled off his bed and sat on the floor while finding an over read quidditch magazine stuffed under his carpet he began to scan it but got quickly bored as he already knew every word by heart our match against ravenclaw is the saturday after returning to school he said dully trying to pick up a conversation we ll beat em draco replied chewing on his fingernails that seeker of theirs that chang girl she has no techniques whatsoever you ve got nothing to worry about you re right harry agreed after another long pause he threw the magazine at draco hitting him with it on his chest the other boy propped up on his elbows and raised an unappreciated eyebrow at him without seeing what was coming next harry got hit by a large puffy pillow in the face draco merely smirked at him and lied back on the bed and began to read the magazine harry threw at him just a second ago an idea to entertain himself popped then into the devious side in harry mind with a hidden grin hr grabbed the pillow tightly in his hands draco did not know what hit him when everything went dark and he found it hard to breathe as harry thrust the pillow hard on his face laughing jovially as he saw him wrenching about and trying to get the pillow off his face so he could breathe normally and probably hex him into oblivion but then something inside draco mind snapped in a swift movement he was holding his wand threateningly right in harry face who had stopped laughing at once the pressure of harry hands on the pillow softened and he moved it aside as he saw the grim look on draco face someone cantget a joke he muttered pushing himself to get up and he turned his back to his friend however he could still feel draco wand pointing at him harry cast a look over his shoulder to meet draco angry red eyes combined in an empty glare can you put that down mum will be over my head if she found out we used magic outside school but draco only twisted his lips at him in some sort of a growl fine i sorry is that what you wanted to hear if i d know you ll take it that bad i wouldnthave done it when draco got up of the bed and walked slowly to harry his wand aimed right between harry eyes harry couldnthelp but roll them draco was overreacting over something so small and meaningless they used to tease each other like this all the time before harry reached out and pushed his friend wand down i not kidding anymore draco he said sharply and turned to the door harry didnteven hear the spell being said a bright white light was shot at him and he felt himself been thrown back all across his room and pressed to the opposite wall his all torso ached and suddenly he felt weak he sniffed and felt blood dripping from his nose but he was too frail to wipe it clean his head hung down spotting draco feet as he came to stand in front of him his wand was pressed piercingly to his throat and he managed to gulp and mumble something he hoped his mind will help him get it coherent draco what happening his vision became blurry and he felt as if his eyelids were getting too heavy to keep them from closing but yet he forced them to stay wide open as he pulled his head up draco wand was still at his throat why are you doing this harry asked feebly completely confused his head was spinning and his knees trembled hard barely keeping him up he was almost sure the earth was shaking and for that he thanked he was pressed to the wall so he couldntfall he was trying to get everything to focus and just stop turning but his mind wasntfunctioning according to his needs someone needs to finish the job draco hissed a sharp hot pain shot through harry forehead he was hearing himself screaming in agony and he couldntescape for the pain to stop his screams he was sure his head had burst open and that bleeding scars began to cover his skin as he couldntstand the stinging any longer and he shut his eyes tightly then it all stopped and his eyes watered like a waterfall funny how na ve and trustful one can get around their best friend draco said proudly they share their deepest secrets with him tell him everything they know and canttell anyone else you re a fool potter you knew my father is a death eater and yet you still told me everything you needed to hide and let me inside your home he huffed with a mock amusement you bought the story this show i made up see it was suppose to be just you all along you re the one who stood in his way to greatness but that black had to go and ruin it didnthe and like i didntrealize he was staying outside in the dog kennel the poor fellow treating him worse than a dog should be treated well i guess it was his choice wasntit ran away to hide like a scared chicken when it sees a fox getting close no worries he too will be dead after i ll finish here with you draco harry whispered desperately his mind still reeling please please don t it not like you i know it not you you wouldntdo that to me he could feel the charm starting to wear off but he was still tied to the wall unable to move away where draco was leaning over him you dontknow what you re talking about he snarled of course it me it been me all this time you see i was the one who stole your cloak that day at hogsmeade you left me alone at the castle where it was just you and blaise going down to the village after you were gone i took the cloak and left hogwarts as well i saw blaise talking to pansy and he was completely unaware of his surroundings so i made him dropped the fireworks bag and when he didntsee i took one then i went to meet father at the hog head the letter i was reading that morning was actually from him not my mother like i told you when we met we started to go over and preformed this little plan i just pulled off here he first told me we needed to leave a sign that we were getting stronger remember that night the firework the teachers accused you that it was the dark mark that you sent remember going into our dormitory and asking me why i was sneaking out you were a fool not to see that i wasntsneaking out but was actually sneaking back inside after setting that firework off your trunk was so messed up from where i searched for the cloak you were so close to find out what i did that night you first thought that i took the cloak but then you dropped it when you saw it was still there and believed when i said i searched for a quill and ink to write a letter to my mother which was a brilliant excuse i think you never suspected a thing you bought every word anyway that day at the hog head father told me everything i needed to do to gain your trust at me to get me into your house without any problems then when the moment right i ll kill you and the task he set to himself fifteen years ago will finally be over see he promised that when i ll manage it all i ll finally have the mark and follow his lead oh and thanks by the way for giving me the idea to use the confundus charm in order to kill you i expect you wontfeel much since you re under the charm so they couldntblame me i tortured you much before you died draco said in a voice so unlike his own he raised his wand higher draco please harry begged how could this be possible how could his best friend in the world betray him like that how could he even pretend to be his friend when all he was planning to do from the very start was to kill him harry felt so foolish draco was the reason harry had become a slytherin on the short train ride in their first year harry had come to know this boy this boy that he was so sure he knew so well by now and now after hearing draco confession he knew that he wasnta true slytherin at all in was all because of a mind wrap draco had made him see this different side of him the side the sorting hat had seen that night that made it put him in slytherin that made it so sure he was truly belong there back then harry remembered he wished to himself to be at the same house as was the friend he made on the train and his wish was granted and he couldntbe any more thankful that night all the other reasons why he could have gotten into slytherin were pushed aside at this moment what was happening now was all harry could think about one final wish harry my mate he said sarcastically harry gulped hard no please don draco cut in no final wish fine then he smiled crookedly avada right then a loud crack sound was heard as the door burst down and slammed to the floor stupefy someone shouted and harry felt draco fall to the floor with a loud thud sound the effects of his spells were fading as the seconds ticked by and he too slid slowly and limply to the floor with heavy aching body he opened his eyes briefly when he felt a soft hand caress his cheek he looked up to meet his mother eyes he was quite tired and he didntprotest when he was overtaken by darkness as he fainted from exhaustion he woke hours later to hear a loud conversation coming from the bottom floor of the house he found himself tucked safely in his bed it was now the late hours of the evening and the skies outside had already turned a navy blue shade harry pulled the covered off his body and searched around for his glasses before getting down the stairs the day events were still quite fresh in his mind and he wondered what had happened since that morning he never expected to find the entire order in his house including dumbledore snape and the elder weasleys sirius was there too and when he spotted him at the bottom of the stairs looking at all of them with an uncertain look on his face he marched over at him harry prepared himself to be hexed or slapped or anything really he deserved that after all he let down sirius his parents and well the entire of the order of the phoenix when he felt sirius arms wrapped around him he winched at first but after his mind registered that he was being hugged he started to melt and his heart bit faster i so glad you re okay sirius said into harry hair and harry couldntrestrain himself from smiling and hugging him back harry pulled back and looked up at his godfather catching him wiping away a tear arentyou mad he asked quietly no i not mad but you should be i i harry i know you didntmean it i fine you re fine we re all fine that what matters he put a loving hand on his head and harry nodded in agreement harry come here please lily called from the living room harry walked over to his mother knowing she was about to tell him what happened to draco she cupped his face in her hands and he didnteven have the time to feel embarrassed by her motherly actions around everyone else i so relieved we had gotten here just in time i dontknow what i would be doing right now if we were even a minute late harry james added catching his son attention draco wasnta death eater nor was he about to become one harry eyes went wide he was not no harry he was under the imperius curse he what james and lily nodded this morning when we came to dumbledore to discuss what he had seen in draco mind he said there were big holes there it was like draco had lived his life trying to fight off the curse but when it was forced upon him on different occasions he had become a different person the times when the curse took place over his mind had left those holes in his memories we were wondering if you d know if he ever acted strangely like he was shut out or anything of the sort harry nodded he did he once became so clam that it made me feel angry that he could be so peaceful at a time when stressful things had occurred and there were a few times when he just closed himself at us and the next day if now a few hours later he was like his old self again i thought it was strange but i would never imagine he was under the imperius i thought he was just having a phase that he was worried about his mother health and his father actions and he once said he was worried that his father was going to do something to us so i really couldnttell if something was actually wrong harry tried to explain himself the best he could he knew he wasntmaking much sense but he hoped they still understood what he was saying who who cast it on him his father who else james replied we suspect it was before the first term began lucius must have given him orders of how to act and when to act but that doesntexplain why draco looked like he was fighting someone when he first arrived here harry pointed out we did some investigation around malfoy manor the aurors that were guarding around are fine they said they spotted lucius malfoy and his death eaters group getting in and they started to fight them the death eaters had distracted the aurors while malfoy easily entered the house we suspect he wanted to see his wife to convince her to join him but she refused so he had no choice but fight her he tortured her until she lost all strength but she did not die like draco thought when he showed up and saw her not moving he thought he had killed her and went to fight his father lucius of course needed to dash before the aurors got extra help so he quickly fought off draco and disapparated along with his death eaters the moment when draco woke up and found no one was around was the moment the aurors went to call for help and search for the death eaters he was gone before the appeared again they only found narcissa and took her to the hospital it really did all happen and we didnthear about it until a few hours ago and where draco now harry asked he was taken to the ministry for an inquiry they took the imperius curse off him and last we heard they said he was cooperative but he said he cantremember a thing when he was under the imperius he spoke under veritaserum so they d know if he was lying to them or not they promised they will take him to st mungo to make sure there isntany brain damage and if everything is well he will be released home and can go visit his mother he will be back to hogwarts when the holidays are over home to where he doesnthave a home he cantgo back to that place not when his father can go back there harry called worriedly well actually harry dumbledore said for the first time that night lucius malfoy and his escaped death eaters had been spotted not too far from here two hours ago they d been ambushed until they were captured and sure enough a trail will be held against all them tomorrow morning despite christmas i assure you they will be back to azkaban where they all belong so everything is alright harry asked barely believing his ears it all over everyone smiled and nodded happily it all over harry looked up at his parents and grinned innocently at them so he said slowly about what you said earlier am i still grounded because i think i definitely need a little treat after being almost killed and all that well we ll let you know but for now dontpush it james said lowly harry rolled his eyes but still let out a small laugh it was still christmas time after all a n for those who might wonder no the story is not over yet we still have a few more things to solve around here and a few surprises will pop along the way i just sorry this chapter had come so late my beta had some internet problems and i was really stuck writing the scene with draco confession it was the most important scene i ve been waited over a year to write and when i finally come to write it down i couldntfind the words and still it not perfect but yet it satisfying but dontthink that i did nothing while i was stuck with this scene i started writing one of the most important if not the most important scene of the next chapter or the story in general i cantwait for you to read it and just hope you ll like it

got my new laptop for christmas and i made her wait until i could revise it on there feel free to pummel me with rocks chapter 16 revelations it was the day the new term started and it was time to go back to hogwarts the weather hadntchanged much if snow wasntfalling then strong rainstorms were pouring down the time was five minutes to eleven and the bright scarlet train standing near platform 9 was ready to go harry already said goodbye to his parents and sirius back at home was accompanied to the train station with remus who now looked slightly ill since the next full moon was due in a few days the train blew out steam and began to move out of the platform at exactly eleven o clock while remus chose to go rest in the staff compartment harry went to search for an empty one it wasnta difficult task as in the beginning of the first term considering that there were students that stayed at school during the holidays finally harry found an empty compartment at the very end of the train and closed the door behind him he put his trunk and hedwig cage on the luggage rack and seated himself next to the window watching the passing scenery the very obvious and unusual part of today was that for the first time since he began at hogwarts he rode the train alone he didntneed to wait for blaise or draco to show up blaise informed him by owl post earlier that morning that he would meet him at hogsmeade train station when the hogwarts express arrived he had spent the holidays at his aunt in ireland he also noted in his letter that he had some big exciting news to tell him and harry wondered what that was about by the sound of his letter harry realized blaise knew nothing about what happened to draco over christmas he was both glad and worried by that it was good that he didntknow about it at least one of them had a good and happy holidays break but it also meant he had to tell him and he really did not fancy doing that draco however did not contact harry at all harry had the feeling he was trying to avoid him and any possible conversation over what had happened not that he needed to worry about it harry wasntstupid he knew mentioning it would only make matters more difficult for his friend harry had thought about it a lot since the events on the first day of christmas he knew how to act and what to say he just hoped draco didnttake it too hard he was probably already at school coming early so he could avoid people though harry doubted anyone knew harry spent a good hour looking out the window until the weather outside became too dark to see anything rain started to pound loudly against the pane he looked up at hedwig hopefully thinking maybe she would like to listen to his babbling since he was starting to feel a bit lonely but the snowy owl had nested her head underneath her wing and was soundly asleep he sighed trying to think of something better to do he didntfeel tired so he couldnttake a short nap and the lunch trolley hadntpassed yet so he had nothing to eat just when he thought about going out to take a short stroll down the hall the compartment door slid open and he looked up and groaned loudly pansy parkinson was looking down at him with a smug look on her pug like face her hands on her hips you donthave to sound so keen to see me potter she said sardonically but still closed the door and sat by his side please pansy i begging harry said desperately and moved immediately to the opposite bench trying to get as far away from her as he could not now i having a very foul day oh dontworry i wontbe staying long she said waving her hand dismissively i just came in to check if you knew where draco was he missed the prefect meeting and it our turn to patrol the train and since i couldntfind him anywhere i thought i would come and ask you all right wait a second let me check harry said making a show of looking in all his pockets and under the seats well he not here he finally told her straitening up she pouted crossing her arms over her chest and looking unimpressed funny i didntknow you have the sense of humor of a monkey ha ha i didntknow you were lying when you said you wouldntbe staying long he replied in the same tone her eyes turned into slits as she put out her lips she got up and grabbed the door handle but paused before she opened it well i guess there is no point to thank you and if we are on the subject i thought i d be nice enough to come and show my gratitude to you for letting me know that blaise liked me we really bonded over christmas she slid the door open walked out and closed it behind her but not even a second had passed before she opened it again just slightly so she could poke her head in and by the way there are two gorillas answering to the names vincent and gregory bullying first years two cars down from here just thought you would have liked to know what your siblings are doing and where to collect them she added a nasty smile and disappeared harry was so puzzled he didnthear her last insult at him all he heard was something about blaise did she really just say that did she really like blaise after all and did that have something to do with the exciting news he mentioned in his letter earlier harry jumped up opened the door and looked around pansy wait a minute he called to her she was about to move to another car she stopped and looked at him with a frown her eyebrows showing slight hesitation then she gave in and walked slowly towards him he got back inside his compartment sat down next to him and waited for her to follow him in he motioned to her to sit down and when she did he asked her looking completely bewildered what was that all about you and blaise she sighed happily and nodded we started sending one to another letters during the holidays at first it was in a friendly sort of way then i started to see it became much more and well she trailed off and shrugged harry grinned from ear to ear i so happy for you he exclaimed and without realizing it his arms had wrapped themselves around her in a hug it lasted about two seconds before they let go she was smiling too looking happy for a change instead of the irritating girl harry had known her to be about thirty minutes later she left his compartment again to continue her stroll up and down the train and harry was amazed he never talked to pansy like they just did she told him everything how it all started what they wrote to each other and how she felt she was completely fancying blaise zabini his plan had worked he couldntbelieve it and he couldnthave been happier for the both of them now if only his other plan would work just as easily it was merely two hours ago when she saw him passing by the compartment she and her friends chose he was walking alone for a change and he sat right in the next compartment fully unaware she was only a few meters away maybe he did see her but chose to ignore her or maybe that was the reason he sat so close to her to spite her she remembered what had happened on christmas day she actually admitted to herself that she was developing feeling for him again her face flushed with the memory of him being so close to her that she could practically feel his hot breath on her skin she was sitting there with her friends hiding behind a copy of witch weekly and pretending she was reading while she mulled things over she was glad she was hidden because she didntwant to explain to luna or neville why her face suddenly matched her hair still she wondered what he wanted from her she didntknow if she should be grateful or disappointed that they didntkiss again he wanted to kiss her she saw that in his eyes and for a minute she felt like she wanted to kiss him too at the time she was thankful that fred and george showed up and interrupted them she wondered if she would have felt stupid and used if they had kissed again but that was all before and she couldnthelp but wonder how she would have felt now she remembered the first time they kissed sure it didntturn out very well thanks to the git but the kiss itself was good as much as she tried to tell herself otherwise she did like it she just didntlike the person who gave it to her well at the time of course what am i thinking am i actually saying this i like potter no it just a rush of old silly feelings from the very distant past ginny thought frantically trying desperately to make herself believe it was true she just couldntfall for a slytherin and certainly not the same brainless slytherin twice she couldn t and what was she doing now she was thinking of having a repeat of that kiss why was she tormenting herself like this she couldntstand the guy obviously so why couldntshe get him out of her head he an insensitive irritable twat she thought he likes playing with other people feelings he a cheater when it comes to quidditch and he possibly a cheater when it comes to relationships too he an arrogant jerk who cares about himself and no one else well maybe except for his friends and family he hangs out with malfoy zabini crabbe and goyle his taste in girls is just awful seeing as he dated parkinson he insults students who arentin slytherin muggleborns and well weasleys ginny sighed and looked out the window in the compartment door pansy parkinson passed by and ginny wondered for a second if she was looking for malfoy since he was absent from the prefect meeting earlier ginny then remembered seeing potter walking alone and wondered if malfoy was even on the train at all she reached out and shut the blinds on the door not wanting to see anymore unfriendly faces she returned looking at an article in the magazine without much interest yet she sank in thought again what was it about potter that she found likeable well for starters one cantignore his good looks his eyes are a pretty shade of green and he has a very charming smile his hair is too messy though i wonder if he ever heard of a comb he tall but not too tall like dean i hate over tall guys cantreach them i guess he has a bit of sense of humor he a bit of a good kisser a good student a good friend she stopped realizing what she was doing and she could feel her blush creeping down her neck and suddenly she was feeling way too hot the cold rain outside wouldnteven be enough to cool her off she needed fresh air she needed to wash her face and she needed to close some unsettled matters with a certain slytherin she excused herself and without waiting for her friends to ask where she was going she stood in the hallway outside she gulped hard and turned right only to be facing something she did not expect to see ginny stood frozen at the sight that greeted her she held a frown on her face and she did not feel as giddy as she had felt a minute ago she wanted to hit something a wall a pillow or a very annoying harry potter the earlier need to go and wash her flushed face had gone now her face had paled in a second as she saw him pull back from the hug he just gave parkinson he was practically all over her good thing she hadntwitnessed them snogging because then she would have most likely gone blind on the spot she felt slightly sick watching them together they had no idea she was looking at them from the other side of the door pansy shoved his shoulder playfully giggling while he laughed back ginny had seen enough she huffed grumpily and walked back to her own compartment threw herself back in her seat and stared angrily into space how dare he she knew of course she knew she knew all along that bastard was playing with her how else could he explain the very intimfate embrace he had shared in the arms of that cow pansy parkinson he was talking with her laughing with her touching her and ginny felt the heat rush to her face but didntknow why why should she care about it anyway he was a pig headed jerk that all nothing to be jealous of the copy of witch weekly magazine was back in front of her face but she did not bother to read a single word from the articles she ignored everything else and tried to listen to the voices coming through the wall instead she was more confused than angry she was hurt too why would he flirt with her if he was still seeing pansy parkinson boys she thought crossly dogs are more loyal than them she hadntnoticed she had put the magazine in her lap and started staring angrily into space again ron and hermione finally decided to show up their faces were flushed and their robes crumpled even neville plants could have guessed what they had been doing hermione and ron sat in the seats in front of her they quickly noticed her glare what wrong with you ron inquired i know what wrong with her luna said in a matter of fact tone she turned to ginny and said it the rackfets season isntit ginny she winked but ginny only looked more furious what ron asked not following he looked between luna and ginny and held a confused expression on his face what going on nothing ronald mind your own business his sister retorted ron let out a short laugh on i get it he said leaning back in his seat with a smug look only a boy would make her this pissed am i right ginny he suddenly let out a small oouf sound as hermione stepped on his foot neville shifted uncomfortably in his seat next to her and luna simply smiled dreamily i said mind your own business ron ginny screamed a howl of girlish laughter echoed through the wall behind her ginny rolled her eyes and pursed her lips she stood up at once i going for a walk she said and walked out the door again hermione quickly followed hermione reached out for her friend and stopped her from stomping off wait up ginny ginny turned at her looking now tired than usual what she said in a dry tone what wrong you looked fine before we left and now you re like this hermione said a worried note in her voice nothing hermione i having one of my bad days i just want to be alone for a while she turned around to leave again but hermione didntlet go so easily she ran after her ginny come on tell me ginny sighed well while you and ron were snogging in the loos oh dontlook at me like that wasntwhat you were doing i found out something quite disturbing well no well yes i i dontknow how to put it what happened hermione pressed ginny looked around to see there wasntanyone around she continued walking hermione followed and they moved to another carriage well something happened over christmas that neither you nor ron knows she told her all about harry visit to the burrow and how they almost kissed then finally how close she saw him earlier with pansy parkinson so now you re jealous hermione asked smiling in spite of herself ginny buried her face in her hands shaking it violently i dontknow i dontknow what i am feeling i so confused one minute he flirting with me the next he with someone else do you think he back together with her no dontanswer that i dontwant to know i through with harry potter harry looked around the platform of hogsmeade train station it was close to six when the train finally arrived luckily the rain stopped so they didntget wet while they descended the train everyone was now getting onto the horseless carriages looking for me a voice said behind him harry spun around and saw a grinning blaise standing in front of him hey when did you get here harry asked like an hour ago or so i waited in the three broomsticks since it was storming it just stopped raining blaise replied didntwant to go out there and get a cold besides the school gates were locked great let get a carriage harry said leading the way wait where is draco harry hesitated for a moment oh he already there dontknow how he got there though come on now i starving cantwait for dinner to start he said quickly changing the subject though he knew he had to tell him sooner or later about what happened to draco he knew he would have to do it because draco was probably trying to avoid it as much as he could he only hoped he could stall it as long as possible they found an empty carriage and slowly it made the way up to the castle so what the big news you sounded so eager to tell me harry asked blaise didntstop smiling it looked like his smile just got brighter by the second harry you wouldntbelieve it i in love he said in a dreamy voice harry nodded having already heard the story from pansy she absolutely amazing and beautiful and funny i didntknow how funny she was and we exchanged letters all during christmas i couldntbelieve it at first but she really likes me harry kept nodding feeling happy and glad that at least one of them could find happiness with the girl they liked yes i know pansy told me everything he said sounding pleased and her family is great she comes from a great wizarding family you know and she really wait what do you mean pansy told you what does pansy has to do with this blaise change in tone made harry confused who are you talking about he asked puzzled julia who did you think i was talking about blaise replied now feeling even more confused than his friend pansy you know the girl who sent you all during christmas break letters which you replied to just as eagerly from what i ve heard the girl you were so obsessed with for the past five months until i set you up with her the same girl who is fancying you back now and thinks you re fancying her too but now you re telling me there someone named julia in this blaise looked dumbfounded pansy fancies me he asked in a small voice gulping hard yes you prat and where did this julia person came from anyway blaise looked blankly at him she s she a friend of a friend of my cousin s clarisse she in ravenclaw fifth year i sent her letters too what did you say about pansy fancying me he said slowly as if afraid that if he would say it aloud will make it change harry sighed clearly not predicting this outcome she told me earlier on the train so what are you with julia now blaise looked completely lost he ran a hand through his hair we said we ll meet up and see how it goes i honestly dontknow what to do now i had no idea that pansy liked me that way i ve never been in this situation before the carriage stopped moving when they arrived at the front doors to the castle they stepped out of it and walked into the entrance hall dragging their luggage they had about thirty minutes before dinner started they decided to go to the common room until then as they made their way to the dungeons harry noted you know pansy is going to expect you to ask her out on a date blaise looked horrified seriously harry you ve got to help me what would you have done harry let out a dry laugh lucky for me i donthave that problem blaise reached for something in the inside pocket of his cloak he pulled out something and handed him to harry look at her he said harry looked down at what blaise shoved into his hand it was a photo of a girl holding a white cat she had long curly red blonde hair and light green eyes she was smiling genuinely as she patted her cat she was pretty harry had to admit she gorgeous isntshe harry handed him the photo back yes she is too bad you re allergic to cats she seems very fond of them he made a sarcastic note blaise chose to ignore it they followed a group of seventh years into the common room they said the new password and walked inside they entered their dorm and found it empty harry looked over to draco bed his belongings were already in place and he wondered how long he would keep hiding where do you reckon he is blaise asked pushing his trunk to rest by the bottom of his bed harry felt slightly uncomfortable with the question it wasntfair that he knew what had happened and blaise didn t but he just couldntfind the right words to tell him dunno he finally said his voice lower then usual he put hedwig cage on his bedside cabinet hoping that blaise wouldntsee through him he patted the owl beak with one finger which she nipped playfully he suddenly felt a hard shove in his shoulder which caused him to fall to his bed his face down he turned around and gulped when he met the end of blaise wand he knew he had nothing to worry about so he kept his own wand tucked in his pocket blaise wasnta threat to him what do you know that i don t blaise asked looking down at him while his wand was still aimed at his friend i ll tell you later harry said pushing the wand aside but blaise didntgive up as easily as harry thought he shoved him back down looking irritated what is it he pressed on all right harry said giving up i ll tell you just get off me blaise tucked his wand away stepping back from harry and helping him sit up on the edge of the bed harry thought he heard him mutter a faint sorry well it like this harry began to say but a strong voice came from the door way and made them turn around you dontneed to do this harry draco said walking into the room with slow equal paces it isntyour story to tell harry had the funny feeling as though cold had swept into the room once draco stepped in he could have sworn it was just his imagination but the hairs on the back of his neck still stood on end and shiver went through his spine without a second doubt harry had felt a major difference in his attitude draco what going on blaise asked the newcomer i was talking with the headmaster in his office a few minutes ago he said he wanted to speak with me about what my father did i guess harry was just about to tell you how i was trying to kill him and his family when i was under the imperius curse which none other than my own father had cast on me so i could do his dirty work and avenge the death of he who must not be named harry grimaced nodding slightly yes but not with those exact words imperius blaise gasped looking between his two best friends until he settled on harry face as though wanting to confirm what he was hearing harry nodded yes draco went on the ministry aurors had managed to capture my father and an entire group of death eaters he helped escape from azkaban prison that night my mother was injured she and father had quite a fight and he tried to kill her the aurors then investigated me after they d removed the curse and that it i thought you shouldntbe the only one who didntknow and it needed to come from me anyway wow blaise breathed not believing his ears so how long were you under the curse pretty long draco said ever since the start of first term you pretty much had seen me switch between my normal self to the possessed part most of the time it was mostly mood swings different behavior and stuff like that the healers who checked me after the curse was lifted were surprised i was acting normally after that so you okay now harry asked physically and emotionally yes i fine i mean i want to kill my father but that normal i guess he half joked and harry laughed in spite of himself well forget that we re glad to have you back let go down to dinner once they entered the great hall and headed to the slytherin table blaise caught harry arm in a painful grasp stopping harry on the spot and causing him to yelp in pain what the hell did i do to you harry demanded angrily rubbing his sore arm it her harry blaise hissed in panic pointing secretly ahead at pansy who was already seated with her friends in the table from what they could tell they arrived a bit too late and most of the seats were already taken only a few were unoccupied and they were all around her i cantsit next to her i cantdeal with this right now you ve got to help me harry oh no no harry said still annoyed by the throbbing in his arm i dontwant anything to do with this it your mess you figure it out i ve done my share in the deal he walked after draco who chose to sit beside crabbe and goyle and harry with a small smirk sat in the only seat left next to him blaise looked mortified when he found out that if he wanted to sit with them he would either have to take the seat next to pansy across of them or go and sit with a group of first year girls he cast harry a dark glare growling to himself silently and mouthed the words i ll get you for this later before he sat down next to pansy without much choice left she greeted him with an excited hi and he returned her a polite smile as his face flashed a bright color of crimson harry smiled proudly to himself as he started to fill his plate with food during dinner harry had engaged a conversation with pansy intentionally speaking about blaise so his daft and currently red eared friend would finally get the point and join in blaise only added a few sentences shyly which most of the time caused pansy to laugh to his great surprise he didnteven try to be funny harry merely chuckled at the jokes telling pansy a few funny stories about blaise most of their group laughed at the tales pansy shrieked with laughter goyle nearly chocked on his pie and draco tried to hide his snigger behind a napkin but it seemed that the only person who did not find these stories amusing was blaise twice he kicked harry shin under the table but harry hardly cared it was for his friend own good after all he did it all because he wanted to get pansy and blaise together they needed to stick to the plan after feeling he had enough of putting up with harry jokes about him blaise shoulders tensed and he stood up and without a word he strode back to the dungeons harry knew he had crossed a line somewhere and he mentally reminded himself to apologize to his friend later he would try to explain to him why he did it but he wasntso sure that blaise would accept his excuses harry was surprised to see pansy looking after blaise with even more interest than before as he left the hall harry and draco left the great hall a few minutes later with crabbe and goyle tailing behind pansy quickly caught up with them and stood by harry side joining them as well do you think he still likes me harry he seemed a bit put out earlier she said quietly he fine he just going through a phase or something he should be over it soon dontworry it nothing to do with you harry assured her putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder and squeezing it lightly a small smile tugged her lips thank you she said she waved him goodbye and ran down to the common room to join her friends it was funny somehow now that he knew pansy was off his case and that she could actually be totally normal around him he really started to like her in a non other than a friend way since he still believed something could still happen between her and blaise and also he still couldntforget about ginny that quickly he smiled fondly at the thought of blaise and pansy together and if he had to admit it they could be a cute couple only now blaise had to go and ruin his perfect plan which would have worked had he not met that ravenclaw girl potter a voice called coldly and harry spun around there was hermione granger standing alone a large book in her hands and an unfriendly glare on her face for a moment harry meant to greet her kindly but didntknow if his friends would see it appropriate or if she was faking her crossed expression so he simply mimicked her glare and crossed his arms over his chest granger he acknowledged her indifferently he could hear draco making a disgusted groan behind his back and he chose to ignore it while hermione rolled her eyes potter the headmaster had requested i ll walk you to his office since he wishes to talk to you she said at once sounding cold draco quickly pushed his way to stand in front of her and stood by harry i ll take it from here granger harry barely had registered what she told him what would the headmaster want from him was it something to do with draco you are due to do rounds in five minutes malfoy if you hadntmissed today prefects meeting you would have known that harry was sure he saw a glint of triumph in her eyes but her expression did not change draco made another assaulted sound and walked away crabbe and goyle still behind him please follow me hermione said and walked up a staircase not waiting up for him and he ran up to meet her they walked up to the second floor until she opened a door to an empty classroom pushed him inside and locked it behind them with a flick of her wand what going on i thought dumbled are you honestly stupid or are you just pretending to be she asked cutting him off throwing her heavy book on a desk a loud thump echoed through the dark room what he retorted confused well at least now he knew the headmaster didntreally ask to see him so he could stop worrying what he wanted however now he was cornered face to face with a fuming girl in a vacant dark classroom and he had no idea why she was so angry at him what did i do oh dontgive me that she said pacing angrily about the room muttering to herself she stopped and looked him directly in his eyes i risking my relationship with ron and friendship with ginny so i can help you get together with her but then you throw that in my face granger what are you on about he asked puzzled she started pacing around the room again at first i thought she was just overreacting that maybe she misunderstood what she saw but when i saw it myself i just wanted to strangle you again what you and pansy parkinson harry blinked not following what about me and pansy hermione gasped looking shocked oh donteven try to deny it i saw you two together earlier at dinner at first he didntfollow but then the words entered his head and he gaped at her in horror pansy and i are definitely one hundred percent not together she sulked dontlie ginny said she saw you hugging her ginny said that where did she get it from are you both insane i can barely stand her he said now feeling angry himself then he remembered he did hug pansy oh the train he said slowly hermione nodded she not interested in me she told me she was fancying blaise and i was just happy so i hugged her i didnteven realize hermione didntlook convinced i swear really why would i mess up things with ginny after everything i ve done to try and get her does it even make sense to you hermione huffed angrily i swear potter if you mess this up i wontlet you see the next day sunrise she said threateningly so unlike of her he raised his hands up in defense make sure ginny knows there nothing between pansy and me would you hermione did not say anything she grabbed her book and stomped out of the classroom without another word harry walked out of there feeling a bit perplexed he couldnthelp but think what would happen when he and ginny could finally start a relationship but with no trust would she always think he would turn his back on her and go to someone else and play with her like that he felt like it wasntthe time to think about it he knew that no matter what he would never do that and if a matter like that ever surfaced between them he would have to assure her that there nothing to worry about harry chuckled to himself and ran a hand trough his thick hair he couldntbelieve he was thinking what he would do if his relationship with ginny be at risk when there was no relationship at all between them although he couldnthelp but wonder if it would ever work out between them they were two opposites after all his mind still traveled to those places where he yearned to reach already he wandered the torch lit hallway and entered the loos at the very end of it he needed a bit of freshening up before he could come back to the common room he flashed cold water on his face and rubbed his weary eyes slightly smiling to himself when he couldntstop thinking what their first date would be like would they constantly argue or would they be unable take a minute break to catch their breaths since they couldntstop snogging harry looked up at the mirror examining his flushed faced he shook it forcedly in attempt to clear his mind from these thoughts he reached for the paper towels dispenser to wipe his hands and face dry but found it empty he entered an vacant stall to grab some toilet paper instead just when he heard the door creak open and two sets of heavy foot steps entered the room she nice isntshe he heard someone say he didntrecognize the voice the sound of running water in the sink was heard quite a looker too his friend chuckled i ll say did you see her front not bad for a girl her age eh though i think she might be too short for you the first one sighed obviously a fake sigh as harry could tell harry simply rolled his eyes as he wiped his hands dry in toilet paper yeah but she been single for quite some time now so i thought i should just ask her out now before someone else will corner said she knows how to kiss and well stuff harry shook his head absently not paying much interest in their private conversation after all boys will be boys and he couldntblame guys his age for checking out girls there was the screech of the metal tap turn shut and harry stepped outside his stall eyeing the two ravenclaw boys who looked likely to be fifth years for a minute before heading to the door just wait until breakfast tomorrow and i ll set a date with ginny weasley harry feet had halted on their own record at that he looked back to the other two boys fixing their appearance in the mirrors and sniggering to themselves until the tall sandy haired one who talked about asking ginny harry ginny out on a date had caught his eyes in the mirror and frowned whatchoo looking at he called at harry his friend turned around and shot him a dark glare harry did not say anything knowing if he had he d be seeking trouble so thinking better he turned back and walked out taking a shortcut to the dungeons harry mentally kicked himself he knew he should have acted sooner now someone else was going to ask her out someone who was more handsome than he was who was taller than he was who was more popular than he was who wasnta slytherin like he was and ginny would accept his offer and agree to go out with him he d never have a chance to date her now not in this decade at least he reached the entrance to the common room said the password walked inside and straight to his dormitory no one was there but him and for a second he wondered where blaise had gone to or if he even got back here at all he sat at the edge of his bed kicking his shoes off whilst thinking if blaise was avoiding him he let his body fall limply back onto the bed thinking what he should do now with ginny he didntwant anyone else asking her out of course but he couldntjust walk up to her and fight another bloke for her she wasnthis to fight for he had no right to do such thing besides he knew she was still confused about her feelings for him and he knew he should give her time to figure them out however time was the only thing he didnthave tomorrow morning that pretty boy would ask her to go out with him and he would lose any chance of ever being with her he could not lose her again to another guy hermione said ginny was upset when she saw him hugging pansy that must mean she starting to like him otherwise why would she be upset by that and hadntshe almost kissed him back over christmas even though he knew that if he walked up to her right now she d probably avoid him or scream at him or both ginny doesntknow what she wants hermione had said she still in denial harry sighed how much longer is she going to be in denial he still wasntsure what he should do the door opened and harry looked up to see blaise walking into the room wearing his pajamas and drying his hair with a towel obviously having just coming back from a shower he didntsay a thing when he noticed harry sprawled on his bed so you arentspeaking to me harry stated blaise sat on his own bed purposely not looking at him fine be that way i was just trying to help you know you asked me to do this blaise suddenly let out a huff i did not ask you to make me look like a fool in front of everyone he retorted angrily harry sat up so he could look at him properly i did not ask you to joke about me harry i asked you to help me so i wouldntneed to deal with her at the moment because i was confused harry opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out blaise went on for the first time in my life girls are actually interested in me i mean i dontknow why but they do and the worst part is that i cantchoose who i want to be with it may have happened to you before when you used to date three girls at the same time but i not you i not used to getting attention from the opposite sex tonight i needed some space but instead of helping me you kept shoving this suffocating cloud into my face and i couldntdeal with it tonight all i asked from you is to be my friend not a bloody matchmaker harry gulped it only just occurred to him how big of a prat he was tonight toward his best friend if only he realized earlier this is how blaise felt he wouldnthave acted like a complete git blaise i sorry mate i had no idea you felt that way but you ve got to see it from my point of view i felt like you threw everything i ve done for you in my face i thought if i d stick to my plan you ll eventually thank me for it but i saw it was failing and i felt like you threw it all away like i ve done nothing blaise sat there with his shoulders slump looking as sorry as harry was and you know what pansy told me harry went on she was afraid you didntlike her anymore see even after i made you look like a fool she still like likes you as you are the question now is if you still like her blaise covered his face with the towel blocking the frustrated growl that escaped his throat he threw himself backwards onto the bed his body hit the mattress with a weak thump and he stretched out i dontknow he muttered through the soft fabric he removed it just enough so he could take a peek at harry but it like you said earlier harry you ve done your share of the deal so it over now for you i need to get out of this mess by myself dontthink i not thankful harry because i am i dontknow if i said it before but i really am thankful for everything you did you re a good friend touching as this is my fair ladies draco voice rang through the room they looked up to see him leaning against the doorframe clearly having heard half their conversation harry smile which brightened at blaise speech disappeared at once there was something in draco taunting voice that harry didntlike he was used to been teased by him but something felt different and harry frowned at him i dontfind it so amusing when i have to do rounds with parkinson and hear her saying how completely cute you are zabini draco said sarcastically then come back here and hear the two of you blabbing about it as well blaise grabbed a pillow from behind his head and threw it in draco direction not even caring if he hit him with it or not draco easily dodged the pillow and walked inside kicking the dormitory door shut behind him he passed by blaise bed lifted the towel off his face just a bit so he could see his hidden eyes missed he said with a bored note to his voice and carelessly let go of the towel letting it cover his friend face once again he walked to his trunk pulling out his fancy bottle green satin pajamas and started to change his clothes you two are starting to act more like girls every passing day he commented it a real wonder you can still pee while standing you could use a real good snog once in a while too draco harry said dryly now pulling his own pajamas out of his trunk and who said i haven t draco replied casually surprising his friends harry turned to look at him just as he had pulled his pajamas shirt on catching a glimpse of his pale skinned back harry blinked once he was sure he saw a raw mark scorched on his side he shook this thought off thinking he was either imagining it or for the more logical option it could have probably be an outcome of the duel he had with his father harry chose not to say a word about it and instead glanced at blaise direction to see if he had spotted it too but blaise head was still covered with his towel though right now it was perked up at where draco was standing slowly he removed the towel off his face revealing a look of complete shock what he asked with a slight emphasis just because i donttalk about girls like the two of you doesntmean i dontacknowledge them draco explained yeah right blaise snorted who will snog you millicent bulstrode is already taken harry laughed at that yes i think crabbe is dating her he added causing blaise to roll around and stifle his laughter in another puffy pillow draco did not look offended by that however he still wore a small smirk on his lips laugh all you want but just because i donthave a steady girlfriend it doesntmean i dont snog girls unlike you two i actually get to snog girls i like while you sit and mope all day about yours you canteven get them on a date and you re mocking me tut tut whoa that low blaise said shaking his head slowly yeah we re not speaking of this it a sensitive topic harry added and his ears changed a hue of pink besides i never even saw you around girls so quit acting all macho i not draco insisted shrugging i just dontgo and brag about it in front of the whole house well obviously i haventbeen with anyone lately since this all fiasco with my father happened but that actually changed tonight oh yeah with whom harry challenged pulling his own pajamas shirt over his head jennifer newport draco replied without even blinking harry heart skipped a bit no way he said slowly barely managing to find the collar of his shirt to stick his head through blaise sat up at once harry ex it was true a year ago harry dated her for a little over a month jennifer was a slytherin seventh year a pretty brunette with blue eyes who mostly dated boys because she liked the attention it brought on her that who she was another girl who liked being in the spotlight she and harry werentvery serious but he still liked her despite all that they broke up on friendly terms though he hadntspoken to her since how when did this happen harry asked not that he cared he was merely interested draco shrugged a few minutes ago in the common room after i got back from my rounds we sat down and well it just sort of happened you know blaise looked impressed while harry contemplated this it surely seemed like draco was back to his old self and harry wasntsure if he likes it or not he should be happy for his friend after everything he d been through the least he could do was to accept him for whom he really was he felt a small pang of longing for the old draco and he didntknow why he felt that way the old draco wasnthis friend the one who stood in the room with him now was his real best friend so why is it such a sensitive topic for you harry a dull voice erupted his reflections harry woke up from his daze with a quick shake of his head and looked shyly at his friends i not sure i can talk to you about this he said uncertainly if you re not going to talk to us about it who will you turn to blaise reasoned harry first choice in that case of course would have been hermione but giving that it was nearly curfew and that he probably wasnther favorite person at the moment he thought he d better tell them now than to no one at all tomorrow may be a bit too late come on harry we re your best mates blaise pressed yes and even though i know i going to regret it later you should tell us what up with your redhead draco said harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair well things are a bit complicated than i thought they would be she doesntknow what she wants or what she feels and i canteven go up to her and talk not to mention asking her out and speaking of asking her out i found out tonight that there this ravenclaw bloke who going to ask her out tomorrow at breakfast and of course he looking so charming she wontbe able to reject him i not sure what i going to do well that easy draco said slowly just make sure he wontask her until you get to ask her first harry snorted and how am i going to do that we ll help you out harry looked skeptically at them as though they had grown a second head but draco looked serious and blaise nodded his head genuinely right but let leave the option of hexing him as plan b okay and so it was that for the next hour they sat down and plotted what harry should do morning came much too soon and yet harry perked up early changed his clothes and headed off to the owlery his body was shaking slightly and he regretted he didntwear a sweater or a pair of gloves this early in the morning the air was icy and his warm unsteady breath was coming out of his mouth in small puffs of vapor the sun had just started to shine its warm glow casting soft beams of gold over the deep oval skies all harry could hear beside the echo of his footsteps on the marble floor was the squeaky cheeping of birds and the chirping of crickets he ascended the spiral staircase to the owlery once he reached it and silently entered the circular room careful not to alert the entire pack of dozing owls hooting softly in their sleep with their heads buried under their wings the air in the room was damp the floor was a mess of scattered straw owl droppings and animal bones he looked around and spotted hedwig nested on a low perch in the right corner of the tower she had seemed to recognize her master presence when he entered the room her big amber eyes blinked questioningly at him as though asking if he had come for her he walked over to her scratched her pale feathers affectionately while she nibbled his fingers in return she seemed to understand he had not come for her and went back to sleep harry scanned the room for the second time for a suitable school owl one of the few that were already awake and watching him he found one sitting on a perch above hedwig a tiny scops owl and then tried to persuade him to come down the owl finally flew to him and landed on his outstretched arm harry then pulled out of his pocket a small roll of parchment he had prepared the night before with his friends help this parchment was actually taken out of the journal blaise had got him for christmas and blaise tipped him that it wasntexactly an ordinary sheet of parchment and when that got harry interested he refused to say another word about it after giving the owl the instructions to whom and where to deliver his letter the small bird hooted once in comprehension and took off by now harry could hear the unmistakable sound of students going down to breakfast in the great hall and just thinking of it harry stomach gave a lurch both of hunger and anxious this will better work ginny let out one hearty laugh just as hermione and ron joined her across the table at breakfast she had been so engrossed in a conversation lavender and parvati were having that she hadnteven noticed they arrived hey what so funny hermione asked though ginny merely waved her off distractedly ron huffed earth to ginny he called waving a hand in front of her face which she slapped away what she absentmindedly replied hermione seemed keen to know what the conversation was about and started to listen to her roommates as well ron rolled his eyes in boredom filling himself a bowl of cereal and trying in all his might to look interestedly in their talk she really good you should all go and see her parvati coaxed and not just because she a relative wait see who exactly hermione asked parvati aunt is a seer lavender explained excitedly her eyes beaming she just opened a new place down in hogsmeade hermione narrowed her eyes and looked doubtfully at parvati it was a well known fact that she did not believe in seers or anything that was future telling related she always said that it was rubbish and a way to scare people and steal their money she d been like that ever since her third year when professor trelawney told her that she doesnthave the inner eye no really hermione i know what you re going to say parvati said eagerness clear in her voice but she nothing like that she always talks about love and friendships she nothing like professor trelawney she never predicts death or the like she not using crystal balls or tea leaves and such she just looks at you and she knows ginny giggled sounds like i should go and see her next time there a hogsmeade trip what do you say hermione want to come she winked you dontreally believe in that do you ginny hermione countered with a weak voice oh come on it just for fun what wrong with knowing a bit about your future she might even tell me when i will finally have a normal boyfriend i can tell you that and it will actually be true hermione said leaning back in her chair there was a small trace of a smug smile on her face but it quickly disappeared yeah and free ron added i ll tell you what this is he said pointing his dripping spoon at ginny it a waste of your money that what it is a total rip off parvati made an insulted sound i ll have you know that last time i saw her she told me that i will lose track of time and the day after that my alarm clock went off on its own and my watch broke she interfered sounding dramatic lavender gasped in disbelief ginny giggled again and hermione rolled her eyes muttering oh please under her breath hey speaking of hogsmeade did you talk to mum ginny then turned to her brother she completely forgot to ask him about it bout wot he asked back his mouth full of cereal is she still refusing to let you go to hogsmeade or do you need to make another polyjuice potion just so you could sneak you way out of the castle again he swallowed and looked up at her as a matter of fact she signed my form just before we came back he answered proudly puffing his chest really hermione looked hopeful he nodded with a pompous grin on his face you can come this time i can and it was all because they took scabbers away from me she felt bad about it that i donthave a pet anymore now how long was it since the last time we had a normal date hua he asked his girlfriend flinging a hand around her shoulders and pulling her closely to him she looked into his eyes adoringly and gave him a peck on the lips since the last time i puked ginny muttered she threw a few grapes at them picking them from a near fruit bowl really people are eating here ron stuck his tongue at her and ginny returned the gesture immediately hermione laughed at the childish behavior of the two siblings okay so where will we go hermione asked ron shifting back the conversation to where it was in the beginning before ginny interrupted them well how about we go down to parvati aunt and predict our future he suggested and hermione raised an eyebrow at him she turned back to her food ginny wrinkled her nose i thought it was a waste of money ron she mocked taking a bite off the food in her plate hypocrite heck i haventspent a knut from my allowance since the summer holidays he laughed nervously noticing the dark look hermione gave him well be besides the money for you christmas gift of course he added quickly the answer seemed to please her maybe she can tell me if we win the quidditch cup this year it d be a great opportunity to raise a bet of course we ll win the cup there no question about it ginny said ignoring half the things he said hermione however narrowed her eyes at him again she smacked his arm not pulling a fred and george act here are you think about it first before this goes down to your mother if she finds out you re doing illegal bets i doubt she ll let you come back and finish your n e w t s next year she rebuked moreover you can lose your post as captain and you wouldntwant that now would you oh great mail here ron said looking up obviously not hearing a word hermione said she shook her head and ginny smirked owls flew into the great hall from all directions dropping letters and parcels to their respectable receivers a barn owl flew at them and landed in front of hermione delivering her the morning paper ron reached to untie it from its leg but in return he received a nasty bite oww he yelp withdrawing his hand and sucking on his bleeding finger grumpy are you he asked the bird hermione smiled in sympathy and paid a golden coin to the owl which hooted angrily once and flew away ron then snatch the quidditch section grumping on bloody owl bites and hermione who meant to scan the front page news looked up when something grey and furry caught her eye ginny you have an owl she said her redhead friend who was reading the back of ron paper suddenly looked up and focused her gaze at hermione sorry what she asked hermione pointed at the owl waiting for her at the middle of the table sticking his leg at her a roll of parchment attached to it with a string curiosity shot through her and ginny untied the letter from the tiny owl giving him a small piece of her toast as a treat before he flew away she wondered what it could be and what it was about she didntrecognize the owl but he looked like one of those that the school owned she wondered who will send her a letter she carefully rolled the letter open a scowl appeared on her face and she wrinkled the letter into a ball and tossed it inside ron nearly empty cereal bowl what is it hermione who had been watching her closely asked with concern ron put his paper aside and pulled out the crumpled paper ball and started to shake it from the milk that drenched it a prank ginny said simply reaching across the table for hermione newspaper and disappearing behind it what did it say hermione pressed ginny sighed angrily it sounded like it took her a great deal to control her emotions and not to snap at hermione nothing it blank whoa ron suddenly called in alarm what the splatters of milk hit the newspaper ginny held and apparently milk drops flew everywhere ginny tossed the paper down angrily luckily for her she was hidden behind it so she hadntbeen hit with milk in the face could you be a little more careful when you re cleaning that there no need to splash milk all over the place ronald you re lucky the newspaper blocked it she said crossly but then she froze when she saw what ron was holding in his hands he did not held a crumpled ball of parchment but a neat smooth sheet of it as though it was brand new it it smoothed by itself ron stuttered he cast a look at ginny who looked back at him with wide eyes donttouch that hermione called startling them both ron threw it as though his fingers had been burned it could be cursed she added but we ve already touched it ginny countered fear crossing her eyes if it was cursed we should have had boils or nosebleeds or something by now dontyou think hermione shook her head ginny the least we could do is getting it checked ginny sighed fine but i have to go to class now i have snape next argh double potions my absolute favorite she said sarcastically and made a sour face at that we ll meet after school at the library all right ginny got up and swung her bag over her shoulder er so what do we do with it now she asked looking down at the parchment now lying peacefully on the table ron and hermione stood as well hermione flicked her wand with a swirling movement of her wrist and the mysterious parchment glowed pearly white for a moment before it soared to her and she carefully tucked it into her book bag as though it would explode any moment now ginny knew one can never be too careful especially when it involved curses and jinxes to her it looked like just another regular parchment quite harmless in fact she was sure she wouldnthave noticed it otherwise hadntit just straightened on its own ginny knew hermione acted wisely suggesting they would check it out just in case they had left the great hall together and parted at the entrance each going to a separate way hermione who meant to go up the stairs to her ancient runes class suddenly felt a rough pressure on her left shoulder and turned around with a cross glare on his face harry potter was standing in front of her looking down at her menacingly hermione for a second had the sudden thought that he was about to strangle her right then his jaw was set hard and his eyes were dark and narrowed she opened her mouth to say something but he started first what do you think you re doing he asked at once his voice hard and demanding again she tried to reply only this time she couldntfind her voice at all she glanced around them to see if anyone was watching them surely harry knew it would look strange and suspicious if they would be seen talking together again she was thankful for the heavy crowd of rushing students that started to get out of the great hall just then mingling around them and swallowing them in it no one cared to look at them everyone were in a hurry to make it to their class before the bells rang so they were left unnoticed hermione had the faint idea of what this was all about why he would suddenly corner her like this he was probably upset about her yelling at him the night before harry she hissed is this how you re helping me he spat at her what she asked taken aback her eyes widening give her back the letter this second hermione or i swear but he never got to finish that sentence since she began to laugh oh so it yours she said looking at his face with a mixed expression of surprise and amusement oh i should have known but then again why would you charm it she tilted her head in a small angle resembling a curious puppy harry looked at her strangely i didntcharm it she folded her arms over her chest and looked straight into his eyes then how do you suppose to read it you read it like any other letter harry replied in frustration his voice a bit louder than usual she squinted at him are you sure she asked testily you didntuse an invisible ink or something like that what are you on about hermione he demanded again she clicked her tongue raising her hands in defeat and shaking her head as she opened her bag and pulled out the spoken letter this time she wasntas careful as she was before now knowing it wasntjinxed or cursed before she could hand it to him he snatched it out of her hands as soon as he saw it as he looked down at it she could see his eyes widening in surprise and almost popping out of their sockets as he saw a blank sheet of parchment and not the letter containing his words but i there were words he stammered looking frantically at both sides of the paper i dontunderstand that he looked up at her are you sure it the same one she nodded i ve never seen anything like that before maybe you sent her a blank paper instead he shook his head still glancing down at the parchment in his hands and moving a finger across the surface as if he would feel the ink bulging out there no way i ve mixed it up with another paper wait blaise did say it was quite different you dontthink it erases the words you write on it do you could be but maybe you should ask him and make sure harry shook his head again no i donthave time he muttered then all of the sudden he let out a loud growl i going to kill him he spun on his heel and hurriedly made his way to the dungeons hermione after checking she had enough time to get to her class before the bells ring followed after him harry strode in the direction of the slytherin common room where he knew blaise was staying since they had a free period now he was vaguely aware that hermione was behind him all he could think of was finding blaise so he could explain this then he ll hex his sorry arse into a pulp at the thought of that harry seized his wand and flexed his fingers over it in a firmer grip harry wait hermione called from behind her breaths coming in short gasps what that harry came to a halt and looked back at her she was pointing at the letter in his hand harry gave it a quick glance before shifting his eyes back to her meaning to ask her what she meant but he needntto since he noticed it himself harry brought the parchment closer to his face so he could observe it better a wide smile spread on his lips oh he a genius he exclaimed and turned back to look at her now that he knew what blaise had meant the hasty need of wanting to kill him had fled away as if it never existed hermione make sure you give it back to ginny immediately okay it important that she ll read it right away why what the rush she asked taking back the letter he was handing back to her she glanced down briefly at it and realized how harry was able to read it now harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously it just that i found out last night that there is this ravenclaw guy that likes her and he meaning to ask her out today if he hadntalready and i just know she going to agree unless she reads this letter first hermione smiled kindly dontworry i ll make sure she ll read it and that she wonteven have the chance to talk to him thank you he smiled back he grabbed her by the shoulders and spun her around okay now go hurry you ve got to find her fortunately for hermione ginny had told her earlier that she had potions next so she took a turn left and hurried straight to professor snape classroom she found ginny waiting outside with her friends and rushed over to her to her alarm she was talking to a tall ravenclaw bloke who seemed to look smug at the conversation they were having ginny however looked hesitant and let out a nervous laugh as he spoke to her ginny she called waving at her the other girl perked her head up at the sound of her name being called she excused herself from the guy who she was talking to as she spotted hermione coming towards her hermione she asked what are you doing here hermione panting hard again bent down and put her hands on her knees trying to catch her breath she straightened up and shoved harry letter into her friend hands once again it had flattened out on its own from a crumpled state it okay it safe she said breathlessly are you sure ginny asked with a frown looking skeptically at the parchment in her hands yes she huffed she took a deep breath look at it in here you ll be able to read it er okay ginny replied uncertainly pushing the letter into her bag trying to understand what hermione meant by that the loud jingle of the bells was heard and a second later the door to the potions classroom had opened behind them with a swing and snape stood at the entrance rushing them in ginny thanked hermione and turned to enter the class oh and ginny hermione added suddenly and ginny turned back around that guy you talked with earlier dontgo out with him ginny gaped at her how did you know he asked me miss weasley come inside now or dontcome at all snape snarled and ginny reluctantly turned again and quickly entered the class with a sheepish look on her face snape looked down at hermione dontyou have a class to go to miss granger i think it would be the first time you ll be late what a surprise and here i thought i wouldntbe there to witness it his voice held a definite sneer and without another word he smiled leeringly and shut the door hard disappearing inside hermione heart gave a wild jump as she remembered she was in fact late for her class she ran all the way to the sixth floor still out of breath knowing that what she did was probably a good deed for maybe this time harry and ginny would finally be able to make amends she felt a great wave of satisfaction rush over her as she sat down in her desk and pulled out her books and even that she was five minutes late for the first time in all her hogwarts years she didntcare at all for she knew that right now harry was probably sitting and thinking of her and when ginny will read the letter both will surely be smiling as ginny sat down in her usual seat she felt slightly confused how did hermione know that she had just been asked out of a date well ginny told herself making a fleet attempt of convincing it hermione she knows everything she sat with her friends and waited for the lesson to start snape walked to the blackboard his coal black robes blowing at his wake and with a flick of his wand words appeared on the black surface pull out your books and turn them to page 157 he instructed and miss weasley your bag is glowing put that light out now or i ll take points from you he said threateningly every eye in the room was now staring at her as she tried to understand what just happened she looked down at her bag lying discarded on the dungeon filthy floor and saw that indeed a soft glow was coming out of it she frowned and checked if her wand was in her robe pocket like it usually was when she found it right in its place she wondered what could be the source of the light she reached for the bag to take out her book at the same time she searched within it she then noticed that the light was coming out of none other than the letter hermione had just given back to her she folded it in half and held it tight so it wontsnap open and straighten itself again and quickly tucked it in another thick book she carried in her bag she tried to ignore it the best she could until the class was over and snape had dismissed them it seemed to be the longest class she ever had and the anxious to look at the letter had almost broken her nerves only when she walked out of the room did she pull out the letter again to take a better look at it what are you reading ginny luna asked walking beside her i not sure she replied uncertainly she was sure she was holding the same parchment she received this morning in the mail since it smoothed right when she pulled it out of the bag she hid it in earlier but the weirdest thing was that this parchment wasntblank anymore words had appeared on the surface glowing out brightly as though fire had ignited them instead of what was supposed to be ink was light together forming letters as she passed by an open window and the white daylight from outside shone around her she noticed the words disappear at once as if they never existed and what was left in her hands was only a blank piece of parchment again that until she stepped into the shadows again that she saw the letters forming on the paper once more now she understood why she wasntable to read it in the great hall which was lit so brightly that morning that there was no chance she would have spotted something there she remembered what hermione told her earlier look at it in here you ll be able to read it and for the second time that day ginny asked herself how hermione knew that she halted lingering in a dark corner so she could read the letter carefully luna stayed by her side her curious prominent eyes gazing at her as ginny looked down at the letter she could tell it was the same writing style that belonged to her so called secret admirer she smiled softly as she scanned the page dear ginny i hope that by the time you receive this letter i hadntmissed my chance yet i know there are plenty of guys in this school that would do anything to go out with you and i included i know that by the end of the day that ravenclaw bloke from your year will give it a try and ask you out and i sad to say that i not him i just hope that you wontaccept his proposal before you hear what i have to say i know that for the rest of the day i ll sit around and mope too concerned about whether you agreed to go out with him or not i also sad to say that i tried a few times myself but you never spared me a glance you never took me seriously enough so this is my last attempt of doing this properly i would like to see you in order to do it i cantput it in a letter and simply expect your reaction the way i want it to be because there is the chance that i will be disappointed i know you are most likely imagining someone who either too hideous to walk up to you with uncertainness embarrassment and insecurity or either he too arrogant and good looking that he hadntenough of all the girls in this school that now he trying to get to you i proud to say that i neither of those types and if you re curious to find out for yourself i ll be waiting for you this afternoon at five in the owlery i hope that you ll come and that you wontbe too disappointed i not sure it a good idea to sign with my name or initials until you see me so i ll use what you re already familiar with yours sincerely s s merlin ginny muttered to herself i hope s s still stands for secret santa and not severus snape the thought of snape sending her love notes and christmas gifts gave her the chills and a shiver went up her spine she contemplated what she had just read would appearance matter to her he sounded so sincere and nice someone with great personality and she wasntas shallow as some other girls she knew she cared for people if they were different neville wasntthat attractive but she still went with him to the yule ball and luna was an outsider but she still hung out with her ginny sighed making up her mind it wouldnthurt to see who it is and what he like maybe it would be good for her maybe this one happened to be just the one for her after all all the boys she went out with thus far happened to be a disaster walking on earth ginny heart fluttered at the image of someone waiting for her in the owlery she felt full content and happy her secret admirer wanted to meet her he wanted to ask her out finally she thought to herself contently she would meet him she would be able to see who it is she imagined him looking out the window of the rounded room and into the school grounds outside with his back to the door and as she d step inside quietly he d sense her presence and turn around he would look back so intently and flash a smile at her as he d tuck a stray strand of raven black hair aside his sparkling green eyes will twinkle through his glasses as brightly as his smile grow wider ginny luna hand rested on her shoulder and snapped her out of her daydream she then shook her head violently forcing the image of harry potter out of her mind she didntunderstand why she would imagine him of all people she hoped she was safe in the shadows she didntwant luna to see her blush i fine she said hastily forcing a reassuring smile at her friend she tucked the letter back into her bag i dontthink professor snape will send you letters he just yelled at you in class luna said in her typical dreamy voice ginny snorted and they resumed their walk finally reaching the great hall for lunch five minutes later she and luna departed each girl going to her respective house table as ginny sat down and helped herself for some food she couldntshake the buzzing excitement that the letter gave her he cantbe too creepy she reasoned and he said he not arrogant so he wontlie when he talking about his looks but what if he someone i cantstand someone like colin creevey she decided she wouldntgo alone she would need someone to be there with her to support her in case things go really bad she knew who it would be and already knew what she was going to say but ginny wonttake no for an answer erm ginny someone said hesitantly from behind tapping her on the shoulder she glanced around to see kris huston the ravenclaw guy who asked her out earlier just like hermione and her secret admirer knew he would kris i was wondering if you thought about what i asked you earlier you didntgive me your answer and his voice trailed off as he nervously fiddled with his fingers she remembered that hermione told her not to go out with him it sounded much like a warning maybe hermione thought he wasntthe guy who will suit her she trusted her friend completely and knew she was always right without a second thought ginny apologized i sorry kris but no he looked disappointed at the strict answer and she felt bad about it but she knew there must be a reason for hermione to warn her not to go out with him that s that okay he said with a strong voice waving her off he walked away and ginny turned back to her food anxious for hermione to arrive so she would ask her to accompany her to the owlery that afternoon no ginny forget it i have two essays to complete five chapters to read in ancient runes and plus i had promised ron that i would help him in history of magic so no hermione said stubbornly once ginny had started to beg please hermione please ginny pleaded again i cantgo there alone i will chicken out i know i will you have to give me your support i cant ginny hermione insisted ask luna i sure she will agree to come with you besides it your thing ginny how will it look if i show up with you to meet a guy who wants to ask you on a date you wontcome inside you ll wait outside i sure i ll feel uncomfortable there listening and all hermione ginny gasped sounding scandalized what do you think that i going to snog his brains out as i walk through the door hermione blushed at that bowing her head into her plate of food ginny huffed please hermione come with me i swear i wontask you for anything else ever again well not ever again but for the rest of the year ginny had started then a round of please s and wouldntstop hermione who had enough of hearing please please please caved in and shouted you owe me big oh ginny suddenly burst out and threw herself over the table at her best friend knocking off goblets and baskets of rolls while flinging her hands around hermione shoulders now exclaiming a round of i do s and thank you s hermione face slowly contorted into a mischievous smile seizing the moment she silently added and you lend me that lilac blouse of yours that i like ginny almost fell for it as she was still yelling i do then she frowned and loosened her grip around hermione shoulders looking at her friend with a sour face she said no but i ll owe you something else hermione shoulders slumped down and she sighed in defeat bigger fine okay so when do you want to meet it was around seven minutes to five o clock and harry shifted his eyes from his watch forcing himself to focus on something else beside the time or the angry hoots of the owls around him he started feeling more nervous by the second she should be here any moment now hermione had reassured him earlier that ginny will come to meet him he just hoped she wouldntbe late he couldntstand waiting for her any longer he had anticipated meeting her and to tell her what he had been planning to say for so long he was pacing around the circular room practicing what he wanted to say choosing his words carefully he was sure it wouldntmatter anyway because he was sure that the minute she stepped through the door he wouldntremember his name let alone what he wanted to say he wondered how she would react and what she d say he hoped her reaction would be positive after all hadnthermione said it bothered ginny to see him with pansy he was sure it meant something he also held onto the memory of almost kissing her at christmas he knew he had her convinced she wouldntsay no this time the sound of someone climbing up the stairs to the tower was echoing through the door and harry found himself running about the room nervously trying to find a much better spot to stand in and wait he grew impatient as the slow rhythm of ascending feet grew louder and louder harry swallowed hard feeling his heart beat ten times faster than normal one more glance at his watch told him that she was right on time he leaned against a distant wall having a clear view of the door and waited for her to show up silently cursing himself under his breathe for the worst place he chose for them to meet but none of that mattered now she was here he was going to do it to get it done with hi he started the second she entered the room but a split second later he was completely chocked out and started coughing uncontrollably harry she asked an evident surprise in her voice he finally managed to overcome his coughing fit and looked up at her pansy hey he said to the girl who stood before him it wasntwho he expected it to be what are you doing here he asked hurriedly fearing that if ginny show up any second now she wontlike to see him together with pansy again he needed to get her out of there right now well pansy started blaise is avoiding me i afraid i thought i should take matters into my own hands and stop waiting for him to come around i decided to write him a letter and tell him exactly what i think and that i wonthave it the way he treating me anymore i would have done it personally but every time i come near him he flees away she said a notable pain in her voice erm harry wasntsure what to say but he made a mental note to talk to blaise about pansy later okay so go on then make it quickly you know the sooner he gets that letter the sooner he ll realize how stupid he was for avoiding you harry kept shooting glances at the door watching out in case ginny comes inside while hoping he wasnttoo obvious in front of pansy you know harry i dontthink i ve thanked you enough for all that you ve done you went through so much trouble even if blaise is acting like prat and he doesntappreciate what a wonderful friend he has i on the other hand am thankful i dontknow what i would ve done without you sure things had worked for the worse but i realized that i misjudged you all along you re a very sweet and caring friend she said and without seeing it coming she leaned forward and pecked him on the cheek her hands resting on his shoulders the door suddenly slammed hard the walls shook at the effect scared owls flew around them hysterically and they jumped apart with a start pansy shrieked as owls flew passed her and out the windows harry looked around the first thought entering his mind is that a gust of wind shut the very heavy door but then he remembered why he was there in the first place he ran for the door not bothering to say goodbye to pansy and ran down the stairs until he reached the bottom he looked haphazardly left and right and at the end of the hallway he spotted ginny silky red hair flying widely after her as though a great tongue of fire was soaring through the air as she and hermione strode away he sighed tiredly knowing it would be best now to give her some space instead of running after her he would also have to explain things to hermione who he was sure was siding with ginny as before he walked back to the common room with slacked shoulders and a heavy feeling of defeat in his heart hermione was trying to keep up after her angry friend but ginny was much faster especially when she was angry ginny please wait for a second she called after her but ginny didntslow down they now reached the fat lady portrait ginny spat the password at her and ran straight to her dorm room with hermione still behind ginny shut the door to her room at hermione face the bushy haired girl let out a sigh not sure how to deal with this or what to say it would be easier if ginny will just admit that she liked harry she pressed on the door handle and slowly pushed it open she carefully pocked her head inside fearing the something would come flying in her direction but when nothing happened she allowed herself to take a better glance at the room ginny sat slumped in the middle of her bed her back leaning against the headboard and a sour look on her face her knees were bent and a small black leather covered book sat open in her lap she had a quill twitching violently between her fingers scratching on the paper with black ink ginny she said tentatively crossing over to her ginny acted as though she wasnteven aware that hermione was in the room with her she kept writing in her diary not paying attention to her bushy haired friend ginny i sorry i know you feel angry but maybe he has an explanation ginny hand stopped moving and suddenly her head snapped up her eyes were narrow and dark an explanation what could possibly be his explanation for for hermione bowed her head she swore she would not let harry live this through he messed up enough and he lied so much she couldntthink she would want to even look at him again she knew ginny was upset she saw what happened too and that was after he swore to her that he had nothing going on with pansy parkinson he dared lie to her in the face after everything she did for him for standing me up that jerk ginny finished hermione blinked once and frowned as her friend words sank in stood her up what does she mean and to think i had to put up with another snogging display of potter and his pug ginny added what hermione asked confused you re not i not what ginny asked annoyed hermione shook her head nothing hermione realized that ginny wasntupset for just seeing harry and pansy together but for being stood up by who she thought was her mystery guy who she was sure was not harry ginny didnteven realize that the guy who waited for her was harry himself and that he didntstand her up the only thing hermione was still confused about is what was pansy doing there gluing herself to harry and if harry did in fact waited for ginny why would he let pansy kiss him when he knew ginny was about to come and meet him she needed to confront him before ginny got tired of these games and gave up but she was too upset with him to go out and find him and besides she still had a load of homework to get done and she had promised ron she would meet him in the library guess i ll have to hex him when i see him harry walked around the hallways with no purpose or idea where he was heading his mind was whirling with anger and depression and the portraits stared at him in concern asking if all was well but he merely waved them off barely sparing them a glance as he wandered around he felt like he hated everyone right now pansy for kissing him blaise for making her act all mushy like that which caused her to kiss him ginny for running away before he even had the chance to exchange even one word with her hermione who was probably siding up with ginny like in the night they had come back to school and he was even mad at himself for being too foolish in believing this plan can actually work and letting this all happen and get to this point he could feel his blood boil with anger his veins expanding with each fast beat of his heart muffled voices echoed around a corner and as harry turned he spotted three ravenclaw blokes he recognized as their quidditch team chasers he then remembered that on this saturday his own team was going to be playing against them he hoped the weather changed because he knew for sure that his team would play like rubbish and wouldnthave a chance of winning the match in the kind of storm raging outside as the ravenclaws walked past him they all smiled mischievously at him resembling a few slytherins harry was much too smart not to be associated with and at once shouted out in union with a note of competitiveness you re going down potter grab your broom tightly harry head span around at them ready to counter back but then he was sure someone had hit him with a body bind curse there in front of him stood not the three chasers who went past him just now but three identical copies of the same tall blond boy who wanted to ask ginny out she mine mine mine each of them echoed separately whispering it out but it sounded as screams to harry ears he watched perplexed and lost as a huge evil grin spread on each of their faces before they burst out in a harsh laugh harry knew it was his mind that was playing tricks on him and forced himself to shake his head vigorously the triple vision of the blond ravenclaw had dissolved back into the three chasers as they walked away laughing to themselves harry stopped walking and leaned against a cold stone wall trying to get his mind focus back to the present he took one deep breath to clam his nerves though it didnthelp much because he was sure he was now hearing ginny voice laughing merrily he needed a shot of cold water splashed on his face but before he could shout aguamenti and point his wand at himself he opened his eyes just a crack and looked around he found himself having a clear view of the entrance doors to the library just when ginny entered having said goodbye to a friend who passed by harry as though he was wearing his father invisibility cloak and she hadntnotice he was there his eyes lit up at the sight of ginny and everything seemed draped with gold and perfect once again this was his chance he knew the only way to calm himself and make things right he couldntstand the thought he almost had ginny talking to him and then it all went down the drain now the only way to find out what ginny was feeling was to approach her and talk to her right here right now knowing she was probably still upset with him he needed to do it carefully as he walked into the library for what it seemed the second time in all the years he spent thus far in hogwarts he started to look around the tables and shelves for the ginger haired girl he was looking for finally he spotted her she was sitting alone in a table mere feet in front of him leafing through a large book he couldntbelieve how his luck just turned just less than an hour ago she had stormed out of the owlery and he was sure it will take him days until he d be able to see her again his mind went completely blank of all thoughts as he started to move closer and closer to her making his mind of what to tell her and how to apologize to her the only thing in his mind was to do what he meant to do before pansy appeared in the owlery he was finally going to ask her out with a bright smile on his face and the enormous feeling of happiness and joy he took large determined strides towards her table all of that had disappeared as he suddenly felt a hard tug on his right wrist and a second later he found himself being thrown against a hard wall in a dark corner of the library unexpectedly hermione face appeared even before he had the time to reach for his wand or even register what had happened you slimy git what are you doing here she hissed harshly do you want to get out of here as a jar of ashes harry pushed her away from him giving himself some room before replying i dontcare how angry you might be hermione or what you re going to do to me but i had enough of waiting around for the right moment to come well it good then that you know that you went overboard but it not my job to do anything to you regardless of how mad i am at you right now harry ignored her and pushed himself off the wall and moved past her meaning to cross his way back to ginny table he didntneed hermione to help him talk to ginny he could do it alone he didntneed her breathing down his neck telling him what to do or how to act it was time he did it himself hermione caught his wrist again to hold him back before he even reached an inch out of the shadows he hadntthe time to resist before she whispered i didntmean it would be me although i think i ought to do something to you after what you ve done i actually meant ron would gladly hex you look he right there and i sure that if he wouldntdo it then ginny will surely finish the job for him harry looked between the shelves of a large old bookcase at the table ginny was sitting in he could now see ron taking the seat across from her besides him hermione continued talking dontthink she looks calm and giggly now because she in a good mood she faking it so ron wontnotice something wrong deep inside she seething hermione he sighed turning back to face her i dontcare anymore if i wontask her now someone else will and then i would lose my chance again you cantdo it this way harry you have to stick to the plan she insisted stick to the plan what plan exactly do you mean hermione your plan doesnteven work i have to do everything on my own he whispered crossly at her and you wouldnthave to if you had just listened to me i know what i doing so am i right she said slowly crossing her arms over her chest impatiently and kissing other girls in front of her is a part of your plan i assume she raised a warning finger at him when he opened his mouth to defend himself again no dontyou even bother denying it again i was there remember this time i saw it myself so donteven say it didnthappen he now mimicked her position folding his own hands over his chest oh did you he countered mockingly tell me hermione what kind of kiss did you really see if you had stuck around a second longer you would have seen her giving me nothing but an innocent peck on the cheek nothing more i pushed her away the second i realized what was happening when hermione didntlook convinced he went on i telling you hermione it wasntin a romantic sort of way since pansy like i have told you before fancies blaise not me hermione remained silent she appeared to have nothing to say to counter that the only thing she did was to glare at him through her narrow eyes clearly thinking of something to say harry gulped dreading her reaction at last she let out a long exhale and raised her chin high in a defiant expression i dontknow why i feel like i should forgive you again or why i still bothering to help you with this but something tells me that i should trust you her words had caused him to flash the widest of smiles he ever expressed in his life but she said and his grin immediately faded this is the last time i forgiving you potter no more pansy kissing or hugging or any other girls for that matter if you want to be with her act like it ask her out when she alone and carefree not when her brother is right there ready to kill you stop caring about your own interests and think about her for a change how would she feel when she sees you doing this or that think about what you do and say before you do it i care about ginny as if she was my own sister and if you hurt her i ll have to hurt you harry nodded vigorously taking the sight of her serious face she looked really intimidating when she was angry like one would not want to cross her he knew he shouldntjudge her just for being a girl this girl after all has probably read the entire collection of books about hexes that this library holds okay i will now can you please go and tell her what i just told you that happened in the owlery so she wontbe mad at me anymore hermione sighed and shook her head i can t harry what why he said in shock not expecting this answer he thought she understood and that she believed him you just said you forgive me i did forgive you but i canttell her what you said because she not mad at that she her sentence ended in an incoherent mumble and she cast her head aside to avoid looking in his eyes what was that she she thinks you stood her up she said with a slight grimace on her lips what he practically shouted and hermione hand flew at once at his mouth to shut him between the shelves of the old bookcase near them she could see that almost every person in the library had lifted their head to look for the source of sound madam pince had looked up from her table her long nose had raised two inches above the book she was examining in her hands her large nostrils had flared up as if she was a large mole sniffing around to find the disturber when she buried her face back inside her book hermione had looked back at harry who still had her hand plastered tightly over his mouth he gently fought to remove her hand holding her by the forearms and trying to push her away again but to no avail hermione knew he was too gentle with her and wouldnthurt her because then she would have to pay him back even worse seeing him breathing deeply and slowly calming down as he stopped resisting and squirming hermione nodded and slowly removed her hand fearing he would scream again and cause them to get caught that was close she muttered under her breath hermione how can she think that i was right there she saw me he hissed well i guess that once she saw you there with pansy and no one else was there she thought she just happened to interrupt you on your private moment and whoever ask her to meet him didntshow up so she left and now she angry about that harry leaned back against a wall to support himself from falling down at the news i cantbelieve it he said slowly but it didnteven cross her mind that it could be me hermione shook her head sympathetically not when pansy was there and especially not after she saw her kissing you maybe she was upset for seeing me with her harry suggested hopefully after all you said she was upset when she saw me hugging her on the train it a possibility but she didntsay anything about it to me harry sighed loudly how come i keep messing things up how am i supposed to ask her out now he looked hopefully at hermione for any sign of idea she might have he needed to fix this he needed to let her know that he was there and that he waited for her like he said he would pansy just happened to come in before her and things got out of hand ginny needed to know that he doesnteven like pansy he never did it was always her and now his only chance of letting her know all that stood in front of him her face however was blank harry bowed his head hermione had done enough for him he couldntask her that without making it look like she was helping him it was either telling ginny himself or to forget all about it and not tell her at all hermione seemed to read his thoughts she put a supporting hand on his shoulder and said in a low voice you re the only one who can tell her that harry but i afraid now is just not the right time or the right place for that she going through a lot right now she needs some time to think but what if i miss the right time and someone else gets to ask her before me he said in slight panic the thought of ginny going out with the blond ravenclaw he hated so much gave him the chills that what i here for hermione said kindly a small smile on her lips dontworry i wontlet that happen she added in a soothing voice patting his shoulder in a calming manner he couldnthelp but trust her he knew she was only trying to help she never owed him a thing and yet suddenly he has her by his side he couldntfeel more grateful and yet sorry for ever misjudging her he thanked her and turned around to the door harry she called not too loudly but only so he would be able to hear her he stopped and looked back a questioning look on his face can i be honest with you about something sure he nodded ginny told me what happened in her house at christmas you know when your family came to visit the weasleys and frankly she seemed excited about it at the time so i wouldntworry if i were you you ve still got your chance even if it does take a while to happen it eventually will she said her smile never faltering who knows what tomorrow may bring right he mimicked her smile tomorrow hua she nodded once with half a shrug tomorrow he nodded quietly and walked out the door feeling loads better than before once he was out of sight hermione took a deep breath and made her way back to ron and ginny hey there you are ron said cheerfully once he saw her she sat next to him took you long enough i was just telling ginny that i ve began to think you ditched us for that book madam pince said someone else had already borrowed it she smiled sweetly at him then leaning down and kissed him fully on the lips deep inside guilt crept into her heart she knew she did it because she needed to feel better about sneaking behind his back to help harry get together with ginny despite ron objections on the matter she had to make herself believe that he would always act this peaceful and loving around her even when she finally decide to tell him what she did she at least had to hold onto something in case things get bitter which she knew would probably will what was that for ron asked with a goofy smile as they pulled back not that i complain of course she shrugged innocently i just remembered why i love you so much ron smile genially and kissed her again aww if i knew you liked it when i call you bookworm than i would have called you that all the time she laughed lightly as he hugged her closely to his body and nibbled her neck in affection she gave him a playful shove in the chest ron not in front of your sister hermione said lowly a blush on her cheeks and a twinkle in her eyes exactly ginny chimed in her eyes buried in her book listen to your girlfriend ron she suppose to be the smartest witch of her age the couple laughed at the comment but then quickly forgot ginny was sitting with them will you love me always hermione whispered putting her arms around ron neck as he pulled her to sit on his lap no matter what always ron repeated genuinely no matter what she then pulled back just enough so she could put her hand in front of him she stuck out only her pinky pinky swears he drew back with wide eyes and looked between her face and her presented pinky several times before she felt his chest starting to shake with laughter what he chuckled clearly thinking she went insane she sighed impatiently little disappointed that he managed again to ruin a perfect moment but she knew she oughtntto blame him for not being familiar with this muggle custom just take the pinky he slowly reached his hand to grab the tiny finger but she chuckled and before he could hold the tiny finger in his palm she locked her pinky in his like this it an oath to life like an unbreakable vow only it not dangerous oh he said stupidly as they shook their fingers together well then hermione jean granger i promise i would love you always no matter what hermione hugged ron again but quickly pulled away back to her seat as madam pince started to patrol the library ginny eyes lifted to look secretly at them instead of feigning to be puking like she would do on other circumstances a sad smile of jealousy had fallen on her lips completely hidden behind her book it was friday lunch break and harry draco and blaise were exiting the great hall after a delicious meal as always they had defense against the dark arts next harry was quite looking forward to that since he could see remus again he had been absent from the rest of the week classes due to his full moon transformation he had been ill ever since they d come back to school and harry felt horrible not going to visit him after the full moon ended he wanted to go and apologize when he saw him this morning sitting at the staff table but thought he would postpone it until the actual class so they d be able to talk more privately as harry looked at his watch he saw they still had fifteen minutes left until the bells would ring blaise decided to walk his new girlfriend julia to her next class so draco and harry were left on their own they started talking excitedly on their upcoming quidditch match they had the following morning exchanging ideas and techniques the weather is supposed to be quite stormy so we ll have to see which way the wind blows draco was saying animatedly that way we could avoid bludgers and the chasers will know how and where to throw the quaffle without it flowing away from our possession and you re not even listening to me are you not really harry said distractedly his mind somewhere else his eyes fixed ahead on a beautiful redhead witch crossing her way through the crowd right draco said slowly rolling his eyes he clapped harry on the back i ll see you in class then kay harry murmured only half listening all he could hear now was his own heart drumming in his ears enthusiastically he didntsee draco leave and suddenly looked around and found himself alone simply thankful he hadnthad his friends tailing him around he went to follow ginny through the hallway to wherever she was heading for he was drawn to her by an invisible force which he couldntunderstand himself it was always like that when he saw her and he didntmind it at all the sight of her filled him with energy and being away from her felt like he could no longer take another breath hi ginny someone said to her harry had looked up at the sound of the deep voice calling her name it was none other than the two still nameless ravenclaw boys he saw the other night in the loos harry cursed them silently wishing they would leave her alone so he would be able to talk to her as they walked past her and ginny looked up at the tall blond one harry saw she was in a better mood this morning as she smiled up at them and her cheeks flashed red she waved goodbye to them and for a second harry was sure he saw her rolling her eyes his heart skipped a beat still oblivious he was following her she kept walking only a short distance away from him harry cast a dark look at the two ravenclaws but he kept walking after ginny even so he just had to see her the more he could and to make sure no other bloke would come five feet from her she stopped and turned to open a door on the end of the hallway and silently slipped inside the door closing shut behind her without even realizing it harry walked towards that door everything hermione had told him yesterday in the library had seemed to vanish from his mind everything except one word tomorrow this is the right time harry told himself she finally alone she totally carefree finally after so much agonizingly long time he would be able to tell her everything and at last ask her out on a date he stopped before the door looking pointedly at the brass handle hesitating whether to press it and open the door or to wait for her to come out questions flooded his mind and what if she wontcome out and how long exactly will he have to wait outside is she really alone and what if she was asked to meet someone inside shaking his head and gripping the handle tightly in a shaking hand he took one deep breath and pressed it down in one swing he entered inside the last thing he expected was to hear screams at first he was sure he entered a room full of banshees but as a red flash missed his ear by an inch he blinked and quickly realized where he really entered the girls loos a group of furious girls were glaring at him with their wands pointed threateningly at him a few were still screaming and shrieking hysterically at his intrusion he quickly looked around the room behind the group of girls who were now slowly closing in on him he could see ginny back to him her face only visible as she looked at him through the mirror she was facing a frown was visible on her pretty face as she was obviously thinking what are you doing here the next thing he knew he was flying backwards and all his body was aching as he was knocked back into the opposite wall with a loud thud when a series of curses hit his chest his body crumpled on the marble floor in a hip and his eyes shut tight from the pain the screaming girls then stormed outside you pervert a few shouted and slapped him painfully on his already swollen cheeks before they ran off the clicking of their heels against the marble floor and their faded outraged murmurings were all harry could now hear in the corridor harry slowly propped himself up to his feet shaking his head from the subsiding pain he was thankful that no one else was around to see this embarrassing episode he was sure that he looked like a total fool the door to the girls loos stayed closed and no sound from within the room could be heard from where harry was standing harry lingered in the empty corridor for a moment longer as if checking it will stay that way and at the same time afraid that if he took another step closer it would end up with him bleeding or covered with boils he was about to leave when he was sure that there was nobody there anymore and that ginny had already left with the other girls but before he even had the time to take another step the door to the loos swung open again with a creak and a head full of red hair pocked outside ginny looked at the sign hanging on the door clearly stating girls bathrooms a puzzled frown still on her face then she turned to look around and spotted harry staring back at her she shook her head and disappeared back inside harry felt even more stupid for not noticing this sign earlier before he barged inside he rubbed his stinging cheek which had returned to its proper size but still remained red and walked back slowly to the door again he hesitated whether he should open it or not he decided to risk it he now knew it would be just ginny in there the rest of the girls had already left he pressed down the handle as silently and slowly as he could he opened the door a mere crack so he could peek inside just to be sure he was right ginny stood alone where he last saw her still fixing her long red ponytail in the mirror seeing she was completely alone he let out an enormous sigh of relief and walked inside the door swung shut behind him he didntknow whether she noticed him or not and he wasntsure what to say or how even start for a moment i thought i was the one who came to the wrong loos she suddenly said her voice confidant and a small smile tugged to the corner of her mouth her brown eyes rolled at her image in the mirror harry remained silent too transfixed watching her comb her beautiful silky hair it was like a tongue of fire and he yearned to reach out and run his fingers through it i mean i can understand that you got confused the first time but since you re still here i guess you have some big secret you ve been hiding from everyone hmm she teased sniggering to herself as she watched his reflection through the mirror a confused frown on his face she turned her head to look at him and cast her eyes briefly at the direction of his pelvis before she let out another giggle turned back grabbed her bag and thrust her comb inside harry who felt nervous at her implying gaze shifted in his spot he quickly tried to think of something to say it nothing like that he stammered nervously i not hiding anything she nodded in disbelief and hummed yeah right she murmured under her breath hey you can come and check for yourself if you want he suddenly burst out before he could even give it a second thought she looked at him then with scandalized eyes great harry thought faintly she probably thinks i a complete madman when he realized his mistake his fingers ran through his messy hair as a raw blush covered his cheeks and ears he hadntmeant for things to get this way he came here to do something and he was going to do it no matter how hard she was going to make it for him he stammered an incoherent apology but she swung her bag over her shoulder and turned for the door no thanks i think i ll pass she said sarcastically i not missing out on anything special anyway harry pouted will you ever stop mocking me i came here to talk to you i trying to be serious here but you wonteven give me a chance to oh i sorry she cut him off with a tone of mock apology a hand on her chest in a dramatic manner and harry made a see what i talking about move with his hands it just that a day without mocking you is not a very pleasant day for me she let out a loud snort and moved past him walking out of the room leaving him inside harry felt angry why wontshe just stop acting so childish and listen to what he has to say he cantgive up now he has to do it no matter what harry opened the door and walked outside running to catch up with her quick paces she kept walking not even bothering to look at him he had enough of her ignoring him stop following me or i ll tell the next professor i see that you entered the girls loos she warned he ignored her comment as if she didntsay it still walking beside her fully determined to get this all over with i was thinking about something he started packing up his courage and giving it a try oh really she interrupted once more i didntknow you were capable of thinking she teased again harry took a deep sigh taking it all in he went on pretending he didnthear her this was just another thing about her that he needed to get used to her sarcasm i i wanted to ask you something he stuttered his forehead now prickling and clammy with hot sweat dontback out now he told himself do you think there a chance that maybe you you would go out with me on a date i mean he finished rather lamely but a great sensation of euphoria washed over him he finally said it he felt like he can do anything after saying that there wasntany way in the world that would ruin this for him now ginny suddenly came to a halt and harry noticing that a second later stopped as well only two feet away she looked up at him with a blank look on her face he looked back desperately at her maybe sincere even silently begging that she will say something in return the anticipation hurt like a whip as the seconds rolled on he thought he was breathing shallower or that his heart stopped beating when her lips curled into a smile any second now she would run to him and throw her arms around his neck and happily exclaim that finally after all the time she waited to hear him say it it finally become real he swallowed hard his adam apple bobbing up and down in his dried throat the realistic dream he just ran through his mind didnthappen unfortunately instead of running towards him and shower him with kisses she let out a sudden chuckle harry eyes changed into a shape they never had before yeah right she said sneeringly obviously not taking him seriously he wasntsurprised somehow he knew there is a chance she d react this way she started walking again and harry not accepting her reaction as a proper answer shook his head and went after her i serious he insisted ginny held her face up deliberately ignoring him occasionally when she passed by someone she knew she smiled kindly at them and by that also presenting a show as if she has no idea why this slytherin scumbag was following her or even addressing her ginny he tried again to get her attention still not looking at him she spoke out as though talking to someone who not really there i not listening to your lame attempts of winning some sort of a bet you had with your pathetic friends she countered she risked to look at him from the corner of her eyes before she went on where are malfoy and zabini potter lurking around a corner or hiding in a cupboard harry was shocked at her words is this how she takes him for i didntpull any bet with anyone potter if you were to ask me out for real it wouldnthave been like this she said and besides i know for a fact that you re still seeing pansy parkinson and i dontcare if you re denying it or not i mean if that your taste in girls than i consider her quite lucky that you even look her way but i just know you dontmean it okay so show over the gloves are off you can stop acting the part of your life okay drama boy i can believe that what you think harry murmured shaking his head as her hurtful words sank in he couldnttake her no and end it with that he had to convince her somehow no matter how desperate and foolish he d sound is it so hard to believe that i actually do want to go out with you i mean i know that i ve done some nasty things before but is it fair to judge me for them donti deserve a second chance she bowed her head having become speechless her paces slowed down until she came into a complete halt was he really telling the truth and if he was why hadnthe bothered to deny his relationship with parkinson come on gin he said gently in her ear please go out with me his voice was practically begging she contemplated what he just said and realized this was actually the first time she heard him call her that no one ever called her that not even her family she admitted to herself that it had a nice ring to it coming from his lips she raised an eyebrow she couldntbe serious he couldntbe serious she shook her head from all the incoherent thoughts that flooded her mind no dontgo there again she ordered herself she accepted the fact that she simply relived through her childhood crush and nothing more she should forget all about it and move forward people like harry potter especially harry potter will never find interest in a girl like her she was a simple girl there was nothing special about her she had a horrible hair color that matched a carrot and her eyes color was a dull plain shade of brown something you can see on every second person you meet she played quidditch and pulled pranks on people she barely wore makeup on and she still wasntaccustomed to the fact that somehow boys were attracted to her if they weren t people would think she was a boy with long hair and a skirt she snapped her head at him and narrowed her eyes dangerously how many times do i have to say no why cantyou just leave me alone she stuck out her lower lip in a pout and marched forward hands swinging wildly at her sides for a moment harry thought the best thing to do was to leave her alone at least for now and here he thought he caught her on a good day but he was clearly mistaken hermione was right he should give her some time and space only then a voice spoke inside his head he remembered something his godfather had told him over christmas his eyes went wide as saucers as an idea popped to his head he should do exactly what his father did he never thought that his parents would help him when it came to girls issues but right now he couldntbe more thankful he quickly drew level with ginny and called to her back i promise i would leave you alone if you go out with me only one date that all i asking she let out another hallow laugh and how does that make any sense exactly well harry said confidently i promise i wontbother you chase you and wonteven talk or cast a glance at you if that what you want ever again if you just give me one chance i still dontunderstand she replied stopping and looking doubtfully at him now she was sure he was complete mental harry looked quite smug with himself positively sure that his plan is going to work you see i can promise you that i wontever come near you again but i cantpromise the same thing about you to me he said with a cheeky smile and added a wink she crossed her arms over her chest looking at him closely her face supported something that looked like she was not impressed oh you re so sure of yourself eh potter he nodded you sure got a big ego i dontknow what made you think that i would actually agree to that you must be really desperate to win that bet harry frowned i told you and i dontcare so that a no it sure is you wonteven consider this she smiled lopsidedly okay you know what let me think about it she made a fake thinking face looking quite convincing when she started to rub her chin and look up at the ceiling as though it would help her decide umm no and once again she renewed her paces with him still after her still not taking rejection that easily he sighed feeling tired of playing cat and mouse games he was so sure she would agree this time it worked for his parents why hadntit worked for him maybe things had changed in the dating world since the 70 s why not harry persisted because was her reply that not an answer he countered well that all you are going to get just tell me why the hell not he now demanded she stopped for the fourth time she gave up but hadnthad the courage to look him in the face while she said it because we re different okay she said ever so softly she wasnteven sure he heard her so she spoke louder it because i a gryffindor and you re a slytherin i milk you re oil we just dontmix she indicated with her hands between them it could never work between us he huffed angrily not quite satisfied with her answer that a rubbish way to put it he argued knowing that he had softened her even a little bit you just scared that it might actually work between us i am just as scared believe me you donteven know me she said out of the blue he frowned again he wanted so much to reach out and touch her shoulder to spin her around so she would finally look at him he didntfind enough courage to do that though what that got to do with anything he shook his head we can get to know each other better wontwe that all the point of a date she shuffled her feet on the marble floor thinking of what he was saying besides i already know more than you think i do she looked at him questioningly thankful for the things hermione had tipped him off he said i know you like vanilla more than chocolate i know your favorite color is pink even if you cantwear it because it clashes horribly with you hair he made a reach for a stranded red lock yearning to touch the silky texture of it between his fingers but she tucked it behind her ear before he even got closer and she hadnteven noticed the gesture i know your favorite animal is not a cat or a dog it a horse even if you never actually seen one i really know a lot about you ginny weasley she began to stammer what is that how do you know all that stuff she knew she was panicking but why those things were so innocent that she wasntsure why she was scared maybe she wasntscared but she was definitely shaking because she knew all the things that he just said were true a few times before she had played with the idea that he was stalking her he had denied of course now she wasntsure what all this meant how did he find out all that stuff no i who told you that she shot at him now feeling vulnerable completely exposed goosebumps erupted on her skin and she didntlike the feeling at all she wrapped her arms around herself in attempt to warm her body from the sudden cold that hit her skin it wasntthe actual cold of february the hallway they stood in was quite warm in fact but a chill that she felt suddenly around her creeping inside radiating from the walls from the air itself and into her body she couldnthelp but think that she went smaller in less than two seconds he might as well just step on her and finish it anything just to make this frost go away harry noticed her reaction saw her shiver felt her fear coming out in waves and crashing into him i sorry i didntmean to scare you i meant it a good thing she then felt as though sunshine was appearing behind grey clouds the warmth of his words felt nice somehow securing he did mean well she could tell his voice was honest she noticed she never heard him this honest before it was different that how she knew please all i want is one chance and i gone she said nothing simple gazing into air looking at nothing special she still refused to look at him not sure what she ll see or on the contrary what she will look like the bells chimed loudly signaling the start of the class harry couldntbelieve that fifteen minutes had gone by so slowly it looked like hours had passed since he walked after her into the loos and until this moment when they were together in the hallway he didntknow what she would say she changed so many times in those fifteen minutes the bells rang that it it was time she would give him her answer would she nod her head and say okay and then all the exhaustion all the chasings the pain and restless nights will be gone or would she turn away and say no for the last time he was sure he saw her head make the slightest of movements but couldntmake of it she shook her head more forcefully and a glint of apology in her eyes you already have someone she said in a cracked voice you dontneed me without further words she took off again to her class this time harry stayed put in the empty corridor with his shoulders slacked and feeling more of an idiot than he ever felt before it was time to go for dinner at the great hall but harry was too depressed to get out of his bed he lay on his back facing the green canvas ceiling of his four poster thinking how he could fix this situation he got himself into he couldntthink of anything he could do he knew he messed up enough and he didntthink there is a way to make it better the damage was done ginny had rejected him for the last time he sighed and pressed his palms to his eyes wishing it all was a dream and that he d wake up soon can you believe her blaise voice suddenly barked from the other side of the room who harry asked not really caring pansy that who blaise said furiously she sends me a letter and guess what it says harry groaned loudly argh i dont care he snapped silence fell through the room at once it appeared to be that blaise was speechless and in a state of shock at harry sudden outburst i sick of hearing of pansy i sorry i ever met her okay yeah so am i but blaise said slowly now looking carefully at harry are you okay he asked with wariness harry propped himself up on his elbows glaring at his friend just peachy he said sarcastically he got up from the bed and strode to the door but bumped into someone watch where you re going draco snapped harry pushed past him not sparing him another glance draco looked after him and then exchanged a questioning look with blaise at harry peculiar behavior and without even thinking too much about it they followed his track harry blaise called just when harry left the common room they quickly ran to catch up with him what happened what did pansy do to you harry let out a low growl only made my life miserable he muttered why draco asked i dontreally want to talk about it harry retorted he felt miserable knowing ginny was still sure he was with pansy it was one of the reasons she rejected him they reached the entrance hall and were about to go to dinner when a female voice called harry and he stopped groaning loudly he doesntneed this right now potter i d like to have a word with you hermione said from behind her voice sounding cold and official well that too bad mudblood draco interrupted before harry could even answer something inside harry snapped despite his lack of interest in what hermione had to say he still felt a twinge of anger when he heard how draco had just addressed her by he turned to look at his friend with a glare in his eyes draco had a winning smile plastered to his face hermione however looked offended by the comment luckily enough for her she appeared to be without ron for a change or else draco would have probably be facing the end of his wand by now dontcall her that harry ordered in a cool voice draco smile faltered his face twitching angrily and harry could hear blaise let out a long whistle and since when do you care how i call her draco demanded sounding insulted harry chose to ignore the question and stick to his defensive tone apologize to her now he said coolly hermione glanced between them unable to speak and not sure if it would be wise to interrupt them she just gaped at them blaise looked at them as well not sure what to say he remained silent himself i will not apologize to anyone draco insisted i dontknow what wrong with you today but i have the sudden feeling that you re not the person i used to know no harry said emphatically shoving an accusing finger into draco chest causing him to take a minor step back you re not the person i used to know draco gripped his wand tightly and shoved harry hand away with a look of disgust donttouch me blaise seemed to sense the danger approaching and flung himself between his two friends trying to separate them but harry was too mad he was sure he could burst out at any second and it will not look pretty he was sure he managed to remain clam but still as blaise touched harry chest while trying to keep him back from draco a sudden force erupted from harry body and blaise flew back and hit the floor hard with a struggled moan a crowd of students gathered around them in circle at the sight of blaize flying through the air all eager to watch a duel pushing hermione behind a gale of anxious whispers filled the hall harry pulled out his wand ready to defense himself in case draco will shoot a spell at him first you dontwant to fight me draco he warned oh that right draco chuckled mockingly they called you the best dueler in school didntthey i wonder if you were worthy of that name because i think you forgot who overcame you with your own technique back at christmas draco stood there proudly puffing his chest with a smug grin on his lips the crowd let out a mutual gasp harry shot him a fierce look you were under the imperius curse if you cantremember draco you werentyourself another loud gasp erupted from the crowd along with some murmuring and hurried whispers people covered their mouth as they spoke into the other ear it looked like all the air in draco lungs had gone at once for a second he resembled the small scrawny boy harry remembered him being the first time they met draco was nothing like that boy anymore harry knew he d grown up and so was his strength it was now draco turn to shoot him a deadly glare harry knew he went too far by telling the whole school what happened to draco especially when he made so much effort in keeping it quiet until now but it just came out of his mouth before he could give it a second thought how dare you draco screamed red sparks shooting out of his wand harry tightened his grip around his own you ve become nothing more than a a rotten gryffindor that what you are is that your best draco harry taunted causing draco to point his wand at his chest harry hadntmoved an inch enough with the house rivalries harry growled though gritted teeth you hate your father draco you dontwant to be like him to go in his way why do you still bother so much to hate gryffindors or muggle borns i still got my slytherin pride unlike you draco countered this is me the real me if you happened to have forgotten a true slytherin should honor his house to be proud to be chosen to be like the great salazar slytherin and you you are nothing like us you were different from the very beginning you never fitted in yet i made sure you wontfeel different i made you my friend and this is how you repay me harry was stunned draco hurtful words had stung him like knives he wasntsure what to say or if he should even say anything at all draco went on first you act like this then you defend mudbloods oh and yes let not forget how you fell in love with a weasley at that deadly silence fell about the room and harry felt himself freeze up his heart slowed down and he was sure it actually stopped beating completely all the air in his lungs had ran up in one single exhale and he was sure he was shrinking to the size of a house elf everything around him stood still and looked suddenly so big even the whispers from before had evaporated like smoke as his eyes shifted around slowly searching so slowly he thought he had aged in several years he found hermione gaze locked upon him peering from behind the crowd her own brown orbs were now quivering and rimmed with tears her face featured an apologetic expression then there was a soft sound much like a squeal and every head in the hall had turned around including harry s through a narrow gap in the crowd harry could spot a short redhead girl with a hand clapped to her mouth and wide brown eyes a blink of an eye later she turned on her heel and ran off harry hadntseen where to hermione turned around as well and disappeared after her a pained look crossed harry face and he bowed his head too ashamed to look at his surroundings at the revelation in front of the whole school he felt himself moving as he went harry caught a swift glimpse of a blonde girl wearing ravenclaw robes helping blaise get up from the floor blaise stood up and swayed on the spot before he caught his balance again he caught harry apologetic look and nodded understandingly not sure where his legs were taking him he pushed his way past the crowd and disappeared back into the dungeons not looking back at anyone else draco remained on his spot still looking resentful he may have shouted some more but harry hadntheard him or was it that refused to hear him harry hadntknown himself people started talking in whispers again as they made their way to dinner but harry didntcare it wasntthe first time they talked about him and it surely wouldntbe the last the clock by her bed was ticking too loudly she thought irritably as she lay awake in the dark shifting the red curtains aside and peering out at the annoying object she saw it was after one in the morning she groaned aloud too troubled to catch a good sleep she flung back into the bed staring into the nothingness surrounding her she lay in her bed since dinner time she didntfeel like talking to anyone at the moment she had wanted some time alone to contemplate what happened that night hermione had tried to get her to talk to her but gave up after ginny started to yell at her to leave her alone she even pretended to be asleep when her roommates entered the dormitory after dinner so they wouldntask her any questions now the steady breathing of her roommates did nothing but make her jealous she wanted to sleep to simply get away from everything that happened that day but her own body betrayed her by not being tired at all it was like she drank too much coffee the energy she held in her came out of nowhere and would not fade away she drummed her fingers anxiously as if waiting to something to happen but all she did was going over things in her mind that she couldntdeny or get away from anymore it was as though watching it all through a pensieve as the events swept upon her one after the other how they started a row the way he suddenly kissed her the smack of the slap when she hit his cheek still rang through her mind how she heard him tell snape that she put a spell on him and how good it felt when she rewarded him for it since then he wouldntleave her alone everywhere she went he was there in hallways in the library outside in the grounds in quidditch games the hospital wing the great hall in classrooms everywhere i t like i have a tail with its own name and its name is harry potter she remembered herself saying sometimes she couldnteven stand him he was an insufferable git it happened to be in times like when he hung around with his friends or kissed pansy parkinson in front of the whole school to see other times he could have been considered even as normal like when he came to apologize for the stupid things he did or when he was nice enough to come to her and return her the diary she d forgotten in the library or when he stood up for her in front of dean and when he complimented her and called her beautiful she remembered how he came to her that morning so determined that she would agree to his question to go out with him he wouldntlet it go he pressed and pleaded her to consider but all she did was to say no over and over she wasntsure why at the time but there was something sincere in his voice the way he acted now she knew that there was actually a chance that he really meant it ginny sighed if she had a galleon for every time someone asked her out this week she d had a fortune by now there was potter of course kris the ravenclaw boy hermione had warned her about who she would never consider of even letting him carry her books the mystery guy who was nice enough to send her letters and buy her a present but she didntforget that he also ditched her when he asked her to meet him and of course if you add dean neville michael and in case luna was right about something for a change colin too than she might as well open a dating service she remembered the note she found in lupin class and the christmas card when the mystery guy had called himself a secret santa and finally the letter she received from him this week asking her to meet him in the owlery she didntknow why but the word sorry suddenly popped into her head she frowned thinking why she would relate her secret admirer with this word do you forgive me it was his voice potter voice why would she remember it now i ve asked for your forgiveness oh you mean your stinky sorry ginny scratched her head still deep in thought suddenly she remembered ron saying something about seeing something in lupin class one day he wouldnttell her what he saw but now as she was reflecting on it she remembered that the next day she found the strange note in the same class could this be related to what ron saw in there she thought about the christmas card again then the letter she received a few days ago i tried a few times myself but you never spared me a glance you never took me seriously enough it read you just scared that it might actually work between us then malfoy voice spoke up with the words that still made her heart all flutter funnily every time she thought of it oh and yes let not forget how you fell in love with a weasley suddenly ginny head was spinning so fast that if the case was different and she wasntlying in bed she was sure she d have fallen to the ground she bolted upright in her bed like having just waked up from a nightmare her palms were sweaty her heart raced in her chest and her breathing were as heavy as ever she took a deep breath to calm herself as she pulled out her wand and a piece of parchment from underneath her pillow with a quick lumos charm a soft light flicked out of the tip of her wand she unfolded the slip of paper and stared at the words then she knew then she saw how everything made perfect sense every piece of the puzzle had come together and the whole picture stood clearly before her eyes it was the same handwriting it matched perfectly to the letter he sent her months ago asking her to forgive him for being so foolish after the quidditch game it was the same writing on the christmas card and on the strange letter from a few days ago that why she related him to the secret admirer they were the same person with an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach and the sudden urge to vomit any second harry entered the great hall on the following morning with his broom in his hand ready for today match as he d ever be he ignored the looks people shot at him and disregarded the longing in his chest to look over at the gryffindor table to see if she was there if she was one of those who were watching him other than that the room was buzzing with excitement of the approaching game students were chatting animatedly between themselves while having breakfast some were supporting banners and having painted their faces in their supported team colors harry felt like he couldnteven hold a bite of eggs and that after he hadnteven ate dinner the night before he was sure he d be sick if he just tried to put something in his mouth so as he sat down at his house table he settled for only a cup of steaming tea it looked like no one cared about the snowy weather that welcomed them this morning when it involved watching a quidditch game people were as cheerful as ever as he cast a glance around the room it was obvious which team the gryffindors and hufflepuffs were supporting giving for the banners and signs with the ravenclaw crest and witty sentences with pun and rhymes such as the lion roars when ravenclaw scores harry stomach grumbled whether it was with hunger or anxious he wasntsure he looked longingly at the various selection of delicious food displayed on the table before him he shook his head he d eat after the game was be over he was nervous because he knew it not going to be a simple match the weather was stormy like he d predicted and he knew his team still hadntacquired enough skill to play in such conditions his other teammates soon joined him in the table crabbe and goyle who to harry looked like they were getting bigger by the day stuffed their plates with everything within their reach as usual blaise was chatting with the other two chasers about how he thought they should play today only draco was sitting alone and quietly playing with the food in his plate harry secretly glanced at him wishing draco would look up and catch his gaze but he knew he was deliberately avoiding him he was still upset about the fight they had last night harry thought he should feel angry with his friend as well but he knew draco only said those things because he was hurt he knew some of them were true but there was no time to talk this over right now harry knew the pain was just too fresh to mend before the match will start he had already forgotten about everything draco had said last night but he knew for draco it was different he knew that no matter how much he apologized draco wouldntlisten the only thing harry was sorry about was revealing draco secret he wasntsorry for telling him what he thought and draco should know that seeing the ravenclaw team gathering up to leave for the pitch harry stood up as well and asked his teammates to join him together they walked to the changing rooms while harry tried to imagine how this game would turn out ginny wake up you re going to miss the match hermione voice rang behind the curtains of her bed ginny groaned in protest and pulled her duvet high above her head snuggling deeper into her pillow hoping that hermione voice would disappear lemme sweep mione she grumbled huskily she didntcatch much sleep last night and now after she finally did manage to doze off for a few hours hermione was disrupting her again hermione let out a chuckle fine i ll let you sweep later i ll even bring filch cleaning tools with me how about that not funny ginny snarled sleepily ginny come on you have just a bit more than twenty minutes to get ready and go down to the pitch or else you re going to miss everything and i know you wouldntwant that but i dontwant to get out it cold and my bed is so soft and warm ginny moaned hermione clicked her tongue shaking her head ginny you never missed quidditch because it was cold before now would you get out of there or do i have to pull you out myself i swear that if i forced to do that tickling will be included and it wontbe pleasant believe me ginny heaved a sigh hermione knew too well how ticklish she was and to her misfortune she took advantage of it she pushed the covers off herself and while still in bed she opened the curtains to see hermione standing in front of her four poster with a winning smile on her face fine you win ginny said short temperedly not pleased that hermione had won her over it just it too embarrassing to show myself at his game after what been said last night she added quietly rubbing her eyes off sleep her whole face flushed pink she wasntsure if she should tell hermione what she had discovered ginny you canthide forever you ll have to go out eventually besides since when do you care what people think hermione reasoned werentyou the one who taught me to just ignore everything and focus on myself only ginny sighed again and propped herself on her elbows you re right she said finally looking up at her friend i might as well face it now or i wontever have the guts to do it at all what can i say i a gryffindor after all that the spirit hermione said with a nod she extended her hands towards her redhead friend ginny caught them and hermione helped her get out of bed now you have five minutes to put some warm clothes on and get ready i ll wait for you in the common room ginny nodded and moved around the room in search for her clothes hermione crossed the room for the door but before she reached it she turned and looked back at ginny you know ron was on prefect rounds last night so he isntaware yet of what happened if it makes you feel any better and i also tipped off the boys not to say anything to him ginny smiled thankfully at her it does make me feel better at least he wontbreathe down my neck thank you and with a wave of goodbye hermione disappeared through the door five minutes later ginny joined her in the common room fully dressed and ready to go they went through the portrait hall and took a shortcut that would lead them straight to the entrance hall ginny stomach gave a loud grumble and she clutched it with her hands bugger i wish i had eaten something hermione stopped walking and looked at her questioningly would you mind saving me a seat i ll just grab a toast or something from the kitchens i ll try to do it as quickly as i can hermione smiled she didntseem to mind at all no problem i ll see you there she waved her goodbye and went out to the snowy grounds as ginny made her way to the kitchens she looked outside the windows and wrinkled her nose her team was lucky not to play in such weather she didntfancy flying in a snow storm freezing herself half to death while trying to find the tiny snitch as though reading her mind a burst of icy wind came out of an open window ginny fastened her cloak tighter to her body and continued her path when she reached the picture with the bowl of fruits a few minutes later she was about to tickle the pear but before she could do so the picture had swung open and outside emerged a group of five ravenclaws a few were holding trays of food and drinks the others held two baskets full of fresh red tomatoes the sniggered among themselves until they spotted that ginny was standing in their way as she took a good look at their faces she recognized one of them ginny he said surprised to see her kris hello she greeted surprised herself she felt her cheeks warm up what what are you doing here why arentyou at the match it about to begin yes we re just about heading there you arentcoming i hadnthad any breakfast so i thought i d grab something from here before going she explained she craned her neck to look behind him at his friends what with all the food anyway she asked curiously pointing at the trays well that he pointed at the fancy desserts and butterbeer bottles is for the after party we re having at out common room later i would ve invited you but he bent down to whisper in her ear a hint of amusement in his voice you see you re not in ravenclaw she took in a sharp breath feeling a bit uncomfortable with his closeness but still managed to chuckle lightly as he pulled away oh why are you so sure you re going to win she asked just as amused instead of answering her properly he simply laughed his friends joining him as well ginny secretly rolled her eyes and what about the tomatoes she asked indicating the basket in his hands his smile only brightened that is for the slytherins ginny frowned what do you mean for the past two days those snakes had been lurking on us in every corner wherever we went they stuck out their legs so we ll stumble and fall or they would shoot jinxes at us from behind our seeker cho chang had gone this morning to the hospital wing after she couldntstop hiccupping soap bubbles so now we prepared them a little revenge you see ginny looked stunned she knew some slytherins were slimy but never thought they would stoop down that low really she asked in astonishment so who playing as your seeker today kris looked smug as he always did well we cooked them a little surprised his name is lance hastings and i know it mean to say but i glad that chang cantplay today i just dontknow why he never tried out for the team because he fantastic one of kris friends cleared his throat loudly kris looked back at his mates for a second wordlessly telling them to go ahead before turning back to ginny well sorry love we ve got to go cheer for us yeah he reached his hand to caress her neck and think about what i said the other day okay i wonttake no that easily he added a cheeky wink before he ran down the hall to join his friends ginny shuddered at the feeling of his hand on her skin she held herself so she wouldntbe rude and flinch right before his eyes she touched the spot where his hand had traveled and she felt goosebumps appear on her skin now she realized why hermione had warned her not to go out with him he was a big git ginny ran her fingers around her neck suddenly feeling some sort of a string moving up and down her collar she reached for it and pulled out the pearl necklace she received for christmas she almost had forgotten that it was even there she let out a groan remembering what she found out last night it nagged her she knew she needed to do something about it she needed to go and talk to him when her stomach gave another angry grumble she finally stepped into the kitchen and asked an elated house elf for a piece of buttered toast she left with a puzzled face as her thoughts drifted off to different locations still thinking about her discovery she made up her mind she d go see him ask him everything she needed to know it was now or never looking at her watch and noticing the time she had less than ten minutes before the game started she broke in a run to the grounds barely aware of the heavy snowflakes falling down on her wetting her hair and soaking in her clothes she didntmind any of that however all she wanted right now was to solve this thing once and for all to confront him and hear him say exactly what she needed to hear she needed that strict answer she ran to the field the deafening shouts and cheers thundering in her ears reminding her that the game is only mere minutes away from getting started in the distance she could hear dennis creevey voice the commentator welcoming everyone she knew the teams would be out any minute now she sprinted to the changing rooms the soaked grass now covered with white patches of snow splashed as her feet hit it with every step she took it a fine cold day but i hope that the quidditch spirits will warm you up dennis called into the megaphone and madam hooch is calling the teams here comes the ravenclaws inside the hallway leading to the dressing rooms she could still make out the cheers of the crowd but quite muffled through the brick walls her own steps echoed in the small space strong wind blew in her hair from the open doorway at the other end of the corridor she spotted the ravenclaw team standing in a group together at the exit to the pitch they mounted their brooms and one after the other they soared outside as each of their names was called ginny needed to hurry before the slytherin team got out as well then the echo of voices filled the small passageway and a door to her right only about twenty feet ahead of her was pushed open and seven boys wearing green robes emerged through it holding brooms and quidditch gear the first leading them was a bespectacled black haired boy who was evidently scolding at the rest of his teammates you better win this game he said somewhat threateningly and it sounded as though it wasntthe first time he said it in the past hour now ravenclaw is already 40 points ahead of us but we can still change that i want you to score more points and not the whole winning will be based just on me catching the snitch i want all six of you there playing as hard as you can you hear me loud and clear captain blaise zabini muttered ginny stood behind breathless from her run and unnoticed as she watched silently as they walked closer and closer to the exit ready to fly out to the pitch dennis muffled voice was now introducing ravenclaw new seeker and hastings is looking quite ready to catch the snitch today for those who didnthear cho chang was unable to play today but it looks like hastings is a more than a fine substituted just look at him on that broom that boy can fly i must say it looks like ravenclaw knew what they were doing when they added him as a reserve wait what was that zabini suddenly asked sounding outraged did you hear that harry they ve got a new seeker those bastards where the hell is that chang girl at that crabbe and goyle snickered to themselves oh great what did you do harry asked the two of them they simply shrugged but still held a satisfied smile on their fat ugly faces ginny who was too nervous they ll be gone before she ll get the guts to do what she came here for took a deep breath packed up her courage and cleared her throat loudly erm excuse me pot um harry she stuttered unsure of what name to call him by she didntknow why she decided to choose his first name instead of his last like she normally would she expected it to sound strange that her voice somehow will quiver but it came out nice and smooth and it surprised her that it didntsound strange at all seven intimidating and curious faces looked back at her harry eyes had widened in surprise since he didntexpect to see her she felt uncomfortable at their stares and her face warmed up she knew that compare to their muscular figures she must look too small and scrawny what she doing here malfoy leaned over to blaise and hissed in his ear blaise smiled brightly probably came to kiss him good luck he muttered back harry who apparently heard them cast a narrow glance their way before he pushed his way past them an intrigued look on his face what is it he asked her coolly as though not sure what else he could say to her it was funny just yesterday he chased her around and wouldntshut up and now he was shy because he was around other people she wondered if maybe he was only trying to look macho around his friends did they know how he had talked to her just a day ago ginny shifted her weight from one foot to another still feeling nervous and shaky maybe it was due the fact that her hair was full of snow her jeans were drenched with freezing water and wind blew all around her or maybe it was only because she could finally have her answers he was looking at her too intensely for her to speak clearly and confidently i i need to talk to you she said breathlessly harry seemed to ponder this for a second dennis was now calling for their team and a small amount of cheers mixed with a vast of catcalls had followed his voice harry looked hesitantly back at his waiting impatient teammates before he looked back at her harry they re calling for us blaise said i know go one by one i ll be right after you it will only be a minute harry replied his back now to them malfoy looked affronted there no way we re he started aggressively it not something to argue about draco just do it harry countered cutting him mid sentence malfoy looked as if he was about to kill he shot a nasty glare at harry but zabini put a hand on his shoulder pulling him to the exit with the rest of the team harry looked at his retreating team and bounced on the balls of his feet slowly he looked back down at ginny face his features softening from a frown at once i know you want to talk but can this wait after the game no she thought fiercely to herself it can t i waited too long for this and i going to get my answers now and to sod with the bloody game but she nodded instead sure i ll wait for you out here after the game if that okay that fine she nodded again just one nod to confirm her agreement he lingered a second more just looking at her then turned around without another word and hopped on his broom and flew outside just in time when his name was called the game could never have gone any worse they had never played this terrible in all the years harry been on the team harry was so angry that he didntsay even one word to his team when they went back to the changing rooms after the game had ended 210 70 to ravenclaw of course he took a warm shower while trying to clear his mind off his anger but he couldntshake the feeling off his shoulders draco did it on purpose harry thought with a frown he obviously was still mad at harry from the previous night events he let the quaffle enter the goal posts several times pretending he didntsee it coming his way and harry had called a time out all he could do was to shout at draco that it was not fair for the rest of the team to lose points just because he was angry at him and that he shouldntlet personal matters effect a quidditch game draco hadnteven listened blaise too had played poorly today he seemed unfocused all during the match his throws were too soft and he collided into someone else at least three times he never even once had managed to score the quaffle harry had guessed it was all because he had a row with julia just before the game which harry had witnessed they had fought about who she should support in this game apparently she was confused about it since she was in ravenclaw house but dated a slytherin harry also knew he couldntjudge the poor performance of any of his teammates without being angry at himself as well he knew all too well that he wasntas focused on the game as he should have been all he could think about was the short encounter he had with ginny just before he flew into the pitch he wondered why all of the sudden she wanted to talk to him instead of searching for the tiny golden ball he was flying around without any actual desire to play without even noticing the game was over as the ravenclaw seeker had caught the snitch the weather didnthelp them much either the bludgers crabbe and goyle aimed at the ravenclaw chasers lost their track thanks to the blowing wind and accidentally they hit one of their own players nearly knocking him off his broom and finally the ravenclaws had started throwing tomatoes at them resulting yet another pause in the game as madam hooch blew hard on her whistle and dumbledore mcgonagall flitwick and snape had all come to separate a large group of ravenclaw and slytherins who started to shoot hexes at each other after harry finished his shower got dressed in his regular clothes he grabbed his broom and stepped outside out in the hall he could hear blaise and julia having yet another row she didntlooked quite pleased with blaise and had slapped him on the cheek and quickly stormed out after he accidentally had said something really nasty to her harry was on the verge of a quick getaway wanting nothing but to avoid his teammates or any other slytherins for that matter he was just about to escape from this place when a small figure appeared in front of him for a second he had forgotten that he agreed to meet her after the game he halted and looked down at her not saying anything is it a bad time she asked in a small voice her slender fingers fidgeting anxiously i mean i know you lost and that you re probably not in the mood to talk right now i understand really if you dontwant to do this he shook his head he really wanted to hear what she had to say yes you re timing couldnthave been any worse but we can still talk not here though she gulped hard nodding nervously silently they walked back into the castle they found a vacant bench in a nearby hallway which was thankfully deserted and they sat together still not sharing a word or a glance with each other harry wasntsure if he should speak first he didntknow what to say he glanced up at her wanting to ask her what she wanted from him to urge her to start but he was transfixed by her beauty by her closeness there were snowflakes in her hair dotting it in white her face was flushed pink and her gaze was focused on her lap you have snow in your hair was all he could say it slipped off his mouth without even realizing it then she looked up a puzzled expression on her face she reached with her hands to her silky red hair trying to brush it off when she thought she had everything cleared off he noticed she missed a spot right there he pointed at the still lingering flakes when she didntfind them he slowly and cautiously reached out and cleared them off the touch of her soft hair on his fingers was heavenly and he resisted the urge to run his fingers through the length of it thank you she said sheepishly and if it was possible her cheeks turned a brighter shade of red he thought it will be wise to break off the tension by making her talk so what is it that you wanted to talk about she sighed i was thinking how i should put it so it wontsound different from what i intended so i ll just ask it what is it he pressed gently she looked him straight in the eyes when she spoke why did you ask me out harry honestly didntexpect her to ask this question not sure what to say his mouth let out only incoherent stuttering i i why why do you ask just answer me please i is it because of this she asked and then she reached into her robe pocket and a second later she pulled out something brownish and wrinkly harry took a sudden intake of breath when he realized what it was and she must have noticed it because she than said what is your connection to this note he wasntsure if he didntknow what to say or just couldn t all he knew was that his throat had betrayed him and went completely dry every word he wanted to say will not perform a sound if he opened his mouth she didntwait for him to reply for she pressed on unfolding the note and looking at it carefully he looked down at it remembering the last time he saw it when it was smooth and new this note did you write it is it yours he shifted his head away from her unable to look at her as a pained expression crossed his face his voice was unlike his own throaty and dry what if i tell you that yes it is mine would you believe me or would you just laugh at my face and reject me again it doesntmatter anymore ginny it over it in the past now you rejected me enough times for me to give up on this surreal dream that something could ever work between us she remained silent harry was sure she was chocked with tears for she had wiped her eyes with the back of her hand she only emitted a lonely sniff harry reached for the pocket in his robe his fingers clutched something square and thin fumbling with it for a moment while thinking if it would be wise to give it to her here take it he said finally as he pulled it out and threw it at her lap standing up at once without another look back at her he strode down the hall and disappeared behind a corner leaving her sitting on the bench alone she watched him leave with tears in her eyes she let out another loud sniff through her freckled nose and looked down at the thing that landed in her lap another note though this one seemed the same size of the one she kept with her it looked quite old but untouched like it never been opened more than once or twice she carefully unfolded it not sure what to expect to find in it as her eyes scanned the words and the handwriting her heart filled with emotion and a lonely feeble sob escaped her lips this note was an identical copy of the one she had carried around with her the one she had found months ago in lupin classroom inside this new note were written six familiar words which she now remembered by heart i in love with ginny weasley she wouldnttake it she wouldntlet him walk away like that he cantjust toss a note like that confirming what she had suspected and disappear he cantleave her to just deal with it as if nothing happened ginny stood up from the bench and followed his path around the corner the hallway she had walked into was deserted how did he disappear so quickly she wondered to herself where did he go checking behind every door in the hallway she was about to give up on looking for him when she reached the last one pressing down the handle and pushing the door open she found him there in a vacant classroom looking out through a window into the view of the frozen lake with his back to her he didntlook back but by sharp intake of breath and the way his shoulders tensed she knew he had sensed it was her when she had entered the room even before the door shut behind her she walked closer slowly not sure what she would say you followed me he said quietly it was not a question but a statement well you re not the only one who allowed to follow people around this school she said half amusedly he chuckled softly i guess you re right he said still looking out the window but there no reason for you to be here i still hadntgot all my answers she explained he didntmove and she stayed behind but not too far yet not too close softly she let the words escape her mouth again so this is not a joke i take it he shook his head slowly and looked down at his feet no i may have done stupid pranks before but i would never joke about something like this so you wrote it because you meant it of course i still mean it are you serious his head looked up from the ground to the ceiling and it appeared to her that it took him a great deal to not burst out at her again another intake of breath and he turned his head to the side his body still not moving and he looked at her from the corner of his eyes never been more serious in my whole life she felt herself choke up again not believing what she was hearing it seems so hard for her to process she started to play with her necklace absentmindedly so it was you all along you sent me the letters and the necklace she said quietly he turned back to the window and nodded again i did and it looks as good on you as i thought it would when i first saw it he said peacefully harry forced his legs to turn around and face her completely she was getting closer now and for a moment he thought she was floating her footsteps were so soft he couldnthear them clicking on the marble floor ginny hadntknown what had drawn her nearer to him but she felt her blood run fast in her veins and that was enough for her she looked down at their feet and noticed she was mere inches away from him when she hadntsaid anything in return harry gulped noticeably packed up his courage and reached out to hold her cheek i love y but then she moved away at his touch and looked down again unsure of what had caused her to do it it was a strange new feeling she had never experienced before harry thought he saw a stray tear roll down her cheek and fall to the floor but the room was getting darker by the moving of the grey clouds to cover the winter sun so he wasntsure if he had witness it at all she turned her back to him again i sorry i don t his hand which he held in midair fell down and so did his heart he was so stupid how could he actually think she will return his feelings after all the things he said and done to her he expected her to say she loved him back no i sorry forget what i said he said and he tried to push her away and walk to the door but she had suddenly managed to get his wrist in her hand before he would take off and disappear again and he stopped wait dont dontleave her voice sounded somewhat pleading and he wondered why why he asked with pain in his voice he refused to look at her he didntwant to witness the pity in her eyes why do you even want to speak to me after everything i ve done to you why are you here trying to talk to me and look me in the eye i dontdeserve been spoken to by you i deserve to be kicked up the arse or been slapped or hexed but instead you re standing here in front of me with your your pretty long red hair and your chocolate brown eyes and that innocent face you got and still you re here why because she tried but something stopped her why harry pressed more firmly and loudly she didntsay anything and he was tired of waiting for an answer there in the empty classroom like some sort of an idiot he tried to wrench his wrist away from her grip but she was surprisingly stronger than he thought suddenly she pushed him back against the window his head hit the hard cold glass with an echoing clunk and he was about to call out in pain until suddenly he couldntsee anything he couldntthink of anything and he felt his whole body freeze what happened suddenly registered in his fogged mind and he felt his body begin to warm up inside as he felt her soft lips pressed hard against his softly moving encouraging him to return the kiss he slowly closed his eyes and obligingly gave in to her it was like he was lying in a field full of flowers on a sunny spring day the warm feeling filled him up from head to toe and it was a purely amazing feeling the touch of her lips was so soft he thought he was sure he was dreaming this couldntbe real that all his head was telling him she felt too good to be true and smelled incredibly intoxicating if this was truly a dream than he never want to wake up he wanted it to last for eternity but eventually she was one who broke apart first he thought he heard himself let out a protesting moan but all his attention was on her and he couldntget his mind to stop spinning you can open your eyes now she said her voice rougher than before but there was still a hint of amusement to it he realized his eyes were indeed still closed and when he felt her hands caress his cheeks he opened them to see a small satisfied grin on her lips she looked absolutely beautiful like that her eyes heavy lidded and her lips still slightly parted looking glossy from their kiss i was afraid you were going to slap me again he confessed and she giggled she shook her head and then pressed her forehead to his and let out a sigh as she hugged him around his neck his hands slowly traveled around the small of her back and he held her tight i sorry about before she whispered i didntknow what to think i was so confused i didntmind hearing you say it but it suddenly became real and i was scared and when i realized i really hurt you i shh he whispered back just as softly and he caressed her hair savoring the amazing feeling of finally having her in his arms it okay you donthave to say anything it all forgotten he realized words were not important right now just being like this with her told him everything he wished to hear for so long say it again she said quietly as if afraid to speak aloud he knew what she meant and he held her face in his hands just like he wanted to do before and he made her look in his eyes making sure she will know it was true this time she did not turn away from his touch i love you i love you ginny weasley so much now the tears he thought he saw earlier came to well in her eyes but he knew those were happy tears very different from the ones he saw escaping her eyes the night he first kissed her i wanted him to be you all along you know this secret admirer i wished it would be you i thought of so many guys that he could be but i never wanted any of them but you to be him and then you came to my house and started to flirt and you almost kissed me i almost gave in to you right then and after i saw you playing chess with bill something snapped i dontknow why i guess i expected all my brothers to hate you and i was surprised bill did see this good side in you that i see right now he didntsay anything but just tightened his grip on her body never wanting to let her go he was scared she was the one who was playing a big joke on him and that any second now she would push him with a big mocking smile on her face and start laughing at him her brother would come in with a camera and snap a few pictures of his bewildered face having a laughing fit at the scene but none of that happened and she stayed embraced securely in his arms for long before he wanted to make sure this really wasnta trick the soft flowery scent of perfume entered his nose and he planted little kisses on her cheek as he spoke so does this means you ll go out with me now and he felt her smile broadly at the innocence of his words a n a few things i would like to add 1 this story doesntend here of course there are a few more chapters to go 2 i sure some of you have noticed that i changed the summary for this story the old one just didntfit anymore 3 i already started writing the next chapter it wontbe as long as this one was but i still dontknow when i will finish it hopefully it will be less than ten months this time anyway that was chapter 16 you ve all been waiting for now please tell me what you think your opinions are really important to me disclaimer i dontown harry potter big a n thank you for all the wonderful supportive reviews they really made me happy since i feeling rather gloomy for the past few months one thing i want to talk about is that people tend to forget that i started this story before hbp came out and in case you started reading this story just recently check up the date i first posted it and see for yourself so the character of blaise zabini in this story isntthe same as the one j k rowling introduced us to in hbp my blaise isnta dark italian bloke he in fact the complete opposite from jkr description he pretty skinny i guess and he has longish wavy dark brown hair and even though he in slytherin he pretty mischievous but yet he very shy and he also has relatives in ireland so i now hope i made it clearer for you now for this chapter there a lot of h g and r hr in here fluff mixed with angst donthate me on this one please hope you enjoy also i ve added a poll to my profile please go and vote the results will affect the ending of the story so it all up to you chapter 17 broken promises with a great buzz in his chest and the feeling of his blood rushing faster than ever harry let out a long sigh reluctant to admit it he finally whispered his voice soft and barely audible it getting late running his hand lightly up and down her forearm he also pointed out it already dark outside ginny looked out of the window from their nook on the floor and gazed at the bright stars she could hear a faint hoot of an owl from afar she had been living in the magical world for sixteen years and probably saw everything a person could ever imagine and even more but this day was nothing compared to charms breaking out from a wand or flying on a broomstick this day having spent most of it in harry arms had been the most magical day she had ever experienced in her life earlier after what seemed like a good ten minutes of snogging they d realized they were still standing pressed to the cold window pane in the same vacant classroom they found themselves in after the game despite the many chairs and desks in the room which they could have used harry removed his cloak and spread it on the floor like a blanket and cast a quick cushioning charm so they would have something warm and more comfortable to sit on while ginny back was pressed tightly to harry chest they were leaning against the teacher desk and she refused to hold onto the fact that it was time for them to say goodbye for the day just five more minutes she murmured and buried her head underneath his chin she then felt his chest shaking under her while he chuckled and squeezed her shoulders with a firmer touch i afraid to say it but we do need to get back i sure people are starting to wonder where you have gone off to yet after saying that he remained snuggled with her on the floor the feeling of her this close to him felt almost unreal and he was afraid that any moment now with a blink of an eye it would all disappear he was glad though that even hours later the scene hadntchanged on the contrary it had only got better and you wontbe missed by anyone she asked innocently running her fingertips over the back of his hand and causing his skin to give a slight shudder she smiled when she felt a spot of goosebumps erupt to his skin he let out a snort which made her chuckle at the sound of it i doubt it she pulled her head from the warmth of his neck and looked up to him a mingled expression of concern and confusion in her brown eyes how come well maybe only by blaise i dontknow draco and i arenton speaking terms at the moment you know after last night fiasco in the entrance hall and my slip up i really dontblame him ginny looked stunned at him he was as much of a prat as far as i ever remember him being harry bowed his head and sighed he pulled back from her and straightened his clothes he deserved that harry i dontknow if you ve realized it yet ginny but he my best friend harry said as he got up on his feet he extended his hand for her to take and helped her stand up and with a wave of his wand he cleaned the dust off his cloak and wrapped it back around himself after a moment of silence between them he sighed again let not talk about it anymore shall we she nodded understandingly and reluctantly changed the subject it nearly time for dinner want to head down to the great hall sure he smiled and extended his hand which she took without hesitation the small gesture felt nice she never thought she would be holding hands with him she smiled when she saw their entwined fingers and felt warmth spread through her arm and all over her body everything was going well but at the moment when they reached the entrance hall harry paused suddenly and awkwardly let go of her hand ginny immediately missed the feeling of his touch you know i not really that hungry anymore you go ahead inside i ll go back to my common room he said ginny looked at him confused looking from his face to his hands which he shoved quickly into his pockets she tried to think what might have caused him to change his mind so abruptly she settled her gaze back on his face and frowned slightly when she noticed he had backed a couple of steps away from her erm okay i guess i ll see you tomorrow he nodded and flashed a smile which disappeared a moment later she was positive she saw the faintest tint of a blush on his cheeks but he instantly looked down at his feet so it could have been only her imagination he meant to turn around and she stopped him with her gryffindor courage and slight cheek in her voice donti at least get a goodnight kiss she said he chuckled again and looked up at her seeing her stick out her bottom lip out and playfully faking a pout he couldntresist the temptation growing in the pit on his stomach with a genuine smile he walked back to her leaned down and kissed her lightly on the cheek his lips barely brushing her skin goodnight love before ginny could react to him he had pulled away a smile still on his face have have sweet dreams she managed to say as sweetly as she could master as she tried not to sound as shocked as she was oh i will he said and with a wink he turned his back on her and walked towards the dungeons trying all she might to convince herself that his sudden change in attitude was only because of the new change in their relationship was a new and exciting as it was to her she shook her head and forced herself to focus on the good memories they had created together today and where exactly have you been all day hermione inquired when they climbed through the portrait hole ron and i were worried sick ginny smiled faintly as she remembered what harry had said earlier about people searching for her hey what that smile for hermione asked again before ginny could reply to her first question her eyes narrowed to slits what did you do what i cantbe happy anymore ginny replied and a second later hermione made a loud gasp and her hand went to her cheek resembling a fish she opened and closed her mouth several times and before she could say anything ginny had cut her off hey what going on there she had pointed out to a gathering of people around the notice board she walked hurriedly to join the crowd with hermione following her every step and saw a notice of a new hogsmeade trip set for the next weekend ginny saw lavender and parvati backing from the group giggling as seamus finnigan passed by them and was reminded briefly of the time before the yule ball normally she would just roll her eyes at a sight just as that but today events had made her feel giddy herself this would be a perfect opportunity to go on her first official date with harry spinning on her heel she walked back to the sitting area and took a seat in a large armchair by the fire hermione who was still walking after her sat in the corner of the couch the closest to ginny and continued to gape at her what ginny asked innocently faking annoyance although she knew perfectly well why hermione was gawking at her tell me everything that happened hermione said in an undertone ginny had made her best imitation of a thinking face well there not much to tell luna and i went for a stroll with hagrid around the forbidden forest we saw two unicorns and one crumple horned snorkack i was really surprised at first to see one i thought luna bless her made them up ginny stop it hermione suddenly barked and ginny couldnthelp herself but to roll around in laughter come on tell me you re all glowing ginny eyes widened and she laughed again glowing you re overdoing it hermione hermione muttered angrily under her breath and meant to pull out her wand next and in seeing her doing so ginny waved her hands in defense okay okay i ll tell you there no need to exaggerate less than five minutes later after ginny had finished her story hermione had shrieked jumped from her place on the couch and flung her arms around ginny in a hug truly happy for her best friend only one problem though ginny said suddenly after hermione had settled down her expression changing into more of a sad grimace i think he might be regretting it hermione eyes went as wide as saucers what do you mean ginny looked uncomfortably at the roaring fire in the hearth maybe i just worrying myself i dontknow what happened everything went fine and we started talking but he suddenly went all shy and distant i dontknow what might have caused him to change like that i dontremember doing anything wrong but then she thought back on their wonderful day together although what ginny cringed and sighed merlin i so stupid ginny buried her head in her hands and mumbled out he completely opened up to me told me that he loved me and i said nothing back maybe he understands hermione offered maybe he doesntwant to rush you wants to give you time or maybe he doesntcare he might have been just tired you know after all the snogging you put him through today hermione said cheekily ginny chuckled and shoved her playfully by the shoulder shut up she said with a giggle and was glad that hermione was there to make her feel better making herself believe that maybe her best friend was right yet again she promised herself to deal with all consequences in the morning somehow before she went to bed she managed to ignore the troubling feeling that there was something weird with the way harry had acted earlier as harry stepped into the common room the first thing he saw was blaise sitting alone in one of the high backed chairs staring blankly in the fire as he walked closer to him he noticed he held a tissue pressed to his nose and it was soaked with blood merlin what happened harry asked worriedly as he hurried to his friend and sat next to him to take a closer look at his face julia happened blaise muttered sullenly and he picked up his wand tapped the currently red tissue paper and a second later it was a clear white again he wiped his nose with it as it started to drench with blood again the stupid cow hit me with a trip jinx and i stumbled and broke my nose and now the damn thing wontstop bleeding needless to say is that we arenttogether anymore but that a new record you see we lasted what three whole days that more than i ever got to be with anyone i sorry harry said honestly he was suddenly filled with guilt about the wonderful day he had with ginny blaise waved him off no i sorry i should have listened to you harry maybe you re right maybe i was better off with you cantknow that harry cut him you followed your heart you did what you thought would make you happy blaise looked miserably at the fire and it didntand i ended up alone harry looked around the common room and suddenly an idea popped to his mind you can still win her back he said with a crooked smile not julia i mean pansy blaise simply looked at him a blank expression on his tissue cloaked face really how take her out on a date harry said simply blaise snorted and that was something he probably shouldnthave done because a second later he cried out in pain and pinched his nose oww he muttered under his breath and wiped at his nose again with his now that a great idea harry he snapped and sniffed deeply once more he slammed his hand to his knee as he pushed himself up from his chair and started walking about the room why couldnti think of that before oh maybe because i already know she wonteven think twice to look my way again harry rolled his eyes and got up from his chair as well so he could match blaise eye level fine do what you think is best i just saying that it still early and you can still save the situation between you two with the bit of tact you still have that rich harry really to make fun of me like that while i feeling down no i mean it because i ve just lost my last shred of dignity harry looked around once again and pointed at the notice board look there your chance another hogsmeade trip if you act all mushy and loving around her she might agree to go out with you next weekend blaise walked closer to the board and read the notice that was pinned to it you think so i know so harry said emphatically and even if she doesn t one day when you become rich and successful she ll come around he added jokingly blaise smiled what will i do that will make me rich harry considered this for a second you ll sell travel books in a small muggle shop along with an old man with a bad spitting habit blaise chuckled again and wiped his nose once more finding it had finally stopped bleeding and how will that make me rich exactly harry tried his best to look serious and not burst out laughing as they sat back on the couch oh it won t but then you ll win the lottery and buy your own travel agency and why in the muggle world because a wizarding travel agency will make you go bankrupt why would you wizards and witches pay to travel around the world when they can use a portkey apparate or simply floo harry couldnthelp but chuckle by now and blaise joined him heartily after calming down they sat in a comfortable silence each of them with their own thoughts i ll ask her tomorrow blaise said finally i would give it at least a day or two before asking first thing would be apologizing to her tomorrow you ll do something nice you know like write her how you feel or even send her a flower i found out girls like that stuff oh yeah like it worked for you blaise asked mockingly avoiding blaise gaze harry smiled contently despite the comment exactly like it worked for me for a moment harry thought blaise hadntheard him it took about a whole minute before the words finally sank in him wait what do you mean still leaning against the couch harry simply tore his gaze from the fire and looked briefly at his shocked friend before turning to look at the fire again as if finding it more interesting than what he was about to say yeah i didntwant to say anything before while you were still sulking over julia but i kind of have a new girlfriend now blaise looked even more stunned if it was possible no way you re telling me you finally managed to catch the weasley fish harry smile faded hey ginny not a fish despite himself he couldnthelp but let the smile grow back on his lips as his mind wandered around to think about her face and how beautiful she was and how sweet she tasted on his lips but yes we re finally together blaise looked impressed good for you now all you have to do is patch things up with draco and your life couldntbe more perfect at the mention of draco name harry grunted argh dontremind me where is the git now dunno haventseen him since the match but i guess he should come back any time now curfew is due soon and what am i suppose to tell him i still stand by what i said i know and i agree with you but you have to accept the fact that this is how he is and that he having a really hard time right now we re still his best friends and we need to help him get past it even if he is being a git in the process damn i hate it when you re right harry muttered under his breath it was ten minutes later when draco finally walked into the common room with crabbe and goyle by his side harry immediately stood up and draco stopped to look at him and blaise who remained seated on the couch but turned his head around to look at him back his nose had finally stopped bleeding but he had nasty dark bruises underneath his eyes what do you want draco spat at harry if this is about the game you know damn well i wasntthe only one who played badly today harry shook his head earnestly this isntabout the game i think we need to talk about last night the look draco gave him next made harry feel as though draco was looking at him like some sort of a stranger potter draco said quietly and harry knew he only called him that because he was truly angry as far as i concerned after last night we arentfriends anymore we are housemates teammates classmates whatever and that it i canthave someone acting for six years like he my friend and then stab me in the back just because he cantaccept me for who i am without saying more he turned and walked towards the boys dormitories not even giving harry a chance to say a word harry watched him walk off angrily with crabbe and goyle stomping behind like his two bodyguards it was quite rare when the two of them had a real argument even after six years of knowing each other harry wasntfamiliar with the new stabbing feeling he felt in his chest it was hard to think about it but he actually feared that there was no way to fix things between them this time after having a restless night he thought noting would make the next day easier for him but everything seemed so much brighter when he saw ginny approach him the next morning as he exited the great hall hi she said with a smile when she finally reached him her hands immediately reached for his and instantly a rush of warmth spread through his body when he touched her and he felt much better hi he greeted back as cheerfully as he could despite the circumstances i didntsee you at breakfast is everything all right she asked with slight concern to her voice harry shook his head and watched as her eyes changed into a more serious expression but it is now that you re here he tried to light up the somber mood ginny eyes bore into his searching for some answer oh do you want to talk about it maybe he shook his head again and looked down at their joined hands not really ginny felt him starting to get away from her again she looked at him closely waiting for him to look back at her why are you avoiding me she asked quietly his head immediately snapped up and his green eyes met her brown ones what i not her gaze only intensified yes you are ever since last night when we left for dinner i dontknow why you re doing this but i wish you wouldn t if you re regretting us getting together then just say so a moment later she realized that she might have said it a little too briskly but it was too late to take it back his grip on her hands loosened and he dropped her hands suddenly but she wasntsure if it was because she was too harsh towards him or because she was right about him avoiding her the look on his face only told her that she was completely wrong with her suspicions as it simply reflected a total shock harry mouth dropped slightly and he wondered why she would think that i don t her voice intensified by the second and she couldntstop herself so it because i didntsay that i loved you back isntit or maybe it because you re ashamed to be with me that you dontwant people to see us together what the hell are you on about that not true at all ginny he protested matching her tones i dontknow where did you come up with all of this but i really not in the mood for all these false accusations okay i ve had enough of fighting with people this week and the last thing i want to do is to fight you too the look of surprise mixed with guilt showed evidently on ginny face she felt incredibly stupid and selfish of course this was about him how could she ever think differently not everything was supposed to involve her harry she said quietly once again i m i sorry i didntknow well now you do he said his voice strained but softening a bit and like i already said i dontwant to talk about it so let just drop it okay he ran his hand through his thick messy hair and what was this all about anyway why would you even think that i regretted being with you she looked down and shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other i sorry but i didntknow what to think everything was going great until we went to dinner and then i felt like you changed your mind and searched for a reason to back out i guessed that i panicked and jumped to the wrong conclusions and thought about myself only i so stupid no you re not harry said clearly he wrapped his arms around her securely and pulled her into a warm embrace right there in the middle of the hall he didntcare if the whole school saw for him they were there alone and this was their private moment together and dontever let me hear you say it again about yourself you ginny weasley are the most brilliant he said with a kiss to her forehead sweet another kiss this time to her closed eyes beautiful the tip of her nose was next caring and finally a longer one on her lips and the strongest witch i ve ever met i dontcare if anyone hears this because i not ashamed of anything that is concerning you i will scream it from the rooftops if that what i need to do in order to convince you she leaned her forehead on his chest feeling his heart drum fast and chuckled lightly and he smiled at the sweet sound i just love you so much she suddenly stiffened in his arms and she hoped he didntsense it hearing him say that was still so surreal to her harry about that she started hesitantly and her voice trailed off not sure how she should put it so he wonttake offense by it what he promoted her gently she took a deep breath and let it all out it just that you say you love me so easily and i know you mean it but i haventeven said it back yet i not sure that i you re too good for me ginny i dontwant you to feel that you are obligated to say it just because i did you have to mean it and i want you to take your time until you do you ll say it when you re ready believe me it took me awhile to admit it to myself it didntcome right away she couldntbelieve how lucky she was to have him she simply couldntbelieve it was all real how she had ever mistaken him for being any different he was so good to her and here she thought that he deserved better that she wasntenough she didntknow what she did to have him but she was more than glad for it thank you i should ve realized how wonderful you are from the start he chuckled and ran his hands up and down her back and she loved the soothing feeling this small gesture had brought on her she buried her face in his shoulder and sighed contently savoring every feeling every touch every moment of it i wouldntsay that i was a prat at the start dontyou remember i couldnteven stand you and you couldntstand me either well that was until i kissed you i kissed you back she said somewhat shyly and harry couldnthelp but chuckle again and she joined him realizing what was so funny yeah now you admit it he said amusedly then he turned serious again you know i meant every word that night well only the good ones he added once he remembered how they screamed their lungs at each other that night when they served that detention together you did not he smiled i did and when i told snape that you put a spell on me well that was kind of true too it was you your spell and i still under it why potter are you trying to sweet talk me she asked and raised her head to look up at him his eyes shone brightly when he looked back at her it depends is it working he asked cheekily a grin on his lips umm no he nodded and his smile only widened when he caught her lie umm yes he mimicked he leaned down and caught her lips in his with another kiss just when he thought that things can progress into something a bit more than a quick kiss she gently pushed him away and backed half a step from him he realized that he let out a protesting moan once she tore her lips from his and he fought the horrible blush that threatened to appear on his cheeks i need to ask you to do something for me she said at once and when he saw the serious look in her eyes all thoughts of protesting and continuing the kiss had fled away what is it she reached her hands to his robes and played with the button holes while she talked i hadnthad the chance to tell my brother about us yet harry immediately caught on and nodded understandably oh and you re worried he going to freak out if he catches us together freak out would be an understatement i d say she said he just doesntknow that you changed and how good you are like i do and i thought that that you might want she trailed off wishing desperately for him to get the message only this time when she looked at him he had a frown on his face that i might want what he asked she gulped rather obviously and looked over his shoulder trying to avoid his eyes while she finished her sentence might want to go and ask him for his permission to date me she said rather quickly harry eyes nearly popped out of their sockets what why would i do it why cantyou do it he your brother she shifted on her feet again and bit her lip nervously yes but if it comes from you he ll see that you re serious about us and he might change his mind or hex me into a million bits of tiny pieces harry offered ginny waved him off oh he wontdo such thing ginny he growled in protest harry she called and then she did the most adorable thing which he couldntbelieve that this cheap trick was actually working on him puppy dog eyes please she batted her eyelashes at him for me why do we even need his permission anyway because this is the only way we can go out without me feeling guilty about it he groaned oh all right even though he felt extremely nervous about it he knew there was nothing else in the world that was worthier than the smile she just flashed at him oh thank you thank you thank you she called cheerfully and threw her arms around his neck nearly toppling them both over and she peppered his face with small kisses until he caught her lips again and drew her into a passionate kiss much more passionate than the one she had stopped a minute ago a sudden wolf whistle had ruined the moment and they broke apart looking around for the source of such rude behavior when they saw who it was harry palms began to sweat and ginny felt a large lump rise in her throat at what happened next so ron the hufflepuff game is coming in two weeks worried much dean had asked when the four roommates had made their way out from the great hall ron simply snorted in mockery worried should i be the hufflepuffs are wimps nothing but a piece of cake he said proudly ah so you re must be more worried about ravenclaw then please are you serious we eat ravenclaw with ketchup ron answered the cup is ours i have nothing to worry about but they did beat slytherin seamus pointed out neville sniggered at that and seamus smiled widely ron lowered his head before replying anyone beats slytherin our team didn t neville said matter of factly ron blushed scarlet whether that was from embarrassment or from anger neither of them knew yeah well that was supposed to be our victory snape must have said something to dumbledore to pick his house okay forget that seamus tried to lighten the mood ravenclaw got a new seeker remember what are you going to do about him he a temp he playing until cho chang is out of the hospital wing ron explained dean shook his head that not what i heard chang out for good ron stopped abruptly in place and looked back at dean as though he just told him the most mortifying story ever what he asked quietly who told you never mind who told me dean quickly replied what are you going to do about that hastings bloke he way too good ginny better ron said firmly i trust her they walked into the entrance hall and meant to cross it to go outside for awhile it was a cool morning and the weather finally settled down for the moment oh you do do you seamus said with an amused tone and do you trust her frenching random guys in the castle hallways before ron could even register what his friend just told him seamus let out a loud whistle the rest of the three of them stopped at the sound and ron span around to see what was happening what he whispered in disbelief there in the middle of the corridor stood a close couple embraced in a heated kiss no doubt the identity of the girl was ginny his own sister her long red hair could be spotted from miles away ron could feel his eyes sting at the sight she stood there carefree and willingly snogging some bloke whose face was hidden behind her ginger head when the couple heard seamus call at ginny they both broke apart quickly and looked around wildly like two deer caught in the headlights ginny face was evidently red from anger while the boy who had kissed her was red from embarrassment when ron saw who that guy was a large lump in his throat quickly formed and it ached so much he wanted to start screaming but surprisingly enough he didn t holy merlin that potter seamus called out loud once again a wide grin plastered to his face he nudged dean at the ribs with his elbow dean simply stared at the scene with cold indifference in his eyes and turned to walk away neville was a little pink in the ears as well he lowered his head and went to follow dean outside your sister frenching potter weasley seamus went on now you re defiantly going to lose the cup and to slytherin no less ron merely stood frozen in place and stared at their faces ginny face quickly changed from anger to something more on the line of guilt and the rosy blush that colored her cheeks quickly spread all over her neck and ears harry felt uncomfortable under his gaze he knew that any moment now he would suffer the great outcome of a really awful hex he realized he was still holding one hand around ginny waist and he quickly drew it back and rubbed the back of his neck neither he nor ginny knew what to say they had only agreed to tell him about them a minute ago they hadntprepared what to say exactly preparing himself to receive the worst hex or punch he had ever got harry swallowed thickly and closed his eyes shut suddenly he felt ginny hand sneak into his and their fingers entwined together bravely he opened his eyes and looked down at her but she was not looking back she was staring directly at her brother across the room as if silently challenging him to do or say something what ron did next was a great shock to all of them he pinched his nose with his fingers and shut his eyes then shook his head silently in disbelief and went out of the double doors to the grounds with seamus still taunting him from behind well harry said slowly once they were gone and after it all sank in that must be good he didntkill me but ginny thought differently she shook her head slowly as the horrible feeling of disappointment tightened around her heart no she said quietly and she dared not to look at his eyes as hers were brimming with tears ron not saying anything is not good it not good at all ron was so furious he wanted to kick something he thought that the cool fresh air would do him some good and make him relax a bit but instead seamus couldntstop blabbing about what they saw that he had to go back to the common room and talk to hermione flubberworm he shot the password at the fat lady before she even asked and once the portrait swung open he climbed inside and strode angrily to the couch in front of the fire the couch however was already occupied by a quite enthusiastic snogging pair he folded his arms across his chest and stared at them for a moment and cleared his throat loudly until they broke apart do you mind he asked hotly and the young couple quickly stood and disappeared leaving the large couch only to the house prefect to mull things over he didntcare that other students around the room began to stare he stared at the fire for what seemed like hours until he felt a familiar and gentle touch around his neck as his girlfriend hands snuck around him from behind she kissed his cheek and leaned her head on his shoulder is everything all right you look angr i am he said at once his voice rough hermione frowned slightly at the tone of his voice and drew her hands away from him he felt her pull back and he sighed quickly reaching for her again he didntwant to take this out on her it wasnther fault that his sister was such a fool i sorry he said quietly to her i didntmean to take this out on you she rounded the couch and sat next to him she looked him in the eyes and quickly asked what happened it ginny he said shortly did you know she has a new boyfriend ah hermione said she knew this would be a long talk so she changed her position on the couch into a more comfortable one tucking her legs under her and reaching out to take his hand in hers well yes in fact i did ron head spun to look at her and you didntthink that i might need to know about it he asked angrily hermione simply shrugged first of all it just happened so i really didnthave the time to register it myself secondly it her life she should be the one to tell you if she wants to it not my job to tell you who she dates hermione i just made a complete fool out of myself in front of everyone how could you not tell me something like that ron i think you re taking this a bit too hard too hard too hard ron called i had to see her snogging him in the hallways i nearly puked so what it not the first time you saw her kissing someone hermione said besides i think they look good together they re cute she smiled fondly and that only made ron feel angrier cute ron eyes nearly popped out of their sockets hermione i dontthink we re talking about the same guy here i talking about harry potter she finished for him nodding i know ron pushed himself from the couch and turned to face her his face redder than ever he threw his arms out and started shouting you knew that my sister is going out with my worst enemy and yet you didntsay a word how could you do this to me hermione you know how i feel about that guy i could ve prevented this from happening hermione huffed exasperatedly and tried all her might not to yell back at him ron you re not listening to me she said patiently it just happened i found out last night and since last night you ve met me in breakfast you had plenty of time it not my secret to tell she repeated her voice now rising to match his and what do you mean you could have prevented this how can you take you sister happiness away that really cruel ron at the start of their raised voices a quick rush of feet and murmurs were heard as the people in the room fled away clearing the common room in no time and giving the two of them more privacy however the wizards and witches in the framed portraits hanged on the walls stayed to see the quarrel and started chatting excitedly among themselves as their eyes darted between ron to hermione she promised she would stay away from him hermione and now she broke that promise do you even listen to yourself hermione asked slightly mortified by his words she happy ron and if she happy with harry then you should be happy for her besides how can you be the one to talk you promised her you d stay out of her love life we re not talking about me here hermione at that hermione rolled her eyes how can you defend him like that what about all the times when he called you mudblood when he used to make our lives miserable is that all forgotten you re telling me just like that ron asked incredulously hermione sighed and looked into his eyes now almost black with anger instead of their normal cool blue color yes because i found it in me to forgive him just like you should do he changed he a better person now and he sorry and how exactly would you know that ron challenged because he told me hermione burst out exasperated ron looked ay her for a moment confused trying to understand what she was telling him since when do you talk to him she never took her gaze off him she wanted him to know she was serious and that she not sorry for that about the time that i found out that he likes ginny we started talking and i realized that he actually a good guy that he different now it because of ginny that he different he really cares for her i saw that and i promised him i would help him get together with her there was a long uncomfortable pause between them ron looked confused and shocked opening and closing his mouth while searching what he wanted to say until he finally settled for you did what hermione got up from the couch to match his level i couldnttell you because i knew you will take it badly ginny my friend she deserves to be happy with someone who cares for her ron hands flew around his head and he looked like he was about to explode hermione gulped wishing the outcome would not be as bad as she imagined it to be but why him hermione from all the guys who wish to date my sister you had to go and help that slimy git what he had enough fooling around with all the girls in slytherin so he had to go and pick my sister next as what to get back at me for something or is he that lousy at asking girls out that he needed your help with that and to think you had to go do it behind my back to hide this from me because i would take it badly you re taking it badly right now hermione called pointing to him i did it for him as a favor and he did it for himself not because he wanted to get back at you for something you had nothing to do with it ron lowered his head and looked at his feet quietly he walked slowly to the couch and slumped back down on it staring blankly at the roaring flames in the grate she sighed again and sat down next to his wishing he would look up at her ron she said gently he didntsay a word to her for a few long minutes and she knew he was trying to gather his thoughts she knew she should give him time to register everything finally he spoke up in a hoarse voice which surprised hermione when she looked at his face she could see his eyes were brimming with tears and she gasp silently she had never seen him cry before you you betrayed me hermione eyes went wide at his words and her throat ached from her own chocked tears no ron she whispered reaching for his hand but he pushed it away i cantbelieve you did this you went behind my back you helped the guy i hate the most in the world to get together with my sister and you re saying i have nothing to do with it what left hermione her lips quivered what what do you mean he turned his head slowly at her his eyes ached by looking at her i dontthink i can be with someone that does things against me someone that lies to me all the painted witches from the portraits let out a great sad aww dabbing their eyes with handkerchiefs while the wizards simply shook their heads ron don t she whimpered knowing the ending of this conversation and silently pleading she was wrong go hermione she grabbed him by the forearm her grip was so strong and clingy but not as painful as the ache in his heart ron please dontdo this i sorry i promise i would never hermione he yelled suddenly cutting her off he turned his gaze back to fire releasing her grasp from him with his other hand and moving to the far end of the couch you did this not me and donttell me you re sorry because we both know you re not i had enough with your lies ron you dontmean it she sobbed the tears are rolling freely on her face now you re being irrational please just take as long as you need and relax just please dontdo this to us i mean it he said strictly go away hermione i dontwant to see you or hear another one of your lies she stood up shakily and sobbed quietly her face red and her eyes wet and swollen she half ran to the door to the girls dormitories but stopped on the first step and what about your promise to me ron you promised you would always love me so donttell me i the only one who lied it not okay for ginny to break her promises but for you it is she right you know you are such a hypocrite and with that she disappeared up the stairs ron simply sat on the couch limply and did nothing but to stare into space wiping the tears from his face with the back of his hand when they escaped his eyes and ignoring the comments the witches in the portraits had yelled at him harry and ginny walked together swinging their joined hands back and forth as they paced quietly ginny couldntbelieve that one person could hold inside them so many different emotions at once she felt content and happy and at the same time depressed and guilty she was happy that she had harry now but she couldntshake the feeling that she let ron down this was not how it was supposed to go they had agreed that she would tell ron some time later today about them and that harry would act all gentlemanly and ask for his permission to date her ron would eventually have to agree or else she would bat bogey hex him i ll walk you to your common room you find him and talk harry suggested bringing her out of her thoughts ginny then smiled crookedly but i cantlet you find out where my common room is she said rather playfully he smirked as well oh you mean behind the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor when she looked surprised at him he chuckled lightly dontlook so shocked everyone knows where it is they walked together in a comfortable silence simply enjoying being with each other harry had wrapped his hand around her shoulders and pulled her closer to him she couldntbelieve that only a few moments ago she accused him for avoiding her and being embarrassed of being seen with her she was glad she was wrong she could get used to this she thought to herself she could stay together with him like this wrapped inside his arms securely for eternity she wished she could have him alone for an hour or so somewhere private where no one could interrupt them to kiss or talk or kiss she smiled at the thought and she lightly touched with her fingers on the back of his hand he had wrapped around her she knew that there was still time and that maybe right now wouldntbe the right moment to mention it but she couldntwait any longer to tell him about hogsmeade anxious to finally let it out she started say harry she said softly hmm i dontknow if you noticed but there was a sign for another hogs oh no he said suddenly cutting on her words let not go down this way ginny stopped in place looking at him bewilderedly i sorry had harry knew what she was about to say did he not want to take her out to hogsmeade he said he wanted to go out with her so what was more perfect than going together to the village for their first date well of course there werentmany choices of locations to choose from if you re stuck inside a castle for ten months so that was pretty much the only thing she could look forward to then harry motioned with his head to the direction they were heading she slowly looked that way and saw malfoy walking towards them with zabini crabbe and goyle do you know any shortcuts harry asked rather coldly his eyes focused on the group of four slytherins ahead of them ginny felt relief when she realized what he meant he only wanted to change their path er yeah let go this way she said leading him through a narrow hallway to their left it a bit longer though that okay i just didntwant to face him harry said dejectedly he sighed and forced on a smile besides that way i get to spend more time with you his tone of voice was now more cheery but yet it was unnaturally cheery as ginny could tell ginny looked up at him are you sure you dontwant to talk about it he nodded firmly i sure because if i do talk about it i ll get upset and you ll get depressed and right now i dontwant either of us to feel that way okay she said rather sweetly rubbing her fingers soothingly on the back of his hand but if you do want to talk about it i here harry chuckled and looked down at her you re cute he leaned down and brushed his lips on hers slowly the taste and texture of her kiss were making him feel slightly giddy and it was just what he needed to cure him for this recent dejection that had fallen upon him because of draco she was the air that he was breathing the solution to his problems she was what made it all worth fighting for am i she asked when they broke apart currently amused he nodded slightly you are they reached the fat lady portrait a few minutes later and they parted with another long kiss which made the fat lady call at them angrily to take it somewhere else once harry left ginny said the password and climbed through the portrait hall and into the common room her eyes immediately found her brother he was the only one there after all and she found him seating on the couch in front of the fire his head buried in his hands she sighed guessing that seeing her and harry kiss was kind of hard on him she walked over warily dreading some sort of an unexpected reaction from him that will startle her when he did not even bother to look at her she sat down next to him waiting for him to acknowledge her presence at least ron she said weakly after a silent pause he finally said something you promised me ginny he said his voice muffled through his hands he raised his head and she was stricken to see his eyes were red and a bit swollen he was crying she quickly realized she couldntremember the last time she saw him cry was ron had always been tougher than her she didntknow he would take this so hard you promised it would be anyone just not him that not what i promised ron she said i promised i wouldntdate him if he was a death eater which he not and you promised you would accept who i date ron chuckled softly shaking his head in disbelief i knew you d get out of this somehow you just couldnthave stayed away from him could you ginny looked him deep in the eyes guess not it was bound to happen sometime anyway i planned on telling you about him later you know when she noticed he was barely listening to her she grabbed his face and made him look at her ron things are different now than they were since the start of first term he not who you think he is he loves me ron chuckled again only this time his laugh sounded rather harshly ha the hell he does do you really believe that pathetic cheating bastard do i really have to remind you what you went through so far because of him ginny have you already forgotten how he treated you how cruel he used to be towards us that right he used to be and how can you say even that cantyou just be happy for me he d changed and became a new person a good person and you cantever see it or hear a word about it she added once he started shaking his head dismissively if i forgave him why cantyou i happy when i with him why is that that you are allowed to be happy with whom you love and the same thing canthappen for me ron bowed his head and suddenly looked mournfully at the floor you know what i feel right now he asked and she did not answer for she knew he had not searched a reply i just his voice trailed off he swallowed hard and looked up at her his voice dropped to almost a whisper now disappointed in you he finished the words had pierced ginny heart like an arrow and for a minute her breath caught in her throat she couldntbelieve her own brother had just told her that he was disappointed in her just when she thought that things had gotten bad it had only got worse when he went on but you know because i promised i would not interfere in your love life i ll keep my mouth shut but that doesntmean i accepting it because i dontthink i will ever be able to unlike you ginny i stand by my promises he stood up from the couch and paced slowly around the room ginny couldnteven raise her head to look at him his earlier words too fresh and hurtful to make her want to see him she focused on her nails instead while she sensed him rounding the couch one more thing ginny he said she started but still did not turn to look at him if this is your final decision then say it now she swallowed thickly it is she said boldly her voice a little throaty then dontcome crying to me when he hurts you whatever involves him i want nothing to do with it i just hope he wonthave a bad influence on you and change you completely one day you see that i was right about him ginny let out some sort of a sigh mixed with a sob for a moment she just wanted him to go to stop saying all those things to stop making her feel bad about it all she had to remind herself that she was doing nothing wrong and that she should have expected ron reaction to be like this she guessed she hadntprepared herself enough for this oh and if you want some consult you can go to hermione after all she the one who set this all up then there was nothing but silence left ginny wiped her face with the back of her hand sniffed the last remnants of her tears and went up to look for hermione when she entered the sixth years girls dormitory she found hermione bed curtains closed she walked over and picked inside finding hermione crying as well hermione she said quietly as she opened to curtains fully and sat on the bed the other girl looked up at her with swollen red eyes what is it she asked gently hermione sobbed quietly and tried to talk between hiccups ron and i i b bro broke up ginny heart swelled with sorrow for her friend and with rage for her git of a brother what was with him today she thought angrily why what has he done no nothing hermione said while trying to calm down ginny knew she hated to be seen like this it was my fault then hermione started pouring out everything before ginny even asked her to and ginny listened carefully to everything her friend had said of how she became friends with harry how she figured out the note was his and how she suggested she would help him that it was her idea from the very beginning and finally how she told him what to do and how to act and then today ron came by and told me he saw you with harry she said ginny looked at her intently but hermione never looked back at her while she told her story and i couldnthide it from him anymore so i told him and he totally lost it he said i betrayed him and that he cantbe with someone that lies to him that git ginny hissed i cantbelieve he did this to you you should have hexed him hermione shook her head he was right it my fault no it not hermione ginny insisted hermione then looked up at her after a long time her eyes were still a little red but not swollen anymore i so sorry ginny please donthate me i did it for you all i wanted for you is to be happy i could never hate you ginny said quietly with a smile dontbe sorry for anything because i am happy hermione sniffed you are ginny smile widened and she reached for her friend hand and started drawing soothing circles with her thumb thanks to you i am hermione without you this whole thing with harry might never have happened i should thank you and ron an idiot for not realizing what he had you ll see that eventually he ll see what he lost and he ll come round you two are made for each other i not so sure about that anymore he said some really hurtful things to me that i dontthink i can ever forget like i already said he a git besides i kind of think he was hurt too for not good reason at all mind you but still you both have some things to talk about heck he just made me feel completely guilty about myself that i want to go there and hang him by his tie but i wontdo that because he my brother and i could get detention for it ginny finished half amusedly and the two girls chuckled yes hermione sighed i guess we all have things to talk about one evening later that week harry knocked softly on lupin office door the professor had approached him that day at lunch and asked him to come since he has some matters he wished to discuss with him come in lupin husky voice answered harry pushed the wooden door open and walked inside the small office finding lupin sitting at his desk checking students essays he raised his head and smiled slightly when he saw harry there he pushed himself from his chair and flicked his wand at the mess on his desk a second later all the parchments and books were rearranged and stacked in a neat pile hey remus harry greeted and went to sit down in one of the dusty patched armchairs that lupin held in the room a clutter of class came from behind as harry waited for lupin to join him a little curious as to what took him so long harry turned to peek around his shoulder and saw remus crouching down and picking out something from a lower cabinet behind his desk feeling any better harry tried to engage a small talk between them to break the silence referring to the latest full moon oh much better thank you remus finally came to join harry and settled on the round coffee table two goblets and a bottle of mead as he started pouring down the golden liquor he noticed the look of surprise on harry face and gave him a slight grin donttell your mother i let you drink this got it for christmas from dumbledore and it d be a waste to drink it alone harry nodded and held a crooked smile on his lips lupin finally sat down in the other chair leaned forward over the table and handed harry a goblet full of the liquor harry took it thanking him he wondered what it tasted like he never drank any other alcoholic beverage beside butterbeer which didnteven count as alcoholic anyway before and he and lupin both knew well that his mum would have a fit if she found out he had some he took a sniff at the content of the goblet and sensed the sweet smell of honey pressing the goblet to his lips he took a small sip of the drink expecting some sort of a sugary taste but instead finding his throat burning slightly the taste of honey was barely noticeable he coughed lightly and lupin chuckled at the scene all right there he asked amusedly taking a swig off his own goblet yeah harry said clearing his throat putting down his goblet on the table he leaned back in his chair so you said you wanted to talk to me about something i do lupin confirmed and his light mood had changed into a more somber one it more like something your parents asked me to talk to you about harry remained silent waiting for lupin to continue he didntwant to guess what this was about his mind often took him to the wrong places so he listened carefully remember at christmas when there was a death eaters attack at malfoy manor well back then the aurors thought that they d captured every escaped death eater but apparently they were mistaken harry frowned there are still death eaters out there lupin nodded i afraid so there had been a sighting of the dark mark last night just out west of london close to surrey no one has been reported missing or hurt but the ministry and the order are still searching for who had conjured it so you dontknow who it was or how many were they unfortunately no yet the aurors are still working on how they have missed someone in their files every person held in azkaban has a record of course but so far no one had been found missing the ministry thinks it was an inside job the files must be accurate at all times you see harry contemplated this how come there wasntanything in the prophet lupin sighed the minister thought it would be best to keep this quiet for now seeing there was no real harm done so there isnta reason to frighten the entire wizarding population that they might be in danger but they can warn them to be more careful harry protested angrily people should be aware luckily this time no one got hurt but next time could be different and the aurors hope that there wontbe a next time they re hoping to catch whoever is still missing soon lupin explain rather calmly this peaceful manner of his professor had made harry feel furious while there could be people out there missing hurt or dying everyone seemed calm about this like they have everything under control when they clearly didn t so why are you telling me this if the ministry wants to keep this quiet harry asked lupin was quiet for a moment contemplating his words carefully because it seems to concern your family harry you re still the target the death eaters are looking for your parents and sirius dontworry they have gone into a safer place protected by a fidelius charm the death eaters dontknow where they are our speculation for the last night events is that whoever they were they were looking for your parents probably searching at surrey maybe for your mother sister house they must have thought they were hiding with them aurors have been sent there to protect them as well harry gazed into space taking a moment to think about this he pushed his bangs irritably from his forehead when will this ever end he thought to himself he looked up at lupin again do you know where they are he finally asked lupin shook his head no only the secret keeper does and who is this secret keeper lupin gave half a shrug and another shake of the head i dontknow harry so what about me wontthe death eaters be looking for me as well shouldnti go into hiding with them you donthave to you re very heavily protected here at hogwarts under dumbledore watch as long as you stay in the castle you re safe after a moment when harry seemed to ponder all this lupin went on do you know what this also means harry harry knew fairly well but it was such a small issue that it almost didntmatter at all no hogsmeade weekends he had meant to go with ginny only the matter hadntcome up yet and he forgot to mention it to her he guessed that now he shouldnteven bother with it since he wouldntbe able to go anyway i sorry lupin said sincerely but your parents and dumbledore fear that if you go into hogsmeade the death eaters will track you down there are a lot of dark wizards staying in that town every one of them can be linked to a death eater we cantrisk that you understand harry nodded i do but what about all the other students if there are alerts of another death eater attack in hogsmeade wontit be better to cancel it for everyone safety and not just my own dumbledore has his reasons dontworry though the town will still be guarded by aurors but this is stupid harry exclaimed and there nothing you could do to make dumbledore change his mind lupin shook his head quietly you should know harry that dumbledore is always prepared for the worst he would never endanger his students harry didntknow what else to say to this he had no other choice but to agree to this plan and of course lupin had made him swear that he would not say anything about it to anyone else either he left his professor office with a heavy feeling in his chest that he could not shake off on the following morning as the day of the hogsmeade trip came closer he felt even worse everyone around him was buzzing with excitement about the weekend making plans on where to go and what to do he wished he could say or do something even if not directly but anything to make this trip get cancelled he didntwant anyone harm to be his fault just because he didntwarn them he was sitting alone yet again at the slytherin table over breakfast his plate of food remained untouched and had already gotten cold he never noticed ginny approaching him from her own house table until he was startled to feel her warm hands sneak around him a knut for your thoughts she said playfully leaning down to whisper softly in his ear hi was his reply he touched her hands and turned his face to kiss her cheek you looked miles away what were you thinking about she asked harry hesitated um you he said tentatively she smiled brightly and the sight of her beaming like that had already made his day better i hope only good things she leaned over his shoulder and met his lips in a quick kiss he was then surprised when she slapped lightly on his shoulder now what were you really thinking harry looked at her simply amazed with her wisdom she should have been sorted into ravenclaw just for that the thought absently crossed his mind he couldntbelieve how well she already got to know him over the mere few days they had been together she looked at him intensely waiting for his reply and he sighed the promise he had made for lupin never left his mind but still he knew he had to tell her something i was actually thinking about this hogsmeade trip that coming up next weekend he finally said and wondered how he can go on from here without revealing too much to her he hated the fact that they had to start their relationship with him lying to her already oh really she said rather excitedly i was actually going to talk to you about it as well harry blinked you were he asked confused yeah you know i was thinking we should meet in the entrance hall and we start from honeydukes then we head down to what that look on your face she suddenly asked all the excitement she had had suddenly vanished harry was more than surprised to say the least she had already made plans he thought he didntknow where he could bury himself he was going to ruin it for her and she would be crushed he had to break it to her gently look ginny he started taking her hands in his and guiding her to a vacant chair next to him she looked around with slight concern in her eyes as if not sure how his housemates or even her housemates would react to a gryffindor sitting at the slytherin house table luckily it appeared to be that nobody even looked their way so she seemed more relaxed and more focused on him is something the matter i hope i not dropping this out on you just like that you did ask me out after all remember you even chased me around the school so i would agree i mean i know you hadntsaid anything but that okay because i ginny he said again more firmly this time that had got her attention i didntsay anything because i wasntplanning on going she didntsay anything for what it seemed like a whole two very slow and awkward minutes the deadly silence between them was fiercer to his ears than if she would have started screaming at him she didnteven blink she simply stared at him wide eyed and her mouth agape say something please so i know that you re okay he said his eyebrows close to each other with confusion at her reaction she closed her eyes briefly pressing the heels of her palms to them and then she started shaking for a moment he was sure she had started to cry and he had no idea what he can do to comfort her he wasntgood at this stuff the only idea he had in mind was to get as far away from her as he could before she would pull out her wand and hex him only then she emitted one of her soft chuckles and she looked up her eyes completely dry the look on his face must have been pure bewilderment for she started laughing a bit harder when she saw it what so funny why are you laughing he asked his eyes checking her closely she looked as if she was under some sort of a cheering charm i wha i i dontknow what to say you re pulling my leg here arentyou she asked her voice light and expectant no ginny i not he looked at her closely his eyes willing her to understand she stilled again and started opening and closing her mouth several times but i don t what the point in asking me out if you re not going to take me out harry gulped thickly her voice had gotten stronger and angrier he couldnthelp but wonder why weasleys had such hot temper is it something to do with the hair he asked himself i sorry but it not like i planned it oh you hadntplanned it then it just came up she said hotly harry sighed wiping his now sweating forehead i really wish you would let me explain but what there to explain harry you obviously already made up your mind or else you wouldnthave said you arentgoing you asked me out on a date and now when we can go out on that date you re ditching me i not ditching you harry said defensively i just i cantgo ginny eyes suddenly narrowed dangerously you cant go or you dont want to go harry bowed his head down and looked at his lap as he said the next words afraid looking her in the eyes while he said them a little bit of both actually ginny huffed angrily argh i can not believe you harry potter she said and for harry taste rather loudly he hoped no one was watching them the last thing that he wanted was to be the center of attention right now and he wished they could have taken this somewhere more private if he only knew it will get to this harry looked up at her guiltily i guess this is my fault she went on i shouldnthave just assumed things i should have waited for you to do it yourself i expected too much harry tried to reach out for her hands but she shoved him away rather cruelly listen gin he said softly we can stay in the castle think about it we ll have much more privacy when everyone out when everyone is out in hogsmeade having fun you mean she said her voice slightly cracking now no it okay i get it you dontwant to be seen with me you dontwant to go out with me you never did it not like that ginny for the last week the whole school had seen us together probably tens of times already so dontthink that i dontwant to be seen with you i do want to go out with you but not to hogsmeade will a broom cupboard take your fancy then or perhaps the forbidden forest she snapped i dontknow maybe you find dark creatures to be really romantic or maybe your definition of romantic is different from the way i and other normal people for that matter see it she bowed her head shut her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose obviously fighting back tears finally she took a large intake of breath and looked up at him again if you dontwant to go out with me then just say so i a big girl i can handle it i already told you that i do want to please donttake this so hard it matters to me too you matter me if i matter to you then why haventyou spoken to my brother yet like i asked you to dontyou care that it important to me you do realize that the only reason that i not talking to him is because of you i chose you harry my brother isntspeaking to me because i dating you then again if we arentdating then this whole fight between us is completely pointless harry eyes widened and he suddenly felt his heart shrink at her words no dontsay that i sorry i ve been preoccupied and i forgot because you dont care ginny retorted angrily i do care she went quiet again no doubt gathering her thoughts and trying not to let all her steam out fine she said shortly and she stood up abruptly from her chair harry eyes followed her she looked up ahead refusing to meet his gaze if you think that i going to sit back in the castle while all my friends are going to have fun then you are very much mistaken if you dontwant to talk to my brother then don t and if you dontwant to go to hogsmeade then stay in i on the other hand am going with or without you harry potter if you do care like you say you do then come and find me with that she strode out of the great hall ginny come on harry called after her but she didntturn back she nearly bumped into blaise on her way out as he came to the slytherin table he stopped abruptly to look after her angry figure walking away and after she was finally gone he came to sit next to harry in the chair she had just vacated harry sat back in his chair and stared blankly into his space picking up his fork and spinning it absently on the wooden surface of the table merlin he wished this was all just a bad dream that he will soon wake up from he even tried to pinch himself just to make sure it hurt like hell so he swore under his breath broken up already blaise suddenly asked as he reached for a scone and started buttering it harry turned his face and shot him a deadly glare no he said firmly we just had a fight he clarified blaise started laughing at that already what did you do shut up you re not helping harry snapped he eyed blaise suspiciously at the grin on his friend face you would like that wontyou see us breaking up me no nott on the other hand is already raising bets on how long it will take you to split and i know that not because i in on it but because i saw him in the common room yesterday collecting money from people great harry muttered darkly shoving his untouched plate away and tossing his fork on it yeah i just think that one week of relationship is pretty poor even for you right harry said slowly and you re the one to talk the longest relationship you ever had lasted three days blaise smile disappeared and he let out a long whistle point taken thought so harry smirked what are you doing here anyway where what s his face who draco he off to do some of his own self pitying harry raised an eyebrow really what wrong with him now blaise shrugged dunno family stuff as usual i guess i didntbother asking he wouldnthave told me anyways as you know unfortunately i do blaise took a large bite off his scone and with a mouthful he said oh so you know about that hogsmeade weekend harry suddenly let out a whiney moan and banged his head against the table don t remind me he said each word with a hit ooh blaise said excitedly so that what got your girlfriend knickers tied in a knot harry slowly raised his head from the table and looked at blaise with heavy lidded eyes if you speak of my girlfriend knickers one more time you re dead he said warningly yeah so anyway blaise said quickly as if not taking harry seriously i asked pansy to go with me you did as i said harry questioned getting more interested with the new subject i did wrote her a letter and even sent her a rose where did you get harry started to ask greenhouses blaise simply replied and harry nodded quite impressed and how did it go well she turned me down blaise said half heartedly oh harry said stupidly blaise waved him off she said that i not decisive and when i ll make up my mind i let her know sorry mate girls can be like that that okay i decided i going to do exactly what you did i not going to give up that good you should do that harry agreed clapping on blaise back blaise got up from his seat and adjusted his book back strap on his shoulder harry looked up to find the great hall nearly empty by now since everyone had gotten up for the first class of the day yeah i mean it worked for you how hard can it be right exactly harry said also getting up then something clicked wait what blaise simply laughed he was already a few feet ahead of harry as they started to leave the great hall oh by the way they re blue what blue harry asked not following your girlfriend knickers he replied amusedly harry face had quickly reddened up you re dead he yelled as blaise broke into a run laughing just like peeves and harry chased him all the way to class later that day just before lunch blaise had to stop at the infirmary and asked madam pomfrey to fix his twisted arm a n okay so that it for this chapter i really really planned to go on but that for the next one i afraid because then it would be way too long anyways there more to come more fluffy scenes and more angsty stuff so i hope you liked this chapter if you did please let me know what you think disclaimer i dontown harry potter a n be warned fluff mixed with angst ahead again happy reading chapter 18 until death do us part part 1 tap tap tap tap tap tap the continual pitter patter noise on the surface of the heavy wooden table was getting on blaise nerves he felt the beginning of a migraine forming in the back of his head and each new tap was boring a bigger hole it would have been less irritating if he wasnttrying to do some last minute revisions to the arithmancy test he had just after lunch trying to ignore it he sighed and turned a page in his book and looked at the question but no matter how many times he tried to read the same sentence nothing sank in tap tap tap tap the words started to disappear from the page and he blinked rapidly in order to focus on the text but to no avail it seemed that harry who was sitting across from him his one hand drumming on the table distractedly while the other was angrily flipping through an open book he set down on the table and had his eyes staring like a hawk at something far behind blaise head tap tap tap tap tap tap blaise eyes snapped at harry drumming fingers and narrowed when they tapped the table again in a quicker rhythm now the vein in his forehead throbbed with his quickening pulse his eyes now red and watching as each tap had turned to a thud in slow motion blaise cracked a knuckle before he smoothly pulled out his wand from the inner pocket in his robes and with a non verbal spell he aimed it at the disturbing fingers and they immediately petrified like stone and stopped in mid tap harry quickly snapping from his daze as he was suddenly aware of the new feeling in his hand looked down to see his fingers frozen and unable to move as shock spread across his face blaise sighed again and muttered thank merlin under his breath and returned to his book oi harry exclaimed knocking with his stone like fingers on the cover of blaise book which unbeknownst to him had only irritated blaise further what d you do that for blaise turned his head to see what harry had been staring at knowing already he would see ginny weasley at her own house table he turned back to harry and pointed his finger at him i ve had enough of you acting like this for three days now all you do is stare at her and sulk and now it driving me nuts you need to talk to her harry eyes looked over blaise shoulder again finding ginny talking to none other than dean thomas he huffed angrily and looked back at his friend i tried just earlier she shot me this deadly glare i seriously thought she was going to hurt me he shrugged i fled blaise sniggered down at his book and shook his head so now you re basically back where you started it was harry turn to point his finger at blaise no i not i just need to figure out a way to make her talk to me again just take her on the bloody date that would make her talk to you again blaise said as he dipped his quill in his inkpot and scribbled the answer to the question on his book watching with satisfaction as a green check mark had formed next to it harry pinched the bridge of his nose you make it sound so easy how much longer are you going to ignore him ginny did not bother to answer hermione nudged her in the ribs quite hard actually hard enough to make her yelp look at him she hissed rubbing the sore spot ginny glared at her instead you did not have to do that she rebuked i know he there i know he watching me i trying to make him understand that he a complete brainless duck she said the last word that came to her mind but he trying to talk to you and you wonteven let him come near you hermione countered you re lucky he still looking at you if he was another guy someone like your idiot of a brother let say than he wouldnteven think twice to even try and make up with you ginny knew hermione was right she was grateful that harry still wanted her even though she was a total bitch to him for the past few days but still she could not shake off the disappointing feeling he left her with you know he sorry hermione went on did you even think of why he cantgo with you maybe he got a detention that he isntproud of and he doesntwant to tell you about huh did you think of that no ginny muttered started to think that maybe she was wrong after all she wanted to talk to him and she was trying to make him jealous just so he would walk over to her and say fine you win that all she wanted to hear really it would be proof that she was his all along and that he did want her even in hogsmeade dates did he say anything to you he asked when you are going to forgive him hermione replied ginny frowned angrily well you can tell him i not telling him anything ginny hermione cut her off i did my part now you messed it up so you need to fix it ginny was sure she was steaming by now i did not mess it up he did hermione raised her hands in defeat before she collected the books she had spread on the table before her into her bag fix it ginny talk to him she stood up and looked away just when ron and his mates passed by ron stopped and leaned over ginny shoulder grabbing a biscuit off the table practice today at four ginny dontbe late he said nonchalantly before he left the great hall with his friends ginny looked up at hermione and noted the sad look in her eyes while ron had casually said a word or two to ginny which usually was only about two things their family or quidditch he hadnteven once spoken or looked at hermione since the big row they had last week and ginny felt sorry for her dear friend because she knew how much she still cared for her brother okay hermione said in a breathy voice obviously holding herself from bursting into tears again i leaving or i ll be late you still have ten minutes left ginny said checking her watch i know but i want to go early so i could get a good seat you know not too far in the back and not too close to the window it all karma really ginny rolled her eyes whatever hermione didntseem to take notice it well anyway good luck on the test thank you she said with a forced smile she turned to leave just when she noticed harry approaching the gryffindor table again she turned back to face ginny again and mouthed talk to him before she greeted him with a polite hello and left for her arithmancy class when ginny looked up and saw harry coming close she quickly grabbed her book bag took another quick sip from her drink and meant to leave before he caught up with her ginny wait he called after her sorry harry i cantright now i really late for class she shouted over her shoulder rushing for the door you ve still got some time left please yeah but you know how it is i need to get my karma seat before someone else takes it she excused rather lamely please he said again his voice was now whispering in her ear and his hand grasped her forearm and she stopped at once missing the touch of him just hear me out fine she breathed with her eyes closed she opened them when she felt his warm breath on her face and looked up to find his brilliant green eyes staring at her but i dontwant to be late i ll be quick he said he gulped nervously making his adam apple bob up and down noticeably in his throat i sorry okay i just canthave you be mad at me i mean we barely started being a couple and we re already fighting i canttake it anymore i i miss you he ended rather shyly ginny felt her heart swelling at his words as simple and corny as they were she hated and loved at the same time the way he could make her feel just by saying something as simple as that oh harry she said softly and moved closer to wrap her hands around his neck he smiled and his hands automatically sneaked to the small of her back holding her close i sorry about the way i acted we can forget this ever happened and you ll see that you wontregret anything i knew you d take it back this weekend is going to be she never finished her sentence harry had moved back and took her hands off his neck looking her in the eyes even without him saying anything she knew quite well what his eyes were telling her she gaped at him oh you are unbelievable she said her voice full of silent anger she pulled away from him snatching her hands from his grip with fury she wanted so badly to slap him that moment but she held back i sorry he tried again with that sorry she snapped are you really or is it something you just say every time you want to shut me up harry rolled his eyes at that you know that not true i do mean it she looked at him skeptically i really doubt that she spun on her heel and went up a flight of stairs to her next class so you re not going to forgive me then harry shouted after her she stopped on a step and looked down at him with narrowed eyes oh i ll forgive you she said with some anger to her tone when pigs fly she spat and disappeared around a corner the bell rang and harry was glad that he had a free period he ran a hand through his hair making it even messier than usual with nothing to do he went to the slytherin common room trying to think of a way to make ginny talk to him again ginny was running through the castle hallways shouting at people to clear her way she took several shortcuts but she was still going to be late ron would never let it go now he told her not to be late and here she was almost eight minutes past four still running towards the entrance hall once outside on the hogwarts grounds she hopped on her broom and flew as fast as she could to the pitch as she got closer she looked at the sky and noticed six players already in the air she cursed under her breath leaning forward to gain speed on her broom and hoped she would fit into the practice unnoticed by ron and try to spot the snitch before he saw something was off unfortunately all hopes quickly left her when a high pitched whistle cut through the air and all six players stopped playing at once the only other player with red hair turned to look at ginny who had just managed to get into the pitch area ron looked up at his team and blew his whistle again keep it going guys he called to them and while they continued their practice ron turned back and looked at ginny she was sure he was going to scream at her and demand to know why she was late she was already preparing a speech about how she was held back in class but she didntneed to say anything as ron only looked at her for a minute or so not saying a word he drew from his pocket a little golden ball and let it go the tiny snitch zoomed as quickly as a flash from his hand and ginny lost track of it as it disappeared into the air ron still not saying anything gestured with his head to where the snitch disappeared ginny nodded stiffly and as he flew back to the goal posts she mounted her broom higher and went searching for it two exhausting hours later ron called the practice they all headed to the changing rooms to freshen up ginny ron called and she stopped in place her heart raced a little faster than usual and she was sure it was nothing to do with the adrenalin from the practice she knew he would bring her lateness up it was inevitable she sighed heavily better get it over with now she thought bitterly and prepared herself for some yelling they stopped in the middle of the pitch coated in orange sunset and cool winter breeze while the rest of the team went to the changing room look ron i sorry i was late professor binns kept pouring us notes and you know how he is sometimes he held up a hand and she went silent at once i just wanted to say good job on practice today keep it up and we wontlose the cup she stammered out incoherent syllables and then merely gaped at him she definitely didntexpect him to say that ron had surprised her twice already today oh was the only word she finally managed to say erm i mean thank you he nodded once yeah but dontlet it get to your head the next time you late i wontbe as soft as i was with you today it d be ten laps round the pitch for every minute that you missed ginny nodded with agreement fair enough a moment of awkward silence passed between them ron ran a hand through his hair and ginny sighed and searched something to focus her eyes on anything just not on him finally he spoke right well i d better get a shower and head back to the castle snape loaded us with work right ginny said i think i go get cleaned up as well they walked silently to the changing rooms shoulder to shoulder but still not sharing a word or a glance at each other on saturday morning harry found himself taking a flight on his broom outside watching longingly as a crowd of overenthusiastic students gathered in the entrance hall while filch and mcgonagall sorted through them checking that everyone had permission to go down to hogsmeade it was a nice day for a hogsmeade trip he noted it wasnttoo cold and snow had fallen over night and covered the ground and trees with thick layer of white that was a real lovely sight to the eyes harry sighed at the sight of the chattering and laughing students below and a ting of jealousy pierced his heart the whole week passed by without him talking to ginny as much as he tried to explain to her the best he could as to why he couldntgo with her she refused to forgive him he was feeling rather frustrated now he knew she would be going alone or with her friends and he was glad because he didntwant to ruin it for her but at the same time he wished she would stay in and spend the day with him instead the week they had shared was wonderful and harry still couldntbelieve it actually happened but he now knew that it was too good to last nothing ever seemed to be working out for him the last few days without her talking to him made him think over their so called relationship he thought about it a lot and realized that maybe it was best if they just ended things now before it became too awkward to do it later they werentspeaking anyway so why stall it he only wanted her to be happy anyway and if she wasnthappy with him then he would step back and grant her the happiness that she deserved harry sighed again this time more in desperation than in jealousy and lowered his broom to the ground too tired of watching other people able to go all about to have fun just because he wouldntbe there ginny looked at her figure in the mirror and tried to straighten her woolen hat it was a christmas gift from her mother she had decided that it would be nice to make something different other than the usual weasley jumpers so she made all her children woolen hats this year ginny thought it was a rather nice change she had so many jumpers with the letter g on them that she kept most of them back at home because she wouldntwear all of them at school she just hated the silly pompon at the top she thought it was pretty childish just when she thought she had set it perfect a loose strand of her long bangs fell over her eyes she blew at it in irritation and when it wouldntmove aside she tucked it behind her ear and combed her fingers through her long silky hair trying to get a few knots undone you look lovely dear the mirror said softly ginny stopped fixing her hair and smiled in satisfaction thank you she told the mirror kindly she turned to hermione who was sitting on her bed a book on her lap like always are you sure you dontwant to come hermione did not look up but only shook her head turning a page in her book i already told you that i ve got so many things to do but we ll have so much fun together hermione ginny tried to convince her friend again as she came to sit next to her on the bed come on dontmake me go alone people will start to whisper things and point at me she faked a pout when hermione looked up and chuckled at the face her redhead friend pulled sorry ginny why dontyou just go with luna i would but she said she needs to search for her shoes and they only other pair she had was flip flops and she cantwear those not because it about seven degrees outside but because it doesntfit her outfit ginny shook her head repeating the words luna had told her about an hour ago she sighed and pushed herself off the bed and made her way to the door fine i ll go alone maybe i ll run into neville or someone are you sure it all right that you re going without harry hermione asked closing her book and moving off the bed she walked with ginny down to the common room ginny shrugged he doesntwant to go that his problem i tired to trying to convince him to go with me but you could have done things differently you know how bad he feels for not being able to go maybe you should stay and keep him company hermione suggested that what he wanted too but i not going to stay behind when i can go out i so tired of being stuck inside the castle ginny explained besides he didnttell me why he couldntgo he just said that he couldn t i feel like he already lying to me maybe there something that he doesntknow how to tell you hermione suggested he knows he can tell me anything hermione i told him i would be there for him whenever he needs me they stood in front of the portrait hall ginny glanced around the room noticing only first and second years were occupying the common room she furrowed a brow are you sure you dontwant to come hermione reached her hands out and hugged her friend go out have fun and dontforget to bring me some sweets well i not sure that you deserve them for making me go alone ginny said teasingly but you did get me a boyfriend even if he is the biggest git in the world well okay that earned you a bag from honeydukes hermione grinned and clapped her hands excitedly thank you you re the best ginny chuckled i know i am she climbed out the portrait hall and went down to the entrance hall once she got there she stood and waited with all the rest of the crowd ginny someone called she turned around and noticed ron shoving his way through people in order to get to her oh hey ron she greeted sheepishly she noticed he wore his new weasley hat as well she secretly giggled when she noticed the color maroon like he always got going to hogsmeade as well yeah he said rubbing the back of his neck i couldntstand another day of studying i know what you mean she said dontknow how hermione manages it ginny saw ron squeeze his eyes shut and she winced once she realized her blurt sorry ron shook his head nah that fine hey where is you know oh he not coming ginny said quietly too embarrassed to talk about this subject with him she wasntsure anyway why he brought it up or even why he was talking to her in the first place wasnthe supposed to be angry with her ron eyed her questioningly and when she caught his look she smiled dontget your hopes up everything fine at least i think so she added the last sentence under her breath they moved up in line and finally when the reached the front doors where filch and mcgonagall stood checking a long list of names weasley ronald and weasley ginevra she said checking the list all right you can go ginny caught sight of mrs norris filch cat she was lying comfortably in her owner arms eyeing them both maliciously with her yellow eyes she hissed at her angrily but ginny ignored her filch patted his cat and leaned down to whisper in her ear dontworry my sweet we ll get them later walking down to the school gates ginny turned to look at her brother he was looking at his feet while he walked his hand shoved into his pockets why are you walking with me she asked him out of curiosity he looked up at her and she saw his pink cheeks and she narrowed her eyes you arenthere to spy on me or anything are you to try and keep me away from harry of course not he objected i saw you were alone and thought of keeping you company if i bothering you that much no i dontmind ginny said shrugging it just that one minute you are a prat and you wonttalk to me for the stupidest reason ever is not he complained is too she countered and fought a smirk when she was suddenly reminded of childish talks when they were kids and the next you re all sunshine and rainbows again and you re walking with me to hogsmeade like nothing happened ron ears turned red and he refused to look at his sister face he kicked a pebble in the road and watched roll down the lane she knew he was too shy to apologize to her it took a great deal of his pride too oh i get it ginny suddenly said ron could not avoid the amusement in her voice he looked up at her and saw her smirking what he asked his eyes round she chuckled you are a prat ron he frowned at her what did i do now ginny chuckled again and eyed him closely you had no one to go with and you didntwant to go alone did you that bull do not finish that sentence if mum was here she would have kicked your arse back up to hogwarts and make you study for newts through all the rest of the hogsmeade weekends you re no better he grumbled in a low voice ginny rolled her eyes anyway she said the word slowly getting back to their previous conversation i know for a fact that dean and seamus are with parvati and lavender because those two wouldntshut up about it all through today breakfast and i just saw neville walking with some hufflepuff in your year you re all alone you planned to go with hermione but you mucked that up so that makes you a prat he was quiet for a moment as though letting everything slowly sink in then he said in a quiet voice you re horrible ginny couldnthelp but laugh soon he joined her and they chuckled all the way down to the village ginny loved coming down to hogsmeade even when it was the same each time she still enjoyed it every time she was here she had so many things she wanted to do today go to honeydukes visit zonko s have a butterbeer in the three broomsticks and if she still have some time left maybe see the shrieking shack one more time she was glad that she wasntalone anymore and that she had ron with her even when he could be an absolute idiot now and then he was a great brother the rest of the time hey what going on there ron asked ginny looked where he pointed and saw a rather large gathering of people around what looked like a small shop dontknow let go check she suggested as the walked over they noticed padma and parvati patil sorting people to enter the shop out of the corner of her eye ginny noticed dean leaning against a distant wall looking really bored and annoyed lavender and seamus stood by him embraced together rather sickeningly to ginny taste and seamus smirked at something that lavender had whispered in his ear madame asha ron read from a large wooden sign that hang above the door seer and fortune teller ginny looked up at the sign oh that must be parvati aunt new place that she talked about she admired she grabbed ron wrist and pulled him come on let see up close you cantbe serious ron mumbled and made the slightest of protest sounds before he caved in as curiosity took over him and let his sister drag him along it must have been the bright red hair that caught parvati eyes she beamed brilliantly at their sight and pushed her body through the noisy crowd to greet them ron eyed the crowd of shoving loud girls warily you girls are mental i dontsee what the big deal is he commented it not like some celebrity had walked in there it just a seer probably a fraud too dontinclude me in this ginny hissed at him as they watched parvati get closer she tried to fake a smile at her friend way i haventgot excited over anything yet yet ron mumbled ginny nudged his side with her elbow just when parvati finally met with them ron ginny i so glad you came she exclaimed beaming excitedly this looks fantastic parvati ginny nodded suddenly sounding like one of the crowd girls which made ron quirk an eyebrow parvati head then snapped back at the crowd as a sudden cry came from within the shop a second later a girl with brown auburn hair emerged out of the mass of people holding a picture of a boy tightly to her chest her girlfriends quickly gathered around her in a circle and she flushed red as a tomato before she cried out she said we will be getting married no surprise was when her friends all let out an equal squeal of joy and started jumping together in a group hug ginny noticed ron was about to gag at the sight and poked him with her elbow again luckily parvati didntseem to notice his reaction she merely grinned at the sight of the squealing girls so things are going well for your aunt i see ginny observed parvati nodded yeah it been great there was a small pause before parvati spoke again do you want to come in i can get you in next she said her eyes hopeful er ginny said and looked to see ron surprised yet fearful eyes ginny felt uncomfortable on ron behalf she knew he wouldntlike it after seeing what it was all about and she felt bad for making him wait for her besides by what she saw so far it really looked like it would be a waste of her money come on parvati said not really waiting for her answer she grabbed ginny hand and pushed her towards the crowd without even thinking ginny took hold of ron hand again and dragged him with her again ginny grinned mischievously at her big brother who protested incessantly and tried to keep his foot locked in place unsuccessfully of course come on ron dontbe shy ginny teased i ll let you go in first ginny dontyou dare he called alarmed trying to free his hand from hers parvati whipped around oh that great she said when she caught on ginny words she turned to her sister who stood at the door to the shop and gestured with her head at the two weasleys padma nodded and let them in easily while fighting off the crowd of protesting girls parvati walked ginny and ron inside the small lobby inside ginny was surprised the shouts and loud noise of the street outside werentheard inside and knew there was a silencing spell on the door probably to keep the meeting more private and intimate she guessed ginny would have to admit the atmosphere inside was really relaxing the room was much different from trelawney classroom yet similar at the same time there was soft indian music playing from somewhere in the room but ginny could not place from where exactly a pleasant scent of jasmine was floating in the air coming from burning incense that sat on a very low table in the center of the room around that said table were arranged in a u shape oblong decorated pillows for people to sit on aside from her and ron the room was empty ginny started to wonder where parvati suddenly disappeared to she noticed ron was looking carefully at the room more in query than in wonder like she just had he had his hands wrapped around himself taking in the pictures of what looked like a hindu goddess who had six arms and was sitting in meditating position a feeble jingle of bells was heard from behind and parvati had returned now carrying a tray with two golden bejeweled cups aunt asha will be with you in a moment she said with a smile she placed the tray on the low table in the center of the room and ginny could see the cups were filled with some steamy cinnamon color beverage have some chai tea while you wait ginny smiled politely and thanked her she looked across the room at her brother who still seemed quite reluctant and eyed him warningly this place is really something ginny said taking one goblet and sipping at the foreign drink she suppressed the urge to cough at the mix of flavors it was spicy and sweet at the same time she honestly preferred drinking english tea this was too much for her taste it really spiritual ron added from the corner of the room now examining a golden statue of an idol ginny saw parvati turned to look at him and placed her cup of chai back onto the tray there was a rustle from behind a bamboo screen which was decorated with pink flowers and vine and another girl which was in ginny year emerged outside with a satisfied smile plastered to her face parvati hurried over to her side everything went well parvati asked the girl the hufflepuff nodded sheepishly yes everything wonderful she pulled out a small leather pouch how much do i owe you she said while rummaging inside it three galleons and five sickles parvati said ginny noticed ron eyes as wide as saucers and he quickly made his way to her from across the room while the hufflepuff girl handed parvati her money and left the shop three galleons and five sickles ron hissed in ginny ear completely scandalized i dontwant to spend that much on some loony ron you can go in now parvati called pleasantly waiting next to the bamboo screen ron shot ginny a deadly glare and ginny merely pushed him forward smiling teasingly at him i ll get you for that he mouthed just before he disappeared behind the screen and ginny let out a bark of a laugh when he was gone it didnthappen very often when hermione got bored especially from a book but today was an exception and she found herself skimming through one that she was positive that on any other day would be excellent reading material without any interest in it at all she was sure it would pass when she would stop thinking about things that bothered her like the whole ron is a prat issue but it had been days now and she couldntstop her mind from wandering she glanced around the deserted library as she sat in one of the tables with a gigantic stack of books next to her that she had no interest whatsoever to open right now and sighed dejectedly she never acknowledged how enormous the library actually was until now when no one was around even madam pince who usually kept her hawk eyes on each burrowed book in the room wasntat her station she hated feeling like this alone sad and hurt and she regretted her decision to skip on the hogsmeade trip i suppose i could go and meet ginny there she muttered to herself and without even giving it a second thought she pounced from her chair and ran out of the library forgetting for the first time ever to return all the books she had taken out back to their respective shelves she quickly made her way to the entrance hall choosing a few shortcuts she and ron had found throughout the years and skipped through two stairways she took a corner only one level to her destination when she suddenly collided with something and nearly fell backwards she was sure the corridor was empty and that she might have just taken the corner too quickly and simply got dizzy but a blink of an eye later someone had materialized before her and held her shoulders steady i so sorry she apologized to the person as she tried to regain her footing that okay hermione he said with slight amusement hermione looked up at his familiar voice and into his eyes emerald green appearing behind narrow square shaped spectacles harry she said relieved to see someone familiar it not that she had forgotten that he stayed behind in the castle as well but she wasntsure if he will be up to spending his time with her so she hadntthought of going to find him hello he smirked down at her still holding her shoulders just to make sure she wouldnttrip hurrying somewhere she shook her head just thought i d head down to the village oh he said quietly releasing her and taking back a step to put some space between them well have fun he wished with fake sincerity in his tone she watched him as he bent down to pick up something from the floor and tucked it inside his robe pocket she couldntsee what that thing was but it was protruding out of his pocket he then walked down the corridor with heavy footsteps to where she had just come from she thought he looked depressed just like every day for the past week since ginny wouldnttalk to him she sympathized with him knowing he was lonely and hurt just like she was she turned around and run over to keep up with him his eyes glimpsed at her inquiringly when she came by his side what are you up to she asked innocently what do you mean he asked unsure she gulped and cleared her throat as though she needed to emphasize she needed to rephrase her question i know you re not going to hogsmeade so i wondered how you were going to spend your day he didntreply but merely kept walking on and she stayed by his side she wasntsure where he was heading but she was sure that neither did he i mean i wasntplanning on actually going myself up until a few minutes ago but i can stay with you if that okay there was an obvious pause as he seemed to consider her offer she noticed a faint smile graced the corners of his lips i d like that he told her a comfortable silence passed between them as they strolled around the castle nowhere particular in mind hermione liked it that way she looked up at him secretly every few minutes and smiled to herself it still amazed her how he had changed in such short time if she had walked around in the same corridor as him only four mounts ago she wouldntbe surprised if he would have insulted her in one way or another now she admired how he had matured only because a single emotion love after what looked like a good ten minutes of silence had passed the thought of what he had put earlier in his pocket was still on her mind curiosity took over and she couldntstop herself from asking him what is that bulging out of your pocket she asked quietly she was startled however when he let out a strong hearty laugh she looked up at him and he gave her a cheeky wink not an average kind of question to ask a bloke now is it it took hermione a full minute to realize what he thought she meant and her face turned warm and red dontbe rude that not what i meant he chuckled again i know what you meant that just my father cloak she raised her eyebrows at him do you always carry you cloak in your pocket no just this once i use it when i want to be alone what do you mean hermione asked perplexed he shook his head you wouldntunderstand all right she nodded accepting his reasons but not really getting it so how is ginny is she okay harry asked changing the subject she still quite upset that you couldntcome with her she was quite looking forward to go out with you especially when this should have been your first date and all harry sighed heavily and rubbed the back of his neck i know i really messed up with her haventi i hope i will be able to take her next time that is if she wontditch me by then he chuckled dryly no real amusement behind it he sighed again she would probably hold it against me forever i wish there was some way i could make it up to her but you can harry hermione said brightly she there you just need to get to her hermione i cant he said firmly she stopped to look at him but what is it exactly that you can t harry you cantleave the castle or you cantbe in hogsmeade i cantbe in hogsmeade without leaving the castle and i cantleave the castle without being seen he said trying to keep his patience with her she seemed to ponder this for a minute then suddenly she looked up and harry noticed an unusual shine in her eyes yes you can harry she said excitedly then all of the sudden she grabbed onto his wrist and broke into a run pulling him with her all the way to the third floor to a corridor which seemed to be deserted but for a single statue of a one eyed witch hermione what are you doing he asked short breathed she waved her hands at him in a wild gesture that he should stop talking and listen to her while she caught onto her breath herself harry trust me it possible to leave the castle without being seen ron told me he and his brothers used to do it all the time you just have to be sneaky and i know that you slytherins are nothing but sneaky harry smirked at her words he couldntdeny to that there a secret passageway over here she said walking over to the ugly statue of the one eyed witch harry watched transfixed as she pulled out her wand muttered something under her breath that he couldntcatch and tapped it once on the witch hump the stone hump slowly slid open and revealed a narrow and dark gap it will lead you to straight to honeydukes try to be as unnoticeable as you can harry looked at her completely astonished then a mischievous smile slowly traced his face hermione he said lightly walking to stand by her if i going then you re coming with me hermione did not respond however she stood still not saying a word her eyes slowly widening harry wanted to ask what was wrong but was stopped when she clumped her hand to his mouth before he could say anything he was too busy to fight her off and nearly bit her in the process but then he heard it himself the distant murmur of someone approaching the timing couldntbe any worse he thought to himself and he stopped struggling with her the voice grew louder and then another joined the first as the people whom they belonged to drew nearer a second later harry noticed remus and professor dumbledore quickly coming their way from around a corner down the hallway without giving it much thought harry pulled out his father cloak out of his pocket he ignored the urge to laugh out loud by the look that hermione had on her face when she realized that he was holding a real invisibility cloak in his hands without saying anything he threw the cloak over them both and made them disappear as though they were never there together they clumsily struggled through the gap in the statue desperately trying to cover up the bottom so their feet wouldntbe seen then they slid inside and heard the hump of the witch slid close behind them as remus and dumbledore passed by remus stopped near the still statue he was sure he saw something switch in it being one of the marauders of course he knew all about the secret passages in the castle he walked closer to it and examined it more carefully the stone was still as in any other statue he listened carefully trying to hear something maybe some voices from within the tunnel but there was complete silence the only thing he did notice was a torn net of spider webs that must have been stretched from the witch hump to the back wall he knew for sure the passage was in use after the marauders time especially when their map had been passed through several students of the school but it didntmean that it was in use in this very moment those spider webs could have been torn for days if not weeks coming remus dumbledore asked waiting patiently for him a few feet away remus looked up at the old headmaster face and shook his head to himself yeah he said and went to join him still a little suspicious he walked with dumbledore to the headmaster office but made a note to himself to check more into it later when he ll be back in his own office damn that fall was hard harry muttered when he rubbed the sore place where he landed on his bum he helped hermione get up from the floor thanks she whispered dusting off her robes but you didntneed to push me you know sorry harry said only his head now visible floating in mid air as he wrapped the cloak around his body and i dontsee why you needed me to come this way i could have just met you there i thought you wanted to keep me company anyway where to hermione hands closed around her wand once again and she lit it she looked around the narrow hallway and started leading the way though now that harry could see much better he realized there was only one way they could go that scary stop that hermione complained suddenly eyeing harry floating head guardedly harry laughed and the sound echoed through the empty space but he didntreveal the rest of his body where did you get an invisibility cloak anyway arentthey supposed to be rare i told you i got it from my father it an old family heirloom harry answered simply so yes i suppose they are rare i thought the ministry had banned them it a good thing that my father is an auror then he said half jokingly and she huffed angrily unsatisfied with his answer they walked together quietly for several minutes until they reached a set of stairs carved into the stone they climbed and climbed until finally they met a trapdoor in the ceiling they stopped to listen if there were any voices outside but all they could hear were their shallow breathings very carefully hermione reached up and pushed the door open and peeked outside harry stood still besides her waiting for her to make the first move i think it safe she whispered she pushed herself up until her whole body was over the opening and she was peering down at him from what looked like a cellar harry quickly followed her and hoisted himself up hermione closed the trapdoor as he stood up and quickly rejoined him he threw the cloak around them both once again and together they looked around the small room until they found a door please dontlet it be locked hermione silently pleaded as harry tried the brass knob are you a witch or not he questioned with a raised eyebrow he saw her thinking about it for a second until it finally downed on her and she pouted he chuckled silently and switched the doorknob and pushed in any case it open they walked into the sweets shop very close together invisible to anyone else and tried to push themselves outside through the thick crowd of customers when they were finally outside harry felt the warmth of the store replaced with the cold air and the smell of fresh snow entered his nose where do you think she is harry asked hermione looking around the street for ginny there were too many people there it would have to be impossible to find her the only hope he had was the bright red hair to give her away i dontknow hermione said her eyes fixed on the faces of passersby i didntsee her inside honeydukes we ll have to start looking i need her to see me she added right harry said he led her behind a group of trees where she would be able to come out from under the robe without people seeing her appear out of thin air be careful when you talk to me he said in a low and amused tone while they came back onto the street you dontwant people thinking you re some crazy person who talks to herself hermione didntsay anything and harry wasntsure if she was ignoring him or actually taking his advice they slowly walked through the crowd and harry saw the many faces of different hogwarts students but as different as they were from each other they all had one thing in common they were all looking happy they passed a group of chattering girls and harry turned his head to look at them observing how gleeful they all were they shrieked with laughter and a pang of guilt stung in his chest how could he be so selfish how could he break his promise to remus and risk everyone he gulped when a strange voice entered his head as long as you re covered it safe no one can see you he nodded to the voice gripping the cloak tightly in his fingers and tightening it around himself so it didnthave a chance of slipping off harry he heard hermione hiss are you there where are you he looked up and saw hermione standing in the middle of the street looking around herself frantically in search of him there was no way she would be able to find him like that he quickly jogged to her i here he whispered dontgo disappear on me now stay with me she chided and harry laid a hand on her shoulder so she ll know he understood come on i think i know where she might be she said and led the way to where a large crowd of girls stood outside a small store ginny jumped with a start when ron suddenly burst out from behind the bamboo screen ron she asked with confusion but he didntturn to look at her i ll wait for you outside he spat she watched as he thrust the money into parvati hand and strode out of the room muttering something that sounded like stupid seers and their obsession with love parvati turned to ginny with a perplexed expression but all ginny could do is shrug she got up from her seat and followed parvati behind the bamboo curtain please go in she said holding her hands in a way that motioned her inside the door that stood behind the screen a smooth curtain of transparent pink fabric hung all the way to the floor from the threshold ginny nodded to her housemate and pushed herself behind it and wrinkled her nose when another strong smell of sweet incense hit her she looked around the small dim and round room it was almost complete blackness inside but for a few candles that floated around and gave it enough light to see through she noticed the walls were painted in dark burgundy and had gold ornaments painted on them with a close inspection she saw they were of stars and planets she noticed several suns and moons heavy black curtains reached the floor concealed the windows and the daylight there was nothing else on the walls besides that no shelves of books or tea cups or crystal balls in the back of the room exactly in front of the door was a round table that was covered with black velvet a small bowl a little deeper than a bowl of soup but altogether around the same size held a small blue flame in it come closer child a deep husky voice said from the back and ginny felt herself shiver she wasntsure she even wanted to get closer to the table but it seemed like her legs thought differently she couldntcontrol them they moved with their own will like some unknown force beckoned them forward as she got closer she was struck to see the blue flame lightening darkly the features of a woman face her face looked engraved and smooth like she was made of stone her skin was dark copper and her hair black with silver streaks despite all that she was very beautiful sit down her lips full and sculpted moved with the strange voice that did not suit her stunning face ginny found herself suddenly facing the woman standing behind a chair she unwillingly complied slowly sitting down and looked into her eyes noticing they were coal black as they were face to face their eyes locked together and ginny found she was transfixed and unable to blink it didnthurt or sting it was like she was hypnotized in some way she couldnttear her gaze from the blackness of the other woman eyes and she felt something stir deep inside her it wasntin her head or in her heart or veins she felt the black gaze wrap around her soul ginevra she hissed her name sounded to ginny like it was some strange language on the woman pointy lips the white so strongly different from the red a pure innocent yet you evoke so much flare around you ginny let out a small gasp suddenly she was hearing her listening carefully but the vision of her stone like face in front of her vanished in a second when the words become sights it wasntanything she ever experienced before in her life she was in the same room still sitting where she was but colors started to swirl around her like in a tornado strange nameless colors ones she had never seen before the colors suddenly mingled together into two forms ginny could distinctly see her own image in each form only one was red and the other was white the two figures of herself that stood across from her vaporized like smoke and abruptly disappeared ginny found herself staring again into the black eyes of madame asha still incapable to look away ah oh hermione said in a small voice she stopped abruptly in the middle of the crowd and harry nearly collided into her he could feel her shoulders tense and tried to understand why she stopped screeching girls pushed all around them trying to get their turn to see the seer and harry snarled when he was hit in the head several times he started to hate the fact that he was invisible but knew it was for the best what he asked with impatience a little more than desperate to get away from the girly crowd hermione said nothing and stayed frozen in place harry followed her gaze until he saw what caused her to stop ron weasley was pushing his way out of the seer pavilion harry noted he was obviously upset about something he watched him get away from all the screaming girls lean against a side wall and sigh he was looking at the ground with a desperate look go to him harry whispered in hermione ear giving her a little push no i i can t she stammered he wouldntwant me there he needs you hermione slowly turned her face to where she knew his must be even though she couldntsee him she was looking right into his eyes walk me over sure he grabbed her hand and pushed her through the crowd and walked with her towards ron hold your hands above the basin madame asha instructed ginny hands lifted from her lap on their own her palms stretched out her slender fingers above the small blue flame the forefingers and thumbs touched their equals and a shape of an inverse heart formed in the space between them madame asha hands rose up high from the table top guiding with them the blue flame to grow bigger in the small bowl the flame rose from the basin and spread between ginny outstretched fingers they didntburn but gave a warm and soothing feeling while they licked and tickled her skin and through all this time ginny kept looking into the woman eyes she held her hands above the flame for another minute turn them over the seer said in her low voice ginny did as she was told and for the first time since she took her seat she felt the need to look away to see her palms and when she tried she found she was able to do as she was pleased she let out another small gasp when she saw in the glow of blue flames that there were red marks scorched into her skin the odd scars created a pattern of symbols similar to ancient runes which she could not understand madame asha bent over and took hold of ginny hands in hers her touch was so light ginny could barely feel it she could feel the seer long dark nails scratch her skin but it wasntuncomfortable they sat silently for a long moment madame asha examined the symbols reading through them trying to decipher their meanings you found yourself your one true love she commented suddenly ginny mind flashed suddenly with an image of harry before coming back to reality i see he cares deeply for you as much as you for him but you do not believe it is important my fair child that you never underestimate him even true love can break apart the boy who is standing outside and waiting for you loves you greatly and he will protect you she said but he can also cause you great pain my child physically and emotionally ginny inhaled deeply trying to understand what she was being told she fought the urge to argue to tell her that this sentence was meaningless since it was only her brother waiting for her outside and there is no way in the world that he will ever cause her pain but she was mute she couldntopen her mouth to speak and it frustrated her without anything else to do she stayed as still as she was and listened prepared for another vision to flash before her only none came you will come across a fork in the road today with your love the path you will take together is meaningful for your future the choice is up to you whether you choose the white road or the red one go to the white and all will go well until death do you part go with the red and it will be as if nothing had ever occurred between you as she finished her speech the flame extinguished and all was left of it was a trail of gray smoke the symbols on ginny palms disappeared as though they never existed and ginny was able to think more clearly and move freely once more thank you was all ginny could say she knew she wanted to say more than that to protest somehow to ask questions she wasntsure about she didntunderstand half the things she was told good luck ginevra madame asha said in her deep mystical voice and nodded once ginny left the room a little shaken she wasntsure if she should take this experience seriously it seemed even beyond serious but the words she repeated to herself in her head just didntmake much sense she handed parvati the money she owed for the visit not paying much attention to the question her friend asked her and went outside to meet up with ron ron lifted his gaze when a shadow covered his eyes he let out another sigh when he saw it was hermione standing before him just like she said he thought back to the seer words until she had actually appeared he wasntsure if he should trust what the seer had said to him only here she was standing before him looking into his eyes with an expression he could not quite figure out hello ron she said in a small voice we need to talk he said and grimaced at the firmness of his own voice she nodded quickly erm the three broomsticks he suggested feebly she nodded again tucking a long curl of her hair behind her ear nervously he was glad he wasntthe only one of them who wasntfeeling this way sounds good she said ron pushed himself away from the wall and straightened his body he couldntlook into her eyes for much longer and had to shift his gaze and look at something else but from the corner of his eyes he thought he saw her shift her shoulder in a weird way like someone just touched her but it couldntbe they were alone just the two of them oh wait a second she suddenly called and he turned to look at her reluctantly hoping he wouldntget lost by the beauty of her eyes did you happen to see ginny i was looking for her earlier oh yeah she in there he pointed back to madame asha place then he cursed silently i was supposed to wait for her dontworry she said quickly i sure she ll manage on her own we really need to talk right he said slowly not quite sure what was up with her he saw hermione turn around for a second before she looked back at him with a little smile on her adoring lips the odd move made him want to ask her what was wrong but he let it go there were more important things to discuss right now as harry took ron place and leaned against the wall still hidden beneath his cloak he watched him and hermione head down together to the three broomsticks it was strange but he couldntfight off the smile when he was looking at them he really wished them well even when it was ron weasley his long time enemy the hatred he once felt towards him was now gone he wasntsure when exactly it happened was it when he made his amends with hermione or when he finally started seeing ginny even so his goal right now was to talk to ginny before he d try to talk to him and make him accept his feelings for his sister because if things didntwork out well today between them there could be a chance that he may not need to talk to him after all he lingered about five more minutes before he noticed the crowd of girls not too far from him had started screaming and pushing again a moment later his eyes caught upon a gleam of red which he could not mistake it was her and she was coming close to him pushing her small frame from the mass of girls until she was finally free she stopped and looked around surely looking for her brother and couldntfind him he wasntsure how he should approach her but he knew he must do it now or all be doomed he took five quick steps and he was standing behind her she was still unaware of his presence he took in a deep breath ginny he whispered and was not surprised to see her jump and turn around at the sound of her name he caught her wrists in his hands and she froze not sure what was touching her exactly it okay it just me he said in a soothing voice and watched her relax but only little she was still a bit cautious harry she whispered looking down at her wrists where he held her yeah she looked up and he was sure she was trying to look at his eyes but her own eyes only focus on the blank air around her why canti see you what kind a spell is it he lifted one hand and touched her cheek lightly he watched her lean gently into his touch feeling the silky texture of the cloak on her skin she hummed softly and closed her eyes he shook his head but realized immediately that she did not see it you cantsee me because i have an invisibility cloak on oh she said simply as though having an invisibility cloak was the most common thing she opened her eyes and looked up to where she guessed his eyes must be but they only reached his nose where ron he had some matters to sort out with hermione she nodded and then looked up again you said you couldntcome you changed your mind i just didntwant to hurt you anymore he explained but why canti see you she asked again pressing on the matter it complicated he answered i dontwant you to get into this but let just say that i cantbe seen here i couldnttell you before but i also couldntstand you staying mad at me we only just started dating and here we are already fighting that not how i wanted it to be and now it came to a point where i just didntcare anymore because it was stronger than me i want to see you she said her voice only pleading a little even when harry deep down still remembered the promise he violated he couldntdeny her request he wanted her to see him too he wanted to be able to walk around freely just like her to hold her hand and not touch her through an enchanted fabric he knew he couldntdo it he couldntbe seen but would it really hurt anyone if she was the only one who could see he asked himself not here he said she nodded once more understanding immediately she closed her fingers around his invisible hand and tugged lightly somewhere more private then and he let her lead the way i must say this is not quite what i pictured for our first date but it better than nothing ginny said when they walked together side by side she was still holding his hand and she was quite sure she saw a few people shooting her strange looks when they caught her talking apparently to no one she giggled at the thought but couldntcare less because harry was with her finally even if he was invisible i sorry this is not what you expected i hope to make it up to you next time he said oh and to make you see how sorry i am ginny looked to her left where she knew he was standing with a puzzled look when he didntcompete his sentence and noticed the tip of his wand appear out of thin air she heard him mutter a spell and saw a jet of yellow light hit a small sparrow that flew up in the sky above them the sparrow started to swell and its gray brown feathers turned pink it grew two triangle ears until they were too long and flipped over its beak got flat rounded up and became fleshier until it was a snout ginny stared at it completely struck it was not a sparrow anymore but a pig with sparrow wings and it was flying in circles squealing and snorting out of surprise ginny started to laugh and caught the attention of a few more people who also stared at the flying pig and started to point and laugh you re crazy she whispered at harry when she calmed down she pointed her own wand at the pig and turned it back to a sparrow and watched as it flew away she heard him chuckle well you said you ll talk to me again when pigs would fly when that didnthappen i had to take some action she giggled squeezing his hand in hers and feeling his do the same so am i forgiven he asked i need to see you before i ll forgive you she replied and tugged on his hand again still guiding their way she wasntsure where she was taking him but she needed to find some isolated place where no one will see them they walked several more steps until their path was blocked by the fence viewing the shrieking shack she looked to her left and saw in the distance of the snow patched road a small group of trees she turned to her right and noticed a madden path leading to an empty narrow alley then she froze and the words madame asha had spoken to her merely minutes ago words she had forgotten staring to swarm back into her head you will come across a fork in the road today with your love the path you will take together is meaningful for your future the choice is up to you whether you choose the white road or the red one go to the white and all will go well until death do you part go with the red and it will be as if nothing had ever occurred between you this was it ginny thought this is what she meant the fork in the road the red and the white the red road was the muddy path on the right which led to the empty alley if they choose to go there it will be like nothing ever occurred between them everything will be lost they will come apart and if they choose the white road the snowy trail on the left all will go well until death parts us ginny repeated to herself she suddenly realized the meaning behind the phrase marriage this is the pure future she could ever hope for herself only she wasntin a position right now to decide whether she wanted it with harry they were on their first date how was she supposed to know right at this moment if she wanted them to get married then the rest of the prophecy flooded her mind the boy who is standing outside and waiting for you loves you greatly he will protect you it only hit home at that exact moment madame asha had meant harry all along he was waiting for her outside he loves her and she knew without any doubt in her heart that he will protect her in time of need he was her future her pure white future but what was with the rest of the prophecy he can also cause you ginny harry asked cutting ginny mid thought she looked up to the sound of his voice searching his invisible face yes she asked weakly are you okay do you want to head back he asked with concern she shook her head there was only one place where she wanted to go with him right now she flashed him a smile everything fine let go here she said pulling him with her to the group of trees where their future together waited she had to admit it looked more inviting more romantic than a narrow and filthy alley harry chuckled again oblivious to her musings i wished i would have brought some butterbeer later maybe she said pulling him behind the trees in a second harry head covered with a smug smile had appeared from underneath his cloak looking around to check they were indeed alone she did her own checking before she didntneed him to do it himself we re alone she promised yeah he breathed and his eyes were focused on her lips she smiled in return and leaned over and touched her lips to his he sighed into the kiss and took her small frame into his arms pulling her closer to him while still kissing him ginny took hold of the silky invisible fabric of the cloak and pulled it off his shoulders and tossed it to the snowy ground revealing the rest of his body much better she said between kisses and harry nodded completely focused on kissing her did you forgive me yet he asked cheekily as he drew his lips from hers and started kissing her neck instead she was so lost in their moment that she forgot how to speak enjoying the hot feeling of his mouth on her neck she merely nodded in response she could feel his warm breathe on her skin and a small shiver ran up her spine sending goosebumps from her shoulders and down to her toes they pulled apart after a moment both panting for air and giddy from the kiss for a moment ginny wondered how was it possible there was snow all around them when she felt so hot all of the sudden i think i ll take that butterbeer now she said still breathing hard harry ran his hand through his hair nodding do you want me to go get the drinks he looked up and she noticed his cheeks were red she knew she looked just as mess as he did um no i ll go you stay here she meant to protest she thought he said he couldntbe seen she didntwant to ask questions that he wouldntbe comfortable answering so she chose not to say anything she got her answer however when she watched him pull the cloak back over himself i ll be right back he whispered before he disappeared once more dontsteal anything she called after him and heard him chuckle in response harry wasntsure how he was supposed to get into the three broomsticks without revealing himself but he didntwant to make ginny do the job he wanted to show her he was gentlemanly enough to get his lady her drink even in his situation when he reached the door of the pub he waited not quite positive whether it would be a good idea to open it himself it would look strange if the door will open on its own so he waited fortunately for him he didntwait long a minute later two old wizards left the pub and harry hurriedly pushed himself inside before the door got shut again now is the hard part he thought as he walked over to the busy bar careful not to bump into someone he looked around noticing the patrons that were merrily chatting and shamelessly flirting with an overloaded madame rosmerta everyone looked busy and oblivious to him harry quickly pulled out of his pocket 4 sickles and called in a fake rough tone two butterbeers to go rosmerta luckily no one seemed to look for the voice without a face madame rosmerta too preoccupied with her other customers took the money quickly and placed two bottles of the golden beverage without even looking away once from the people who she had a conversation with thankful for that harry swiftly hidden them under his cloak and turned around to leave as he passed the tables on his way out his eyes focused on the very back of the pub and a smile spread on his lips there were ron and hermione leaning in for a kiss glad that things had worked well for them as well harry chuckled silently to himself and made his way to the door the noisy chatter around the pub had ceased at once when an ear splitting scream came from the main street every head in the small tavern rose with a start the bottles in harry hand had slipped away from his grip and shuttered to the floor no one seemed to notice the small incident because every eye in the room was seeing the same thing harry did the mass of people on the main street running and screaming in fright and in the skies was reflecting a great green skull with a snake protruding from its mouth death eaters someone yelled and the silence in the pub was replaced with a wave of screams just like in the street outside the entire population of the three broomsticks started to scramble for the door and harry white faced was out with the rest of them they started to run and apparate away students of the school were running back to the castle crying and calling for help only harry stood frozen in the middle of the street trying to understand what was happening it couldntbe his fault it just couldntbe he whispered to himself harry he spun around to the sound of his name hermione was running towards him a frantic look on her face ron was just behind her then harry realized that he didnthave his cloak on anymore he looked around but he couldntsee it anywhere he knew that it must have fallen off when people had started pushing around him on their way out of the pub there was no time to go back and look for it now harry hermione called again trying to catch his attention harry mind was too dazed by the overwhelming occurrence at the moment his eyes couldntfocus much on hermione it was his fault his fault everyone was in danger because of him how stupid and reckless could he have been he felt himself shaking his whole body convulsing into tremors harry we need to go do you hear me hermione yelled holding him by the forearms and giving him a little shake to make it snap back to reality where is ginny harry at the sound of her name harry snapped to attention at once his eyes focused on hermione brown ones searching but he wasntsure what exactly ginny he asked weakly hermione nodded frantically ron stepped over and pushed her away from him he stood face to face with harry glaring menacingly where did you leave my sister potter ron now not the time hermione screamed just when a jet of light hit the wall of the pub behind them we ve got to go they re getting closer ginny must be already on her way back to the castle with all his will harry forced himself to clear the fog that had clouded his brain ginny he let out a scream looking around and running back to the direction of the group of trees where he last saw her harry no come back he heard hermione scream at him but he didntstop to look back at her curses and spells flew all around him but he didntsee who shot them he dodged them easily his wand already in his hand ready to fight back but he didntcare all he cared about was finding ginny and make sure she was safe he told her to wait for him so he needed to see if she listened to him what if she was still there he couldntleave her behind his own life meant so little to him right now ginny he screamed again with all the air he held in his lungs but he couldntsee her anywhere he couldnteven see her where he left her ginny harry over there he heard hermione voice he turned around swiftly and saw her and ron running over to him hermione was pointing to the ground several feet between them to the pebbled street her hair was always the first thing he looked for and there it was vivid red as ever spread over the whiteness of the snow on the ground realizing she was lying motionless harry sprang into a sprint calling her name over and over and hoping that he was not too late and she would raise her head at the sound of his voice he was at her side a few seconds later and rolled her to her back ginny he sighed in relief seeing her breathing and her eyes fluttering she opened them and looked up at him and immediately they started to water with tears the sight of that crushed his heart and he sniffed through his nose forcing himself not to cry he couldntlet her see him cry he needed to look strong i sorry baby i so sorry ginny ron called as he knelt beside her as well hermione stood a few feet back watching out for any death eaters anxiously are you okay are you hurt she shook her head a little no i dontthink so she said feebly i saw the death eaters and started to run but i stumbled and fell can you get up harry asked hoping to get them out of here as soon as possible he could still hear people screaming as they ran away from the corner of his eye he noticed several black figures walking in the streets shooting spells and another group of people fighting them back she nodded pushing herself on her elbows and then shifted her weight to her feet when she tried to stand up harry and ron gave her a little room watching her with cautious eyes she stood still for a second but then swayed and her eyes rolled back into her head harry caught her quickly in his arms before she hit the ground her eyes fluttered open again and she let out a low protesting moan she too weak to walk i ll have to carry her back harry told ron ron nodded and grabbed hermione arm harry swept ginny into his arms and they all started to run to the castle he fell behind them as little and light as ginny was to him holding her body was slowing him down but he knew he had to keep running for her sake at least if not his own harry look out hermione suddenly screamed and without even thinking he ducked down shielding ginny body with his own he saw the curse coming their way and knew it would hit him in the back a second two seconds three had passed and he saw he was still safe alarmed that somehow it hit ginny he looked at her face but even though he eyes were closed she was still breathing he looked up then and noticed a glowing shield charm covering them he turned to see who cast the charm and saw that someone was standing behind them his arms were spread out to his sides and his wand was in his hands harry thought he was looking at some bright light but quickly realized what that whiteness was and he was completely speechless what are you doing draco screamed looking down at harry i canthold the shield much longer go get her back to the castle but harry shook his head knowing exactly at that moment what he should do he sprang to his feet and ran over the ron and hermione where they waited for him he carefully placed ginny in her brother arms and looked at their bewildered expressions take her back he told ron with evident confidence in his voice what about you he asked harry looked at ginny peaceful face they re here for me he mumbled quietly he raised his head and looked back at draco noticing him shooting spell after spell at the approaching death eaters are you mad this isntthe dueling club at school this is for real we ve got to get out of here now harry shook his head in return i know what i doing get her back harry draco screamed from behind i ll fight them off go harry said to ron with definitive tone in his voice ginny eyes opened again and they locked on him harry don t she whispered i sorry gin he said he exchanged one last glance with ron before he and hermione stated to run again harry turned around to face draco but shut his eyes when he heard ginny protesting shouts no don t take me back to him ron harry wiping off a single tear harry stepped next to draco and started shooting spells at the death eaters thank you draco harry said solemnly while escaping a stunner thank me later if we make it back draco said through gritted teeth casting another shield around them they could see the small group of aurors coming their way to help that was quite noble of you what you did back there yeah guess that not very slytherin of me to do dontbe stupid draco scolded come on let go they ve got it he said seeing the aurors now taking action and covering for them he grabbed harry arm and they started to run they came to a halt when they heard several pops and dumbledore and the order forces had appeared out of thin air harry eyes widened with shock when he noticed his parents remus and sirius were running towards them harry his mother called alarmed hi mum he said in a small voice get down draco yelled and pushed harry to the ground and rolled himself to the opposite direction splitting them apart another red light nearly hit them lily potter recovered quickly from her shock and shot a stunner back at the death eaters who aimed at them she hit it squarely in the chest and he dropped down unconscious to the floor nice hit mum harry said with admiration james your son is here get back to the castle right this second young man harry heard his father angry voice no you re all here i staying he insisted he got back to his feet and looked back searching for draco he saw him shooting several more spells at a death eater and managing to knock him out cold he turned to look at the fighting scene but stumbled back and fell on his behind when a death eater was standing right in front of him his wand pointed straight at him the death eater took off his mask revealing his face harry didntrecognize him he was short and fat had dark hair and a long nose and he was leering at harry and cackling a laugh expelliarmus he called and harry wand shot from beneath his hand and into his harry gulped not daring to call for some help or look away even for a friction of a second the death eater pointed his wand exactly at harry heart he gave one last sneer before he called out avada kedavra harry shot his eyes firmly and heard his mother deafening scream harry nooo harry felt like he was hit by a large stone his body was thrown a few feet back and collided with a wall he opened his eyes sure he would see heaven but he was still in hogsmeade watching death eaters and aurors and his parents running to him he wondered how was it possible that he was still alive after being hit by the killing curse he tried to breathe and found it a little hard a great weight was lying on his chest pressing on his lungs harry still a little dazed looked around the squat death eater who shot the curse at him was now lying on the ground tied by invisible ropes sirius was pointing three wands at him not too far from there remus was standing over two more stunned death eaters everything was quite all of the sudden his mother was holding his face in her hands stroking it tenderly while tears flooded her eyes in heavy streams his father crouched down to him and picked up something large into his arms and carried it away suddenly harry felt the heavy feeling being lifted away from him i so sorry sweetheart his mother was saying to him confused he looked at his father noticing the grim look on his face at his feet lay a body he could only see the legs the face was covered with his father cloak but he didntneed to see the face to know who lay there he let out a sob feeling his eyes sting with tears that he finally allowed to flow no he cried in agony his best friend saved his life and gave his own in return his best friend which he never really made amends with was now dead he could never ask him for forgiveness again no he screamed he fell into his mother embrace and cried while she rocked him it cantbe i so sorry harry i so sorry she whispered her own voice chocked up a few minutes had passed and the pain refused to go away harry knew it would take much more than that until it disappeared if it ever would he was walking to the school infirmary his parents by his side guiding the way because he couldntsee much all he kept seeing was the still body of his best friend his father pushed open the door to the hospital wing the room was full with scared students harry didntsee he could only hear their voices harry he heard ginny voice and he was suddenly engulfed into a warm hug the smell of flowers entered his nose but as much as he wanted to respond to her he couldntfeel anything you prat i was worried sick thank goodness you re okay dontyou ever do that to me again you understand you could have died out there when he didntsay or do anything in return she pulled back and looked with a puzzled expression at his parents receiving a painful look in return from both she took his face in her hands and made him look her in the eyes what wrong he couldnthold it in anymore the sob burst out and he couldntstop it he wrapped his arms around her and buried his face in her neck crying his heart out completely taken aback ginny held him close and ran her hand up and down his back soothingly draco he whispered in pain and let out another sob the room fell into deadly silence and only hermione who was sitting in the back let out a gasp of horror oh my god a n like i said fluff mixed with angst i hope i didntdepress you too much and that you liked it and in case you wondered then no i didntplan for draco to die when i started this story but that where it was heading lately and i quite happy with the result i sorry if you liked him and now

books differently than the way i did it all because i started this story before hbp came out so i sticking the universe and the version that i d built in my head chapter 19 until death do us part part 2 harry rested his head on his bedroom windowsill back in their house at godric hollow looking outside the steamed up glass and thought that everything outside looked completely lifeless the morning sky was a dull gray not even casting down a fleck of snow or a drop of rain the wind had not blown in hours not one soul was to be seen outside not even birds nestling on tree branches or people coming out of their houses on their way to work everything had turned gray and still and silent the world seemed to be so much different now he never thought that losing someone he cared about will make him feel so empty life seemed to have no meaning anymore what was the point of living if people got hurt and killed and all because of him and his mistakes harry sighed dejectedly and closed his eyes against the stream of images that flooded his mind images of that damned day of the battle in the streets of hogsmeade that he wanted so much to seal away somewhere and never see again he wiped his face with the sleeve of his shirt and sniffed there was a soft knock on the door behind him but he ignored it still looking outside the window at the motionless street outside the door opened slightly and he heard someone walking inside and stopping to stand just behind him harry didntbother to turn around to see which one of his parents had walked into his room the heavy footfalls must be his father s he assumed you ve got to stop this moping thing his father voice called from behind harry silently nodded to himself in appreciation for his good guess it not good for you harry simply shrugged his shoulders indifferently still not bothering to turn and look at his father eyes james sighed look it been two days since you came back home and you barely left your room your mother is worried about you if you dontcare about yourself then at least do her the favor and join us at the table i not hungry harry muttered quietly in return his eyes glued on the patches of snow that remained on the grass outside from the day before i wasntasking james said sternly you donthave to eat anything just sit down with us show your mother that you re doing better harry honestly didntknow whether he was doing better or not but his father was right he could at least pretend he was improving he took in a deep breath working really hard not to lose his temper at his father as annoying as his parents could be right now he didnthave the heart to lash out at his father he knew that he only wanted the best for him he pushed himself from the windowsill and stood up he didntlook at his father face but down at the floor he felt his father hand resting on his shoulder guiding him down the stairs and into the kitchen his mother was thrilled to see him there obviously not really expecting him to give up his moping and come down very quickly before harry even registered what she was doing she prepared him a bowl full of cereal his father pushed him into his chair and both his parents took their seats at the table for a moment he wondered if it was all a set up i not hungry he repeated his earlier words lily looked at him with small disappointment on her face she reached across the table and took his hand in hers harry looked up to her face and saw the tiny smile she forced on he knew she was trying to make him feel better just a few bites or you ll starve yourself harry thought about it for a second feeling his stomach twisting and begging for food he nodded and she flashed him a wider smile when he took a spoonful of cereal into his mouth his stomach appreciated it and started to growl with satisfaction despite his earlier objections about his lack of appetite once he started to eat he couldntstop until he finished the whole bowl he didnteven know he was that hungry thank you he said once he was done he pushed back his chair and stood up from the table and meant to leave the room but his father quickly grabbed his wrist and stopped him wait a minute harry sit down there is something you mother and i discussed and wanted to share with you james lily hissed i dontthink now is the right time for that both adults glanced intensely at each other for a moment before james said it as good time as ever lils what is it harry asked slightly interested he sat back in his chair and looked at them seeing the exchange of looks between them lily finally nodded at her husband and grabbed harry hand again while james cleared his throat in order to get his son attention harry your mother and i thought that maybe it will be good for you to meet with a counselor again not for long just a few sessions a counselor harry repeated confused his eyebrows knitted together muggle shrinks again he asked with a voice mixed with anger and doubt the last time he d done sessions like this it only made him think he was crazy and did nothing to make him feel that it was supposed to help him with anything it all happened a few years ago when his parents kept fighting with him about his choice to stay in slytherin thinking there must have been something wrong with him when he decided that he liked it there no of course not his father denied there a counseling healer that we d like you to see it nothing like last time we think that it would be best if you d talk to someone since you wonttalk to us it just talking son harry turned to look at his mother seeing the pained expression on her face she diverted her eyes down at the table refusing to look at him while he took it all in a counseling healer usually meant that there was something wrong had he really been that much of a lost cause that his parents wanted him to see a healer he couldntbelieve that a counseling healer would do him any good now if it didntback then but the determined look he saw on his parents faces made him consider it for a moment he knew it would make them a lot calmer if he didntfight against it i guess a few sessions wonthurt he answered quietly he heard his mother let out a long sigh that she d probably been holding in for a few minutes and he felt her squeeze his hand in assurance when i ll talk to the healer and ask if tomorrow morning will be a good time james said tomorrow harry asked a little alarmed but the funeral is tomorrow morning lily looked up at him harry i dontthink it would a good idea if you go no harry called loudly standing up abruptly and knocking his chair back to the floor all the anger he d been trying to hold in for the last two days was suddenly bursting out you cantdo this i have to be there harry james said firmly also standing up things are a little tense right now and mrs malfoy she blames me for draco death doesntshe harry asked hurt of course not honey his mother quickly interjected no one blames you she just hurt and alone and i sure it hard for her to lose her only child what happened to draco wasntyour fault harry bowed his head shamefully yes it is he said quietly if i had listened to remus warnings none of this would have happened harry lily sighed he looked up his eyes red once more please i have to go it the last time i can show him that i cared that i didntmean to do this i have to pay my respects lily and james exchanged one more look before they both nodded wordlessly at him okay lily said i ll tell the healer to set an appointment for the afternoon thank you harry whispered and then turned to the door and shuffled back up to his room once again classes at hogwarts had been canceled for a week the overwhelming knowledge of what happened to draco malfoy had all the students and teachers in shock no one had their mind straight enough to keep things going as usual mcgonagall had tried to maintain a normal school day trying to teach like nothing had happened but to no avail she had slowly given up as well and dismissed all her students back to their common rooms everyone grieved it was such hypocrisy for people to act like that ginny thought but she couldnthelp but feel the same way they did draco malfoy may have been a bully who most of the school hated but knowing now that he died especially of the way he had knowing that he will no longer walk through the castle hallways had done something to her and apparently to every person in the castle the usual cheerful murmurings that filled the great hall each morning at breakfast were absent today instead people kept to themselves barely touching their food reading the articles in the newspapers bowing their heads together and whispering to themselves as though afraid to speak loudly the entire slytherin table was quite every face held grief and it only made everyone else feel worse no one knew what to say they all felt sorry that they hated the boy who was murdered and never had a chance to get to know him better ginny was surprised when mcgonagall had approached her this morning with an unexpected question she had asked if she will be attending the funeral since professor dumbledore had thought that it will be respectful for close friends to say their final goodbye to draco ginny was at a loss of words and looked at her head of house with a blank expression on her face not sure what to say to call malfoy her friend would have to be a joke and up until what happened two days ago she thought she will hate him forever it was probably only because she was close to harry who was draco best friend that mcgonagall thought that she had any connection to him personally ginny then remembered harry agonized face when he was brought to the hospital wing that day and her heart broke all over again at the memory she knew it would probably mean a lot to harry if she was there with him she knew he needed some support to deal with it she recalled how hysterical he later became how he started shouting that it was his fault and how he was forced to take a calming draught until his parents thought it would be better if they took him home for a while while mcgonagall waited for ginny lost response hermione who had stood by her side at that moment chose to take over and told her they would both be attending ginny had looked at her friend with so many questions in her eyes hermione simply shrugged and said sometimes it better to leave the past behind at that moment ginny admired her friend so much for the selfless act she had no motive behind it she simply thought it would be a good idea to show some respect for a fellow student no matter how he treated them in the past he didntdeserve to be buried at the age of 16 and he was innocent when he died he was trying to protect them from the death eaters acting selflessly himself an attitude ginny had never thought she d witness in a malfoy so later that day at the funeral ginny had found herself in the cemetery standing in the shade of a large oak tree while she watched the crowd from afar some of them were unfamiliar to her while some of them she knew whether from school or the newspapers it seemed like the entire slytherin house and the complete school staff had arrived she wore a set of casual black school robes since she didnthave anything else with her at hogwarts and had pulled her hair back into a ponytail her hands were wrapped around herself she wasntsure of which reason the chilling wind or the insecure feeling she had in that moment ginny ginny turned back to see ron walking over to her his hands deep down in the pockets of his own school robes he stopped by her side and looked the same way she had been looking before i surprised to see you here she commented and turned her gaze back to the gathering crowd she saw him shrug his shoulders by the corner of her eye hermione he explained simply he let out a long sigh merlin how i hated his guts i cantbelieve i standing at his funeral it so surreal she grimaced i know is hermione here yes i couldntgo with her over there it felt wrong somehow they fell into silence for a long moment they watched narcissa malfoy wearing a black dress and an elegant matching hat sobbing quietly while people walked over to share their condolences she turned her eyes to search the crowd ron seemed to know who she was looking for is he here she nodded arrived with his parents about ten minutes ago he standing with zabini and parkinson now ron bounced on the balls on his feet uncomfortably i think you should go over to him he said ginny turned to look at him with slight surprise on her face and he shrugged again he d appreciate it he explained ginny smiled faintly at her brother not quite believing what she was hearing could it be that ron somehow came to accept that harry was now in her life for good she sighed as she watched harry from afar seeing the torn look on his face and noticing the way he wrapped his arms around himself protectively i want to but i dontknow what to say to him i ve never been in this situation before maybe i should give him some time let him come to me when he feels that he needs me i mean i told him once that i ll always be there for him i just didntthink it would be this hard she turned to look at him see what he had to say about that her eyes were slightly squinted from the wind that was hitting her face ron held a mystified look on his face like he was contemplating the right answer after a long moment of silence he said i not hermione so my advice cantbe that good but i think you should imagine if the situation was reversed and it was you standing there at a friend funeral then what would you want him to do would you want some time for yourself or to have him at your side ginny contemplated ron words and she didnthave a specific answer she didntknow what she would want she couldnteven imagine it happening to her and if she didntknow what she would want how could she know what harry wanted they haventbeen together for long and she realized she doesntknow everything about him besides he has his friends and family with him he could use their support right now it was more than what she could offer him anyway finally she decided that she d give him some time to himself and in order to show him that she did still care she would write him a letter later on today se told ron her final decision he didntseem to understand it much but he also didntlinger on the matter does he at least know that you re here he asked ginny leaned back against the tree trunk and looked down at the ground shuffling her foot in the snow covered grass i sure he does it wontbe hard to guess with hermione being there they watched quietly as the ceremony began ginny shuddered when she saw the coffin and how it was lowered into the hole in the ground and she couldnthelp the tears steaming when she heard the distinct cries of a mother who lost her child of the people who lost their friend she had to dug her heal into the ground to stop herself from heading over there to harry she wanted to be there for him to embrace him in her arms and show him she cared but she didnthave enough courage to do it she was weak with overflowing emotions and didntknow what to do so she stayed where she was do you know if they caught em yet ron asked in a slur after the whole thing was over and people had started to separate they were now walking to where the portkeys were ginny had turned around to see harry one more time see if he was looking for her but he was huddled together with blaise zabini his parents and professor lupin she could barely pick his messy black hair out of the muddle of people who ginny asked not quite following she turned back to look down the road they walked and could see hermione waiting for them in the end of the square whoever did it those death eaters that managed to escape did they catch any of them she shook her head i dontknow i haventheard anything although i quite positive there wontbe anything about it in the papers people will start to freak out when they hear there had been another death eater attack and that they managed to escape again but now that the whole school and half the village of hogsmeade witnessed it it wonttake long for the news to come out people say they were aiming for harry you know nonsense she dismissed angrily i dontknow maybe they re right you didntsee it ginny you were pretty unconscious at the time he stayed there to fight he told me they came for him she looked up at him why would they come after harry her voice challenged and she feared his answer might sound logical well i can only guess they work for lucius malfoy dontthey and he worked for you know who if you look back and think about it you know who tried to kill the potters years ago only sirius black stopped him and he didntfinish the job maybe lucius malfoy was trying to do it now and wanted to start with harry the easiest target ginny let that sink for a moment it made sense but there were so many missing pieces in the puzzle that she didntwant to believe it until she heard the whole story from a reliable source why would you know who come after harry for what reason i dontwant to talk about it ron she said finally and sighed feeling a little defeated all right he shrugged but there is something that i sure about i bet right now lucius malfoy is having a fit in his prison cell he wontbe happy with his death eaters killing his son that for sure the ministry needs to keep a close eye on him i say i just hope all those death eaters will rot in azkaban for the rest of their lives me too ginny muttered hey hermione she said once they finally reached her hermione gave her a quick smile ron reached for her hand and entwined their fingers together while they walked further to take the portkey back to the school gates ginny was glad to see them together again even in times like this it was nice to see people who could work out their problems and be happy to show that there was still hope left somewhere she felt the stabbing feeling that she should have went to greet harry but she forced herself not to think about it too much she wanted to think that her decision to give him time to grieve was the right thing to do did he say anything to you ginny asked hermione later when they were back in the girls dormitories who harry not much just hello there wasntreally a right time we could talk you know he was pretty distant and cold i could see it was very hard for him to maintain his composure but at least he wasnthysterical hermione said her words stung and ginny couldntbelieve she hadntbeen there after all but dontworry things will work out give him some time he went back home with his parents ginny noted hermione nodded i think it good they ll help him get through it she spouted in remorse i so stupid i should have been there for him hermione looked at her sympathetically ginny i sure your support will mean a lot to him but right now maybe it best that he has his parents guidance he needs to know how to grieve you wontbe able to do much for him when he in this state you ll only be a distraction and he wontbe able to move on like he should you ll see him in a couple of days and things will work out trust me one month later things had gone pretty much back to normal maybe it was the sudden change of the unusually warm weather for that time of the year that had kindled everyone spirits or maybe what they all needed was time to get over their emotions to let things settle down but the school was as alive as ever it was nearly the end of february and it looked like spring might have come much earlier this year the snow had started to finally melt although it was not completely gone green patches of grass were revealed in the grounds outside trees and flowers had sprouted and turned green and bloomed in so many colors the sun shone in the bright blue sky and birds began to sing again when harry stepped through the school gates it was with a heavy feeling in his chest but he still had hope that he could manage it being back here should mean he was back to normal back to being himself again but only harry himself knew that hew was a different person now and today was the first day of the new life he had planned for himself remus met him by the gates and walked him back to the castle they both had gotten much closer over the past few weeks remus had visited godric hollow a lot while harry had been there the only few days he didntshow up were around the time when he had his full moon transformation feeling well harry asked his professor who had now become a close friend remus smiled swinging his arm around harry scrawny shoulders as good as i can feel after being chained to the walls inside the shrieking shack in the cold nights he laughed faintly but stopped at harry grimace he forgot how easy it was for him to talk about his transformations while harry still took it hard he cleared his throat and tried to keep in conversation how about you harry harry nodded observing the place cantsay really it ll be hard i know i promise i ll help you catch up with your school work and not just in defense against the dark arts thank you remus harry said with a kind smile they stopped in the middle of the entrance hall and remus turned to face harry still keeping a strong arm on one of his shoulders leave your trunk here harry i ll have it sent to your dorm you go and join your friends for breakfast harry wrinkled his nose slightly his left hand went to rub his stomach cantreally eat anything did you really think that lily potter would send her son to hogwarts on an empty stomach remus let out a barking laugh no i guess not he patted harry shoulder twice come to my office this evening i ll have all the course materials that you missed by then i will harry said and they parted each going to their separate way so how is he ron asked ginny as they went down the staircases to the great hall ron had been asking the same question for the past few days and up until now ginny had managed to avoid him but she was running out of ideas on how to change the subject so she sighed letting out a frustrated breath she d been holding for a while and said i dontknow he didntanswer to any of my letters hmm was all ron said it made ginny seethe knowing he was half pleased that she didnttalk to harry at all since he left school a month ago any hope that he came to terms with their relationship flew out the window at that moment what made ginny feel even angrier was not harry behavior and completely ignoring her but that she actually stayed back on the day of the funeral and didntgo to him when she obviously should have she was sure that by staying away that day harry probably felt some sort of resentment towards her or else he would have written back to her one letter or a tiny note would have been fine she just needed to know that he was okay and that he was not mad at her she hoped that this morning a snowy owl would land at the gryffindor table and bring her some sort of news from him they were about to go down the final staircase to the entrance hall when they saw hermione coming up the stairs heading toward them looking very tense she stopped right in front of them panting slightly ginny she said her voice wheezing as she tried to catch her breath hermione are you okay ginny asked with concern ron made a move to hold her to him but she shoved him away gently gulping and taking one large breath before she let it all out i fine did you happen to hear from harry lately ginny rolled her eyes is that all those two are thinking about she asked herself betting everything she owned that they were talking about her behind her back no she huffed angrily you already knew that hermione you donthave to rub it in why do you ask anyway well hermione eyes turned slightly guilty then you re not going to like what i have to say ginny pushed past her and made her way down to the entrance hall feeling a little hungry by now and not wanting to skip breakfast she still had the tiny expectation to receive a letter as the owls swoop in with the post hermione tried to catch her shoulder and stop her but ginny shrug her off i dontlike half the things you say hermione yet you always say them anyway i i i thought dean was just trying to work me up but when neville confirmed it i started to wonder hermione rambled and ginny rolled her eyes ginny started to get a little impatient what is it hermione and how does it relate to harry she walked into the great hall with hermione still trying to push her back out and ron shooting them weird looks trying to catch on so i checked it myself and i saw it was true and i swear i didntknow i ran to find you as soon i found out ginny please stop for a minute hermione leave me alone i want to go get some breakfast ginny growled he here hermione hissed ginny froze in her place and stopped fighting wrenching her shoulders from hermione grip who here she asked in a quiet voice potter ron then said with a blank note in his voice ginny turned to them not quite understanding what they meant hermione held a serious look on her face her eyes apologizing ron eyes were diverted to the other far side of the hall towards the slytherin house table which there unmistakably sat her so called boyfriend harry potter sipping on a goblet of bloody pumpkin juice oh she simply said not sure what she was feeling right now she chose to think about it walked to the gryffindor table and sat in a vacant seat with her back to the slytherin table so she wouldntbe shooting looks or jinxes for that matter at him well arentyou going to talk to him hermione said sitting next to her and looking closely at her face searching to see if there was some sort of a rage attack about to come from ginny ginny turned a blank look at her blinking her eyes a few times and staring at black space umm no not right now anyway hermione didntsay anything else but she kept watching her closely ginny felt a little uncomfortable under her peering gaze she turned to look at her and forced a small smile on her face i ll talk to him later i sure he wants to catch up with his friends first ginny knew she would not be able to concentrate in her classes until she talked to harry she needed to know why he ignored her letters and didntcome to see her when he got back remembering that his first class today should be charms she waited outside flitwick classroom for him to show up five minutes before the bell was supposed to ring he came alone which surprised her at first that he wasntaccompanied by blaise zabini it made her wonder about it for a second before she remembered her purpose for being here harry stopped in his tracks when he saw her she pushed herself away from the wall she was leaning on and quietly walked over to him she stopped to stand only a few feet from him she saw his shoulders square and his adam apple bob nervously up and down in his throat ginny hi he said thickly she had the urge to shout at him dontyou ginny hi me but held herself back she was slightly angry with him but she needed to be patient at first in order to see if her anger was justified when did you get back she asked in a quiet voice er earlier before breakfast she nodded i wrote to you but i guess the post got lost on the way or else you would have written back right she asked with a challenge in her voice and a raise of her eyebrows he sighed and ran his hand through his thick hair making it stand out more than the usual i seven letters ginny suddenly called startling him he winced i know she held out her hands to the sides waiting to see if he would say more than that it didntmake any sense to her at all why would he do that when he didntadd anything else her patience grew short did you even bother to open them she asked slowly fearing his answer he lowered his gaze to the floor and didntsay anything although his body language gave her the answer she didntwant to receive i sorry he said after a moment there was no hint in his voice that he actually meant it i can explain she wrapped her arms together and waited i listening she said evenly i was a complete mess i got so many letters and i didntopen any of them not just yours and that supposed to make me feel better i was worried about you i didntknow how you were coping and all i wanted was to hear that you were fine i wasn t the bell chimed then and harry looked anxiously back at the door to the charms classroom ginny heard flitwick squeaking voice come from inside and the door shut then completely on its own i still not harry added looking back at her what happened to draco it changed me and maybe it better if you give me a little time to adjust she shook her head taking a few steps closer until they were standing face to face she grabbed his hands in hers and squeezed lightly a small smile graced her lips harry i here for you whenever you need me for anything you know that right pushing me away wontdo either of us any good he shut his eyes tightly shaking his head at her words you dontunderstand gin please i dontwant to hurt you but you arentmaking it easier she looked at him with sad and confused eyes what i broken he said i not the same guy i was before i not as na ve as i was a few weeks ago i dontexactly know yet what i ve become so i need to figure it out and i need to do this alone with you being around you ll only become a distraction and i canthave any distractions in my life right now she let go of his hands suddenly as though they burned her and took a step back to examine his face he looked torn between decisions she hoped she was mishearing things not happening not happening not happening she chanted in her head what do you mean her voice came out high and broken full of shock and unwanted tears you re breaking up with me he didntsay anything back he simply looked down and stared at the floor this made her even angrier damn it harry answer me she demanded but he didn t you canteven look me in the eyes when you do it what kind of a person are you i trusted you i sorry he whispered you dontdeserve to be with me ginny you re so good you deserve someone much better this is my decision to make and i dontwant anyone else i think you re the best thing that happened to me i not he countered it was a mistake ginny i was a fool who was blinded by love and yes it was love that i felt for you she shook her head too chocked up to argue there was one word that crossed her mind when he said it bullshit but i cantfeel like this right now he went on and she prayed he would stop it really not fair to you if i donthave my heart fully in it we can go back and be frie how can you say that ginny yelled with a hoarse voice absolutely outraged at his words friends we were never friends harry she stared at him breathing heavily forcing herself to calm down and knowing that yelling wouldntsolve anything she started again with a calmer voice i cantbe your friend harry not after everything you had me going through i wonthave it we can go through with it together i ll help you i dontwant your help harry suddenly burst out ginny whole body froze at the sound of his booming voice she felt like she couldntmove or breathe the only remaining living thing in her body was her heart which was also starting to slow down by the second why cantyou understand he demanded the door of the charms classroom opened and professor flitwick poked his head out behind him towered a crowed of curious students trying to get a peek through the narrow gap of the door mr potter what is going on here flitwick peeped harry and ginny ignored everything else and simply stared at each other harry chest was heaving in and out rapidly while ginny stood as still as a statue and tears were rimming her eyes her daze evaporated slowly and she gulped hard feeling her throat aching terribly and there was a bitter taste in her mouth that hadntbeen there before fine she said quietly straightening up she held her head high in a proud posture have it your way you can have your bloody space then her hand went to her neck and her slim fingers fished out a thin silver chain of three pearls from underneath the collar of her shirt she tore the necklace from her neck and angrily threw it down at harry feet she span on her heel and marched down the hall tears prickling at the corner of her eyes then she stopped and turned back to look at him one more time feeling that she had to say the last words that were on her mind i cantbelieve how i didntsee that you stayed the same nasty person you always were ron was right you wontever change you ll always stay the mean bully of the school malfoy was just your shadow you re a pathetic sad and immature boy who doesntknow what he wants and you know what the saddest thing is that i actually believed your act went ahead and fell in love with you ginny couldnthelp but let the tears now flow freely down her face she ran away knowing she was the one who looked pathetic right now having made a complete fool out of herself in front of a class full of slytherins who were probably laughing at her expanse right now the only thing she hadntknown was that as harry watched her go he felt a huge wave of regret and pain wash over him harry entered the slytherin common room that evening after leaving remus office with a heavy pile of assignments that he missed over the past month remus said it would be better to start right away and be done with it so he wouldntget behind on the new subjects they first went over all the new defense against the dark arts chapters and spells remus wanted to make sure that harry got everything right before sending him on his way to study for the rest of his classes harry set down his books and notes on one table in the corner of the common room and began skimming through it it went on and on and seemed absolutely endless harry could not believe he missed all that in the one month that he d been away he was way into his second chapter in history of magic when blaise came into the room and sat at the other chair next to harry table hey harry he said his voice light as usual harry was a little grateful of blaise arrival to pull him back from his studying he needed a little break and now was just the right time for it hey he replied stretching in his chair how it going good good blaise said nodding he seemed to focus for some reason on harry open books for a second before he blinked quickly and drifted out of his daze harry sensed he was trying not to look directly into his eyes and he wondered what was going on before he could ask blaise went on there something i ve been meaning to ask you my timing is a little crappy i know but it just another thing we have to get out of the way what is it you know about quidditch what about it harry questioned not understanding what blaise was trying to say well i ve asked snape about it he was pretty strict on the subject the games arentcancelled and he said we need to find our team a new keeper now that you know the realization of what blaise was saying finally sank in oh i guess i haventthought about it snape wants you to hold tryouts this week since the hufflepuff game is coming up soon he doesntwant us to lose to a team as poor as theirs we have to practice and train up the new keeper what do you think honestly blaise harry reached for his robe collar and pulled at his shiny captain badge he noticed blaise watching him closely as he placed the small badge in the center of the table blaise stared at it for a short moment with a puzzled expression on his face this is the last thing on my mind right now take the badge be captain schedule tryouts and practices i trust that you d be a better man for the job than me i just cantdo it but harry it best for the team if i keep being the captain i only going to fail you it seemed to be taking blaise a few moments to think about harry generous offer harry was sure blaise knew there was only one option and that he would have to accept if he wanted to win the quidditch cup this year it felt like the right thing to do right now i think you re wrong but thank you blaise nervous fingers grazed the small silver badge as though testing to see if it was a trick harry laughed and blaise finally grabbed the badge and held it firmly in his fist harry knew how blaise felt holding the badge in his hands he knew that victorious feeling he remembered having it on the first of september when draco handed it to him and he was stunned to realize that snape had somehow lost his mind and agreed to make him the team captain it was still quite a mystery one that probably will never be solved how the badge had been mailed to draco when the letter had been harry s whenever you change your mind just say the word and it yours again harry nodded once in gratitude and the corners of his mouth lifted into a little smile so typical of blaise to be as selfless as he was now thinking he would never be good enough harry knew without a doubt that it wasnttrue you ll still stay our seeker though right blaise asked with round eyes dreading harry answer you re the best we got we wonteven have a chance with any other second hand seeker harry smiled and nodded again knowing he could not disappoint his friend if he quit completely it would be like disappointing draco by not winning the cup for him that the least he could do if he was stepping out of his captain spot and having blaise choose another keeper to replace draco i ll try to keep my head in the game blaise flashed him a huge bright smile and harry had the feeling that if there wasnta table separating them he would have jumped up and hugged him blaise smile faded as reality settled back in you know harry life not over you re allowed to move on harry knew that blaise only wanted the best for him he wouldnthave said that if it werenttrue and he hadntmeant it he knew that blaise was right everyone else had moved on even blaise while harry had felt the ground underneath his feet collapsing blaise somehow managed to get it all together and move forward with his life he and pansy had found solace in each other after draco death and it brought them closer together now they were dating finally and they both seemed truly happy harry didntknow how to feel about that on the one hand he was happy that blaise had finally gotten what he wanted for so long but on the other hand he couldnthelp but feel a little selfish for wanting blaise to grieve with him blaise was grieving in his own way harry knew he noticed that whenever draco was mentioned he would get really quite and distant before he d try to change the subject and be back to his old self again was it fair of harry to be feeling this way was it fair of blaise to be acting like he was living on acting like nothing had happened maintaining a relationship and planning on playing quidditch while harry was still locked up in his bubble of grief after all he was draco best friend as well it wasntfair harry decided it wasnthow they should pay their respect towards their deceased friend he felt blaise gaze on him and knew he was studying him and probably reading him like an open book and he wasntmistaken either harry you have to remember that we re still alive and we keep living all thanks to him he saved us and kept us safe if he hadn t you would have died with him i know what you re thinking harry just because i keeping myself together doesntmean that he meant any less to me than he did to you he was my best friend and i ll always remember him you have to know that he wouldnthave wanted us to grieve about him forever he would probably kick our arses for it calling us names and such harry chuckled closing his eyes and imagining it in his mind seeing draco grumbling about them acting like two girls while he would stride around them and pretend he was way better than them the image was so vivid in his mind that harry was sad to open his eyes and see it wasntreal at all he realized that blaise was right and that he should let his life go on he would never forget but merely put it in a side corner in his mind he should do what blaise did he should play quidditch and be happy and have a relationship with the girl he loved that last thought brought the painful memory from this morning encounter with ginny and harry sighed feeling depressed again ginny and i broke up today he said quietly ashamed to admit it it was so surreal that the tables had turned blaise life was more productive and he had someone while in harry case it was the complete opposite what she broke up with you what a bitch blaise exclaimed leaving you at a time like this actually i broke it off with her she made quite a scene but i dontblame her i ve been a real arse to her i really hate myself for doing this to her so that what it was all about this morning blaise asked and harry nodded he had refused to explain it when he entered the class after ginny left spilling it out now to someone who may understand him was giving him a little comfort unlike he thought well i still say she a bitch harry glared at him and blaise shrugged innocently harry let it go and let out a sigh it for the best it wasntgoing to work out anyway we struggled too much to try and make it work when we never had a chance from the start blaise watched him closely again you still love her he observed harry shrugged canthelp it i ll get over her though blaise eyes narrowed sure you will he said somehow skeptically harry hated the note in his voice truthfully he doubted it as well knowing it would be hard to force himself to fall out of love with ginny there was an old scorch mark on the red velvet curtains that hung around ginny four poster bed that she d been staring at for the past hour she remembered how she made it by complete accident of course in her third year after she came back from hogsmeade crying because fred and george stalked her and michael on one of their dates she d been so furious that day that some sparks shot from her wand and nearly set her curtains on fire ginny lay in her bed tracing the burn mark lightly with the tips of her fingers she d been hiding there for the better part of the day hoping that no one would ask her for explanations by no one she thought of hermione ginny knew better than that of course not underestimating her best friend for a second and knowing that sooner or later she d be there asking questions that ginny wanted so badly to avoid she was so hurt and she wasntready to talk about it to anyone yet not even to consult with hermione the only solution so she didntkeep her thoughts locked inside was to get them out and on paper it gave her some relief to get things off her chest when she wrote in her diary even when sometimes she thought it might be slightly childish it was like having another friend who was a great listener and never asked questions ginny fingers rested on the black leather binding of the book she left open on her stomach there were so many memories of so many days stored in there but she refused to turn the pages back and read them she wrote in it about every meaningful moment she had shared with harry but after writing about today happenings she couldntlet herself go back and read about how wonderful those moments felt then when she knew now that she would never have moments like those with harry again she cursed at herself for being deluding into thinking that things had and could have been perfect she cursed at herself for acting like an eleven years old with a crush on some boy she could never have day dreaming on a perfect wedding for them both oh please ginny muttered under her breath and blinked a stray tear from her eyes she remembered something she was told not too long ago and cursed again until death do us part my arse parvati aunt had been wrong maybe she was a fraud after all ginny wished she had never gone to see her what a waste of money she muttered remembering hermione had said it right from the start it was another act of a very good actress if she must admit but that was all the credit she was going to give to madame asha ginny did everything the seer had told her to do she set the future for her and harry by choosing the white road leading for their happiness ginny now felt stupid for listening to something that now sounded completely idiotic she realized how she had made a fool out of herself despite it all she couldnthelp but wonder what could have happened if she had decided differently and had chose the other road the red muddy path that led into a dirty back alley if choosing the white road had led to destruction on hers and harry relationship when it theoretically should have brought them happiness then what would have happened if she had chosen to take the other road greater destruction or the complete opposite the words until death do you part rang in ginny mind one more time and flashes of that day came and went like she was reliving it all over again every part of the prophecy was chanted inside her head and just when she thought she caught on to something she was pulled back to reality ginny hermione tentative voice came from behind the curtains i know you re in there i heard what happened i sorry her voice was apologetic yet ginny couldnthelp but let out a snort in response she pulled her curtains open and sat back against the headboard of the bed and made some room for her friend to sit while tucking her diary underneath her pillow figured you d come by when word got out is there anyone in the castle who didnt hear about it ginny honestly doubted the question hermione face contorted in a mixture of guilt and pain well if it makes you feel any better you re not exactly at the top of the gossip list today eloise midgeon got kissed this afternoon so you re basically old news that does make me feel slightly better wait did you just say that eloise midgeon got kissed who where and why ginny had to admit that she was slightly interested hermione chuckled i think it was on a dare i didntcatch the kisser name but i heard he was from hufflepuff poor bloke i reckon he ll wake up tomorrow with a face full of acne hermione let out a loud laugh at that you re awful i see that you re acting as your usual self that good ginny contemplated what hermione said she chose her words carefully not really wanting to start a full conversation about what happened yeah i promised myself long time ago that i wouldntcry over him doesntchange the fact that the boy had me completely fall for him and now now i cantstop shedding tears because of him that bastard i sorry hermione said again i feel like it my fault ginny saw her friend looked really regretful but couldntreally understand why dontbe it isn t he had everyone fooled has ron beaten the crap out of him yet ginny asked with an arched eyebrow only partly joking not yet he wanted to badly but i stopped him i told him to ask your permission first to tell you the truth i nearly went after him myself hermione gave her half a smile ginny knew she meant what she said but also said it because she wanted to cheer her up ginny nodded in gratitude good thinking holding ron back as much as harry hurt me today i dontknow if i want to hurt him back in any way or even if i can hermione nodded once it understandable you love him ginny shook her head it not that i feel like i the one who made us break apart how could you it not like you pressured him or anything hermione reasoned not quite following ginny thread of thought no it nothing like that i thing i messed up with fate i caused our lives to be the way they are now she started to explain the earlier thought she had before hermione came over you remember i told you about the prophecy parvati aunt told me right at that hermione sighed and rolled her eyes donttell me you believe that old bat no listen ginny insisted sitting up in her bed at the time i thought i understood what she meant but what if i was wrong what if i mixed things up hermione looked at her with a half bored expression but ginny went on explaining it all clear to me now there were three parts to the prophecy in the first she talked about how i found my true love and that even true love can break apart if i would not value it in the second part i thought she talked about ron but i come to realize that she had talked about harry all along she said he can protect me but can also cause me pain so far both parts had come true hermione blinked still clearly not impressed and the third part she promoted ginny gulped remembering the third part of the prophecy the crucial part the third part talked about two roads that resembled me and that was the reason why i was the one who had to choose the road i wanted for myself and it will affect mine and harry future together her exact words were go to the white and all will go well until death do you part go with the red and it will be as if nothing had ever occurred between you which road did you take hermione asked ginny blushed ashamed to admit she had thought the white road meant marriage i thought the white one would give us a future together while the red one would erase everything and make us as if we were strangers again only now i realized that there isntany meaning behind the words it was as simple as that i had taken the wrong road i had chosen to keep us apart by death draco death in this case it had made harry want to get away from me ron told me something in the funeral that harry knew the death eaters had come for him he was hiding that day for a reason because he didntwant to be seen we sat in an open clearing and someone was bound to see him there and call the death eaters if only we had taken the other road and went into the alley it led to he would have stayed hidden no one would have seen him there and we would have stayed as we were like nothing had occurred between us like we didnthave that stupid fight in the first place hermione looked at her for a moment before finally shaking her head we each make our own fate ginny the future may be alterable but it is also unpredictable i dontbelieve it ginny insisted she saw it happening she warned me only i misunderstood her ginny you are taking matters way out of proportion you re looking at it too deeply when you shouldntlet some old nutter tell you how to live your life if you want things to go back to the way they were you should act according to what you feel and what you think not someone who supposedly told you that the way it is you can always change the future you just need to make the right decision but how do i know i made the right decision like i said act according to your heart if you want him back do everything you can to get him back but what if fate has already been decided and we re supposed to be apart no matter what i do we d stay apart what if fate isntalterable after all then if that the case and you had taken the red road you would have split apart anyway dontyou think ginny sighed and looked at her lap i not even sure that i want him back now hermione took her hand in hers and gave it a gentle squeeze then give it some time to settle and see if that is still what you want and if you do dontwait too long because then it might be too late the hallways of the castle were empty the stone walls were ice cold but the floor felt as though he was walking on cotton although every step he took echoed at least three times around him harry was dressed in his pajamas he walked barefoot out of the castle and down to the quidditch pitch it was almost summer time on twilight the sun was just starting to set behind the lake reflecting gold and dancing on the water and it looked as if there was a large bonfire on the bank on the other side a whoosh sound in the sky above him made him look up to see a figure on a broom racing to fly around the pitch the person a black shadow as harry saw from where he stood was absolutely marvelous on a broom harry watched with interest as the figure had created a quaffle out of thin air the person bewitched it to toss around while he did all he could to keep the ball out of the goal posts he only missed once and the ball fell through the ring and onto the grass and rolled right at harry feet harry bent down and held the ball in his hands examining it as though there was something out of ordinary about it only there wasn t he looked up at the sky again now seeing the shadowed figure hovering just above his head his hand reaching for the quaffle harry handed it to him and noticed the grin he received in return he knew that smile i didntmean to take it away from you harry said you mean the ball or my life draco asked with a hint on amusement in his voice what do you think i think you re a coward harry you re a fool and you make so many mistakes that i canteven count them on my two hands how so harry asked in puzzlement as he saw draco descend with his broom to the ground and stand across from him his back was to the setting sun making his face darken with shadows and his blond hair glow like a halo you turned your back on your life and for what i dead you cantbring me back and you cantturn back time harry didntknow what to say he wasnteven sure he knew how to speak after that he tried but nothing came out draco sighed and put his hand on harry shoulder a rush of warmth spread through his body at the touch and it made harry gasp and shut his eyes for a second live your life harry i not mad at you for anything you shouldnthold your life back just because of what happened to me it wasntyour fault and i not holding it against you harry stared at his lost friend in quiet amazement still unable to find the right words to say i leaving now harry can you do me one last favor before i go harry nodded draco smile made another appearance and it made harry feel that earlier warmth again fix your mistakes harry harry stood still watching draco hop back on his broom he tossed the quaffle back to harry and he caught it play it right he added with a wink and took off into the air harry saw him disappear as a tiny black dot behind the clouds somehow he had the feeling it would not be their final meeting they would be seeing each other again even if it was only in dreamland he woke up a little short of breath remembering the dream so vividly he sat up in his bed and noticed he wasntthe only one awake in the room blaise was looking at him with a concerned look on his face silently questioning what was wrong sorry i woke you harry apologized to blaise go back to sleep we ll talk tomorrow the next morning harry skipped his first period he waited outside the potions classroom ten minutes before the bell was supposed to ring he knew that snape had never dismissed a class early before but he couldnttake the chance of missing ginny exit last night when he woke up from his dream about draco he had reached a decision he was going to listen to draco advice and start over any mistakes he d made yesterday were going to be fixed today and he was going to start with ginny he sat up on the floor leaning against a humid wall down in the dungeons and set his view on snape classroom door he looked at his watch noting the time five minutes to go he thought to himself with a sigh his fingers in his right hand played around with the silver chain of ginny necklace swirling it around in distraction to pass the time students were starting to walk around the hallways having been dismissed early from their classes as some slytherins walked passed harry on their way to their common room they shot him strange glances and talked in hushed voices no doubt that it was about him the fight scene he held with ginny yesterday was still fresh gossip he ignored them knowing that it would pass sometime later this week as another group of girls walked by harry buried his head between his knees hoping to avoid anymore talks he didntexpect however that one of them would stop to chat harry she called he tried not to pay attention but there was something familiar about her voice he slowly looked up to see who she was shoulder length dark hair and concerned blue eyes greeted him he smiled faintly at her hey jen he said harry felt a familiar shiver coming up his spine when he looked at her jennifer newport wasntugly looking at all and he remembered that feeling from their dating days whenever he looked at her he would feel that shiver going through his body that how pretty she was he just didntexpect feeling like this a year after they broke up and particularly when they never been serious enough for this feeling to develop into something more though sharing the same house she hadntsaid a word to him since the day they decided to split up and harry wondered for a short second why she would stop now at the sight of him why are you sitting on the floor she asked with an arched eyebrow he shrugged not really wanting to explain to her his actions and sharing more than he already had about his and ginny shattered relationship she shook her head moving on with what she wanted to say well i glad i ran into you i wanted to say that i really sorry about draco harry nodded in appreciation then his eyebrows knitted together when he remembered something oh that right werentyou two an item or something the last he heard of her she was snogging draco after the christmas break probably using him to get herself attention he never got to hear how that turned out draco had referred to it as something casual at the time and hadntsaid more than that she blushed and tried to hide a smile uh no not really she said in embarrassment well this is pretty embarrassing she muttered and continued when harry frowned at her i knew that since you two were best friends that eventually you d hear about it her words only confused him more what do you mean he asked she didntask for his permission but she sat next to him on the floor at first she was quiet and shy he never saw her act like this as long as he had known her she was always direct and always got what she wanted she suddenly turned and looked straight into his eyes and harry gulped as the same shiver ran through him again i ve been wanting to get your attention for quite some time now but never got the courage to approach you i knew you were seeing that weasley girl and draco had mentioned that you were pretty head over heels for her i guess i got jealous i thought that if i made a move on him it would get your attention enough to talk to me i was wrong apparently it was shocking news to him and he wasntaware that he was looking at her with wide round eyes she had wanted to get herself attention but not just anyone attention his attention slowly the fog in his brain cleared and he was ready to think again wow he said slowly i i really dontknow what to say i mean what happened to draco is devastating and dontget me wrong i liked him loads i just liked you more harry merely listened not sure how to accept all of this at once when he didntsaid anything for a long moment she asked you were pretty tied up with her werentyou she referred to ginny he nodded still hung up on her confession er yeah pretty tight she smiled brightly then and he wasntsure what he said to cause her to be this happy so what do you say i know you only broke up like yesterday but i could make you forget her harry was still confused er what she nodded enthusiastically and her eyes were boring into his harry was too stunned by her gaze and he found that he couldntlook away her smile softened and he felt himself smile back goofily something was oddly familiar about this moment and he remembered all the times he looked at her that exact way and felt wonderful about it she traced a finger lightly on his bicep and with her other hand she held his chin and pulled his head gently to hers when she closed her eyes he closed his and the last thing he looked at was her parting lips he expected the warm and fuzzy feeling that he used to feel whenever he kissed her before but there was nothing there when her lips traced his again and again he was sure of it jennifer may be pretty on the outside and every guy in school wouldntdeny it but she had no control on harry heart anymore the kiss was empty and wet and nothing more before she could push he tongue in he pulled back and tried to smile gently hoping she wontbe offended when he d turn her down this is so brilliant harry she said excitedly and harry was still having a hard time figuring what exactly happened i could never have pictured us back together but it just feels right right what he said finally realizing what she d meant he looked at her in alarm his heart racing back together you and me yeah she called in a shrilly voice and then lunged herself on him nearly tackling him over her hands were holding his shoulders tight and her face was buried in his neck oh harry harry was so stunned to comprehend how he got into this situation in the first place it was then that he realized that he didnteven hear the bell ring nor did he notice the potions classroom door open and the crowd of fifth years rushing out he was trying to take jennifer hands off him but was unsuccessful she grabbed his face in her hand and pressed her lips to him in another hard kiss this time however he didntrespond his eyes were wide and span around the room while he thought of an idea how to part jennifer from him without actually hurting her he was too slow apparently and he let it go too far as the crowd in the hallway thinned his eyes fixed on the opposite wall and realized that someone was standing there and watching them he blinked and thought he was just imagining people went through and blocked his view and he wasntsure when the sight was clear again there was no one there harry finally managed to tear himself from jennifer hold shoved her away quickly and jumped to his feet while still trying to straighten his clothes and look somewhat presentable i cantbelieve this he heard someone mutter angrily harry looked around quickly and was horrified to see ginny walking away she shoved her body between people and tried to flee the place harry knew then that it was her standing right in front of him while he was still glued to jennifer by the lips harry ran after her leaving jennifer behind he watched as ginny face changed expressions like a chameleon changed colors at first she looked appalled then outraged and finally she looked heartbroken and on the verge of tears ginny wait he called and tried to take hold of her shoulder but she got away well isntthis look familiar ginny spat ginny i can explain he said trying to sound as honest as he was save it she said harshly not even twenty four hours has gone by since you asked me to give you space and here you are with the next girl who was willing enough to throw herself at you and right in front of my face have you no shame i swear this is just a big misunderstanding so you werentjust snogging her no she stopped abruptly and harry ran and stood in front of her but she refused to look at his face he gulped hard fearing that ginny actually saw the whole thing and not just the last kiss that he didntrespond to he hoped he was wrong but he knew that she did see something funny because that how it looked like she said in a monotone voice and turned around to walk away again harry quickly grabbed her hand and stopped her donttouch me she tried to yank her hand away but he wasntgoing to let her go until she would listen and understand i know this looks bad he started to explain and she rolled her eyes but he wouldntlet her go yet and yes i did ask for some space and that he gestured with his hands towards the end of the hallway where they came from an uncomfortable feeling spread through him when he saw jennifer standing behind them and realized she had followed them here that was not a part of that i was wrong ginny everything i said yesterday i take it all back i donteven know why i said that and i know i making us look like fools in front of the whole school but i dontcare because i need you to know this for the past several months i ve been pining over you trying to understand what this thing is that you make me feel and when i finally realized what it was i threw it away i was stupid and i deserve you cursing me hitting me and calling me names but please i canthave you away from me again you dontknow what it feels like loving someone and not having them loving you back she stopped fighting him and slowly looked at his eyes he stopped his breath feeling like time had stopped when she watched him it was like eternity had passed before she spoke actually harry i do know you made sure to make me feel like that yesterday and you were pretty clear about what you needed and it wasntme she managed to tug her hand free from his feeble palm and turned her back on him and walked away harry didnttry to chase her again he felt worse than if she had slapped him it was a dagger to the heart he knew that any chance he had of ginny forgiving him had been lost he had lost his hope once when he thought that there was no other way her could make her agree to give him a chance to go out with him but he had been wrong and she had given him that chance and now he ruined it for some reason this time it felt different he knew that no matter what he would do she would not forgive him that easily if she ever forgave him at all he watched her go and the small crowd around him slowly disappeared only jennifer stayed behind she walked behind him and put her hand on his shoulder he instantly brushed it off harry i sorry i feel so stupid she said in apology he ignored her and walked away he wasntsure where he was walking but he somehow ended up in the quidditch changing rooms he sat down on a lonely bench in the dark still playing with ginny necklace in his hands thinking about how he managed to lose her he lost his hold on the chain when his hands grew weak and he let it fall to the floor with a desperate sigh he rested his elbows on his knees and bent down to bury his head between his hands he guessed he spent most of the day in there he took notice that it was already getting dark outside the sun was beginning to set he was sure that blaise was looking for him all over the castle but he didntcare he thought he could stay here all night and maybe tomorrow he would start fresh then again he thought that ginny would still be angry with him tomorrow and nothing would be different so staying here would not make him forget that as he gathered all his thoughts and made up his mind to head back to the castle a warm feeling he was familiar with grazed at his back harry turned back expecting to see someone behind maybe expecting too much that it would be ginny but he was only greeted with the team lockers he wasntsure why but there was one locker right before him that somehow made him fascinated if not drawn to harry spun around on the bench and stood up to examine it even closer it took him only a second to realize it was draco personal locker harry reached into his robes and pulled out his wand hesitantly he ran his fingers over the green metal door and the padlock the warmth it was emitting intensified at his touch harry curiousness got the better of him he tapped his wand at the lock and murmured alohomora the lock snapped open harry quickly took it off and snatched the door open and took a look inside he smiled at first and then he chuckled maybe he was hallucinating or maybe he was dreaming again but as he reached inside he grabbed a red quaffle ball there was a message written on it in black ink sod off captain look for the snitch you arse harry threw his head back and burst out laughing he couldntremember the last time he laughed so hard a minute after he calmed down he put the ball back in his friend locker he made sure to lock it with more than one locking spell this time he smiled again to himself you got it draco a n i warned you donthate me next chapter is supposed to be the last one now i not sure if there will be an epilogue after it or not i guess it would be clearer when i finish the next chapter i looking forward to read your thoughts dontbe shy they re welcome disclaimer i dontown harry potter a n thank you guys for all the reviews here the second chapter after couple of drafts now i pleased with it especially now that my beta fixed it enjoy and dontforget to review chapter 2 boys talk sirius stopped in front of harry bedroom door what should i say he thought nothing came to mind he figured that if he were to walk back downstairs james and lily would never speak to him again he sighed deeply and knocked twice on the door what harry voice answered angrily er harry may i come in sirius asked hesitantly loud enough for harry to hear him through the door nope harry called back come on i want to talk to you but i dontwanna talk to you harry sirius was getting a bit annoyed talking to him through the door you just wanna tell me what my parents couldn t gosh this kid is more clever than i thought what to do what to do he stood there facing the door his eyes moving around for an idea he couldntthink of anything but trying to talk to him again but he wontopen the door he kept thinking but then he realized that this situation could be fixed he pulled out his wand and pointed it at the lock alohomora the door opened and sirius walked slowly inside he saw harry lying flat on his stomach on his bed he didntsay anything to sirius after he entered his room without his permission in fact he didntsay or do anything at all he just laid there head on the pillow facing the wall sirius sat slowly next to harry stilled body and looked at the floor after a few moments of silence he said so what up i hate them harry said furiously more to himself than to sirius i hate the way they talk to me the way they think i a child who canthandle anything i hate when they think i hopeless someone who must get help they never try to understand what it like to be me well what it like harry sat up straight neither of them wanted to look at the other eyes yet it sucks they donttrust me they always think i against them but they dont so why are they acting like that trying to push me to be someone i not i happy the way i turned out but they ll never understand that will they your parents are worried about you harry and you re not showing them any respect i understand you sometimes get mad at them everyone is like that at this age sirius couldntbelieve he had this parental side in him but he kept going with it harry got up of the bed and began to walk around the room what do you know he spat believe me i know sirius thought of the old times when he was in harry age you know you re not as pureblood as you wish you were like your friends are you have to deal with it it been 16 years you cantcall your mother a mudblood every time you re mad at her there no reason in the world to treat her like that you re her son and you really hurt her harry stopped pacing around the room for the first time since sirius entered his room he dared to look in his eyes sirius tried his best not to look back at him but it was what harry said that made him finally look up why all of the sudden are you trying to talk to me we have never had conversations like this before harry began to investigate sirius sighed again i here to start acting like a caring godfather i realized i haventbeen there for you and i want to make it up to you oh yeah how are you gonna do that well i haventgiven you your birthday present yet he replied smiling but to his surprise harry just frowned you d do that yeah you know my harley davidson is a little out of use you want to give me your flying motorcycle harry eyebrow shot up yeah and it in good condition i actually got it when i was on your age harry laughed for a second james and lily will never let me ride on that thing now it was sirius turn to frown james and lily since when do you call them by their first names sirius asked harry just shrugged so you want it sirius asked again you really mean it you re really going to give it to me harry asked suspiciously hu ha sirius nodded but on one condition ha i knew there a catch it was too good to be true harry said what is it well i ll give you my harley if you promise to show your parents respect harry shifted in his place sirius went on you wontcall them by their first names or other insults but only as mum and dad and if they re annoying you you can always come to me harry was tired of listening to sirius lecture you know what just keep that harley for yourself and get the fuck out if you really cared you would talk to them and not me watch your tongue sirius said loudly you know why i got so pissed off earlier because they told me again not to hang out with draco and blaise i mean they re my best friends and i canteven see them over the holidays i cantsend them letters because they took hedwig and i cantinvite them to my fucking 16th birthday sirius yelled at harry for swearing again but harry didntcare what did i do to deserve this you know how sensitive your mother is about you being a slytherin when she and your father both were in gryffindor well it been bloody 6 years since i was sorted into slytherin and i fine there i ve got great friends and great grades have you seen my o w l s results i got four o s i know you re okay with that but cut them some slack will you try to be a good son they are only trying to help you they re actually afraid of you afraid that you ll betray them and join the dark side become a a death eater harry finished his sentence dontworry i wontdo that i may be friends with a death eater son but that doesntmean draco will become like his father and i ll follow suit draco already told me that he wonttake the mark no matter what his father will do to him flashback what why i harry just let us show you that the sorting hat was wrong and that you belong into gryffindor lily said i never wrong said the sorting hat with its hoarse voice which dumbledore was holding in midair shut up james said distractedly to the hat just write another song or something to keep you busy for a while attitude like this was the thing that kept me doubt about where you belong mr potter said the hat back to james and everyone attention was now at it you were too could have done well in slytherin like i told you on the time you wore me in your first year james lily shrieked but as your son put me on his head i had no doubt slytherin was the right house for him clever and cunning he was always was ambitious like i said i never wrong with my decisions you re son is a true slytherin end of flashback i got sorted into slytherin because dad was supposed to end up in there harry said i glad he didn t gryffindor could be such a great place for you you could have had great friends there oh yeah like poor weasel and that mudblood granger the odd couple harry joked dontsay that word sirius hissed sorry harry said and for a change he really meant it okay so it a deal you give me your harley and i will be more grateful to them but only if they ll accept my friends and me being a slytherin okay i think we can all accept a compromise sirius finally stood up from the bed and held his hand up to harry harry hesitated for a second but shook it well come on i saw your plate was half full so i sure you re hungry sirius moved toward the door waiting for harry to follow him you have no idea i had to lie on my stomach just not to feel it aching sirius chuckled a little okay well first thing before we enter the kitchen we need to get your mother lipstick and write sorry on your forehead harry laughed yeah i heard what your father said harry walked out of his room with sirius oh and dontforget to tell them about my new harley davidson yeah let just wait a couple of days until things cool down sirius said the thought of james and lily faces when they ll hear about it made him feel a little bit nervous so how my first day as a godfather not too bad harry said smiling at him a n so harry was acting like a teenager after all but with a mix of being a slytherin hope you liked it chapter 3 will

the ride on the train the summer holidays passed by eventually harry had to spend it with his parents and their friends and when they went to work or did some arranging they didnttell him what exactly they were doing he was left alone afraid i might tell someone of course he thought to himself he found himself getting along with them just fine no more fights no more yelling and cursing they let him send letters to his friends but he was still not allowed to meet them until school started again so when the first of september finally arrived harry couldnthave been more excited to meet his friends again though he kept his cool be careful honey okay mum harry rolled his eyes dontdo any trouble young man you got it dad he gave him thumbs up followed by a smile we dontwant to get letters telling us that you got detentions or skipped classes again i ll do my best he murmured under his breath but nodded they escorted him to platform 9 and said goodbye as he heard his friend calling his name draco malfoy was followed by his very cold looking father lucius lucius nose shot up an inch when he saw the potters he gave them a very ugly smile that made him look really mean but harry didntreally care about him lucius malfoy shot the potters and their shaggy black dog sitting next to them one last nasty look and walked away it was now 11 exactly and clouds of steam and smoke started to fill the platform harry said one last goodbye to his parents and he and draco got up onto the train as it started to move carbbe and goyle appeared out of nowhere and volunteered to get their trunks into an empty compartment we ll meet blaise afterwards draco told harry i need to go to the prefect meeting and what about me harry asked quite disappointed that after all this time that he hadntseen his best friend he was going to stay alone for a while draco pulled out something from his robes and handed it to harry it was a green and silver badge not a prefect badge but a quidditch captain badge congrats you ve been made captain harry took the badge and stared at it not only was he the best seeker hogwarts had ever seen and it was because of him slytherin won every year the quidditch cup he was now the team captain me c captain he asked still amazed at the news yeah i know it shocking said draco sarcastically father tried to buy me the position but i faced the truth you re a better player than i am so why didnti get the badge why did you have it snape mistake i guess he said and pulled something else out of his robe and gave it to him it was a letter inside an open envelope i got your letter though it my name on the envelope harry read the writing on the envelope indeed it said mr draco malfoy are you kidding me harry asked suspiciously draco shook his head in all the years harry knew draco he never seen him so serious he opened the letter and read dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you ve been made the new slytherin quidditch captain your new badge is inside this envelope good luck professor s snape head of slytherin house and professor a dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts you re not kidding me he said folding the letter and putting it inside his robes well that why you re coming with me the captains always go to the prefect meetings so put the badge on and let go we re already five minutes late the meeting was short everyone knew what to do except the new fifth year prefects who stayed behind while everyone else went to patrol the train after about ten minutes of doing so and also making fun of first years and some defenseless hufflepuffs they went to find the compartment crabbe and goyle picked for them they found it but not before they found the three gryffindors they had been dying to make fun of since the end of last year draco slid open the compartment door and leaned against the threshold lookie lookie he said and smirked harry followed and smiled cunningly at the three before them oh great speaking of the devil said weasley oh and followed by his girlfriend he added as he saw harry see weasley that not a very nice way to welcome the new slytherin quidditch captain said harry looking bored as he ignored ron comment he flicked with his fingers his new shining badge that was resting on his chest oh yeah you ve been made captain gosh that so great he said cynically looking at harry new badge his expression and tone changed immediately well i ve got news for you potter this year you re so gonna lose the cup to us draco and harry exchanged looks and then laughed at this statement what makes you say that weasel draco chuckled we ve got new a seeker a better seeker he said his mouth spreading into a wide proud smile you cantchoose a new seeker over the summer holidays it against the rules you have to do tryouts first harry said uh uh ron shook his head not when i the captain and besides we already chose my sister as the new seeker last year she just hasntplayed yet harry looked around the compartment next to weasley girlfriend granger sat his younger sister she looked back at him her brown eyes filled with anger is that right harry asked her well i very looking forward to see how hard you will cry when i ll get the snitch right under your big freckled nose he smirked and he started laughing again draco joining him the weasley girl shot her head to the window and held a few tears back come on draco being around mudbloods and mudbloods lovers too much can ruin my reputation he said and walked out with a fake yawn he had enough seeing them in the prefect meeting earlier he didntneed a closer look at their ugly faces draco gave them his warning look the one when he shoots his eyebrows up and smile devilishly and walked out after harry and back to their own compartment you know his mother is also a muggle born ron snapped and folded his arms he probably not so proud of that ron you really shouldntworry about him he a git always was always will be hermione said and sat next to him well i didntlike the way he looked at the two of you like he planning something he unfolded his arms and hugged hermione no one will call my girl a mudblood he said and planted a kiss on hermione lips i just cantunderstand how he got into slytherin his parents both were in gryffindor they are both aurors and he he hanging out with a bunch of death eaters sons flashback ron and harry were in a middle of a conversation about quidditch when the door of their compartment slid open three boys stood in the doorway harry recognized the one who stood in the middle as the boy he met at diagon alley he had a pale face grey eyes a pointed nose and a sleeked blond hair the other two looked very dumb and fat standing on either side of the blond boy they looked like his bodyguards is it true the pale boy said they re saying all down the train that harry potter in this compartment so it you is it he said looking at harry and trying to ignore ron yes harry said he looked again at his fat followers the pale boy introduced them as crabbe and goyle and then introduced himself as draco malfoy ron chuckled at his name and malfoy started to insult him no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children that they can afford ron looked slightly offended malfoy turned to harry you see potter you dontwant to make friends with the wrong sort of wizards i can help you there he held up his hand to shake harry s harry hesitated for a second he knew ron was watching him carefully all his life harry didntreally have a lot of friends and the friends he had were very unpopular not like him at all finally he had the opportunity to have friends with his own kind and level harry understood by the things malfoy said about ron that his family was quite poor why would he want to make friends with someone like that i sure you will harry smiled and grabbed malfoy hand and shook it ron gaped and swallowed hard malfoy looked like he just won a prize uh you know ron stuttered he stood up and started to gather his things i ve forgotten to er to ask george something about the spell he gave me a n sunshine daisies lol and he walked out as quickly as he could draco took his seat and waved his hand to crabbe and goyle to leave them alone and so they did harry and draco spent hours talking draco of course wanted to know the boy whose family defeated the dark lord even if his own father supported him i guess you re not too bad he said to harry after all the first years sorted into the four houses and they ended up in the same house think what could have happened if i didntshow up to rescue you from weasley you could have been sorted into gryffindor he and harry laughed so hard that they knew that very second they were going to be good friends end of flashback harry sighed at the memory he couldnthave been more grateful for draco for being his best friend he draco and blaise kept talking about their lousy summer and their o w l s results as the train took them to hogwarts the door of their compartment opened around four o clock pansy parkinson smiled from ear to ear at the look of her two favorite slytherin boys well along with their two fat devoted suckers carbbe and goyle and blaise zabini then she turned to the most handsome boy she found in there oh harry sweetie she squealed her irritating high pitched voice making them all shiver slightly harry was surprised at how she addressed him she never called him a sweetie he gulped as she made her way inside the very crowded compartment and sat right on harry lap parkinson eww get off harry yelled at her and pushed her away from him with disgust but harry honey she said whining harry knew too well that when pansy was whining she was also about to start crying and when she cried she sounded like a tiny chihuahua puppy and really looked like one with her big black wet eyes pansy parkinson was always head over heals for harry but he had never felt the same way for her he couldnteven stand her and not to mention look at her doggish face no matter how many times he turned her down she always tried to catch his heart over and over again but harry heart never belonged to anyone he never had been in love sure he had been for a short time with a girl or two who always chased him around but they looked nice not like pansy god you re pathetic shove off harry told her after she started to cry he put his fingers deep in his ears so he couldnthear her so irritating whimpering and dontcall me honey sweetie or any other nickname who knows what the consequences can be she eventually left but not before she promised him that this wasntover great he muttered under his breath harry potter heartbreaker draco teased him shut up harry said in a low voice merlin harry blaise said sounding worried for some reason i think you really hurt her i know she can be a pain in the arse but maybe you should ve treated her with more respect be gentle next time do me a favor blaise if you re so interested in her make a move and please do it fast harry said blaise turned a little red around the ears and didntsay another word about pansy parkinson when they finally reached the hogsmeade train station they walked to the first horseless carriage they saw and shoved aside the third years that were about to enter it crabbe and goyle made sure they werentgoing to fight for it with them and so they made their way to hogwarts ready to start their sixth year next chapters why sirius came to king cross as a dog if he a free man and yes he never went

flashback but i guess it came out nice again enjoy chapter 4 back to school the welcoming dinner was over and harry and blaise made their way to the common room while draco went to show the first years where to go along with the other prefects blaise looked a little annoyed to see draco walking with pansy harry saw her clutching draco arm like he was her date or something he knew that must be what made blaise act like that harry chuckled as draco pushed pansy away from him like he did earlier on the train while blaise tried to ignore this harry knew that she did that only to make him harry jealous which only made him feel worse for poor miserable blaise arentyou pathetic harry said to his friend in a matter of fact voice and he rolled his eyes they reached the dungeons and walked to the entrance to the common room what the password blaise asked in a low voice avoiding harry comment and looking shyly at the floor draco pushed his way in front of the crowd facing the empty wall toxic fang he uttered the password and a door in the wall slid open and everyone marched inside harry and blaise sat in the high backed chairs and waited for draco who continued showing the first years where the dormitories were he finally finished his duty and went to join them first years are so stupid he said as he sank into his chair i cantbelieve we were that short when we first got here yeah blaise said absentmindedly what up with zabini draco asked harry like blaise wasnteven there with them oh he upset because pansy gluing to you now harry answered with an amused smile and turned to his other friend listen blaise pansy is just trying to get me to date her she sees her plan isntworking so she trying to make me get jealous by using draco blaise opened his mouth to say something but quickly closed it harry knew he wanted to ask why it always had to be about only draco or harry and not him but harry chose to let it go harry and draco started to talk about their plans for tomorrow hoping they d have potions i ve got an e in the potions o w l draco said really how i didntthink it was possible you know for you to get less than an o i mean i got an o even though i failed almost all of snape tests and you passed all of them last year harry said i know but i got distracted by something i guess he replied i ve got only three o s everything else is either e or a oh and one p in divination but i mean who passed that not me harry said shaking his head trelawney is a fraud if you ask me i heard she never predicted even one true prediction anyway i glad i not taking her class anymore i bet granger passed that o w l draco joked bet she has all straight o s oh she not taking that class blaise said suddenly and startled both of his friends after a while of not speaking harry and draco really forgot he was there how d you know harry and draco asked in unison because she in my arithmancy class and she always talks about how it more important than divination she left after the first few classes in third year i never thought that she capable of missing a subject harry joked now anyway draco said getting back to the subject he was sick talking too much about that mudblood father wasntso pleased with my grades he expected all straight o s though mother was satisfied i thought you said you dontgive a damn about what your father says blaise said i don t he perfectly aware that i wontfollow his way and become a death eater i mean the dark lord died what the deal with serving him now and did you see how he looked at your parents he now asked harry harry frowned i hate when he does that he looked weird he probably knew my godfather was there he probably recognized him but couldntdo anything why did he come anyway i thought it was risky for him to be seen by death eaters that why he was there in his animagi form he thought it would be safer that way harry answered he remembered the first time he asked why sirius had to transform himself into a dog his parents explained to him everything that had happened flashback it was already dark in godric hollow and it was a typical october evening and the potters had enjoyed their halloween celebrations until lord voldemort arrived young sirius black was starting to get bored sitting all alone in number 12 grimmauld place the house elf was asleep so sirius couldntmake fun of him to entertain himself he decided that it would be safe to make a floo call to his friend remus lupin sirius went to the dungeon kitchen took some green floo powder threw the powder inside the hearthand put his head in the fireplace as he called the address of remus home sirius immediately saw his friend though not as he expected to find him remus sat alone at drawing room his face buried in the palms of his hands he looked like he was after a full moon pale and old but it was only a week after the last time he transformed his face was white and he looked sick and sweaty and more paranoid than he usually was before a full moon like someone was out to get him remus got up from the couch he was sitting on and walked around the room like he was lost and didntknow where to go it was only then when he finally noticed sirius head sticking out of the fire moony what wrong sirius asked sounding concerned it peter remus sighed sitting down in front of the fireplace though he didntlook in sirius eyes he was here just five minutes ago he he said something really oh merlin sirius peter sold james and lily out he finally cried out as he covered his face again with his hands what sirius asked he didntunderstand his friend for a second and from what he heard if he heard right it sounded like no he did not believe his ears but peter wouldn t but he did he told me personally just before he left he mad sirius something has got into him he couldntstop laughing he laughed so hollowly like it was a joke to him oh sirius we need to do something to help them before it too late where are they hiding did he say remus nodded do you know a village called godric hollow yeah i ll go there right away sirius said at once try to contact dumbledore maybe he can help and before remus could say anything else sirius head was gone sirius ran out of his house hopped on his motorcycle and flew to the potters he wouldntlet voldemort kill his best friends and he swore he will revenge peter for betraying them how could peter do this he thought as he flew to godric hollow how stupid could i ve been to turn down james offer i could have been their secret keeper damn you peter step aside you fool you better do so before you ll meet you death potter the dark lord said as he faced james potter ready to duel with him to his death you cantpossibly think you can stand against me do you james kept his distance away from voldemort his wife was in the back room putting a protection charm on their son the more time james stalled the better chance lily had of making a stronger charm curses and spells filled the house seconds turned into minutes and every precious minute a fraction of a second could be the final one the house around them began to crumble shelves and furniture fell down from their places walls had been snapped with great black holes where the spells hit causing fractures to shoot right back at them voldemort got sick of playing with james he wanted to shoot the killing curse at him so he could move on he knew it would be easier if james wasntready to curse him back when he caught james off guard he thought it would be the best time to take action accio wand he called and james wand shot to his hand james looked horror struck he didntknow what to do or where to go he was defenseless and there was a good chance he could die at any second but he didntfear his own death he feared for lily and harry lives he needed to protect them but he knew voldemort was right he has no chance against him not without a wand anyway he was going to die and there was no escape he gulped hard trying to swallow the lump that had built up in his throat and stood straight ready to receive his fate voldemort was smirking at him with a smug look on his ugly face ready to strike james closed his eyes shut thinking maybe this way he wouldntfeel a thing and all this time he was thinking about his dear family and how he wanted to save them but couldn t voldemort slowly pointed his wand at james and opened his mouth to say the curse he wanted so badly to say that night avada kedavra a flash of green light filled the room and a man body dropped dead to the ground but it wasntjames body for all he knew he was still breathing he slowly opened his eyes only to see his best friend sirius black standing in the doorway breathing heavily he had obviously hurried himself over there before it was too late james slowly looked down at the floor voldemort body was sprawled and lifeless it over james said panting and almost not believing he was alive it not over until i ll hunt down peter it was he who i know james said hagrid appeared at the wrecked house about fifteen minutes after it all happened and explained that remus had contacted dumbledore and told him everything so he sent him to help while he was going to alert the minister of magic he helped them with voldemort body and took him to the ministry while sirius went to look for peter end of flashback peter pettigrew had never been seen since that night and though the all order of the phoenix had searched for him to this day he was still alive and well as harry been told that traitor who called himself their friend turned his back on harry parents and gave information to voldemort so he could kill them all lucky for them sirius got there in time to save them and the whole world from the most evil wizard ever existed and that was the reason why he was hiding from old servers of voldemort though the ministry awarded him for that and hadnteven sentenced him to azkaban for using the killing curse harry parents and godfather told him sirius would have to stay in dog form in public so the death eaters wouldntfind him and try to avenge their lord death some of them were still free and others were caught during a raid on death eater activity in a muggle town a year ago harry cleared his mind and went back to reality he and his friends stayed up talking about their o results when harry had the chance he told them about the flying motorcycle sirius gave him for his birthday which made his two best friends envy him a little even draco who supposedly had everything money could buy the common room emptied a little as the time passed by and they felt quite tired around midnight though harry felt like he could keep talking with them for hours to make up for the time he hasntseen them but then draco got up from his seat i going to bed he declared with a yawn as he started to head for the boys dormitories it still early harry said trying to squeeze in more time with them yeah i going to sleep too blaise said also getting up all right all right harry gave up and they called it off for the night whatever star thank you i wontlet it die as long as people will review it i haventthought about it but i guess i can

weasley welcome to the n e w t potions class professor snape said in a drawling voice at their first class they had the following morning i expected to have fewer pupils in my class this year but i guess some of you realized before your o w l s last year that potions is no picnic if you thought that an a e or o grade in your o w l s exam was enough for you to pass the n e w t s exam then you re wrong he said walking up and down the class and shooting threatening glances at a few scared gryffindors this year is going to be the toughest year you ve had so far and if you dontpractice doing potions correctly and learn the theoretical material by heart i can assure you right here and now that you will fail the n e w t s exam and that there is no reason for you to stay unless you want to fail the potion lesson today wasntso hard harry thought he compared his own to granger and was sure that both potions looked the same and that they were both good after the bell rang and ended the double period they had snape called harry to stay behind after harry saw that all the students left the classroom including blaise and draco who said that they d meet him at lunch harry approached snape you wanted to see me sir he asked yes potter i wanted to know when you are planning to set tryouts for the team snape responded hua harry asked dumbly but then he understood that snape was probably talking about quidditch since he was the new team captain oh er i dunno maybe friday night i guess i haventreally thought about it yet then friday night it is i ll sign for the pitch between 7 to 9 p m is that a good time yeah it great harry answered should i put a note on the notice board sir if you may i ve got loads of work to do and quidditch is the last thing on my mind right now okay then i will harry assured him all right off you go harry turned around from snape desk and made his way towards the door but stopped when a thought popped in his mind he turned around and looked back at his greasy black haired professor excuse me sir can i ask you something what is it potter snape asked not facing harry and carrying on writing something on a parchment i i wanted to know why you chose me to be the team captain now snape finally abandoned his business and turned his face to look at harry i mean i honored and let me assure you that i ll do a great job as captain and do my best to train the team so we ll win the cup but there something on my mind that bothering me a bit and that thing is snape looked quite annoyed that harry spoke a whole speech and distracted him i not your favorite student let face it and i almost always fail your tests so why did you chose me as the captain and not draco for instance as much as i hate your parents potter harry of course already knew that tiny fact but it didntmatter to him i trust you completely and i know you re different from them i mean look at you you re a slytherin but they were gryffindors that the first thing that makes you different from them i chose you because you re cunning and clever even if you dontadmit it and the last thing that made me sure that you re right for the position was that you re the best quidditch player and seeker slytherin has seen in years that why i chose you did you really think that i would prefer mr malfoy no offense to your friend of course but he not as good player as you snape finished his speech harry looked surprise to hear for the first time in his life snape complimenting him snape continued to look at him as harry hadntsaid a word and he looked like he hoped he harry had heard him because he didntwant to repeat it all over again do you understand he asked finally pulling harry back to reality y yes sir thank you he said and walked out of the classroom he went to join his friends for lunch in the great hall and told them what snape had wanted blaise looked overenthusiastic about something for some reason and it started to annoy harry what are you so excited about today he asked him curiously but blaise was jumping in his seat can you calm down i trying to eat here blaise stopped jumping but kept on smiling from ear to ear and continued to gaze in air daydreaming he didntanswer harry like he hasntheard anything he said hello blaise harry asked waving a hand in front of his friend face blaise didntwake up from his daydream did a dementor kiss him or something he now turned to draco after giving up almost to be precise the dementor name is pansy parkinson draco said as he read the headlines of the daily prophet and chewed his food at the same time what harry asked suddenly sounding surprised for an unknown reason is this another plan of pansy to make him jealous by using poor blaise now not that blaise seemed to mind did she always have to use his friends oh didntyou notice in class earlier his dear precious pansy allowed him to sit next to her draco answered with a smirk on his lips that all harry asked with a mocking chuckle and draco nodded and he thought it was getting out of hand okay this is fixable we still can have our old blaise back hey crabbe harry called looking for one of their dumb and fat followers crabbe raised his head from his plate and looked at harry with a questioning look on his face next potions class you sit next to pansy parkinson okay crabbe just shrugged his shoulders carelessly and went back to stuffing food into his mouth harry noticed that when he called out pansy name blaise woke up from his daydream and looked around now blaise held a horror struck look on his face and looked at harry who looked back at him and draco with a triumph smile playing on his lips blaise stared at him opened mouthed and draco tried to suppress a laugh wha why what d you that for blaise asked harry in shock and he can talk draco joked harry sniggered but then tried to look serious as he talked to blaise you need to get over that girl man forget her you can do much better than that believe me it for your own good it not healthy to obsess over some girl like that especially if it parkinson harry added a disgusted look to his words to hell with health you ruined my chances with her he protested okay blaise draco folded his paper and put it aside and turned to blaise reality check parkinson does not give a damn about you yeah sorry mate but you know it me she wants i ll be more than glad to let you have her but let face it when she obsessed with someone she ll turn the world upside down just to have him do you remember what she did to marcus flint a few years ago even though he was a little older than her she made him miserable until he gave up polyjuiced a frog to look like him and let her kiss it just so she would leave him alone he said and then mumbled to himself umm maybe i should do that too i think the frog died an hour later poor thing never knew what was coming draco made the comment with a sarcastic smile i dontcare blaise ignored draco and retorted back to harry let her use me just so i could have her for one minute he said and then his face froze hold on a sec did you say something about quidditch tryouts yeah on friday night i thought you didnthear why you want to tryout that would be cool dontyou think blaise said he looked like a lightening bulb had been lit above his head meaning he had an idea that way pansy will notice what a great chaser i am and everyone knows the chaser gets more attention than any other player on the team right he asked more to himself than his friends but draco answered cynically oh yeah sure and rolled his eyes harry just shook his head disbelievingly and knew that blaise was for the time being hopeless but he wasntfinished there blaise decided that harry had gone too far so he told them after the bell rang that he didntwant to speak to them for a while because they were supposed to help him with stuff like that so he walked out alone to their next class without saying anything else to them oh great draco mumbled had to say that didntyou oh of course blame me with all of this harry retorted quite annoyed well you started it you told him i did not did too no arguing in the hallways a voice said calmly unfortunately this voice belonged to hermione granger as she passed them by on their way to class filthy mudblood both draco and harry said in unison under their breaths and they calmed down at once harry noticed he used again the m word he promised to sirius he wouldntuse again but he couldnthelp it when he was around his friends he was a whole new person okay so how long do you reckon he wonttalk to us harry asked trying to focus back on the blaise issue draco smirked and said it wouldnttake long i think we ll survive his silence until dinner he said and they both tried to suppress another laugh the first quidditch practice took place on the second weekend after school had started harry team had already drawn up tryouts for the three missing chasers blaise was excellent harry wondered why he never tried to be a player on the team if he was so good at dodging bludgers and score the quaffle through the goal posts because he got the position immediately and as for the other two chasers they were good and fast but not as good and fast as blaise was harry was also glad that blaise didntmention pansy since the first day of school and he was sure he was over her now slytherin as always stole the pitch from the other teams for their practice of course they had snape permission with them using the excuse that they needed to train their new chasers but it still counted as stealing and they were proud of it or so they were thought to be when harry and his teammates came out of the changing room and walked down the pitch they saw the last thing they ve expected that day gryffindor team was already playing in the air crabbe and goyle suggested knocking them off their brooms and the rest of the team supported that plan but not harry he stopped them at the last second before they soared into the air truly harry was mad at the gryffindors for taking their time at the pitch but before he let them know that they made a very big mistake he wanted to see how strong their team was he wanted to see their moves their players and their tactics from what he could see their team has improved since last year and honestly they were indeed a good team harry scanned the sky for their seeker but he couldntfind that little red headed girl he started to look for her around the pitch right when a flash of gold crossed his eyes and one second later he was knocked to the ground by someone fuck he exclaimed clutching the back of his head where he felt a sharp pain followed by what might have been blood that dripped forcefully inside of his grip got it the weasley girl called from up the air harry opened his eyes and saw her flying about 12 feet above him the snitch was held tightly in her hand he saw her freckled face shoot him a sneering look and then she poked her tongue out at him just before all of the gryffindor team flew to meet her good one ginny ron weasley clapped on his sister back and laughed lightly draco and blaise helped harry to get up he quickly seized his wand from his back pocket he didntmind that his head was bleeding he wanted her to pay for the pain she caused him he wanted to fly up and start to shoot curses at her but he felt everyone holding him back the scene around him started to spin he suddenly felt very weak his body was sloppy and he lost the grip on his broom and wand that were in his hands and he fell to the ground darkness taking over him as he fainted oh look he waking up blaise voice said from a great great distance harry opened his eyes to see himself lying on a bed in the hospital wing even though he thought blaise and draco stood near the door they were actually sat right next to his bed draco explained what happened i i fainted harry asked stunned after he heard the whole story he never ever lost consciousness before he reached up to where the pain was still fresh and felt bandages wrapped around his forehead what that he asked at first confused but then he realized that his head must still be bleeding madam pomfrey entered the ward from her office mr potter i see you re awake now i need to be sure that you donthave to stay here overnight and then you can leave how many fingers am i holding up she held up three fingers and a thumb from what harry could see he hoped he was right he didntwant to spend the night in this place he barely ever stepped inside the infirmary only when one of the team players got hit by a bludger or something so he went to visit him with the rest of the team four he tried to sound like he was sure of what he saw are you guessing or do you really see me holding up four fingers she asked i see you holding three fingers and a thumb now am i right and i can leave or do i need to tell you what color your shoes are she pouted and put her hands on her hips i not appreciating your attitude mr potter but you may leave harry sat upright in the bed and reached again to his head to take off the bandages what are you doing madam pomfrey asked you canttake them off until tomorrow morning i sorry she didntsound like she was sorry i cantwalk around with these things on my head he complained well you have to goodbye harry had to hurry to the common room as fast as he could draco and blaise may look innocent but he knew they made fun of him behind his back he didntcare that they would see him like this just as long as nobody else would oh that attractive harry cringed his teeth at the sound of the voice dreams snapped hopes shattering into small pieces weasley and granger stood together at the bottom of the stairs in the entrance hall weasley smirked at him and looked very pleased with whathis sisterdid to him shut up weasel it all your sister fault she did that on purpose harry said defending himself oh yeah try to prove it he shot back when i see her i swear his temper was rising now if you lay one finger on my sister your head isntthe only thing going to be wrapped in bandages weasley said threateningly leave him alone ron i think the bandages looking quite nice on him it like a new hat dontyou think so the weasley girl emerged from nowhere and now stood next to her brother crossing her arms over her chest a defeating smile cross her lips you you filthy little weasel harry spat he couldnttake this anymore no one would make fun of him or threaten him without getting punished he reached for his wand and pulled it out pointing it at the three gryffindors standing in front of him harry stop a man voice called harry turned around startled to see remus lupin his defense against the dark arts teacher and also one of his parents best friends standing on the stairs behind him what the hell do you think you re doing trying to attack three defenseless gryffindors he said as he came down a few stairs what how can you take their side they started it his sister is the reason my head is all wrapped in bandages ask draco and blaise they saw it too draco and blaise nodded to lupin he turned to look at the three gryffindors they all shook their heads in unison and looked innocent they re lying harry said do you think i really have time to attack these idiots whenever i feel like it okay you two he pointed to the two weasleys and you harry to my office now they all walked in silence to the second floor where lupin office was nobody dared to say anything or looked each other in the eye until they entered the office lupin made them stand side by side and then started to ask questions or actually to demand answers harry tell me what happened harry started to tell him about what happened that afternoon about how the weasley girl knocking him on the ground and made him lose consciousness okay ginny is that true did you do it on purpose no i was after the snitch it just happened to go right in front of him it was an accident she answered which this reminds me they stole the pitch from us today harry interfered pointing a finger at them we did not ron protested and he and his sister started to get into a row with harry each side claiming they had signed for the pitch first okay quiet everyone lupin shouted with his hoarse voice and the room was quiet again ginny you could have avoided crashing into harry right she nodded then why didntyou she shrugged and looked at the floor circling the stone with the toe of her shoe then it was on purpose lupin said and she nodded again facing the floor and stopped circling it with her shoe and did you have anything to do with it lupin turned to ron no i swear i only teased him earlier but that all he said innocently ha ha lupin sounded like he reached a decision i dontlike taking points off the houses and certainly not giving out punishments but i ll easy you with this one ginny detention for you tomorrow night for what you did to harry and no excuses of how much he deserved it i ll talk to you tomorrow morning to let you know when and where your detention will be set you two may go back to your common room now not wandering the hallways yes sir the two gryffindors said and went out of the office harry was triumph that she got punished and he wasn t though he hoped her brother would get a detention too but hey you canteat the cake and keep it whole right now about you harry lupin said from what i saw you just broke some of the school rules yourself no using spells in the hallways no attacking other students and there are a few more but let spare the details i sorry but i have to be fair and objective so a detention for you too tomorrow night harry nodded quietly he turned back to exit the room but then lupin stopped him wait i think it will be best if you inform your parents about today events including the detention you just got harry nodded again and headed back to his common room somehow it seemed fair to give him a punishment too he just didntknow why lupin caught harry at lunch the next day and told him that his detention would be at 7p m with professor snape in his office harry was disappointed to hear that he knew snape detentions were the worst and he hoped the head of his house would not hear about it somehow after all he said he trusted him completely and he didntwant to let him down after only two weeks but he had no choice ditching a detention from snape was the worst thing one could do harry arrived at snape office couple of minutes after 7 he sighed before he knocked twice on the door and when he heard snape calling him to come in he pressed down the handle and walked inside the room he didntexpect to see her there the weasley girl sitting in one of the chairs in front of snape desk and glaring back at him looking like she wasntso pleased to see him harry shot her back the same look what is she doing here he thought to himself but then remembered that lupin gave her a detention too come in mr potter close the door behind you please snape drawled and harry did as he was told i though i was doing this detention alone she said to snape the truth was that harry was also sure that he would be doing this detention alone that it would be just him and snape he would have preferred to do it with a whole bunch of gryffindors instead of this particular one well i guess you were wrong ms weasley you will be here with mr potter snape bent down and took a bucket of water and two sponges from the floor and placed them on his desk my office needs a little wash he said with an evil grin you will clean it with these sponges and of course without using magic i have some things to take care of so you ll be here alone for awhile i ll be back shortly and when i do i want to see you both on floor scraping and polishing it very nicely so when i look down at it i will see my reflection is that clear yes sir they said together good luck he said as he rose from his desk and left the office ginny took the bucket of water and put it on the floor she didntlook at harry though he had watched her since he entered the room she had her hair tied in a high ponytail and she still wore her school uniforms she sat on her knees and started to scrape the floor with a sponge her skirt was short and almost revealed more than harry was supposed to see she noticed he was looking at her and gave him a very angry look are you going to do something or do i need to tell snape that you just watched me do all the work by myself all the while he was gone she spat harry rolled his eyes at her and kneeled next to her taking the other sponge in his hand and starting to scrape the floor chill with the temper he muttered under his breath i heard that she said in through gritted teeth argh harry had enough even though he was scraping the floor for less than ten seconds he couldntstand being in the same room with this girl he threw his sponge stood up and started to pace around the room he couldntleave because then snape would let filch hang him upside down in the entrance hall so he stayed i cantbelieve i have to spend a detention with a with what she asked firmly also standing up and reaching his eyes level with a weasel with a shame for purebloods with muggle lover with a red head with a gryffindor come on potter say what you had in mind i dontcare because i already heard it all you re such an arse her dark brown eyes burned with rage harry couldntstare at them for long fearing he might lose himself inside of them oh yeah he retorted feeling his own temper rising just above the average and his heart starting to bit faster than usual well you are the most unbearable person i ever met she absentmindedly took a small step towards him and sharpened her gaze at him you are the most self centered arrogant human being i even came across oh yeah he yelled yeah she matched her voice to his tone level you re a foul little scumbag that what you are i think you re the most irritating person in the world well i think you re the most he started to shout back but then he looked down at her eyes tears were beginning to form in them he wasntsure if they were tears of anger or tears of some sort of pain he just knew that he didntwant to see tears in those gorgeous brown eyes of hers he suddenly saw something in her that he didntsee before she was pretty more than pretty it was indescribable and he couldntresist the words escaping his mouth the most beautiful and incredible person i ever seen his voice was now weak and almost like a whisper as soon as the words left his mouth ginny was ready to respond back with another rebuke she opened her mouth to insult him back but then realized what he said the truth was that harry didntregret saying those things to her even though it was an accident w what she asked bewildered he didntanswer her he didntwant to repeat it once again for fear that he just couldntsay those words again he just closed his eyes and leaned over placing his lips on hers ginny was in shock she blinked her wide open eyes once but didntcooperate on kissing him back after what seemed like 30 seconds or more had passed and neither of them pulled back she realized what was going on was he using her it seemed to her that he was she let a few tears roll down her cheeks as the thought sank in she decided that she wontlet anyone especially not harry potter use her she pulled back and looked at his eyes his emerald green eyes were studying her own he was waiting for her to say something because she was the one who stopped the kiss but she didntsay anything but only slapped him hard on the cheek oww he cried holding his aching cheek and then turning back slowly to face her she looked tentatively at him and he didntexpect her next move instead of walking away she threw her arms around his neck and pulled him closer to kiss him again her lips crashed hard against his this time taking them into one passionate kiss harry was confused one minute they were yelling at each other the second he was kissing her then she pulled back and slapped him but in the end she kissed him back ginny was also confused even more confused than harry why was she kissing him she told herself not to let him use her only this was the boy she had a crush on ever since she saw him on platform 9 when ron left for school but when she heard he was sorted into slytherin she told herself no she forced herself to forget him she never was able to forget him completely even when he cursed her her family and her friends she always found him so attractive and good looking but what was on the inside she never knew hem hem snape cleared his throat when he saw the scene before him harry and ginny parted immediately and looked at snape innocently snape dark and cold eyes moved to look from harry to ginny for a short and quiet minute before he finally looked at ginny ms weasley you may go now i think you ve done enough for tonight maybe too much than what was asked from you snape said coldly ginny nodded quietly and without a glance back at harry she left the office snape walked towards harry who gulped with difficulty snape watched him closely as he walked around him harry felt nervous by that and looked at the floor potter snape finally said causing harry to jump can i ask what was what i saw now happening in my office er harry tried to find something to say but he was too nervous to speak i i sorry sir he calmed down a little and managed to say it wonthappen again sir i i think she did something to me she must have put some sort of a spell on me i ll be more aware next time all right i shall have a talk with professor mcgonagall about her you too may leave now you re excused from this detention thank you sir harry walked out of snape office feeling relieved that he didntpunish him not that he had the right to but this was snape and he could have kept harry cleaning his office all night long alone he hurried to the great hall to get some leftovers for his missing dinner he felt someone placing a hand on his shoulder so he turned around to see ginny weasley looking very pissed before he knew what was going to happen she kneed him in the groin and said put a spell on you hua and ran away with tears in her eyes leaving him curled on the floor like a ball and whimpering from pain damn you weasley he said to himself after everything cooled down and he found his voice again all right now repeat after me r e v i e w that right now you will be reviewing this

thank you it took me some time to write this chapter see more details in the bottom a n for you so enjoy and please review after you re done chapter 6 harry punishments ginny went straight to the gryffindor common room she was relieved to see that it was empty because everyone else was still at dinner she sat on an armchair at the farthest corner of the room and crossed her arms around her knees she sat there alone thinking for what seemed like hours but every time she looked at her watch she saw that the time had barely passed by how could she make the stupid and uncharacteristic mistake of give giving harry potter the pleasure of doing whatever he wanted and take advantage of her not that they did anything more than kiss but she was still furious with herself she couldntbelieve herself she actually jumped on him and kissed him back merlin knows why she did that she was so angry and confused how could she have let her guard down and everything went fine until she heard what he told snape how could he he was the one who initiated the kiss ginny was brought back to reality from her thoughts when she heard someone calling her name ginny are you all right hermione asked ginny looked up and saw her and ron standing in front of her looking concerned it was then that she realized that she had tears in her eyes again she slowly shook her head and sniffed what happened ron asked when ginny didntreply hermione asked did something happen in detention did snape say something that offended you it wasntsnape ginny said in a whisper then who ron asked ginny just shook her head again never mind ron i okay now she said and tried to sound calm bollocks ginny people dontcry for anything he argued come on tell me just let it go already ginny snapped i wontuntil you tell me who made you cry ron demanded ron maybe you should let me talk to her hermione whispered to her boyfriend but ginny heard her anyway and said that she didntwant to talk about it at all i ll owl mum if you wonttell me who did this to you ron threatened and i ll tell dumbledore and mcgonagall if you leave me no choice ron turned to leave but the words he said seemed to affect ginny she stood up and held his arm to stop him from making another step before he took off no she yelled in shock i ll tell you but you have to swear to me you wonttell anyone you too hermione she added i so humiliated and i dontneed the whole school to know what happened and give me a hard time ron and hermione nodded and the three of them moved to the couch in front of the fireplace once ginny felt comfortable she let out a sigh and started to tell them everything that happened in detention with harry he did what ron cut ginny off in mid sentence when she told them about the kiss i going to kill that little bastard ron shut up ginny hissed the last thing she wanted was that the group of fourth years that sat behind them to hear everything ron made a move to get up from the couch but both ginny and hermione forced him down ginny went on and told them everything else trying not to miss out on any details you kissed him back ron said in a low voice through gritted teeth obviously furious with what he was hearing he forced you didnthe he asked hoping to hear that his sister didntkiss harry potter by her free will he didntforce me ron ginny said she lowered her head so she wouldnthave to look at his face and see his reaction but ron just gaped at her wait a minute hermione began interrupting the silence if you kissed him back then why were you crying ginny started to explain what happened the minute snape caught them kiss snape told me to leave so i did but i stayed behind his office door and i heard harry tell him that i put a spell on him what now it was hermione turn to shout ron got up quickly and succeeded in avoiding ginny grasp on his arm again and ran out of the common room leaving hermione and ginny alone in there he started to run towards the great hall when he spotted draco blaise and harry exiting it and heading to the dungeons potter ron roared causing all the people present in the room to look at them harry looked up and as he saw him he felt a lump build in his throat draco and blaise looked at harry and saw him freeze at the sight of ron approaching them they didntknow exactly what was going on and they didntknow how to react but with any step ron made toward them they made one backwards you ron shouted when he was two feet away from harry without any hesitation he took a swing with his fist and aimed it to harry face knocking him down if you ever come near my sister again i swear i will kill you you and your bloody friends stay away from her he shouted at harry limp form on the floor and walked back up to gryffindor tower to tell his sister that everything was okay now what up with you weasleys being so damn violent harry called out at ron kneeling on the floor nursing a bleeding lip he looked around and saw students whispering and shooting glances at him oh sure now there no teacher to save the day and see what really happened he said to himself draco and blaise hurried back to help him get up when harry was on his feet again he wiped the blood off his bottom lip gently touching the cut arentyou going to do something to him blaise asked him no he not worth it what was he talking about what did you do to his sister draco asked he exchanged a confused look with blaise they were now heading to the dungeons like they were going to before the encounter with ron nothing harry lied i have no idea what he was on about he probably thinking i attacked her with a spell or something after what she did to me yesterday which i did not let send crabbe and goyle to punish him blaise suggested with an evil smirk nah things can only get worse i dontwant to get into more trouble than i am now this morning i received a very angry letter from my parents about the detention i got because of that weaslette i dontwant to receive a howler tomorrow in addition to that he had to say that even if it was true he just didnttell them the whole truth how could he explain to them what happened earlier with the red head girl they wouldntunderstand they d probably make fun of him or something he knew he probably deserved the punch from ron and the knee in the balls from ginny because what he had said to snape he shouldnthave said that but the words slipped out of his mouth he shifted his eyes down and saw his lip starting to get blue and swell it hurt but the pain was sufferable tomorrow morning he decided he would walk up to her and apologize but now all he needed was ice to make the pain go away so he could get some sleep oh harry poo i heard what happened last night are you all right pansy started again to annoy him at breakfast take a hike pansy harry said throwing his toast back to his plate in the lost of his appetite dontyou worry harrikins i ll make the pain go away said pansy who pushed herself between harry and draco and sat on harry lap throwing her arm around his neck and hugging him tight she broke the hug quickly and leaned in to kiss harry sod off harry said pushing pansy away from him in disgust as he got up from his seat i think i going to puke he said to himself harry looked over at blaise but he didntseem to mind that pansy was all over him again blaise sat two seats away from harry shot him an amused look and continued to do his homework before the first class all right pansy cried out you know what fine and she walked off though nobody really seemed to care about her dramatic exit harry let out a long sigh and sat back in his seat looking at his neglected toast he had a strange feeling that someone was watching him he felt someone eyes on him and when he looked around the slytherin table he couldntsee anyone giving him any looks so he looked around the hall finally he spotted that person who was staring at him sitting at the gryffindor table was none other than ginny weasley when she saw he was looking back at her she immediately looked away harry sighed again it going to be a long day around five o clock at the afternoon harry went into the library after searching the hallways all day for ginny he saw her walking with some friends into the library and decided to follow her he crept behind bookshelves pretending to be looking for a book if someone saw him he she d know what he was really doing because harry never visited the library he pushed aside two large books so he could get a clear view of ginny she sat at a table with her friends and started to work on an essay harry wished he could talk to her alone but he couldntjust show up and ask her if they could talk in front of her friends surely not to apologize to her in front of them so he waited and it didnttake long for her friends to say goodbye to her and leave like he thought ginny was all alone now it was the perfect time to talk to her harry looked around to see if anybody was watching him and when the coast was clear he walked slowly to her table he sat two seats to her right and looked completely innocent they didntsay anything to each other and she didnteven ask him to leave the table nor did she get up to leave but only cast him a strange look shook her head slowly in disbelief and returned to her essay new here she finally asked a small sarcastic grin on her face harry tried to smile back but found it painful and almost impossible to do with his new fat lip ouch he mumbled wincing from the pain ginny looked up again and saw him holding his sore lip with closed eyes very funny he muttered when the pain passed well i ve never seen you here before what are you doing here anyway she went back to her essay again as odd as it may sound i here to apologize for my behavior yesterday he said good ginny replied but if you expect to hear an apology from me you better leave because i not regretful for what i ve done actually i know i deserved it i sorry for what i said he said sheepishly and looked at the table you re not used to apologizing a lot are you she asked curiously harry let out a small laugh no especially not to girls ginny also chuckled and focused back at her parchment we dontbite you know oh some of you do what never mind he replied shrugging it off he didntreally know what to say to her now he saw a small lock of her red hair fall from her loosened ponytail and she swept it behind her ear though harry thought she looked cute the way it was before she stopped writing and started absently to sway her quill with her thumb and index finger as she searched for ideas to put in her essay need help harry asked when he saw her do so ginny let out another chuckle but a different one this time a mocking one i serious what is it transfiguration he asked as he craned his neck to see what the book in front of her was about yes she said but no thank you i got an e in the transfiguration o w l he said i can really help you there i dontwant to get an e i want an o ginny said and went back to think after a few seconds she spat you re distracting me i cantconcentrate when you re here what exactly about me is distracting you he asked with a mischievous tone in his voice what do you want ginny asked loudly causing some of the students around to shush her so now she whispered you apologized right so please leave me alone if you dontwant a black eye from me or from my brother i just wanted to know if ginny someone said causing both harry and ginny to look up harry saw a young black guy wearing gryffindor uniforms standing in front of their table looking angrily at him dean thomas harry thought what he doing with ginny what going on is he bothering you dean asked her no dean he not ginny answered sweetly she started to gather her books and things and got up harry noticed a little dark book falling from the pile of books she was holding harry leaned to the floor and picked it up but ginny didnteven notice that something was missing here hold those for me please she said and stuffed the books into dean hands thank you she said to him softly dean leaned over and kissed her on the lips harry saw that ginny didntseem to mind his kiss he felt a little twinge of jealousy when he saw her kissing him back they didnteven care that harry was watching them with a frown on his face oh you know there a hogsmeade weekend before halloween i was thinking we can go together he said after he pulled back from their kiss ginny cheeks went red as same as the color of her hair er can we talk about it someplace else she asked in embarrassment eyeing harry right dean said ginny walked away and didntsee the nasty look dean shot harry before walking after her harry watched them leave together ginny was holding dean hand and leaning her head on his shoulder what did she see in dean thomas anyway how could he be better than me harry thought he was fuming well he could smell something burning in fact something was burning harry looked down and saw the hem of his robes was on fire he didntrealize that when he saw dean kiss ginny his wand shot sparks and they kindled his robe harry apathetically repaired his robes with the help of his wand and got up he became aware that he was still holding the little black book he picked up from the floor and forgot to give it back to ginny harry examined the thin book closely it had a black leather cover with the initials g m w engraved on it in silver a diary harry realized he was curious to know what was written inside but he couldntdo that his conscience was holding him back from opening the book and starting to read harry stuffed the diary into his robe and decided to keep it until he met ginny again so he could give it back to her he wouldntread it because he knew that was the wrong thing to do at night harry found himself lying in his bed wide awake he couldntsleep knowing the diary that belonged to the girl he had a crush on lay on his bedside cabinet harry looked at the diary what can happen if he ll read only one line a paragraph an entry nothing right and ginny would never know anyway screw my conscience i reading it a n did i end it with a cliffy hee hee yes i did lol i love beating up harry i evil i know but it fun and i know i made ginny such a crying baby in this story but she wontcry anymore hint hint d sorry i didntupdate for the past month but i had difficulties to think of a plot and i blame my laziness for it as well and my beta just sent the fixed chapter back anyway you have to review if you wontreview no chapter 7 for you and i can tell you that it ready because this chapter was suppose to be like 10 pages longer but i split it into two parts so it up to you review and chapter 7 will

read the whole review and burst out laughing so hard i think tears were coming out of my eyes lol so seriously now no dean wontdie sorry but on the other hand you never know what can happen to him and ginny later on p pheonixflyer dontworry i wontchange the rating for three reasons 1 i suck at writing r fics or m now dontyou just hate the new rating system 2 i cantactually write r fics because i not of age yet i only 17 will be 18 only in august 3 i dontplan to write anything that is not proper for people under the age of 14 to read that way more people can read this fic ciberloco well i said i like to bit up people didnti so yes there will be more fights dontworry selenea well things will get more clear when harry will be back home for christmas but i already said it was because they kept him away from his friends and still didntexcept him as a slytherin and another reason that he angry about them is because he just a teenager and teenagers sometimes tend to get angry on their parents about the dursleys you ll read in this chapter and for everyone else who reviewed and read but got lazy to review thanks enjoy chapter 7 chapter 7 dear diary harry took the diary in his hands lightened his wand and opened the diary please let it be charmed he pleaded in his head this would be the only way he could stop himself from reading the diary though he knew he was doing something wrong which he would probably regret about later he looked down and started to browse through the pages of the diary unfortunately it was an ordinary diary he read the first entry august 31st 1992 dear diary my brother charlie bought me this diary for my birthday two weeks ago so this is my first entry tomorrow will be my first day at hogwarts i cantwait i am finally going to see ron fred george and percy of course we ll spend the holidays together here at the burrow but being here with only mum drives me crazy i cantwait to learn how to do magic mum bought me all the books robes and a wand of my own though we needed to save money so we bought everything second hand except for my wand because the wand chooses the owner even though all of those things are so exciting i cantwait for tomorrow for a whole different reason him the love of my life the one i saw last year on platform 9 talking to ron fred and george everything harry had read so far was boring it was just an 11 years old girly trash he was about to close the diary and try to get some sleep when something written on the page caught his eye his own name talking to ron fred and george harry potter he read harry gulped hard his name was encircled with little red hearts ginny had had a crush on him merlin he didntknow it he always thought she hated his guts he could perfectly remember his first day on platform 9 flashback all you need to do in order to get up onto the platform is to go straight into the barrier between platforms nine and ten until you will be on the platform got it james asked harry bending down to his eye level and gesturing with his hand to the barrier he had just talked about harry nodded slowly but still looked confused what if he crashed into it oh here watch them lily said and pointed towards a family of red heads going through the barrier and disappearing once they went through it harry nodded to his father with understanding and james rose back up all right now you try and we ll be right behind you she said james nodded to them that the coast was clear from muggles and harry pushed his cart and ran towards the stone barrier the view changed and he could see he was on a new platform an old steam powered scarlet train stood next to it the platform was packed with people kids were walking with their parents all of them carrying with trolleys like his you still have fifteen minutes harry james said after crossing the barrier with lily look james here remus lily said and led them to remus lupin who was talking to the two older red heads harry saw earlier come on harry you know remus is going to be your defense against the dark arts teacher right he starting today just like you james said with a smile harry parents stopped next to remus harry followed but looked around the place and enjoyed the scene james lily hey remus greeted when he saw his friends hey harry feeling nervous he caught harry attention and messed his untidy raven black hair and causing his little square shape glasses to become askew on the bridge of his nose a little harry said fixing his glasses are you a bit but then of course i remember that i already attended hogwarts and that i only going back as a teacher he told him then he turned back to james and lily oh silly me i forgot to introduce you to the weasleys molly arthur i would like you to meet my best friends james and lily potter and their son harry harry is a first year starting today hello nice to meet you the plump red headed lady called molly weasley shook james and lily hands the old thin slightly balding man who wore glasses looked at lily in awe are you really he asked merlin you and sirius black defeated the dark lord it a pleasure to meet you he shook lily hand aggressively and then james and finally gave harry a wide smile you have a sister who is a muggle right he asked lily sounding very interested arthur molly snapped at her husband smacking the back of his bald head and causing his small glasses to fall to the end of his nose you have to excuse my husband he head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office in the ministry and when it comes to muggles he totally obsessed he doesntunderstand that they re just normal human beings like us except for the fact they cantdo magic you hear me arthur yes dear he said quietly and added a polite sorry to lily lily chuckled in amusement actually it okay yes my sister and her husband are muggles but we re not in touch with them they dontlike the fact that i a witch said lily oh sorry to hear about it molly said apologetically molly and arthur and their two elder sons are actually joining the order remus interrupted oh really james asked with interest yes we talked to dumbledore and everything is settled molly said we really want to contribute what we can and help catch the free death eaters out there mother i need to be in the prefect compartment where my sandwich harry saw a red head boy the oldest of the family there now standing next to molly he also wore glasses and he was already in his hogwarts uniforms harry noticed a shiny scarlet and gold badge on his chest with the letter p on it molly excused herself from the conversation james lily remus and arthur continued to talk about their own business none of which interested harry so he continued to look around him ten minutes to eleven he noticed the hour of the clock on the platform wall harry was bored so he watched molly weasley talking to her son to escape the imposing boredom here you go percy corned beef exactly as you like it molly said as she pulled out a wrapped sandwich from the bag she was holding in her hand now where are you brothers right here two identical red head twin brothers chorused together behind her next to them stood a young long nosed boy and a small freckled girl both with red hair the boy looked around harry age but taller than him and the girl a bit younger than both of them all right what have you two been up to now molly asked suspiciously nothing the twins said together innocently when the two of you say nothing together it a sign for trouble percy said oh ickle perciekins is a prefect one of the twins teased how does it feel to be a prefect perfect percy the other twin joked and pinched his brother cheek with his fingers harry tried not to smile but couldnthelp it his grin gave him away when mrs weasley looked at him oh ron this is harry potter she suddenly said he is a first year too lily looked around to them when she heard that oh this is great maybe they could be friends all of harry friends unfortunately are muggles she explained to mrs weasley it would be nice if he was to have a wizard friend what house were you all of us were in gryffindor we hope ron and ginny will too she ll attend next year where is she by the way molly looked around and then spotted her daughter oh ginny come here sweetie dontget too far harry saw she was shooting him weird looks before walking to her mother this is great then we were also gryffindors i bet harry and ron will be good friends lily said excitedly harry and ron started to talk and then the twins butted in and introduced themselves as fred and george the train started to whistle and everyone hurried their children to get onto it harry heard remus promise his parents he would keep an eye on him harry said goodbye to his parents they wished him a good year and promised that they d see him at christmas and reminded him to write a lot harry got up on the train and went to find a compartment with ron he heard the little girl crying behind along with the yells of mrs weasley at fred and george that she didntwant to receive letters telling her they got detentions again they whined and said it impossible for them not to get into trouble the twins calmed their sister by telling her that she would be seeing them soon though harry had a strange feeling that she wasntjust crying about their departure and they got on the train end of flashback was she crying because he was leaving very unlikely but who knows he didnteven know she had a crush on him harry kept reading the entry but there was nothing special about this entry beside what he had just read he looked for his name in the rest of the diary entries curious to know more to see what else she wrote about him he found in the second entry something quite interesting september 10th 1992 dear diary how can this be why did i deserve it he a slytherin now i know why ron never said a word about him when he came back from hogwarts an evil wizard that what he will become one day i cantfall for a slytherin what was i thinking ginny harry continued to look for others clues about him he found one and read it she wrote this entry at february 14th 1993 still at her first year she wrote how he stared at her that day but she didntknow why she thought it was because it was valentine day or because he knew it was she who sent him the valentine poem that morning harry remembered that poem he wasntembarrassed by it and laughed at it but he didntknow who wrote it back then he just thought it was pathetic and awfully written he read the rest of the entry and noticed the words but i still loved him she also wrote that her brothers told her to forget him but as right as they were it was difficult for her to do so he flipped the pages and stopped at the date december 19th 1994 harry could sense that her writing had improved with time she began to write more seriously and to the point not to babble about things nonstop at the same entry harry read how neville longbottom asked her out to the yule ball she accepted because it was her only chance for going since third years werentallowed to go she wrote that it was her first date but she wasntexcited about it at all because she didntfancy neville because neville was not him he moved on to january 27th 1995 she wrote about how she had fun at the ball and she even met a guy michael corner he asked her out and she said she would think about it harry was puzzled she didnteven mention him once in that entry he turned over the page and read the next entry she told about the great date she had with michael at hogsmeade but she thinking of breaking up with him is that why dean thomas going with her now harry thought but again found his eyes returning back to the page when he noticed the post script in the entry he just read it said p s needless to say that i over stupid harry potter excuse me harry thought shocked and annoyed at the same time stupid how dare she call me stupid harry moved to the end of the diary and read the last entry he was surprised it was written in red ink and not with her usual neat handwriting september 15th 1996 harry realized ginny wrote it only yesterday i hate him i hate him hate him i hate bloody harry potter what harry blurted in shock but as he realized he said it out loud he looked around his room to see he didntwake his friends up how could he who the hell does he think he is he bloody kissed me why would i expect receiving a kiss from the idiotic slytherin toad toad she got too far harry mumbled angrily bloody kiss and bloody harry potter did i say that i hate him he thinks he can get what he wants if he ll say to me that i beautiful and amazing but oh how he wrong i never even wanted to kiss him back in the first place but old feelings gathered up and i couldntcontrol myself i dontlove him and i regret that i ever had a crush on him i hate him and i hate myself for kissing him the thing that i hate the most right now is that he told snape i put a spell on him he wishes i mean how could he one second he kisses me and the other he throws that in my face good for me to knee him and good for ron to punch him because he deserves what he got only problem now is dean i dontwant him to know what happened he too sweet to lose he a much better boyfriend than michael and things going really well i hope ron or hermione wonttell him i really like him ginny harry closed the diary there werentanymore entries to read and even if there were he wouldntread them how could he think she was great maybe she used to fancy him but now she really hated him and she had a boyfriend things were so complicated now he didntnotice her when she liked him and when he finally sees her she not that girl anymore now he liked her but she clearly confused she writes about how much she hates him but she still has feelings for him so what does she really feel and what does he feel for her after reading her personal thoughts he decided to let it go she not worth the trouble they are plenty of girls out there that would actually throw themselves at him tomorrow he would give her back the diary and walk away but no matter what she says and why she trying to convince herself she hates him harry knew she didn t she still kissed him back his mind went to think about dean thomas he hadntknown she had a boyfriend and she said she doesntwant to lose him because they really good together so he decided an eye for an eye weasley he thought you make me jealous i ll make you jealous harry woke up the next morning hearing howls of laughter around his dormitory he stretched out his hands put his glasses on and got up from bed to see draco and blaise reading ginny diary and laughing occasionally god harry where did you find this diary draco sniggered when he saw him getting up from bed what are you doing harry asked in shock it took him a few seconds to realize that ginny wrote about him in her diary and those were personal things that he didntwant his friends to know read him this one blaise said to draco pointing his fingers in the page right harry listen you ll be very interested to hear this draco cleared his throat and started to read from the diary mimicking a little girl voice even though all of those things blah blah blah i cantwait for tomorrow for a whole different reason him the love of my life the one i saw last year on platform 9 talking to ron fred and george harry potter merlin harry this girl had a crush on hey what are you doing give it back draco yelled at harry who snatched the diary from draco hands and didntlook very pleased about what his friends did harry didntfollow his friend order so draco pulled out his wand and called accio diary the diary flew from harry grasp back to draco hand draco looked at the cover of the diary who g m w harry i think i read the name ginny at the end of the entry blaise said he made a thinking face and said ginny the only ginny i can think of is ginny weasley the one who knocked him down couple of days ago draco give it back harry said calmly not before i read another juicy detail he smirked and opened the diary again blaise leaned behind his shoulder and peeked in give it back harry said firmly draco i serious give it back no i dontwant to what do you have to hide anyway he said as he thumbed through the pages harry saw he stopped at the last entry written in the red ink and draco and blaise started to read it harry didnthave the energy to chase after draco just so he can have the diary back not he hadnthave the strength to pull out his wand and accio it back because he knew he always has been weak perform magic in the morning he sat on the edge of his bed and waited until they d finished reading he looked blankly at the floor and heard draco chuckle for a second but then blaise gasped and harry closed his eyes what draco shouted suddenly harry thought he might do that that why his yell didntcause him to jump like it did to blaise you kissed her the weaslette harry got up from his bed walked toward his friends again and held out his hand yes now can i have the diary back i need to return it to her tough luck she hates you mate blaise said but why her why a gryffindor he said the last word with a disgusted look i thought you hated her draco said curiously closing the diary and giving it back to harry why didntyou say that why weasel punched you i dontwant to talk about it harry said sheepishly oh come on we re your friends we re not going to make fun of you blaise said i dontlike her okay harry lied he tried to sound calm but he couldntget rid of the annoyance in his voice this is my way to punish her for what she did to me the other day got it draco and blaise nodded so you mean you fooled her draco asked slowly harry just nodded harry got dressed quickly and went to find ginny in the great hall luckily he found her sitting alone at the gryffindor table reading a letter a small tawny owl just dropped her harry walked up to her and when he reached her he put the diary in front of her on the table ginny quickly turned around and saw him he could tell she was confused i i found this after you left the library yesterday i guess those are the initials of you name he said quietly d did you r read it she stuttered he knew she was afraid that he read what she wrote inside no harry lied from the corner of his eye he spotted dean thomas approaching them there was nothing left for him to say so he turned around and walked to the slytherin table he found himself staring at her smooth red hair during breakfast because she had her back turned to him he saw dean holding her hand and making her laugh when he told a joke harry shook his head vigorously harry are you okay he heard someone asking but he didntregister who it was harry looked around the table until he saw pansy sitting quietly with millicent bulstrode he got up from his seat and walked quickly to pansy harry sighed before he nudged her shoulder with his finger she swung around and faced him he took a deep breath then cupped her face in his hands and leaned in to kiss her in a passionate way pansy squeaked at first from the shock but relaxed into the kiss and threw her arms around his neck pushing his body closer to hers and deepening the kiss harry could hear in the background many whistles and ooohs from the other slytherins something suddenly came to his mind he was kissing pansy parkinson harry broke the kiss and let go of pansy he tried to look like he enjoyed it wow pansy mumbled harry saw her face was deep red and she looked a little perplexed he smiled at her and walked out of the great hall as he walked he saw in the corner of his eyes ginny looking at him she was pale with shock harry smirked inwardly at her sight and left the hall he was late to potions on purpose that day he walked into the classroom his shirt was untucked and his tie was loosed he carried his robe over his shoulder and walked inside like nothing was wrong fortunately snape wasntaround so he walked slowly and took his time drawing everyone attention to himself but then snape entered from his office and harry ducked behind someone chair before he saw him when snape turned his back to the class harry sneaked to pansy desk and quickly managed to escape the potions master eyes he motioned crabbe to move to another table and harry took his seat next to pansy pansy looked excited and nervous at the same time harry made sure that hermione granger ron weasley and dean thomas saw him before he turned her around and kissed her with another deep kiss which again caused all the slytherins to clap their hands and whistle and the gryffindors to look at them in shock and disgust silence everyone snape called and mr potter thank you for finally joining us i will see you in detention tonight in my office at seven o clock for being fifteen minutes late all the gryffindors ooohed with amusement but harry didntcare detention would take his mind off the little red head that insisted to be stuck in his mind after class draco and blaise walked with harry back to the common room what up with you today draco asked what do you mean harry asked first you kissed parkinson at breakfast and now in class he sounded as shocked as the gryffindors were earlier i may have changed my mind about her harry replied hey blaise you dontmind right harry didntsee blaise sulk since blaise walked ahead of him and draco but he sensed something was wrong when he didntanswer him blaise he asked again worried about his sudden silence blaise stopped walking and almost caused draco and harry to crash into his back blaise turned around and faced harry you said you cantstand her and you told me to take her off your back blaise said sounding offended i thought you were over her harry explained well i not over her i didnttalk about her because i knew you were tired of it so i stopped but i didntstop feeling the way i did i sorry harry said apologetically i didntknow draco rolled his eyes in boredom i going to do my homework he said and left for the common room look blaise i ll let her go if you want her that much harry said he didntwant to hurt his best friend just because he wanted a certain gryffindor girl to notice him by using the object of blaise affection blaise face lit up a little really yeah i might say something about you to her if you d like blaise now grinned stupidly and nodded thanks rumors had been spread all over school by dinner time the hot topic was that harry and pansy been an item of course but seeing blaise suffered from the talking harry made his way toward pansy again when she saw him approach her she made him some room to sit next to her but he didnttake it he looked seriously in her eyes before he said look pansy i dontthink it will work out what she sounded confused me and you i mean he said watching her eyes go glassy with tears oh how he hated when they cry girls go figure i sorry it not you pansy please dontgive me the it not you it me clich she cut him off i wasntgonna harry answered why would she think it was about him god knows why i was going to say it blaise who pansy truly sounded like she didntknow who blaise is blaise zabini my friend you know him harry turned around and pointed her towards blaise direction who was stuffing a steak and kidney pie into his mouth at that moment pansy looked lost by now why is it about him because he really fancies you and i care for you both and i think you two could really hit it off he added with an assuring smile pansy made an offended sound and got up from her seat she shot her nose up snobbishly and called loudly so everyone in the hall could hear her merlin knows what i found so fascinating in you harry potter you are nothing but an arrogant childish and selfish boy who thinks he has it all and not to mention what a lousy kisser you are she snapped and walked out of the hall with her slytherin girlfriends hot on her heals harry couldnthave been happier he finally got rid of pansy and now he could couple her with blaise though it would take some time for her to cool down and ginny saw it all right at that moment harry turned to take a glimpse at the gryffindor table but the only red head he could spot was the irritating brother of hers no way all this scene was for nothing eww eww eww draco walked with quick steps into the common room in his bathrobe slippers and towel what blaise asked him harry was too busy writing an essay about vampires to see how ridiculous draco looked at the moment i just bumped into weasley in the prefects bathroom draco said looking horrified that was all it took to get harry attention which weasley he asked carefully trying not to send any hint of interest the male one the sight of him with a towel around his pale skinny body was absolutely gross draco exclaimed and his all body shuddered believe me seeing his sister with a towel would be a much more pleasant sight for my eyes oh harry said and tried to get back to his essay without making any remark of jealousy oooh blaise said suddenly with amusement in his voice no he didntcatch that harry mind pleaded harry still fancies her he added in a singing voice i do not harry protested than why are you blushing scarlet be beca because you re making me nervous with all of your stupid and false statements okay but you did fancy her before didntyou no oh shut up you two draco interrupted blaise went quiet and harry went back to his essay i going to my bed he said and went for the boys dormitories blaise looked around to see if draco was gone he slowly leaned his body towards harry and whispered i know you fancy her harry had enough he reached for a pillow that lay on the couch and threw it at blaise blaise got up without saying another word to him he only gave him a smirk and received a threatening look from harry and with that he left him alone a n sorry if the dates in the diary dontmake sense it

one friday evening at end of october when harry gathered his teammates for the last quidditch practice before the game against gryffindor the follow morning the team has never been better than this year and harry was satisfied and proud to be their captain while he caught the snitch over and over again draco blocked the quaffle that blaise and the other two chasers leroy graham and ben jackson tried to throw through the goal posts and crabbe and goyle did an excellent job of blocking leroy and ben attempts by hitting bludgers at them such a fine job they almost knocked the chasers off their brooms when he called them in for a final talk before practice ended he opened with a speech saying that he didntwant them to disappoint him and told them that there was no reason for them losing the game to the gryffindors he dismissed them and walked back to the castle along with blaise and draco i think you should promise us the same thing blaise said suddenly what do you mean harry asked confused well see blaise started the gryffindor seeker is none other then your current crush ms weasley if we lose the game to them it will be only because you let her catch the snitch because she fluttered her eyelashes at you or something like that oh not this again harry growled yeah i getting tired of this too draco said with a yawn they just walked up the few stone steps to the castle dinner was about to start in the great hall and the sound of hundreds of students could be heard yeah listen blaise harry began let say that hypothetically i do have a crush on her dontyou think i can separate personal feelings and professional business i wontlet her get the snitch and i dontcare how great a seeker she is i have never missed the snitch and i not going to miss it tomorrow clear as a crystal blaise responded with a weird smirk on his face harry didntknow what he was smirking about until they walked into the entrance hall and saw the same girl they had just talked about standing near the doors of the great hall with her boyfriend harry eyes locked on her and suddenly everything seemed to go in a slow motion so on sunday because you have that game tomorrow harry heard dean saying to her i dontknow dean i really should study i have loads of homework and it o w l s year i want to have good grades ginny replied as an excuse her arms were wrapped around couple of books she was holding tight to her chest she looked a bit uncomfortable around dean for some strange reason come on ginny we haventbeen on a normal date for a long time now and i d really like to take you out it halloween hogsmeade weekend are you really going to study on a holiday yes dean i am and i sorry they had just passed the arguing couple and harry saw her shoot him a quick glance before she shifted her eyes back to dean she quickly added another time okay and she walked into the great hall quickly leaving dean alone harry suddenly woke up from his daze when he heard blaise chuckle and say something to draco hmm did you see that blaise said playfully yeah i saw that we re so losing tomorrow game draco replied with the same tone harry could only sigh now that his friends caught him red handed staring at ginny he tried to make excuses but everything he said didntmade any sense so he finally gave in and admitted that he did fancy her a bit and he was glad that his friends didntmake a big deal out of his confession harry decided that he wouldntlet his team down whatever he felt towards ginny was to stay behind until the game was be over he would play fairly and treat her like he treated all the other seekers he played against in the past he didntforget the talk he had with snape the day before after the last potions class ended snape had asked him to stay behind again harry had wondered what he had done wrong this time but instead of getting yelled at he was surprised to hear snape wishing him good luck at the game of course that wasntall and before harry left the classroom snape added in a threatening voice that they better win this match so now harry was in the changing room giving his team a final pep talk before the game began all right guys let show them what we ve got he said when he finished talking and everyone proclaimed their competitive spirit together one by one they hopped on their brooms flew out of the changing room and onto the pitch the weather was nice and convenient for a game the skies were light blue with a shade of the end of october grey in them a cloud or two hid the warm sun and a cool breeze blew through their hair raising everyone spirits and here the slytherin team called dennis creevey the new commentator potter malfoy graham zabini jackson crabbe and goyle they could hear loads of cat calls at them from the three other houses but all of the slytherin house cheered them and that was what really mattered and from the other side of the pitch comes the gryffindor team weasley slopper kirke bell weasley gates and bennett now it was totally the opposite the slytherins booed and the other three houses cheered with all their might everyone made a few warm up laps around the stadium before they landed on the pitch in front on madam hooch who was ready with the quaffle in her hands oddly enough dumbledore snape mcgonagall and remus werentin the teachers stands madam hooch hagrid flitwick and sprout were the only adults watching the game captains shake hands madam hooch ordered reluctantly harry walked a few steps forward as did ron weasley harry knew the tradition every time the captains shook hands it was to wish the other captain bad luck at the game harry extended his hand to ron who hesitantly shook it probably aware of the pain harry wanted to cause him harry pressed his fingers on ron lean palm and started to squeeze it hard it seemed to work because ron let out a faint whimper and then pulled his hand back quickly wrapping it with his other hand to ease the pain no i guess ron wasntaware of the secret handshake harry thought oh well he does now he added mentally to himself that this was his payback for the fat lip the weasel gave him madam hooch however didntseem to notice what happened or chose not to because she was used to it by now ready she asked after each captain went back to his place i want a fair game no funny business you get it mount your brooms she said and released the three balls that were locked in the box which was sitting on the ground next to her she then blew hard on her whistle and threw the quaffle high into the air as all fourteen players rose from the ground they had a good start blaise got the quaffle within two seconds and he was already on his way to the goal posts he spotted a gryffindor chasers coming his way and threw the ball to ben who passed it to leroy all three of them ducked as a bludger almost hit them blaise got the possession of the quaffle again and flew the gryffindor goal posts ron weasley was ready to block the ball but missed it when blaise pretended to aim it to the right loop but instead shot it to the left one slytherin scores ten zero called dennis ceevey voice to the megaphone within only five minutes slytherin scored four more goals while gryffindor was stuck with a zero harry wasntworried about his team and while they played with the quaffle he was looking for the snitch too bad it disappeared harry saw in the corner of his eye that ginny was still looking for it as well harry did a lap around the pitch thinking maybe this way he d have a new perspective and would find it hiding somewhere he didntbother to look earlier he looked very carefully at ginny to see if she had spotted the snitch before him ooh gryffindor scores dennis said excitedly the score is fifty ten to slytherin but the game can end very differently slytherin may be a better team now more than ever especially since harry potter is their new captain but gryffindor new seeker ginny weasley can still save the day and bring them 150 points and it slytherin in possession again harry blocked creevey commentaries from his mind and shot an evil glare at draco for letting the gryffindors score draco was on the other edge of the stadium protecting the goal loops he caught harry glare but only shrugged with a sorry look on his face as a response the game continued and again blaise had the quaffle and he flew to the gryffindor goal posts hey zabini called katie bell who was flying very close to him i just saw pansy parkinson blowing you a kiss blaise abruptly stopped his broom and from the force of the halt almost fell backwards from it he managed to control it and balanced himself in time before he slipped he tossed his head in every possible direction what where i dontknow katie answered and with a swift movement of her hands she snatched the quaffle right from his grip and turned around it took blaise a few seconds to realize it was just a diversion but when he turned around and saw katie wave her hand at him and calling thank you he muttered bitch under his breath and went back on his pursue after the quaffle the game went on and the snitch hadntbeen found yet just then harry heard a buzzing sound from near by he looked around carefully as to not alert ginny to see where the snitch has just been he found it now hovering just a few inches above the ground without even thinking harry dove toward the little golden ball hoping it wouldntdisappear again a quick glance to his left showed him that ginny did the same thing and now they were on the same level and same distance from the snitch he could hear in the background the crowd sudden gasp and creevey excited commentary the fresh green grass came closer and closer by the second and luckily the snitch stayed put for a change he reached out his hand as he drew closer very aware of the fact that ginny body came very close to his closer and closer to the ground they flew and harry was sure he was going to crash if not into ginny into the ground but then the snitch wings twitched a little and both seekers knew what was going to happen next harry felt his feet sweep the grass as he halted his broom for a second and shot up back into the sky practically making a ten degree angle with the ground he picked up speed again as he rose higher into the air ginny was just behind him determined to catch the ball before him she forced her broom to reach his level their hands were still stretched out as they chased the little ball you must be a really good flier if your cleansweep can fly as fast as my firebolt he yelled to her the wind blowing on their faces made it almost impossible to hear even dennis creevey loud commentary sounded muffled to them she didntrespond to that and was still focused on the ball harry suddenly heard a whistle but it wasntmadam hooch s this one sounded different unsteady and louder it was getting stronger and stronger by the minute a little black dot came into view ahead of them the snitch decided to fly to the left and both of them changed their direction the black dot wasntlittle anymore and it was coming in their way as harry realized what the dot actually was panic came over him that was a bludger which was going to hit them any second if they didntstop chasing the snitch no beater was close enough to change its track pull away harry yelled at ginny no she yelled back she wasntafraid at all and continued chasing the snitch she was braver than him that why she was in gryffindor and he wasn t harry remembered his promise he wouldntlet her get the snitch and if it meant he had to chase it and be hit by a bludger to get it before her so be it he forced himself to be brave as well and focused himself on the tiny ball the bludger now closer than ever pull away now and i will do so as well he gave her another chance but she didntpull away and neither did he harry wasntsure if he would catch it but he wasntabout to chicken out his finger tickled the ball slightly and as the bludger hit them both in the shoulder he managed close his grip on the ball the next thing he knew he was lying sprawled on the ground he felt an enormous pain in his shoulder like someone ripped out his arm right out when he turned to check if his arm was indeed in its proper place he was relieved to see that it was still attached to his body he was also surprised to see he wasntonly holding the snitch but another hand as well his eyes widened as he followed the hand he held and saw it belonged to the unconscious ginny weasley lying by his side her ponytail wasntso neat and tight like she had before and it was messed because of the fall she looked so peaceful when she wasntconscious harry looked up at the sky unable to move his upper body his sight was blurry and he realized then that his glasses had fallen askew on the bridge of his nose he heard another whistle this one unmistakably belonged to madam hooch a group of people suddenly gathered around him in a circle and he could only see their heads looking down at him all right potter let go of my sister hand ron weasley said firmly i can t harry said i cantmove my arm bullshit let see you move a broken arm after a bludger hit you in the shoulder harry snapped ron ignored him and bent down to ginny and unsuccessfully tried to wake her up who won the game madam hooch katie bell asked they both caught the snitch i not sure this never happened before i can only think of two possible options one to do a rematch or two to announce slytherin as the winners because they had more points i call a rematch ron said immediately not even considering the matter there no way we re doing a rematch harry protested still lying on the ground why are you afraid to lose potter ron taunted weasley if we do a rematch not only we beat you sorry asses again but we ll gain more points while they argued a little voice spoke up we re not doing a rematch everyone fell silent as ginny stirred what ron exclaimed with shock we re not doing a rematch because i caught the snitch she said ron helped her sit up and she tried to pull her hand holding the snitch unaware it was clutched tightly inside harry palm when she gasped with pain ron seized her by the shoulders and held her still are you okay he asked worriedly no i think i broke my arm she lay back on her back taking in her surroundings she then saw her hand was held with harry s who was lying next to her on the ground looking up anyway see i caught the snitch she motioned her hand ignoring the fact that harry held the ball too we both caught it he said quietly avoiding looking at her face move aside coming through they could all hear madam pomfrey voice coming from near by the group of people that gathered around the two seekers split into two lines and then they saw madam pomfrey emerged from behind she held her first aid kit in her hands she bent down to see what happened tutting to herself they say they broke their arms informed her madam hooch yes i can see that they turned blue she replied however i donthave all the potions they need here we ll take them to the infirmary but first she suddenly reached out her hands and before harry could ask what she was doing he let out a sharp yell same as ginny s their hands came separated and the snitch zoomed into the air well what are you waiting for she asked them as neither of them got up from the ground draco who was one of the watchers helped harry get up to his feet and ron helped ginny they all walked out of the pitch together with the rest of the school and they were still arguing about who won the game shut up you lot called madam hooch i ll have a talk with your heads of houses and the headmaster and hopefully we will let you know who won the game by dinner time the two teams walked quietly into the hospital wing behind harry and ginny who were still avoiding each other eyes harry was seated by madam pomfrey on the closest bed to the door of the infirmary and ginny in the bed opposite his i got your broom harry said blaise i ll put it back in our dorms by your bed thanks he replied he turned to all his teammates and whispered so no one else could here hey guys no one agrees for a rematch got it everyone nodded madam pomfrey came back from her office with at least eight different potions in her hands and shooed everyone who wasntginny or harry out and then forced her two patients to drink all of the potions each potion pomfrey gave harry tasted worse than the one before you tend to get hurt a lot mr potter it wasntmadam pomfrey who said it but ginny truth be told all the bruises he suffered from lately happened because of this little redhead harry wondered if she was worth the trouble fighting for because all she did was hurt him tell me ms weasley he said after a few moments of thinking when madam pomfrey finally left the room was it worth risking your life for a victory in a game of course she replied simply harry frowned why do you hate your life that much no i hate you so much i dontmind ending my life so i wonthave to see you again she said sarcastically why do you hate me he sounded hurt because you re a git and you re stalking me oh you re saying it like it a bad thing he joked but then turned serious i not stalking you then how come wherever i go i see you there she inquired i dontcall it stalking i call it coincidence he said it could have been coincidence for the first or second time but now it like i have a tail with its own name and its name is harry potter fine i still not stalking you oh so you just happened to meet me in the library that day and sit at my table from all the tables around doing nothing er he was caught off guard i thought so she didntlet him respond the room was filled with silence full of tension finally she spoke again so did you have a good snog with parkinson harry smiled to himself glad the kiss with pansy finally paid off and made her jealous oh i had a great snog with her he said proudly couple of snogs actually he admitted good for you ginny said trying to sound sincere and like she meant it hua he huffed is that a hint of jealousy i hear in your voice he was interested to know how much it had affected her you would love that wouldntyou i d drown myself in the lake before i d be jealous of your new poodle you know i have to agree with you for the first time since we met she does look like a dog ginny laughed and harry joined her they were making jokes about how pansy would look like if she was wagging a tail they calmed down after couple of good laughs and then ginny turned to him seriously so why did you kiss her because it drives me mad when i see you kiss dean harry thought to himself no she doesntneed to know that harry shrugged i had a free snog why would i pass the opportunity he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world guys ginny rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath so you re saying you arentjealous not even a little bit he pressed ginny shook her head and said innocently no not at all you know if i knew better i d say you want me to be jealous no i just saying that because you cantjudge me for who i go out with or who i kiss because you kiss your boyfriend in every corner or a broom cupboard in school he said defensively not that i cantdo that because he is my boyfriend after all unlike you taking advantage from every girl you see but i cantblame you it obvious you re too scared of commitment and just for you know i think you re the one having problem with me snogging my boyfriend and not the other way around harry was speechless for a second but then he regained his composure and said who me no not at all madam pomfrey came back just then and helped them put a plaster on their broken hands by dinner time harry and ginny were released from the hospital wing harry walked to the common room to check if draco and blaise were there since he hadntseen them since lunch but they werentanywhere to be found the common room was deserted harry collapsed on the couch in front of the crackling fire examining the plaster cast on his arm a tap on the window got his attention and he looked up and saw a ghost owl waiting at the window sill a letter at his beak harry recognized the owl as merrill his father owl he got up from the couch and strode to the window to let merrill in the owl dropped the letter in harry free hand and waited in the warm room while harry read the letter dear harry we heard what happened today at the game from remus we hope you are feeling okay now and that you will be able to use your arm again really soon sorry we couldntcome visit you but we were loaded with work the handwriting style changed harry knew the first paragraph was written by his father and the rest of the letter as he saw was written by his mother what were you thinking harry chasing the snitch when you see a bludger coming your way you could have been killed if you do that again i swear i ll have you off the team in a second and i dontcare if you are the captain and thank you really for telling us they picked you by the way you had to catch your father quidditch madness didntyou anyway sweetie have fun and get well soon we ll see you at christmas if not sooner love mum and dad p s if you re interested to know padfoot is fine and really misses you harry groaned when he folded the letter thank god they haventcome visit me that could have been so humiliating when ginny was there he thought he gave merrill a light scratch behind his head and released him to go back home his stomach grumbled and he decided to go meet his friends at the great hall he walked up to the slytherin table and sat in the vacant seat draco had saved for him hey you okay draco asked yeah better thanks harry started to load his plate with food did they say anything you know about the game not yet but dumbledore walked in just a few minutes ago snape and mcgonagall right behind him so they must have been in a meeting discussing the matter blaise answered harry nodded in understanding as he took the first bite of his roasted chicken so did you lovebirds do something while no one was around draco asked cheekily playing with the potatoes on his plate and separating them from the carrots he and blaise sniggered she has a boyfriend harry informed him that didntstop you before well i starting to let go she may be pretty but she not my type he said casually suddenly dumbledore rose from his seat and the chattering in the hall died down at once i bet you re all dying to know which house won the game he started to say murmuring could be heard from all four tables and dumbledore had to clear his throat to gain silence and attention again it was decided the gryffindor house will get 150 points for catching the snitch all the students at the gryffindor table jumped and screamed from happiness at those words and the slytherins all objected and rose with anger including harry draco and blaise i didntfinish dumbledore cut them off and they all froze but since the slytherins caught the snitch as well we had to consider the circumstances and so they should also have 150 points harry face lit up and he felt excited therefore slytherin house is in the lead with 40 points more then gryffindor slytherin house is the winner of today game harry couldntbelieve his ears he waited all day to hear those words and now when all his housemates jumped screamed and hugged each other joyfully he just gaped at empty air while everyone clapped him on the back they gryffindors looked disappointed and they all sulked along with the ravenclaws and the hufflepuffs harry saw ron comforting his team members he drank a toast of pumpkin juice with all the other slytherins when they walked out of the great hall they met ron and the rest of the gryffindor quidditch team at the exit you are all invited to the great celebration of our victory in our common room draco said to them in a high voice oh sorry purebloods only and weasels are out he added and harry couldnthelp but laugh at sight of their grumpy faces not even slightly caring that ginny was one of them a n there is something i forgot to say i put some clues in the previous chapter which will be more prominent later on i ll put more clues in next chapters can you guess what the clues were also i thought it will be more interesting to give the chapter names so i did what do you think and did you see the poster i made no go check it right now before you review and then post your review because i ve been through hell with this chapter and you better review it or else p disclaimer i dontown harry potter a n final exams are tiring i couldntwrite because i needed to study all the time and i haventeven finished all of my exams meanwhile i got a short break and found some time to write sh4d0ow they always cared for him he their son they have had bad times and they have had good times just because he kind of rebellious and they dontlike it doesntmean they dontlove him hoped i cleared this one for you and you re not dumb nimbirosa dontworry hon this story will have a good ending paige2310 that was just draco joke which was meant to tease them for their loss in the game he didntreally want them there and they didntwant to be there either and about harry feeling for ginny you will read now anon thank you for commenting and you re right harry isntacting much like a slytherin why i cantanswer that question right now thought it will be answered in the end thank you for your reviews keep reviewing because the reviews inspire me and i think it makes me write a better story than i could without reviews chapter 9 half truths he didntmean to hurt her like that but he knew he did the look in her eyes told him how hurt she was when he laughed at her what was he thinking how could he let her go when his feelings for her just seemed to get stronger every day but now it was too late he guessed she hated him now more than ever before and he didntknow how to fix it he was angry with himself for getting so caught up in his pride that he listened more to his head than to his heart they called the party off for the night and now he was sitting alone at a table in the corner of the slightly dimmed common room he laid his head in his one good hand trying to think of a solution to his problem he needed ginny to forgive him he was getting along with her and made a little progress in talking with her and sharing a few laughs but now he blew it all up harry groaned in frustration and looked down at the empty sheet of parchment before him lying untouched on the table an hour had passed and he still didntknow what to write every time he started to write something he stopped and cleared the paper with his wand thinking the words werentmeaningful enough harry glanced at his watch now worn on his right wrist since his left arm was wrapped in a cast the time was one fifty in the morning he was tired but knew that now was the best time for him to write an apology to ginny since his friends were all asleep he let out a loud yawn and felt his eyes fall to narrow slits but he forced them open when he felt them close against his will he dipped his quill in the ink bottle not thinking clearly and his tiredness taking over his mind and body his fingers lost the grip on the quill and it dropped back into the ink bottle he hadnteven noticed he folded his right hand on the table and gently laid his head to rest on it soon he fell into a deep sleep he awoke with a smile on his face and with an ache in his neck the pain was sufferable and he could ignore it because he just had the most beautiful dream about ginny they were walking together down the main street of hogsmeade hand in hand they looked like the happiest couple in the world only he acknowledged the fact that they werenta couple not even one step close to be a couple and then he remembered today was halloween and the teachers allowed the students to visit hogsmeade on the short holiday just before the great feast at the evening have a good sleep he recognized draco voice coming from the door leading to the boys dormitories you look like someone taped your cheeks to your ears harry squinted at him with a frown and let the smile on his face disappear he raised his head and started to search the table for his glasses but then draco said on your head you dolt harry awkwardly reached for his glasses and put them on properly did you sleep here all night harry nodded and rubbed his sore neck i think i stretched my neck he said in a sleepy voice he leaned back in his armchair and felt a sudden pain in his back as well oww and my back he added with a wince harry took a look at draco and saw he was already dressed going to breakfast draco nodded yeah blaise is still in the shower i ll see you two later he said and walked out of the common room harry checked that he was totally alone in the room and when he saw there was nobody in sight he remembered the letter he forgot to write he lost all the ideas he wanted to say in the letter and settled for a simple yet poor apology ginny i sorry harry he knew it wasntmuch but he couldntthink of anything else to write while he was still drowsy from sleep he walked into his room and luckily he found hedwig in her cage drinking water hey girl can you deliver this to ginny weasley at the gryffindor table hedwig hooted once in agreement took the note from harry in her beak and flew out of the window when blaise walked out of the shower harry convinced him to wait for him until he was ready so they could go together to the great hall he didntfancy going there and seeing that he and draco had already eaten it was about ten minutes later when they walked into the great hall and over to the slytherin table they saw draco reading a letter and at the sight of them he hid it in his robe what was that harry and blaise asked in unison they sat across from draco and looked suspiciously at him nothing draco answered rather quickly mother wanted to make sure i was coming home for christmas that all but christmas is like in two months away blaise said yeah well mother is very busy these days she gets like this around halloween every year oh okay say are you coming to hogsmeade later harry asked them i dontfeel like it draco said he folded his arms together and looked disturbed harry didntwant to get into talking about what disturbed him he knew it was about his father perhaps it was something his mother wrote in the letter and he didntwant to discuss it with them er how about you blaise all right i ll come he answered in a much better mood than draco while draco turned to read his copy of the sunday prophet and blaise stared at pansy and daydreamed harry turned to look at the gryffindor table ginny just got his note and she was stroking hedwig affectionately while she read it i need to complete a few essays so i ll be in the common room draco said still a bit gloomy blaise agreed to accompany him and told harry to meet him at the entrance hall that afternoon before he left with draco when harry walked out of the great hall he spotted ginny walk out on the grounds with hermione granger without even thinking he called her name she did not turn around although she recognized his voice he ran up to meet her but she grabbed hold on hermione forearm and dragged her away come on ginny wait a second she stopped but her back was facing him he finally reached her breathless he breathed heavily trying to get his normal breath back i want to talk to you he said his lungs still fighting for fresh air alone she turned around slowly her eyes were closed and her lips were pressed together she opened them briefly as a heavy sigh left her mouth whatever you have to say you can say in front of hermione her eyes now fully open were unusually dark and she frowned at him hermione looked uncomfortable at the situation and blushed harry wanted to object but thought it could be his only shot so he went for it all right did you get my note yes and and what please stop playing innocent do you forgive me or not he said controlling his temper and did his best not to snap at her not she replied why i ve asked for your forgiveness she cut him off before he could say anything else oh you mean your stinky sorry i dontreally give a damn about it there nothing for me to forgive because i not talking to you we are not friends or any kind of colleagues so please for the last time leave me alone i dontwant you to follow me around anymore please let it go she started to walk back to the castle hermione looked at him for a second her look unreadable before she ran to meet with her i ll tell dean he shouted at her she stopped her tracks and turned to look at him again tell dean what she asked still sounding quite angry with him she was walking back to him leaving hermione behind about our kiss he whispered looking up to see if hermione was listening even that he knew she already knew all about it you mean your kiss ginny corrected no you kissed me back and that what made it our kiss and i think your boyfriend should know what you are doing behind his back she waved her hand dismissively fine tell him do whatever you want i dontcare anymore but there just one last thing you need to know you re a coward and with that she walked back to hermione not looking back at him and they headed back to the castle harry reviewed all the things she just said to him when she said she wasntforgiving him and that they werentfriends he felt like someone slapped him across his face she wanted him to let go of the whole thing she actually begged him for that he didntlook at the situation from her point of view he acted like blaise acted around pansy well maybe less pathetic but he was still a bit obsessed with her he admired everything about her her fiery red hair the little freckles on her nose and cheeks her pink lips her brown eyes he admired her talent in quidditch he even admired the way she yelled at him he was obsessed now who pathetic he thought all he wanted was to know if she forgave him and all he did was hurt her more what was about this girl who crept into his mind and insisted not to leave it no girl ever made him feel this way so why her why now and most importantly how could he make her forgive him after what he did to her he knew that he would do anything to make her feel better harry thought of these things while he walked around the corridors passing the time until he would have to meet blaise he didntnotice where he was going his legs led the way harry someone suddenly called footsteps came from behind him and harry turned around and saw draco walking over to him what are you doing here dontyou have to meet blaise he asked um i was just walking to pass the time i guess i should a shhh cut him off in the middle of the sentence harry and draco shot their heads up in searching for the source of the sound what was that harry asked sensing something fishy i think it came from there draco said pointing to a door at the end of the corridor this is the seventh floor right harry who wasntso sure where his legs really took him just nodded i didntknow there are classrooms here there arentany that door wasnthere when i first saw you harry looked at him like he gone mad dontlook at me like that it was a blank wall just a minute ago and now there a door over there all right let say i believe you what do you reckon we should do harry asked eyeing the door suspiciously let open it draco said when he turned to look at harry with a wide smirk on his face harry smirked back loving the idea they walked together to the door with light steps when they reached it they leaned against the wall and heard murmuring coming from the other side draco looked at harry for confirmation for doing the next move harry nodded his agreement and draco griped the handle of the door and swung it wide open the sight of the two slytherins at the door gave the four occupants of the room a start harry and draco never thought they would meet the two weasleys and their significant others when they opened the door the four of them sat on a large carpet in the middle of the room which was lighted only by candles as they saw them they all rose from the floor ron who looked very much shocked at draco and harry appearance at the door dropped something furry which disappeared from view before harry even had the chance to see what it actually was hermione unlike ron didntwaste time in gaping at them and started to collect all their stuff from the floor there was a cauldron a few potions vials couple of books and an old parchment while she tried to shove everything into her school bag she muttered something that sounded like why didntwe see them coming i wouldntmove if i were you granger draco said walking into the room slowly harry walked behind him taking a look around of the room he saw ginny and dean standing now at the corner looking back at him we have to stop meeting like this he said to them with a wink they just pouted at him dean had a look of disgust on his face what are you doing here practicing potions draco continued talking to hermione no founding a cult she said standing back up ron suddenly seemed to pull himself out of his state of shock this is a private prefect meeting so if you dontmind we will very appreciate it if you two leave now hermione and dean bowed their heads and ginny smacked her forehead shook her head and sighed oh ron ron however didntrealize his mistake yet and looked puzzled a private prefect meeting eh did you hear that harry well i guess you forgot to invite me than draco looked around and stared at dean and what this i didntknow mr thomas was filling my place that so thoughtful of you he said in a mocking voice but at the same time looked dangerously at them i well ron tried to say the realization finally sinking in on him but he couldntmanage to say anything else i should really inform professor dumbledore about his gryffindor prefects i dontknow why he chose you weasel you canteven put one plus one together hey that not true ron called draco ignored him anyway i confiscating everything in this room hermione opened her mouth to protest but draco held his hand up and went on unless you want me to report the headmaster about your illegal activities i bet he will take your prefect badge away fine she huffed and picked up her school bag let go guys ron dean and ginny started to walk to the door just as hermione reached it but then draco called and they all stopped oh granger i believe you have things in your bag if you dontmind leave them here dumbledore wontbe so pleased with you if you don t flicking his prefect badge with his fingers at her draco looked very satisfied when hermione walked over to him and handed him the old piece of parchment she put in her bag she turned on her heel and left the room harry was now leaning against the open door when ron and dean left after hermione ginny was the last in the line he looked at her and when she walked by past him he held her by her hand to stop her i wanted you to know that i really am sorry for what i ve done he whispered to her she looked down at his hand where he held her and he took it back how touchy draco muttered at them at the sound of his voice ginny remembered he was there too and she left without looking back what do you want to do with this stuff harry asked like he wasntembarrassed at all from draco last comment i dontknow i ll ask snape what to do with it he ll probably make weasel and granger clean it up anyway draco walked over to the cauldron in the middle of the room inside there was a thick dark brown potion still bubbling like the cauldron was on the fire eww what do you think they were trying to make it smells awful harry glanced at his watch it was four fifty and he was late to meet blaise i better go or else blaise will get all whiny at me he turned to talk in a tone that sounded a lot like blaise voice where have you been harry i waiting for you forever and i missed pansy do you know how much i wanted to walk after her all the way to hogsmeade draco chuckled at the imitation and walked with harry out of the room down to the great hall say draco when you met me before you asked what i was doing here but the real question is what were you doing here harry asked a bit amused er never mind it not important draco excused and quickly changed the subject so you re off to meet blaise right now hua yeah are you sure you dontwant to come with us just for two hours it ll be fun harry tried to convince draco again no thanks i ll stay here he said when he looked closely at the parchment he was still holding what is that anyway looks like sort of a map to me let me see harry took the parchment from him and before he could observe it professor lupin ran into them oh harry i glad i ran into you he said literally draco muttered i ll see you later at the feast harry harry nodded and looked back at his teacher who he was now totally alone with what did you want professor it not going to take long is it because blaise is waiting for me at the entrance hall for the past fifty five minutes or so no it ll be short i promise i wanted to ask you if it okay if i join you and your parents for christmas eve was everyone getting ready for christmas already harry thought it not around a full moon this year he asked lupin shook his head but held a smile on his face not this year finally i haventcelebrated christmas properly for so many years did you already discuss it with my parents yes i did i was actually worried about your reaction since you were just a young child when i last celebrated christmas with your family well i dontthink it a good idea he said lupin smile faded slowly but then harry smiled at him just kidding it fine by me lupin sighed with relief and smiled back well i ve got to go harry said gesturing with his hand to the staircase heading down to the entrance hall he hadntnoticed he waved the map right in front of lupin face lupin suddenly turned to him with curiosity as he saw the map harry what is that he pointed to the map his eyes were wide like they were surprised at something and there was hope in them all the same oh draco just confiscated it from a group of gryffindors just a prefect duty you know he said it looks like a map but i haventhad the chance to look at it myself a map he said can i have a look at it harry shrugged and handed the map to the professor if it was possible his eyes grew ever wider than before as he looked down at the parchment oh dear lupin whispered to himself i haventseen this for so long what is it harry asked trying to take a pick at the parchment i i ll explain later i taking it okay er okay harry looked at him suspiciously thinking everyone around him have gone mad today all right lupin said nervously well off you go to meet your friend harry and lupin separated he headed down to meet blaise and found him pacing from side to side near the great oak doors harry where have you been i waiting for you forever and i missed pansy do you know how much i wanted to hold on harry said holding his right hand to stop his friend from saying another word and then he started to rub his temple i getting a d j vu hua blaise looked confused harry shook his head and chuckled never mind ready to go when are we going to use all of this blaise asked harry when they left zonko with a large bag containing at least 15 dungbombs and fireworks you ll see harry said mischievously and what if filch catches us with this bag you re such a coward and besides filch never suspects slytherins with pranks like that all right what do we do now let go grab a cup of butterbeer and then head back to the castle as they walked to the three broomsticks they neared honeydukes the door to the sweetshop opened and two girls exited blaise froze in his place when pansy and millicent stood now right in front of them oh look who it is pansy said in an angry tone looking at harry hello potter pansy harry said indifferently er remember when i told you about my friend blaise he clapped blaise shoulder hard almost causing him to fall forward oh yes the shy one she said examining blaise from head to toe he blushed at her look blaise why dontyou tell pansy what you told me about her the other day harry looked at his friend with a hint in his eyes however it took blaise a minute to catch that what did i tell y oh you mean that thing that right blaise you keep this bag safe okay and i ll be at the three broomsticks he left them alone and looked back he saw blaise actually talking to pansy he was being shy around her but harry knew that as he will spend more time with her he was sure to get more confident mission accomplished harry thought now i just hope blaise wontmess it up but everybody is at the three broomsticks that exactly why i want to go there harry heard two people arguing near by he looked up to see it was none other than dean and ginny who were standing in front of the pub blocking the way in ginny looked crossed at dean and they seemed to have just had a fight since they were standing in front of the entrance to the pub harry couldntget in it was too awkward to go there and ask them to move so he could enter so he just waited for them to move on their own but in madam puddifoot we can talk in private if we enter the three broomsticks your brother and his girlfriend will make us sit with them and then it wouldntbe a date dean said loudly so you re not coming inside ginny already seemed to make up her mind she wanted to go into the pub other than the coffee shop no then i going by myself oh no you don t dean said he grabbed her arm and started to pull her away from the pub that was harry shot to get inside but he couldntmove at the sight of ginny being dragged like this what are you doing dean thomas are you seriously going to drag me into this stupid caf let go of my arm now he couldntstand it anymore the anger just burst out and suddenly he found himself pacing toward them hey he called he didntknow what ginny was doing in hogsmeade didntshe say she wanted to study maybe dean made her go like he was making her go with him right now dean stopped dragging ginny but didntlet go of her arm he and ginny turned around to see who called to them and saw it was harry ginny looked flushed but dean moaned his exasperation great what do you want you heard what she said she can walk you know and surely she can make up her own mind and make her own decisions now let her go harry said feeling a bit of fury himself did she still think he was a coward sticking up for her like that why dontyou go play the hero someplace else hua potter stop sticking your large nose in other people business ginny told me you arentleaving her alone so why dontyou just back off now before you get seriously hurt dean come on let just go somewhere and forget the whole thing ginny said seeing the anger in their eyes she rubbed dean shoulder in a calming way afraid he d start something with harry no wait a second ginny i had enough of this guy he needs to learn when to stay away harry laughed hollowly what are you going to do hex me you bet i am dean said pulling out his wand let him hex me harry thought he didntpull out his own wand but just stood there watching them see who your boyfriend is ginny you dontdeserve him look how he treats you donttalk to her dean growled make me harry shot back dean couldntstand it any longer he reached out his hands and pushed harry backwards dontyou touch me you stinking mudb he stopped thinking hard on his promise to sirius dontsay that word do not finish this sentence he inwardly told himself what the matter potter cat got your tongue dean taunted spill it out let me help you m u d dean ginny yelled oh never mind dean muttered he forgot he held his wand and he started to push harry harder in the chest harry didntlike the idea of being pushed that hard and started to push dean back at the same force he used on him they soon started to use their fists hitting each other in every possible place stop it ginny shrieked stop it right now dean people some were hogwarts students and some were town villagers were all around and watched them fight but neither of them try to separate them harry and dean broke after a minute dean pointed his wand at harry and looked absolutely livid dean no dontyou dare ginny warned she was a bit frightened he would do something completely stupid she knew it was all because of her but dean hadntlistened and he shot a stunner at harry before harry could even draw his wand to defend himself harry hit the ground and lay there motionless observed by the crowd that gathered all around them they all the gasped with shock and took a step back from dean he pocketed his wand and walked back to ginny like nothing had happened ignoring all the people who watched him what did you do ginny asked furiously nothing he deserved it now let go back to the castle he whispered to her wrapping an arm around her shoulders she freed herself from the embrace she didntcare even if the whole town was watching her she had something to say and she needed to get it out no i wontgo with you you started this fight you threatened to hurt him and all he did was try to make sure i was all right he didnteven say the whole word he didntsay it because you were here ginny this guy has seriously problems he infatuated with you cantyou see that dean argued he didnteven pull out his wand and you went and stunned him she looked around and saw she was still the centre of interest of the crowd around them and she was sick of it why are you still watching dontyou have anything better to do soon she and dean were alone again harry was still lying unconscious on the ground you defend him after what he done to you you defend him this slytherin git why ginny didntanswer she bowed her head and thought what to say it time that dean will know the truth because i think he better than you he a better person a better looking guy and a better kisser what do you mean a better kisser you kissed him dean shouted yes and in spite of everything i told myself i dontregret it either now hear me out on the thing i going to say right now because i not going to repeat it for you i not interested in you anymore we re over dean looked shocked but ginny bye dean she said and he walked off angrily ginny bent down to harry and put his head in her lap she pulled out her wand and pointed it to him ennervate harry eyes slowly opened he blinked a few times and tried to remember where he was he slowly looked around and the hints of red hair from above him came into view he looked up and saw ginny face smiling softly at him he shot up as he remembered what just happened he looked around and searched for dean but he wasntin sight it okay he gone ginny said getting up and sweeping dust off her robes er i wanted to say i she started to say but someone cut her off harry blaise shouted from behind harry turned around and saw blaise running towards him harry he breathed when he stopped in front of him trying to catch his breath i just heard what happened i was with pansy and i heard you got stunned so i ran as fast as i could he gulped when he finished talking harry took a quick look at ginny he wondered what happened while he was out where did dean go and why did he wake up in ginny lap let go blaise he said quietly are you sure you want blaise started to say but harry cut him off yes i sure let go he said more firmly they started to walk away to the castle but ginny called out wait harry didntturn around he chased after this girl for ages let her chase him now if she really wanted even though he couldnthelp but think that all the pursuing wasntworth it a n here you go the longest chapter i ever written and it because you had to wait a lot i hope it was worth the wait so things might not brighten for harry in this chapter but definitely brightened for ginny no more dean thank god too bad harry doesntknow that yet will he in the next chapter you just have to wait and see do not forget to review thank you for your reading and hope you enjoyed
