 disclaimer nope still dontown harry potter chapter 9 back to hogwarts strangely the potters got to king station by quarter to eleven on september 1st several things seemed to go wrong that morning first the ministry car picking them up had two flat tires within minutes of each other then the driver got off the wrong turnoff to london in london the traffic lights kept turning red on them then there was parked car blocking the entrance to the station the bobbies couldntmove the potters then stepped out of the car and unloaded it in the middle of the road hurry james lily said moving rapidly as she pulled rose along we re late the express will be leaving in another 15 minutes we ll just make it james look there are the weasleys about to go through the barrier he called out arthur molly wait sure enough a mass of redheads stood at the wall between platforms 9 and 10 they all turned at the shout of mr potter harry noticed that percy was wearing a badge with a big letter p on it over his muggle clothing the big prat he couldntwait to get to hogwarts to show off his being made a prefect james lily mrs weasley said i would thought you d be on the other side already hello harry hi rose we had a few problems today molly lily said all sorts of strange mishaps delayed us otherwise we d have been here ages ago hey mate ron called to harry i never thought you d get here after us i know with mum nagging us we would have been here at least an hour ago harry said but like she said all sort of weird stuff kept happening to us the ministry driver couldntfind us then it couldntget off the freeway at the right exit then all the traffic lights turned red on us stuff that wouldntbe weird by themselves but all together before ron could reply their parents came over and started hustling the children and their trolleys through the barrier careful to avoid the notice of the muggles first went the twins then percy and arthur followed by molly and ginny then lily with rose james came over to ron and harry all right boys he asked i ll go through then you two follow me james went through the barrier after a look around harry and ron then set themselves behind the trolleys bearing their trunks and took off running for the wall crash their trolleys hit the wall and bounced off scattering their trunks on the ground including hegwig cage whereupon the poor owl started squawking and causing a scene harry and ron groggily picked themselves up from where they had landed on the ground one of the station men shouted to them hey you what do you think you re doing sorry lost control of the trolleys harry called to him he then turned to ron what wrong we cantseem to get through he put his hand on the barrier and found it solid we re going to miss the express ron said looking up at the station clock which was at 10 59 the second hand already at the number 10 counting down the seconds to 11 um ron what do we do harry asked we re attracting a lot of attention sure enough many people were looking at them in curiosity maybe we should go outside and wait for our parents the ministry car we used may still be here we can wait near it the car ron suddenly said that brilliant harry we can use our car to get to hogwarts your car ron harry said that car your dad showed us last month the one he said was enchanted to fly and had an invisibility charm on it that car well yeah ron said we used it to get here though mum doesntknow it can fly look the barrier is down the express would have left by now we need to get to school we dontknow how long it will take for our parents to get back or even if they can get back come on harry this is an emergency we re allowed to use magic in an emergency i dontknow ron harry said can you fly that thing is its invisibility charm strong enough we ll get into trouble if we re seen secrecy act and all though i d love to try it out compare it to riding a broomstick hey it cantbe that hard with magic guiding it can it ron said oh all right harry said let go where did your dad park it the two boys pushed their trolleys out and into the parking lot stopping in front of a blue ford anglia parked in a secluded corner of the lot they placed their trunks in the car boot they were about to enter the car when they heard a couple of pops behind them they turned around to find their fathers standing there thank goodness we caught you just in time mr weasley said i wasntsure if you d try to use this thing it a good thing you parked the car in a place where few muggles would have seen us arthur james said otherwise we couldnthave apparated here in time to catch these two from doing some mischief he eyed both boys all right boys he said in a deeper than usual tone harry gulped his father was using his official auror voice um we can explain dad he told the two men about the barrier going solid on them come on dad please believe us we wouldntmake up something like that just to try out this thing james looked at his son for a moment then said all right i believe you i tried to go back when you two didntfollow me immediately i couldntget through and had to apparate harry and ron breathed a sigh of relief if james potter believed them then arthur weasley would too they turned to look at the older man arthur weasley smiled at them dontworry boys no harm done he turned to james well james how do we get these two to school now the express was leaving just as we apparated james leaned back on the car for a moment his hand cupping his chin we could ask professor dumbledore that arthur the wards around hogwarts prevent apparating directly into the castle or the grounds maybe a portkey or the floo will do you wait here with the boys i ll apparate back to potter manor and contact him with a twirl and a soft pop james disappeared all right boys just wait here arthur said i have to go tell your mothers after doing a twirl he too disapparated harry and ron leaned back on the car waiting soon enough molly and lily came running to them arthur walking behind molly pulled ron into a tight hug thank goodness you two are safe when you both didnt follow us through we got worried especially when we couldntgo back through the barrier she pulled back from ron eyeing him suspiciously you didntplan on using the car did you behind her arthur shook his head and mouthed didnttell her anything oh no mum ron said we just decided to wait for you next to the car yes mrs weasley harry said we just wanted to wait for one of you to come find us oh really lily said smirking her arms crossed over her chest as she leaned on the car then why are your trunks already in the car boot it would have been better to wait for us at the barrier harry eyes widened he d never get used to how intuitive their mothers were he and ron looked at each other nervously the boys were saved from further interrogation by a pop that announced the return of his father all right boys james said the headmaster said that you can floo into hogwarts from potter manor we ll just head back there with the cars he also sent an owl to the train telling them you d get to hogwarts by another way the boys nodded their heads then harry turned to his dad um dad can i ride back home with the weasleys james raised an eyebrow well i guess it ll be fine if arthur and molly are okay with it he turned to his wife lily do you have any objections lily shook her head though she was eyeing her son suspiciously harry turned to mrs weasley with a pleading look oh all right she said as long as your father and mother agree tell you what lily said i ll ride with you back to the manor that way james can send back the ministry cars and get to work after all you cant keep the head auror out all day she grinned at her husband yes dear james said grinning back that fine with me he turned to the elder weasleys shaking arthur hand and kissing molly on the cheek well i ll see you two around he turned to harry who was scowling slightly he bent down to tousle his son already messy hair and whispered nice try son you ll have to wait until summer to try out that car he straightened clapped ron on the shoulder and disapparated all right boys come on lily said smiling at them you can sit in the back with me molly and arthur can sit up front the two boys grumpily got into the ford anglia for the trip back to potter manor an hour later harry stumbled out of the headmaster fireplace at hogwarts and ron followed falling over on top of the prone harry get off me ron he said the two boys got themselves sorted and found that they werentalone good afternoon boys dumbledore said his eyes twinkling this is the first time since i became headmaster that we ve had students who couldnt catch the train it not our fault professor harry said we dontknow why we couldnt get through the barrier yes yes harry dumbledore said dontworry your father had already explained it to me i imagine he ll investigate the matter he looked at both boys his eyes twinkling again it a good thing that your fathers found you quickly who knows what would have happened if he didn t harry and ron gulped did the elderly headmaster know what they were planning to do dumbledore chuckled not to worry boys it all right now why dontyou go to the kitchens for lunch i sure harry father has told him how to get into them through a fruit portrait he chuckled again at the surprised look on harry face then you can settle your things into your dormitory room hagrid will walk you over to the station to meet the train so you can come together with your classmates for the feast i daresay a couple of redheaded first years would appreciate your support tonight harry remembered then his sister and ginny were starting at hogwarts come on ron let get to lunch we have to meet the girls the two boys grabbed their trunks and dragged them to gryffindor tower harry taught ron how to enter the kitchens by tickling the pear on the fruit portrait the house elves gladly gave them a lunch that rivaled their usual meals then they unpacked their things from their trunks near sunset hagrid met them at the entrance hall all right arry ron they walked with the huge man to the station and soon they caught sight of the express as soon as the express stopped hagrid went forward to collect the first years harry and ron moved among the alighting students looking for their sisters and friends suddenly someone with a lot of red hair rammed into harry pulling him into a tight embrace harry was wondering how emotional his sister could get when the person pulled back he was surprised to see that it was ginny who had embraced him oops ginny said her face almost as scarlet as her hair i thought you were ron she moved to her brother embracing him almost as strongly then rose came up and hugged harry for a second what happened to you two bro we were worried when the train started pulling out without you two on board we had some trouble with the barrier sis harry said it all right now we got to hogwarts okay he then saw and heard hagrid calling the first years you and ginny better get over there with the other first years all right bro she said see you later harry watched the two redheads move off ginny hadntlooked at him again hermione came over to them followed by neville what happened at king cross harry why did you and ron fail to get on the train your sisters were really worried it a good thing we got a note by owl that you were all right and already at hogwarts harry and ron told their two friends about the problem with the barrier that strange hermione said i ve never read about that sort of thing happening to the barrier yes neville said it is strange it like someone didntwant the two of you from getting on the train who could have that kind of power harry asked why didnthe want us on the train that a real mystery harry hermione said as soon as we have time i ll start looking for spells that could do that she glanced around but right now we better join the others for the ride to the castle ride to the castle ron asked donttell me we re taking those boats again hermione frowned if you ve read hogwarts a history before ronald you d know that that only for the first years we re going by carriage come on let follow the others the four friends joined the older students walking out of the station they soon spotted the carriages and wondered how they moved they got into the last one and set off for the castle later as they sat at the gryffindor table in the great hall they watched the first years enter through the huge doors and stare in awe at the ceiling they listened to the sorting hat song which was similar to the one they had heard the year before they watched the sorting start soon they heard potter rose lily and watched rose nervously approach the stool with the sorting hat she sat down and the hat was placed on her head by professor mcgonagall two minutes passed and harry started to get apprehensive then the hat said gryffindor harry breathed a sigh of relief and stood up as his sister ran up to their table he hugged her and said glad you could join us sis so am i she said smirking then she whispered to him you know that thing wanted to place me in slytherin i told it no way i want to be with my brother harry chuckled you know what it tried the same thing with me last year well this proves we re siblings rose laughed and slapped him on the arm she sat down between him and hermione then she saw neville and her face became a little pink turning away she watched the rest of the sorting when ginny was called up to the sorting hat it took it only ten seconds before saying gryffindor she ran over to their table and sat down between rose and hermione the rest of the feast proceeded well soon the students dispersed to head for their dormitories percy stood up at the gryffindor table and led the first years off harry and his three friends followed at a leisurely pace they stopped by the owlery to send an owl to harry and ron parents with news of their safe arrival and their sisters sorting into gryffindor later that night as he lay in his bed harry wondered about the strange incident with the barrier neville words came back to him why would anyone want to keep him and ron from getting on the express was it to keep them from going back to hogwarts then he remembered all the mishaps they had that morning it seemed that those incidents were delays to keep them from getting to the station on time so was he the real target and ron got involved because they tried getting through the barrier together why did it have anything to do with voldemort after the events of the last year harry was aware that voldemort was around waiting to come back was something going to happen in hogwarts that someone didnt want him around harry decided he needed to keep his eyes open a n sorry this chapter took long to get up i was very busy for the past few weeks that another reason its shorter than the others dont worry the next chapters will be better disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter 11 another new marauder and a schoolwide prank it wasntuntil a week later that harry managed to get neville alone after a herbology class neville lingered to ask professor sprout about something and harry simply waited for him to come out of greenhouse 3 hey neville harry said got a minute there something i need to ask you sure harry the pudgy boy said what is it well harry said lowering his voice you remember the strange things that happened to the slytherins and snape last term neville grinned oh yeah really hilarious especially when they were pink what about it well those were pranks and i happen to know who was responsible for it harry said neville grin widened oh is that so now that you ve confirmed that they were pranks i have an idea who was responsible for them harry also grinned i believe you do i knew you d figure it out especially with your parents both being aurors let me guess harry neville said it you ron and his twin brothers good guess nev harry said of course you re short one person from that group neville raised one eyebrow who harry grinned again who is one of the if not the smartest witch in our year both of neville eyebrows rose to his hairline hermione wow i never would have guessed that she d be a prankster i thought she was a stickler for the rules harry said ordinarily yes but she understands the need for a bit of fun harmless fun every now and then so why are you telling me this harry neville asked well i with the agreement of the rest wanted to know if you d like to join our little group and get in the fun wow neville grinned again i sure would harry great mate harry said grinning again oh by the way we have two other new members who are they neville asked though the look on his face seemed to hint that he had an idea who they were two first years with whom you are acquainted with already harry answered rose and ginny i knew it neville said from what i saw of those two this past summer they d want in on something like this so what do you guys call yourself i mean you must have a name of some sort we call ourselves the new marauders after all we re just continuing the tradition of my dad and his friends who were the original marauders when they were here good name neville said so when do we start well i was thinking of doing something for during the halloween feast something affecting the whole school even us i asked rose and ginny for ideas we ll probably meet for it in a couple of weeks all right harry just let me know the two boys started walking back to the castle for lunch turning their conversation to other things the weeks passed with the routine of classes homework and meals it got a bit more hectic for harry as oliver wood seemed even more determined to win the quidditch cup the last game the previous year between gryffindor and ravenclaw had taken place while harry was unconscious in the hospital wing thus the gryffindor team had lost badly unfortunately they discovered that the slytherin team had acquired new broomsticks the nimbus two thousand and ones which was better than even harry nimbus thousand that he got from his parents the previous year this pushed wood to schedule numerous practice sessions in spite of his obsessed quidditch captain harry managed to get the new marauders to meet in the first sunday of october in an empty classroom on the third floor near the room where fluffy used to be kept rose showed the marauder map to the rest of the group who were impressed with it even hermione though she was suspicious of the type of magic needed to create it the twins commented that if they had had it they would not have been caught as much by filch for their pranking in their first two years the new marauders spent almost two hours throwing ideas back and forth for their halloween prank finally deciding on what to do harry divided the responsibility for the different aspects of the prank they met one more sunday evening to finalize what would happen halloween night saw the great hall decorated with the live bats and hagrid huge pumpkins carved into lanterns golden plates were on the table and the hall was lighted by hundreds of golden candles the students entered the hall in high spirits and gaiety after they had settled into their seats at their house tables professor dumbledore gave a short speech then said tuck in the students immediately began eating the wonderful spread on the table there were all sorts of dishes including harry favorites like steak and kidney pie ron as usual was stuffing his face harry noted that ginny was eating almost as much as her brother though with more finesse near the end of the feast candies of all sorts appeared on the table in the golden trays as the students ate the different candies they started to change the ravenclaws turned blue with beaks for noses and yellow feathers instead of hair their voices became bird squawks and chirps some even had their feet turn into bird feet the hufflepuffs turned yellow grew whiskers and black and white fur on their faces and their noses became black buttons their voices became squeeky and high pitched the slytherins skin turned into green scales and their hair turned into writhing snakes like medusas when they opened their mouths forked tongues would flick out the gryffindors turned golden with reddish manes growing on their heads they also had long lion tails when they tried to talk all that came out were lion roars pandemonium broke out in the great hall as students realized what was happening the eight gryffindors who formed the new marauders were laughing their laughter disguised by lion roars harry looked at the head table to see the reactions of the teachers dumbledore was smiling with a twinkle in his eyes mcgonagall lips were pressed tightly together but every now there was a slight upturn of her mouth snape looked furious and was glaring around hagrid flitwick and sprout were laughing hard filch was glaring furiously around and seemed to be muttering to himself after about ten minutes the students all turned to normal and started to settle down a large banner suddenly unfurled above the doors which read tonight entertainment was brought to you by the new marauders trick or treat happy halloween most of the students were now on their feet laughing and clapping the exceptions of course were a few slytherins like draco malfoy who was scowling harry felt an urge to bow but restrained it he exchanged grins with ron neville and the twins ginny and rose were laughing hysterically even hermione looked pleased harry looked back at the head table snape still looked mad and was now glaring at the gryffindor table of course he would know who the marauders were having gone to school with them and been subjected to their pranks dumbledore stood up a smile on his aged face well that was quite entertaining he said eyes twinkling i see we have a new group of pranksters in hogwarts i do hope they refrain from disrupting classes now i sure you are all tired from the feast and the events of the last few minutes so please head back to your dormitories for a good night rest good night the students all got up and headed for the doors talking and laughing harry and his friends managed to bunch together as they walked to gryffindor tower they gradually slowed down and drifted to the rear of the crowd allowing the other students to get ahead of them finally they stopped and sneaked into an empty classroom once inside fred drew his wand and cast a locking and a silencing charm on the door then they all burst out into laughter that was great neville said in between bursts of laughter yeah ron said grinning that was one of the best pranks yet and we owe it all fred said to our three lovely mates george finished hermione ginny and rose were now blushing yeah harry said smiling at the three girls you three were brilliant thinking up this stuff well me and ginny just thought about what we want to happen hermione came up with the spells rose said and brilliant spells they were harry said well hermione said still blushing you guys did a brilliant job of casting them on the sweets and tables fred and george broke into huge grins then started bowing to the girls saying over and over thank you thank you harry ron and neville on the other hand were blushing and smiling shyly at the compliment thanks hermione neville said well my fellow marauders fred said it been a fun evening george said but the two of us fred said and our favorite seeker george said have practice bright and early tomorrow they both said turning to harry harry scowled just leave it up to wood to schedule a practice the day after a great feast the marauders reluctantly left the classroom after rose took a look at the marauder map to make sure no professors or filch were around they climbed the last staircase to gryffindor tower upon entering the now empty common room they proceeded to their dormitories after bidding each other a goodnight before he drifted off to sleep harry wondered how his team would manage to beat the slytherin team on their speedy brooms a n thanks to my reviewers this chapter is short since i wanted to concentrate it on the new marauders harrypotterfan93 there are already several fanfics like that my take on this is from the viewpoint that several changes will occur in the story the first two years may not be too different but the succeeding ones will be stay tuned avada88 thanks for the review dontworry about me being sued for plagirism i tried to keep the quoting as minimal as possible glad you liked my idea wytil i hope you liked the prank they did here let just say neville helped cast the spells on the sweets they used he more confident than in the books because he not living with his intimidating grandmother beth5572 and kraziechikadee thanks for the review stay tuned disclaimer i dontown harry potter or the characters except for rose a n thanks for the latests reviews this chapter is a bit short but was fun to write ugly duckling i already have a way to get around the fact that ron wand is intact here just wait for that part of the story cruciatus88 i glad you liked the prank there ll be more to come beth5572 i glad you like it chapter 12 a strange visitor harry woke up suddenly in pitch darkness and felt pain in his arm like a lot of splinters were embedded in it for a moment he wondered where he was then he remembered the events of the day it was the first quidditch match of the season gryffindor versus slytherin with their new brooms slytherin chasers were running rings around the gryffindor team harry desperately sought out the snitch hoping to end the game before their opponents got too much of a lead then he had to dodge a bludger as he sped away from it he looked over his shoulder and was surprised to see it turn around and head back his way at first fred and george tried to run interference with the bludger but harry told them to let him deal with the strangely acting bludger since the distraction of the gryffindor beaters allowed the slytherins to score again and again harry did a lot of fancy maneuvers to avoid the bludger then he spent an extra second floating still in the air as he had spotted the snitch hovering above draco malfoy the new slytherin seeker and the rogue bludger slammed into his right arm breaking it in spite of the intense pain this caused harry still managed to catch the snitch from under malfoy nose though he ended up on the ground unfortunately for harry among the first people to reach him was gilderoy lockhart who apparently had a fantasy to be the school nurse before madame pomfrey could reach harry lockhart had cast a spell which relieved harry of the pain and unfortunately of all the bones in the injured arm madame pomfrey was quite upset with this and had harry brought to the hospital wing where he would have to rest the night while his bones were regrown the potion was vile tasting and its effects were quite painful now that he remembered where he was harry looked around trying to figure out what had awoken him the pain was actually only a twinge now he reached for his glasses on the side table with his uninjured arm as the room sharpened into focus he sat up and looked around again he was surprised to see a pair of large tennis ball sized eyes staring at him from the next bed it was a house elf similar in appearance to blinky or mimi but this one was dressed in an old pillow case from what harry had learned about house elves from his parents and their own house elves this may mean he was an enslaved house elf um hello harry said what your name the house elf eyes bulged out as if surprised harry potter talked to me it said in a squeaky voice the great harry potter said hello and asked me my name it then lowered its head into its hands and burst into tears harry eyes widened in surprise i i sorry i didntmean to upset you the house elf looked up and sniffed oh no sir harry potter didntupset dobby but bestowed a great honor on dobby who is crying with joy oh i see so your name is dobby right yes harry potter sir i is dobby well then dobby why are you here are you one of the hogwarts house elves oh no harry potter sir dobby is not fortunate enough to be bound to work here dobby is bound to a wizard family and must serve them until his death harry felt a twinge of sadness as his suspicions about the house elf status were confirmed he didntwant anyone to be like that he was just glad blinky and his family were free elves and chose to work for his family of their own free will well then dobby harry said in a kind tone why are you here visiting me dobby just wanted to make sure harry potter was all right after that bludger had hit him dobby didntmean for harry potter to get hurt like this dobby thought harry potter wouldntcome back here when he missed the train hang on harry said his eyes wide anger starting to rise within him you set that bludger on me you also stopped ron and me from getting through the barrier why dobby now looked miserable dobby just wanted harry potter to stay home dobby wanted harry potter to be safe if you stay here you will be in mortal danger harry potter what danger dobby harry asked still angry what kind of danger is worse than you almost getting me killed by that bludger dobby moved closer to harry until he was right beside him there is a plot harry potter a plot to cause evil things to happen here in hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year what evil thing dobby harry said who plotting them dobby made a choking sound then grabbed the water jug at the side table and started hitting himself with it harry was appalled for a moment then he grabbed the jug stop it dobby what are you doing i was punishing myself harry potter sir i almost spoke ill of the family i serve oh then someone from that family is involved in this plot you re talking of which family do you serve dobby made another choking sound then he started thumping his head on the side of the table harry grabbed one of dobby shoulders with his uninjured arm and shook him okay okay i understand you canttell me at least give me an idea on what the plot is about dobby looked miserable again and shook his head harry sighed in frustration wait a minute this plot doesnthave anything to do with volde seeing dobby wince he said sorry you know who does it dobby slowly shook his head oh no not he who must not be named his eyes however were very wide as if he was hinting at something harry couldntfigure out what he meant well then harry said who just then a light came on in the hallway dobby snapped a finger and just vanished right after madame pomfrey came into the ward holding a candle and looked over at harry are you awake already mr potter um just a bit harry replied my arm still twinges a little madame pomfrey came up to his bed and gave him a small smile well it wontdo that anymore after another hour or two now go on back to sleep harry placed his glasses on the table and turned over however sleep failed to claim him for a few more hours as he pondered his conversation with dobby he d have to tell the others about it in the morning the next day madame pomfrey let harry go before breakfast with the admonishment not to do anything strenuous with the reknitted arm for a few more days it was after dinner when harry finally found time to talk to his friends about dobby he pulled ron hermione and neville into another empty classroom right from the great hall just before harry could say something the door opened and rose and ginny peaked in what are you four doing here rose asked are you guys planning another prank without us no we are not ron said go on and leave us this is something entirely different ron wait harry said that my sister and yours i think they should hear this too if i in danger then so are you and them too fine fine ron said after harry had told them all that dobby had said he looked from one to the other so what do you guys think hmm hermione said looking thoughtful that strange harry i dontknow much about house elves is that the way they really are well hermione ron said most families who have house elves are very rich and very old ordinarily house elves cantsay anything bad about the family they work for otherwise they have to punish themselves hermione looked horrified that terrible why doesntanyone do anything about it harry looked uncomfortable look hermione you ve met blinky and his family according to him it was much worse before my baby self beat old volde er i mean you know who yes hermione rose said mimi told me that before my big brother zapped the big bad most house elves were beaten and were virtually slaves now many of them like blinky and his family get paid for their work and get holidays but still some of them are still treated like slaves so do you think dobby was on the up and up ron asked maybe harry said something is definitely up i dontknow what kind of danger could there be here at hogwarts i mean professor dumbledore is here i cantimagine what he couldnthandle well bro this has been interesting rose said looking at her watch but i ve got to run where are you going at this late hour sis harry asked um she got detention with snape ginny said a grimace forming on her face harry scowled whatever for ginny looked at rose who looked back at her and shook her head harry moved closer to her sister and asked again what the detention for rose after a few seconds of silence rose sighed and said one of the slytherins margaret tunnelbee tripped while taking her potion sample to snape desk she dropped the vial and it broke she claimed that i tripped her since it happened while she was passing my desk so i guess you didntdo that right harry asked i certainly didn t though i was tempted to hex her since she d been making snide remarks about the potion me and ginny had been brewing rose said anyway snape believed her and took 10 points from gryffindor i tried to protest and said i was innocent but he just took 10 more points and gave me three days detention for it all the people in the room scowled that git so typical of him harry said angrily it wasntso bad when it was me he was being unfair with but now he doing it to my sister i should complain to dumbledore for this rose put her hand on his shoulder it okay bro i can handle this dad warned me he might get a bit hard on me because of their shared past dont worry harry sighed okay sis but we ll get back at him for this he looked to the other marauders i think we should start planning another prank for the slytherins everyone nodded then they all left for the gryffindor common room except for rose who moved in the direction of the dungeons disclaimer see preceding chapters chapter 13 the voice and the chamber the next night after curfew harry and ron sneaked out of gryffindor tower in harry invisible cloak and headed for the dungeons unfortunately ron tripped on the hem of the cloak and caused them to crash into a suit of armor on the second floor harry just managed to throw the cloak off of them and into an alcove when filch came running up the caretaker was practically smiling when he dragged them to mcgonagall quarters their head of house was not pleased to be awoken at that hour when asked why they were sneaking around harry told her that they just wanted a midnight snack mcgonagall looked unconvinced but dismissed them after she told them to see her after dinner the next evening for their detentions filch made it a point to escort them to their common room the two boys were quite glum the next day as they wondered what kind of detention they would receive their fellow marauders tried their best but not even fred or george could cheer them up even ron was not hungry at dinner that night when the rest of the students got up to go back to their dormitories ron and harry said their goodbyes to their friends and slowly walked to mcgonagall office harry knocked on the door and they entered when bade to do so all right mr potter mr weasley the elderly woman said i have considered your detention for last night breaking of curfew i know growing boys need their nourishment but that doesntexcuse sneaking around now mr weasley you will go with mr filch to the trophy room and polish all the awards there by hand no magic ron gulped and looked at filch who was almost smiling his arms filled with rags and one hand holding a bottle of metal polish just then another knock was heard on the door filch opened it and stepped back revealing lockhart at the door ah minerva he said his usual smile on his face i gather that you ve told mr potter what his detention is harry felt a sense of dread creep up his spine no gilderoy mcgonagall said a sigh escaping her lips i was just about to oh lockhart said let me be the one then without waiting for a reply from the older woman he approached harry harry my boy your detention this evening is to help me answer some of my fanmail he drew even closer to harry who had a look of horror on his face lockhart apparently misinterpreted the look as some form of joy yes yes i know it seems a bit inappropriate for a detention but i had to take this opportunity to let you have a glimpse of the price of fame and maybe practice when you get your own fanmail he placed an arm on harry shoulder and started to lead him to the door come come we mustntwaste any more time harry looked back at ron his eyes pleading ron just shrugged his shoulders though a faint smile could be seen forming at the corner of his mouth harry frowned and vowed to tell ron off later it was two hours later as he was writing down addresses of lockhart fans on envelopes that harry heard the voice for the first time it was a voice that chilled one bones filled with ice cold venom it was asking someone to come to it to allow it to kill tear and rip apart whoever it was calling apparently lockhart hadntheard the voice but he quickly dismissed harry when he noticed the time harry gratefully left lockhart office for gryffindor tower later in their dormitory harry interrupted ron rant about polishing trophies and awards multiple times to tell him what he had heard it seemed ron couldntexplain the voice either harry fell asleep wondering where the voice had come from later in the week harry and ron successfully managed to get into snape private quarters undetected they managed to change the color of snape robes to pink unfortunately for the potions master it was invisible to him the slytherins were too nervous to tell him while the other houses simply snickered behind his back it was professor dumbledore who informed him of his robe new color during lunch causing snape to disappear for the rest of the day needless to say he was meaner to the other houses for the rest of the week two weeks passed without incident then one evening in the last week of november harry was sitting down to dinner between ron and hermione after being held back by lockhart for almost a half hour harry saw fred and george seated nearby conversing with another gryffindor fourth year lee jordan however he did not see any other redheads at their table he turned to colin creevey who was seated across from him hey colin he said have you seen rose and ginny they re usually the first down here among you lot the last i saw of them was in potions harry the younger boy said his voice filled with awe as harry seldom talked to him harry frowned and turned to look at the head table snape was also missing from his customary place harry wondered what the potions teacher was doing with his sister and friend sighing he turned to eat knowing he couldntdo a thing about it for now as the minutes ticked by harry started to feel nervous he wondered again what snape was doing to the two girls finally he took a last gulp of pumpkin juice and stood up ron looked at him with an eyebrow raised are you done already harry he asked i cant eat ron harry replied i worried about rose and ginny not showing up yet for dinner you heard colin who knows what snape is up to i ve got to go find them ron sighed oh all right i ll come with you after all it my sister too hermione said wait i ll come too the three friends left the great hall and headed for the dungeons they could not have predicted the events that followed later that night they were in an empty classroom discussing the events of the previous two hours harry had heard the same cold murderous voice he had heard in lockhart office he had gone running after it heedless of his friend calls to wait for them and his sister who they passed in the first floor harry had followed the voice to a second floor corridor which was partly flooded it was hermione who pointed out the foot high words in blood splashed on the wall between two windows proclaiming that the chamber of secrets had been opened and warning enemies of the heir then they noticed mrs norris filch cat hanging suspended in front of the words as they were looking at the cat the rest of the school had come by on their way back to their dormitories the students had stopped in shock and stared at the wall filch had been terribly upset trying to blame harry but dumbledore took matters into his own hands and took harry ron and hermione to lockhart classroom for questioning with snape mcgonagall and filch coming along dumbledore had explained that the cat was merely petrified fortunately for mrs norris the second years had been working on mandrakes in herbology which were cures for petrification if chopped up once mature unfortunately that would take a few more months for the mandrakes to mature filch was not happy after making sure the three gryffindors knew nothing about the cause of the cat petrification or the writing on the wall dumbledore had dismissed them now hermione and ron advised harry not to mention the voices he claimed to have heard which they had not heard do you think this chamber of secrets is what dobby was talking about harry hermione asked harry shrugged maybe it seems terrible enough have you heard about it i think so ron said his face scrunched up as he thought about it i think someone mentioned something about a secret chamber here at hogworts it might have been bill well hermione said maybe i can find something on it in hogwarts a history i had to leave my copy in order to fit all of lockhart books in my trunk but i sure there are several copies in the library ron and harry exchanged amused glances knowing that it was hermione favorite book they knew she had read it cover to cover probably the only person they knew who had um we better get back to the common room ron said it getting late harry slapped his forehead bloody hell i forgot about rose he quickly left the classroom ignoring hermione admonishment about language and almost ran back to gryffindor tower once there he looked around and then breathed a sigh of relief as he saw rose seated near the fireplace talking to fred and george the common room was deserted except for the three redheads he immediately moved in front of her where the hell have you been he asked rose turned around and glared at him oh thanks so much for your concern harry it sure didntlook like it when you tore pass me like snape was after you harry gulped then raised his hands in supplication as he attempted to placate his tempestuous sister er i did er sorry sis umm well umm hermione sighed you did pass by her harry while following that voice you heard what voice rose asked harry sighed okay you three none of this is repeated to anyone else understand when the three redheads nodded harry told them about the voice rose eyed him critically that it my brother losing it hey harry said i not imagining it and i not going crazy then why cantanyone else hear it rose asked harry sighed in frustration i dontknow the thing is hearing that voice led me to that corridor so you think that fred said the two things are related george said it definitely possible harry said i mean it too big a coincidence wait a minute harry rose said do you think this is what that house elf what his name was warning you about you mean dobby hermione asked hmm harry said a thoughtful look appearing on his face i think it a possibility we ll need to find out what the chamber is about we can start in the morning hermione said it getting late they all got up and moved toward the stairs to the dorms then harry who was in the front stopped and turned around hey sis where were you earlier during dinner he said to rose where is ginny anyway i surprised she isntdown here with you yeah ron said she wasntat dinner rose face turned stormy i was in the potions classroom that crone margaret tunnelbee spilled her sample again she wasntanywhere near me so snape couldntblame me directly but he made me help her clean it up ginny came back here saying she had a headache and wasntfeeling hungry i guess she already in bed she turned to ron dontworry i ll let you know if she not okay wait a minute sis harry said did you have any dinner well not really rose said after the awful stink of that potion i wasnttoo hungry unfortunately now i am all right harry said come on i ll just get my cloak and you get the map we can sneak down to the kitchens the others said their good nights as they went up the stairs to their respective dorms harry and rose managed to get the house elves to give them a few sandwiches and a pitcher of pumpkin juice over the next few days hogwarts was filled with tension hermione was frustrated when she found that all the copies of hogwarts a history had been checked out of the library however she got professor binns to tell them about the chamber of secrets this gave them the information that it supposedly had been created by salazar slytherin and housed some sort of monster that only he or his descendent heir could control and could use to purge the school of those slytherin thought unworthy to learn magic muggleborns then colin creevey told then that several other students were thinking harry was the heir of slytherin harry desperately hope that he wasn t he knew his family had been in gryffindor for generations however he had never known his entire family tree he was however touched deeply when he heard that rose had risen in defense of her older brother even landing another detention with snape for drawing her wand on some slytherins in front of the potions classroom harry ron and hermione tried to check the area where the writing was remembering the puddles of water they found a bathroom nearby which could have been the source of the water hermione told the two boys that it was never used since it was haunted by a morose ghost named moaning myrtle they looked around but found nothing unusual however outside they noticed a group of spiders frantically trying to pass through one small hole like they were running from something harry smirked when ron shuddered since he knew his best friend was afraid of spiders harry did notice that ginny seemed to have been severely affected by what had happened to mrs norris she seemed less energetic and more subdued very unlike the vibrant girl he had known for almost all his life he didntknow how to raise her spirits not even planning a prank had enlivened her he asked rose about it but she just said that ginny was stressed out by their classes another odd thing occurred when harry ran into hagrid in the corridors he had a couple of dead roosters in one hand hagrid attributed it to foxes or a bugbear harry tried to concentrate more on his studies and think less of chamber and its secrets however he was worried he was now sure that dobby warning was connected to the chamber his feeling increased when he sat down to breakfast one day in the following week he noticed that colin creevey was not at the gryffindor table trying to talk to him then dumbledore stood up and asked for everyone attention i regret to inform you that one of our students has been attacked the headmaster said gasps of shock reverberated throughout the great hall students looked at each other and many started asking who it was dumbledore called for silence and continued speaking i afraid to inform you that colin creevey was found last night on the second floor petrified like mrs norris he is now in the hospital wing anyone who would like to visit him may do so in their free time the gryffindor table was stunned harry glanced at ginny who he knew sat beside the excitable boy in charms she seemed distraught and on the verge of tears he placed a hand on her shoulder and squeezed it she looked up at him with a grateful smile then went back to picking through her food rose also looked shocked but seemed to be able to control herself better harry repeated his gesture of support and she also smiled at him after that day harry noted that the first years were avoiding going around alone often sticking together in groups a week after colin had been found harry and ron came into the entrance hall to find a crowd of students the notice board going closer they saw a notice proclaiming the forming of a dueling club which would meet in two days in the great hall and a sign up sheet beside it harry wondered who would lead the new club hoping it would be dumbledore two days later he wasntpleased to find that lockhart was the one leading the club it wasntan enjoyable experience for harry it had started well enough with lockhart attempting to demonstrate a wizard duel with snape then snape had suggested pairing harry with draco malfoy that when it got bad malfoy had conjured a snake which lockhart attempted to blast it only succeeding in sending it opposite justin finch fletchly a hufflepuff muggleborn in a panic harry had shouted at the snake telling it to back off unfortunately instead of gratitude from justin harry got a wild look from the other boy who immediately ran from the great hall ron had dragged harry back to the gryffindor common room once there harry turned around he noticed that hermione rose and ginny were there also what wrong harry asked why did justin run away harry why didntyou tell us you re a parselmouth ron asked a parselmouth harry said stunned he knew what a parselmouth was having heard the term from his parents what do you mean i just shouted at the snake i dontknow parseltongue i couldnthave talked to the snake rose placed a hand on harry arm you did talk to it bro in some sort of hissing sounds yeah mate ron said it was really weird in fact it seemed like you were um egging it on like telling it to attack justin harry mouth dropped open no i didn t i was telling it to back off you may have said that to it harry hermione said all we heard was the hissing harry dropped into an armchair he was still stunned about talking in a language he didntknow he could speak this isntgood harry hermione said you do realize that salazar slytherin was a parselmouth too and that being one is rare usually passed down from parent to child yeah ron said now the rest of the school will think you re his great great great grandson or something hey rose said that cantbe true i mean i harry sister yet i couldntunderstand what he was saying to the snake the others looked at her harry then broke into a smile there see he said i cantbe related to slytherin otherwise rose would have the same ability hermione sighed it not that simple harry like other skills being a parselmouth may not be passed directly or shared by siblings it could skip a generation or two well there only one way to clear that up harry said i ll have to ask dad if we have a relation to slytherin but i ll do it over christmas it only a week away a n hope you liked the new chapter cruciatus88 sorry if the second year seems drawn out and long but read on disclaimer see preceding chapters chapter 14 chamber secrets molly and arthur weasley had decided to visit bill in egypt during the christmas holidays the five weasley children at hogwarts didntwant to go ron and ginny didntwant to leave their friends the twins thought christmas was more fun in england and percy wanted to keep his four younger siblings in line so they were invited to spend the christmas holidays at potter manor rooming arrangements were made ron would share harry room and ginny would share rose room to his horror percy found himself sharing a guest room with the twins his two youngest siblings had a good laugh when they found out wondering what the twins would do to their perfect older brother the holidays proved to be the ideal break for ron harry and their sisters away from hogwarts and the reminder of the chamber they had time to enjoy themselves harry noticed that ginny was happier and livelier almost back to her usual mischievous self hermione and neville came over almost everyday to spend time with their friends it was the day before christmas when harry finally managed to get his dad alone by telling him that he had something important to ask they went into the library and sat down on a couch so son what is it you wanted to ask me harry looked nervously at his feet james noticed his son nervousness and placed a gentle hand on his shoulder harry what is it you can ask me anything i your father i ll understand whatever it is you want to know then as harry raised his head james asked with a twinkle in his eye this wouldnthave to do with girls now would it harry eyes bulged er actually no dad james breathed a sigh of relief whew i glad i donthave to give you the talk yet um what the talk dad never you mind now maybe we can have it in a few years but now what is it you wanted to ask me um well dad harry stammered i was wondering if salazar slytherin was an ancestor of ours james hadntexpected this his eyebrows rose to his hairline whoa what kind of question is that of course not there no connection between slytherin and our family harry felt a surge of relief but he had to make sure you re sure dad definitely james said now what brought that on harry looked nervously at his feet again unwilling to answer james placed a finger on his son chin and lifted it so he could look into the boy green eyes come on now son tell me i told you that i ll understand whatever it is you want to tell me harry sighed all right dad he then told him about the writing on the wall what happened to colin and the incident in the dueling club including speaking parseltongue however he didnttell him about the voice he kept hearing at the end of harry tale james sighed harry i already know about the writing on the wall and the attack on your friend dumbledore told me about them right after each incident of course he didnttell me you had spoken parseltongue james paused trying to decide what to tell his son being able to speak parseltongue doesntmean you re descended from salazar slytherin in fact he leaned closer to harry and whispered you are actually descended from godric gryffindor harry eyes bulged really james smiled and continued in a low voice really it not known in general in fact you wontfind it mentioned in any book it a secret passed from father to son only your mother sirius and remus know this though i suspect dumbledore knows too i still deciding whether to tell your sister harry face was filled with the awe he felt about being descended from a founder of hogwarts in fact the founder of his house james chuckled in amusement at the look of incredulity on harry face then he leaned back now i not sure why you can speak parseltongue if i may hazard a guess it may be that when voldemort tried to curse you the backlash caused some of his powers to pass to you it was known that he could speak parseltongue he often claimed to be descended from slytherin harry eyed his father dubiously so i may have gotten this from voldemort james sighed that the most likely explanation i can think of suppose i run this through dumbledore and your mother and see what they think harry looked a little uncomfortable with the idea then he sighed okay dad but only with them james smiled of course son in the meantime tell me how mrs norris looked petrified i daresay that cat caused me and the other marauders grief every now and then in fact sirius once remarked that she would look good stuffed harry laughed and launched into a description of mrs norris stiff as a board christmas eve and day was a joyous occasion in potter manor it began in the morning with everyone staying in the manor gathering around the christmas tree in the living room to open presents they were all pleased with their gifts harry particularly liked the new seeker gloves rose and ginny had gotten him he had gotten each of the girls a large assortment of chocolates from honeydukes courtesy of fred and george knowing that the girls shared an insane love of chocolate in any form they had a great breakfast which ended with percy turning into a yellow canary for about ten minutes before molting and returning to his usual self he left the table in disgust having already been the target of the twins for the past week they had stayed at potter manor so far percy had had his hair turned green his bedsheet shortened twice been stuck to the toilet seat for two hours forced to dance in a clown suit and turned neon pink all over the other children had had a great laugh from it all the four younger kids spent the morning flying around on their brooms again rose and ginny had fun flying around the boys in spite of harry nimbus 2000 percy spent the day in the library lunch was another fun affair with sirius and remus joining the potters and their young houseguests the older marauders were highly amused with the tales of the pranks their younger proteges had done hermione and neville joined them for dinner after dinner they all gathered around a grand piano in the ballroom singing carols while it snowed outside hermione and neville spent the night in potter manor staying in rose and harry room respectively the next day they had a great snowball fight after breakfast then they all sat around planning a prank they would pull on the night they returned to hogwarts before hermione and neville left hermione was going with her parents to visit some of her other relatives and would see the others on the platform on january 3 two days later while they were having breakfast james said to harry son how would you like to see some aurors in training specifically learning some spells and dueling harry eyes widened really dad i d love too james smiled there a group halfway through their training who are having a practical session this afternoon you can observe some of the spells they use after that spell you used on quirrell last june i think you d be interested in these harry grinned great it felt good when i used that spell james grinned back good i wanted to do this a few months ago but with your punishment and having to get you cleared to observe it i just got permission last week oh ron fred george you three can go along with harry i ve talked to arthur and he gave permission james shrugged also sure if you want harry and ron grinned at each other wicked ron said the twins gave each other a high five james turned to percy you can come too if you want percy just shrugged is it okay mr potter if i just sit this one out i still have some homework to finish hey rose said what about me and ginny can we go with them james looked at lily who shook her head james sighed sorry princess your mother says you re too young you re just starting to learn spells knowing you once you see some of the spells the aurors use you may be tempted to try them it may be too dangerous for you he looked at ginny i sorry ginny but molly also said the same thing rose scowled hey harry and ron are only a year older than us besides he sure to try those spells once he seen them her face was starting to turn as red as her hair lily sat down beside her daughter and placed her hands gently on the girl shoulders rose honey you have to understand we believe harry will be able to handle the spells he may see being cast rose crossed her arms over her chest it not fair she said grumpily ginny just sat there looking miserable harry felt a twinge of guilt at the sight of the two disappointed girls he turned to his mum mum why dontyou take rose and ginny shopping in muggle london while we are with the aurors i sure they d enjoy it it been a while since they d done that lily smiled good idea harry she turned to the girls well girls how about it feel up to a shopping expedition along charing cross harry leaned over to his sister and whispered dontworry i ll pass out what i see wand movements and all the girls mood brightened as they nodded their heads after lunch james apparated back to potter manor lily and the girls flooed over to the leaky cauldron to get a cab james and the boys flooed to the ministry leading them down the golden hall of the fireplaces past the fountain that harry had always disliked for some reason once past security they took a lift to the fifth floor james led them through a set of metal doors into a large room that had a large mattress covering the floor standing at attention to one side of the room were ten young men and women just a little bit older than percy in front of them glaring at the auror recruits was sirius dressed in the same auror uniform as james sirius broke into a grin at the sight of james and his charges he ordered the recruits to the side and approached the visitors hey guys how are you all doing he said his grin growing wider the boys grinned back at him we re great sirius harry said we cantwait to see what happens here sirius gave a chuckle and said all right just sit down over by the side and watch the four boys sat on the grass while james and sirius went back to the recruits for the next two hours they watched the recruits face off and throw spells at each other harry watched with fascination paying attention to the incantations and words used he saw several spells that he could have used against malfoy in that duel they had he hoped that there would be another meeting of the club when they returned to hogwarts so he could show malfoy and snape a thing or two later they met up with lily and the girls in the leaky cauldron before heading back to potter manor harry noticed that rose and ginny seemed happier than they had been at lunch the rest of the holidays passed filled with fun and good cheer for the people in potter manor on new year eve molly and arthur surprised their children arriving by floo just before dinner the weasley children were delighted and spent the rest of the evening hearing their parents stories of egypt james took this opportunity to pull harry aside and ask him to join him in the library puzzled harry followed his father once they were again seated in the couch james turned to his son harry there one thing i want you to promise me okay harry frowned what is it dad i want you to promise me that whatever happens you will not search for the chamber of secrets harry eyes widened you mean that the chamber is real james sighed yes it is now this is secret information i only know this because i the head auror and i have access to the old files harry looked puzzled what old files dad james got up and started pacing back and forth a habit harry knew his father did when he was worried james talked as he paced what happening now with the chamber had happened before harry gasped before when it happened about fifty years ago several people were attacked and a young girl died harry eyes widened and his mouth dropped open who died it doesntmatter now james said stopping in front of harry and dropping to one knee in front of him what important is that you understand that the chamber is real and there really is some form of monster there it dangerous to go looking for it who opened the chamber then dad harry asked was he caught do they know what kind of monster was in it is it still there i not sure son james said all the files said was that after the girl died the attacks stopped there was a suspect who was expelled but we dontknow who it was or if he or she was really guilty there was no mention as to what kind of creature was hidden in the chamber now he looked directly into harry eyes promise me that you will not go to the chamber of secrets no matter what happens leave it to dumbledore and the other professors even lockhart harry asked a small smile on his lips james scowled remembering what had happened to his son after that bludger had broken his arm well maybe not him promise me okay well okay dad harry said hoping his father did not see his fingers crossed behind his back the following day harry managed to get a compartment on the express for him ron hermione neville rose and ginny though it was a tight squeeze the twins were off visiting with their fellow fourth years once the train was under way he told the others what his father had told him about the chamber ron whistled wow so the chamber been opened before yeah fifty years ago harry said and it not known who was responsible for it hermione asked harry shook his head dad said that the files didnteven say who the suspect was or what happened to him or her after being expelled no one knows what the monster is either i bet it was malfoy dad who opened it ron said you heard what that git said when we found the writing you ll be next mudbloods his dad probably opened it up when he was here then taught good old draco how to do it ron be reasonable hermione said it couldnthave been lucius malfoy oh ron said getting red in the face and why not hermione sighed because ronald it happened fifty years ago which was probably before lucius malfoy was at hogwarts or even before he was born then it was lucius dad ron said almost shouting who passed it on to him then he passed it down to draco ron harry said keep your voice down stop that you re scaring ginny ginny had turned pale while ron had been ranting ron face turned even more red and he mumbled an apology to ginny i doubt it was one of the malfoys neville said i mean this is only the second time the chamber been opened do you think lucius malfoy would have resisted the temptation to open it if he had known how to anyway if one of them had been expelled it would have been hard to keep that sort of thing a secret considering their family status in our world the others thought about it and agreed with him still harry had a nagging feeling that lucius malfoy was involved in it somehow that evening the students were in the middle of the return feast when they started changing again this time the changes took place in each house a quarter of the students changed into santa clauses another quarter changed into reindeer with red noses and another quarter became snowmen the last quarter of the students became elves dressed in green suits with tasseled hats everyone started laughing at each other the teachers were again speechless many of them were laughing after ten minutes the students returned to normal except for malfoy and his cronies who remained looking like santa elves they ran out of the great hall chased by the laughter of the rest of the students the feast then resumed though a few students laughed every now and then another banner appeared behind the teacher table with the words happy holidays welcome back to hogwarts from the new marauders the students returned to their dormitories full of food and good cheer after that night life settled back into the routine of classes meals homework and sleep harry also had quidditch practice to add to his load leaving him tired in the evening two weeks later his practice paid off when harry caught the snitch bringing victory to gryffindor over ravenclaw 280 to 100 even then harry still found the other students whispering behind his back and justin was still avoiding him going so far as to turn back the way he came when he saw harry hermione and ron told him to ignore it but harry still felt bad over the fright justin had had with the snake finally three weeks after the start of term harry had had enough he sought out justin in the library after dinner finding out from ernie macmillan that he had just missed him harry went searching for him in the corridors unfortunately he found justin stiff as a board in the same water soaked corridor on the second floor where the writing was still visible in spite of filch numerous attempts to clean it it got worse as mcgonagall and filch just happened to come by at that moment followed by peeves who hurried off shouting potter been caught in the act at the top of his ghostly lungs mcgonagall marched harry off to dumbledore office while miserably waiting for the headmaster harry met dumbledore phoenix fawkes harry was relieved when dumbledore assured him that he was not being blamed for justin condition unfortunately the next day harry found most of the school avoiding him and whispering behind his back only ron hermione fred george neville rose and ginny kept him company even the other gryffindors would move further down the table when harry came to the great hall for meals dean and seamus refused to look at him in the eye going to sleep before harry got back to the dorm harry concentrated on his schoolwork even refusing to help the others plan pranks even quidditch practice was strained as wood kept mentioning he was a pureblood every now and then one consolation there was that he had stopped his constant badgering of harry to catch the snitch valentine day proved to be interesting in an attempt to liven the spirits of the students lockhart had the walls of the great hall decorated with large pink flowers and had heart shaped confetti falling from the ceiling even worse he had drafted a group of dwarfs to dress up in cupid costumes and deliver singing valentine greetings to the person of a student choice luckily harry was not a recipient of one though neville was much to the pudgy boy discomfort a week later gryffindor managed to beat hufflepuff in their quidditch match 300 to 80 and harry had again made a fantastic catch of the snitch to seal their victory unfortunately since slytherin had beaten hufflepuff and ravenclaw this meant that the two would meet again for the final in the first week of may at least after the match the rest of gryffindor house treated harry normally as they celebrated as if they had already on the cup march passed peacefully with no further attacks lockhart kept claiming that whoever it was that was responsible had stopped once he she realized lockhart was close to catching him her this lack of activity allowed the students to relax and they were less nervous around harry with less tension around him harry allowed the twins to talk him into doing a prank on april 1 the twins birthday harry agreed since they hadntreally celebrated ron birthday the previous january limiting the celebration to their little group the prank started that morning as the students filed into the great hall for breakfast the rest of april passed with the school in higher spirits than at the beginning of term the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs stopped avoiding harry which lifted the boy spirits on the day of the quidditch finals harry again heard the voice while having breakfast again his friends did not hear it then hermione eyes had widened she had a short whispered conversation with rose who was seated beside her then dashed out the great hall telling them she had to go to the library later as harry and ron approached the quidditch pitch they ran into mcgonagall who informed them that the match was cancelled due to another attack she then asked the two stunned boys to accompany her to the hospital wing where they were shocked to find a petrified hermione it seemed she a ravenclaw girl and nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had been attacked outside the library ron seemed the worst affected by hermione condition after the triple attack tension again gripped the castle one consolation was that the other students no longer suspected harry after all he was in plain sight that entire morning including the time the attack had occurred and one of the victims was one of his best friends rose and ginny seemed highly affected by the attack on hermione several times harry saw the two with tears in their eyes causing a dull ache in his heart ron and harry visited hermione as often as they had time wishing they knew who was behind the attacks then two weeks after hermione attack hedwig dropped a letter in harry lap during breakfast addressed to him and rose harry recognized the unruly scrawl of the writer he nudged his sister and motioned her to follow him he then hurried out of the great hall and headed for the quidditch pitch sitting down in one of the front benches he waited for rose to catch up what is it harry she asked him i just got a letter from dad he answered it seems important well just dont sit there open it harry opened the letter and placed it between them so rose could read it too dear harry and rose i really sorry to hear that your friend hermione has been attacked i wish i could help her but dumbledore assures me that the mandrakes will soon be ready to cure all those petrified however we may be close to solving the mystery of the perpetrator the identity of the person who was accused of opening the chamber fifty years ago and expelled for it has been revealed to me unfortunately it is someone we know and have been friends with for years if you wish to know his identity simply say the words for the map i leave it up to you if you wish to talk with this person just be careful love dad harry and rose looked at each other well bro rose said do you want to know who it was of course i do harry said for hermione sake i have to know with a trembling hand harry touched his wand to the letter and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good most of the letters disappeared leaving six letters that slowly rearranged themselves in the center of the parchment and spelled out hagrid a n i hope my readers liked these last two chapters the next two will finish off the second year disclaimer i dontown harry potter or the characters except for rose who is my own creation i thank jkr for the honor of playing with her universe chapter 16 to the rescue harry ron and neville slowly approached the door to moaning myrtle bathroom still under harry invisibility cloak harry turned the brass doorknob and pushed the door open it hadnt changed from the last time he ron and hermione had been there still one of the most depressing and gloomy places harry had seen there was a row of chipped sinks with a large cracked and spotted mirror over them the doors to the stalls were wooden flaking and scratched then harry saw a mass of black robes and red hair in front of one of the sinks the three boys moved out of the cloak and hurried over to the prone figure they knelt beside the person and ron slowly turned the person over it was rose harry pulled her into his arms she was limp with her eyes closed and still breathing so she wasntpetrified rose wake up harry cried shaking her shoulders ooh it was horrible said a voice behind them the three boys turned around and found a squat ghost of a girl with lank hair thick pearly glasses and one of the glummest faces they had ever seen er hello myrtle harry said did you see what happened here oh yes myrtle said i was just there hovering over the door of my stall when a small girl with red hair came in she was walking stiffly clutching some sort of book that red head on floor she pointed at rose came in and asked her what she was doing the first redhead turned around her eyes were all wide and not blinking really scaring then she pulled out her wand and hit the second girl with some sort of red light i fled back here into the u bend of the toilet i just got back when you three came in she then looked shrewdly at them what are you doing here this is a girl bathroom um i harry potter this is ron weasley and neville longbottom we came to ask you something harry said but it can wait until i get rose here awake she my sister then he took out his wand he had seen the red light used by the auror trainees that day he and his friends had watched them sirius had told him that it was a stunning spell he had also seen his father use another spell to awaken those stunned enervate he now said pointing his wand to his sister chest rose stirred slowly she opened her eyes are you all right sis harry said looking into her face what happened she suddenly sat up almost banging heads with harry where ginny we dontknow harry said can you tell us what happened myrtle the ghost over there said she saw ginny stun you why d she do that rose looked at the three of them despair in her eyes she sighed something wrong with ginny she seems to be possessed or something i think it has something to do with that diary what diary ron asked well after that trip to diagon alley before my birthday she found a diary within the second hand book of spells she got she showed the diary to me that morning of my birthday it was a small thin book with a black cover it seemed empty except for a name on the first page t m riddle harry and ron looked at each other stunned rose continued ginny told me she tried to write on it but the ink just vanished like it was being absorbed i was intrigued i wrote down hello on it and to our astonishment the words hello to you too appeared on it ginny then wrote down her name it answered back with hello ginny i tom riddle how d you get hold of my diary i became concerned and asked ginny not to use it she agreed at first but apparently changed her mind looking back i think she started to write in it when i started to have detention alone yeah ron said she seemed a bit lonely without you beside her the attacks on students started about then i think harry said his hand cupping his chin come to think of it every time an attack occurred the two of you werenttogether he looked back at rose so what happened tonight well remember that night after you talked to hagrid and told us about tom riddle being the one who turned hagrid in well she was upset hearing that about the guy i ran after her and asked her if she was writing to tom in the diary she admitted she had been whenever i was in detention because she was lonely i asked her why and she said there were things she couldntshare even with me she then started telling me about having blank spots in her memory that night the writing appeared on the wall out there she woke up to find herself with blood and feathers on her hands and clothes rooster feathers with no idea about what happened at other times she d find herself in places without knowing how she got there usually after an attack had occurred harry eyes widened she was probably the one who killed the roosters and wrote on the wall with their blood i think so too harry rose said but i doubt she did it freely she said she asked riddle about it a couple of times but he never really said anything about it that night you talked with hagrid was the final straw i got her to agree to get rid of it apparently the diary had other ideas what does that have to do with the chamber ron asked harry turned to him dontyou see ron somehow that diary is controlling ginny making her do awful things it probably made her open the chamber and let the monster loose yes i think so too rose said i was going up to gryffindor tower to get her for dinner then i saw her walking down the corridor she seemed stiff in her movements she was clutching the diary i decided to follow her first she came down to this bathroom then she moved to those sinks over there then i finally spoke to her she turned around i saw her eyes they were so round and wide just staring before i could do anything else she pulled out her wand and i got knocked out so what do we do now neville asked harry cupped his chin again thinking hard first we need to get rose to the hospital wing she needs to be checked out by madame pomfrey no rose said i want to help ginny she stood up then wobbled a bit steadying herself on a sink there you see sis harry said you need to get some rest dont worry we ll take care of ginny i i ll take her to the hospital wing harry neville said harry squinted at neville he barely saw the blush form on rose face all right nev just be careful i wouldntwant to have to hurt you if you do something inappropriate harry rose said her face turning as red as her hair i can take care of myself she didntnotice neville cheeks turn a little pink oh not right now you can t harry said now go on the two of you nev you better tell mcgonagall what happened maybe she can reach our dads neville nodded then gingerly placed a hand on rose waist and the other on her shoulder and guided her out the bathroom once they were gone harry turned to ron we ve got to get into that chamber and save ginny how do we do that ron asked we donteven know where the entrance is there one way to find out harry said he turned to myrtle who was still floating over them several minutes later harry and ron were walking down a dark stone tunnel miles below the castle their only light at the end of harry wand as they walked on they started stepping on the bones of countless small animals a crunch sounding with every step they made harry hoped that ginny would not look any way similar to these remains after a while they came upon a giant greenish snake skin about twenty feet long it looked old and moldy obviously the owner would be a lot larger now which was daunting knowledge for the boys they walked on and finally came to a solid wall where two entwined serpents were carved glittering emeralds serving as their eyes just as harry stepped forward to the wall his foot stepped on a strange stone that depressed into the floor then he heard a rumbling sound above him looking up he saw the ceiling above giving way he threw himself forward a moment later he picked himself up from the floor and looked back there was now a wall of broken rock and debris there was no sign of ron harry ran to the wall of debris ron where are you he shouted faintly through the wall he heard i here behind this pile of rocks you okay harry i fine ron harry answered what happened harry ron asked why d the ceiling collapse i think it was some sort of trap i set off harry said come on let try shifting some of these rocks so you can come through that ll take too long harry ron said ginny may be running out of time you go on and i ll try moving some of the rocks so you and ginny can get through once you find her all right ron harry said if i not back within a couple of hours go on harry ron said harry turned around and walked up to the pair of snakes on the wall carefully watching now where he stepped just as he had done above to open the entrance harry used parseltongue to command the snakes to open the snakes parted as the wall cracked open and the halves disappeared into the tunnel walls harry found himself at the end of a very long and dimly lit chamber with towering pillars entwined with more carved serpents lining the sides torches were held in sconces along the wall most of them unlit the ceiling was out of sight a few puddles of water were scattered across the marble floor he slowly walked forward wand out peering into the shadows in case the basilisk was lurking around then he came up to the last pair of pillars and came in sight of a statue as tall as the chamber it face was ancient and monkeyish with a long thin beard so high above that they had to crane their necks to see it it was in sweeping wizards robes and in between the grayish feet of the statue was another figure in black robes with red hair ginny harry cried sprinting forward harry then knelt beside ginny muttering please dontbe dead dontbe dead he turned her over carefully her face was quite pale and cold yet she was breathing since her eyes were closed she wasntpetrified harry started shaking her ginny please wake up he took out his wand and prepared to use the same spell he had awakened rose with she wontwake a soft voice said behind him not even to an enervate spell harry stood quickly and turned around to find a tall black haired sixteen year old boy leaning on a pillar his color seemed a bit off almost like he was from a black and white television screen the strange boy started to move forward toward him and ginny who are you harry asked my name is tom riddle the other boy said harry gasped how is it that you are here i a memory riddle said quietly preserved for fifty years in a diary he pointed between the statue toes there lying open in the floor just a few inches from ginny was a book fitting the description rose had given you re the one who turned hagrid in harry said you caused him to be expelled riddle smirked oh you know about that it was fairly simple headmaster armando dippet was so easy to convince he was a trusting fool i had him convinced that hagrid pet was the one responsible for the death of that girl and the other attacks i knew the existence of the beast for a few months then but thought it would make a perfect scapegoat scapegoat harry asked his eyes then widened you framed hagrid you re the one responsible for those attacks then riddle smiled a cold and cruel smile yes harry potter bravo you ve figured it out something dippet never did no one seemed to realize that he couldnthave been the heir of slytherin or have the power to open the chamber of secrets something i had worked for five years to accomplish how d you know who i am harry asked oh i know who you are and your history riddle said he smiled again ginny told me she wrote to me not often usually when her best friend your sister i believe was absent she told me all about you your sister and family how great it was to be around you to be a friend of the kind and great harry potter when you hated any publicity it was so tedious at times listening to the prattle of a mere child but writing to me enabled me to pour a little of my own secrets into her what secrets harry asked you see after i turned hagrid in i had to stop the attacks i was surprised at how well my plan had worked but then the transfiguration teacher dumbledore persuaded dippet to have hagrid trained as gamekeeper after he was expelled then he seemed to watch my every move he probably suspected hagrid was innocent harry said he probably saw right through you well he kept quite an annoying watch on me riddle said so it became dangerous to open the chamber again while i remained at school so i put part of myself a memory an echo in this diary waiting for another opportunity to continue salazar slytherin noble work and get rid of all the muggleborns in this school ginny weasley gave me the opportunity once i had worn down her will which took a surprising amount to time to do you fiend harry said you controlled her and made her write those words on the wall open the chamber release the monster yes it was going so well riddle said then your sister talked to her ginny became frightened by the diary she wrote one last time saying goodbye to me i decided that it was time to meet you so i took control of ginny again and made her write those last words on the wall hoping it would lure you here i knew that as her friend you d want to save her why did you want to meet me harry asked i was curious i wondered how a boy like you unremarkable looking and with no extraordinary magical powers could have defeated the most powerful wizards of all time how did you escape with a mere scar yet lord voldemort lost his powers harry was surprised what do you care voldemort was before your time oh you are mistaken harry riddle said lord voldemort is my past present and future he bent down and took hold of ginny wand with it he wrote fiery letters spelling his full name then with a wave of the wand the letters rearranged to form i am lord voldemort harry was stunned you re voldemort riddle smiled again yes it a name i assumed while still in hogwarts among my closest friends here i wanted a name to replace the filthy name of my filthy muggle father who abandoned my mother when he learned she was a witch a name that all wizards will fear once i become the most powerful wizard in the world you re not the most powerful wizard in the world harry said albus dumbledore is the most powerful wizard in the world dumbledore hah riddle said laughing i heard he been dismissed dismissed because of a memory well i wontbe a memory for long you see how pale ginny is she has poured a lot of herself into the diary which is why i am before you now as she gets weaker i get stronger soon she will be dead and i will be whole again not if i can help it harry said he raised his wand and shouted expelliarmus the spell hit riddle and just passed through him impacting on a far pillar riddle laughed oh not just yet harry but let us return to our conversation from what i found out from ginny we have met twice in your past and my future and twice i have failed to kill you how did you survive what extraordinary powers do you have i dont know harry answered him no one is sure why i survived and you lost your powers that night not my parents not even dumbledore but he told me that love has something to do with it the love of my mother who was willing to die to protect me ah riddle said love is it what kind of power can that give let us see let match the power of lord voldemort and the great harry potter riddle moved to the foot of the huge statue and said something in parseltongue the mouth of the huge statue opened very wide into a huge hole and harry heard something stirring within remembering a spell he had seen before harry pointed his wand at the statue above the opening reducto a red light from his wand hit the spot he was pointing at causing some pieces to fall partially blocking the hole riddle smirked quite good but not good enough obliterate the blocking rocks disappeared his heart hammering in his chest harry backed up until he hit one of the pillars he ducked behind it facing the wall he heard the sound of something huge hitting the floor followed by slithering of scales along the floor getting nearer to him harry felt a wave of cold fill his body as his heart increased its speed he started thinking help me help me someone please help me then he heard music an eerie spine tingling music it seemed to fill him with buoyant hope it was coming closer then he heard riddle say what that bird doing down here no it cant be a phoenix harry felt something fall to his feet he looked down at what appeared to be a ragged bundle then something heavy landed on his shoulder looking there harry was surprised to see the large crimson bird with a golden tail perched on his shoulder fawkes harry said recognizing the bird as dumbledore phoenix he looked down again at his feet and recognized the rags as the hogwarts sorting hat then his shoulder felt lighter as fawkes lifted off him suddenly there was a loud explosive hissing sound just behind and above him and something heavy smashed into him knocking him sideways to the floor and making him drop his wand riddle was screaming no what are you doing stupid bird get away from here then he was hissing and harry understood him clearly leave the bird alone kill the boy he right behind you harry dared look up and saw a huge greenish snake weaving drunkenly above him fawkes circling around its head then harry noticed the serpent eyes were bleeding and it was spitting in agony harry ducked as the basilisk tail passed above him he could now see its mouth filled with long deadly fangs dripping with poison he needed to kill it but couldntfind his wand he needed a different weapon then harry glanced down at the sorting hat lying on its side something appeared from inside it some kind of silver handle grasping it harry pulled on it and was surprised to see a sword emerge from the hat it looked beautiful like those used by knights he had seen on television shifting the sword in his hand harry got to his feet the basilisk was now weaving its head back and forth a long tongue flicking in and out harry knew from watching nature documentaries that this was how snakes smelled out their prey riddle saw the weapon in harry hand well nice sword harry i hope you can use it harry leaped forward as the basilisk lunged at him just missing by a handbreadth harry landed next to the diary and ginny harry noticed that ginny seemed paler now almost lacking in color he also saw that riddle was more substantial and less white than when he had arrived in the chamber harry realized that time was running out for his friend then an idea stuck him two actually two desperate intertwined ideas harry slowly picked up the diary in one hand as he stood up hey he shouted over here you stupid reptile he stamped his feet on the floor knowing that snakes also were sensitive to vibrations the basilisk turned to the sound of his voice it seemed to gather itself then lunged forward as the mouth moved toward him harry jumped sideways throwing the diary into the massive jaws the jaws clamped shut on the black book riddle screamed no as basilisk head smashed into the floor harry quickly raised the sword above his head and smashed it down on the area right behind the head like a butter knife slicing through hot butter the sword sliced through the massive body neatly severing the head off harry dropped to his knees and looked toward riddle he was screaming and convulsing then he exploded in a flash of light and was gone ginny moaned and harry moved to her side dropping the sword and knelt beside her she opened her eyes which widened on seeing harry harry helped her sit up tears started to flow from her eyes oh harry it was me i opened the chamber i set the monster loose riddle made me even made me stun rose she sobbed wh where is he the last thing i remember is him coming out of that diary harry placed a hand gently on her shoulder it all right ginny it over riddle gone and the basilisk dead look he pointed at the serpent severed head where the diary was impaled on one of the fangs harry got up and walked over to the head he gingerly pried the diary out of the fang fawkes settled on harry shoulder harry petted the bird thanks fawkes without you i doubt i could have survived harry picked up his wand the sword and the sorting hat he came back to ginny who was now looking in wonder at fawkes harry is that a phoenix she asked wide eyed harry gave her a small smile yeah it is he actually dumbledore s his name fawkes what it doing here she asked her hand now stroking its tail feathers gently fawkes was now crooning softly his music lightening the hearts of the two friends harry smile widened he helped me save you blinded the basilisk and brought the sorting hat ginny looked down in surprise at the hat in harry hand why d he bring the sorting hat harry held up the sword this came out of the hat i used it to kill the basilisk they examined the sword shuddering at the blood encrusted on its blade then harry saw the name on the sword godric gryffindor his heart skipped a beat he had to tell his dad about this he stood up and offered a hand to ginny come on gin we ve got to get out of here ron will be worried at the sound of her brother name ginny broke into tears again oh harry i going to be expelled for causing all this trouble she sobbed harry knelt down and pulled her awkwardly into his arms similar to what he had done earlier with rose yet he felt a strange sensation in his stomach that he hadntfelt then he ignored the feeling for now shh it going to be all right ginny he said as he slowly rubbed her back i ll explain everything we ll show them the diary everyone will understand no one will blame you and you wontbe expelled ginny pulled back and looked at harry tears still streaming from her eyes are you sure will rose and hermione forgive me harry felt a pang in his heart at the sight of her tear streaked face yes they will they ll understand that it wasntyou but riddle who did those things ginny sniffled one last time then stood up harry placed the sword and sorting hat through his belt and held the diary in one hand the hand that wasntclutching ginny s they left the chamber and found ron had made a hole in the wall of stone in front of the entrance to the chamber they managed to squeeze through the hole then fawkes carried the three of them out of the tunnels back to moaning myrtle bathroom and up to dumbledore office bypassing the guardian gargoyle and the winding staircase harry wondered why fawkes had brought them there since he saw dumbledore leave the school after lucius malfoy had brought him papers dismissing him earlier that evening they paused at the door to dumbledore inner office having heard voices inside now that we know from ms potter where the entrance of the chamber of secrets most likely is what do we do a voice said most likely mcgonagall we ll organize a rescue party said a voice that harry recognized as his father s we ll go into the chamber after them harry gave ginny hand one last gentle squeeze before releasing it and pushing the doors open within the office they saw james frank longbottom molly and arthur weasley and professor mcgonagall seated in chairs in front of the headmaster desk surprisingly professor dumbledore was seated in his usual chair behind the desk in a corner harry saw lockhart sprawled on the floor wrapped up with ropes you donthave to go down there dad harry said as he ron and ginny stepped into the office it over a n hope you liked this chapter i had planned to finish it including the office scene but decided it was getting long so i cut it into two chapters the second part should be up in another week disclaimer see previous chapters chapter 17 after the chamber it over harry said as he ginny and ron stepped dumbledore office after coming from the chamber of secrets fawkes swooped over to his perch by dumbledore side after a few moments where everyone except dumbledore looked at them in shock mrs weasley rushed forward to embrace her daughter her husband soon following james looked shrewdly at his son mr longbottom and mcgonagall were still looking at the scene dumbfounded but dumbledore was smiling with a twinkle in his eye then harry and ron were pulled into a hug by mrs weasley you saved her you saved ginny she said ron was mumbling mum geroff harry felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment it didnthelp that his father was now smirking james walked up to his son and placed his hands on the boy shoulders so what happened harry with this question mrs weasley stepped back from the two boys and guided ginny gently into a chair her parents sat behind her harry placed the sorting hat diary and sword on dumbledore table then he and ron sat down in the chairs beside ginny s harry could sense that she was ready to cry again now boys dumbledore said gently what happened in the chamber how did you figure everything out harry sighed over the next half hour he told them about dobby and his warning hearing the voice rose figuring out that the monster was a basilisk their theory that the entrance of the chamber was in moaning myrtle bathroom riddle and the battle in the chamber with dumbledore help harry also explained about the diary and how riddle used it to possess ginny mr weasley admonished ginny for trusting the diary harry gave a look of sympathy and support as tears again threatened to flow down her cheeks finally dumbledore said i think it best that madame pomfrey take at look at miss weasley to make sure she doesnthave any serious injuries and she should spend the night in the hospital wing to get some rest dontworry my dear there will be no punishment for what happened older and wiser wizarding folk have been duped by tom riddle ginny looked relieved then she looked appalled cantmadame pomfrey look at me here i dontwant to go to the hospital wing rose is probably there how can i face her after what i did to her dumbledore smiled dontworry miss weasley i doubt miss potter will hold it against you the friendship you share will overcome any ill feelings this incident may cause i sure she is worried about you and will feel better knowing you are all right james knelt down in front of ginny ginny you and rose have been friends since you two could crawl down the years you ve had many disagreements and fights yet you ve always made up rose will understand that you didntmean to hex her she knew you werentyourself when you went into that bathroom professor dumbledore is right she ll be more worried about you so go on and show her you re out of danger ginny gave a weak nod and allowed her parents to lead her out of dumbledore office taking a moment to look back at harry a look of gratitude in her eyes harry heart gave a small leap at that look confusing harry then ron said what lockhart doing here all trussed up james laughed oh you noticed eh his expression then changed to disgust well your esteemed defense teacher showed his true colors tonight the git whoops he glanced at dumbledore and mcgonagall the latter scowling at his language sorry professors your ex professor was going to make a run for it it lucky frank and i showed up at the entrance hall after minerva called us about ginny disappearance he glared at the prone man he actually tried to remove our memories he turned to the two boys who were now chuckling and grinning you were right about him then dad harry said i knew it we were actually going to tell him what we learned about the chamber and the monster who knows what he would have done to us if we caught him trying to leave james grinned i ve no doubt you would have handled him well enough son he turned to frank longbottom frank i think you should get the former professor over to the ministry i need to stay here check on my daughter and make sure my son is fine mr longbottom grinned sure james check on that son of mine while you re at it okay he then waved his wand over lockhart mobilicorpus lockhart floated ahead of him out the door come along mr weasley mcgonagall said i think madame pomfrey should check you out also i believe that madame pomfrey is giving the mandrake juice to those who were petrified good ron said happily that means hermione is all right wait till i tell her what happened she ll be green with envy over this adventure he followed mcgonagall out of the office james then turned to his son seems you re getting into a dangerous habit son last year it was the stone now it a basilisk i d hate to think what your mother will say when she finds out harry winced i sorry dad he said you had just gone and i wasntsure if lockhart could save ginny we had to try to save her if we hadn t she d be dead now and voldemort would be back even as a sixteen year old james sat down heavily on the seat beside his son yeah there is that he turned to dumbledore so you know who went to school here did he dumbledore sighed yes he did james he was an exceptionally gifted student one of the most brilliant i ve seen i not surprised he came up with that diary unfortunately he was also a puzzle to me he had only a small group of friends all from his own house he was an orphan you know born of a witch and muggle father lived in an orphanage until he received his hogwarts letter he hated going home there every summer wait a minute james said he a half blood just like harry is that the reason he he paused at a look from dumbledore who nodded slightly toward harry harry didntcatch what his father was going to say as his attention was focused on the sword he had pulled out of the sorting hat dad professor this sword i pulled it out of the hat take a look at it dumbledore and james looked at it and saw the name causing both of them to gasp james turned to dumbledore his voice filled with awe albus is this really godric gryffindor sword dumbledore reverently stroked the hilt i believe so james i ve read descriptions of it but it hasntbeen seen in hundreds of years not since it was buried with him then how did harry get hold of it james said is it related to harry looked suspiciously at dumbledore and his father what were they hiding why was dumbledore here when he was supposedly relieved by the school board of governors just then the doors of the office opened again and lucius malfoy stepped in he was followed by a small creature dobby harry cried so you work for the malfoys malfoy glared at the house elf and said i ll deal with you later he turned back to dumbledore obviously ignoring the potters so you re back he said sneering yes lucius dumbledore said leaning back in his chair when the board heard that arthur weasley daughter had been kidnapped they seemed to reconsider their position and told me that i could return to hogwarts i see lucius said well i think they ll change their minds when the attacks continue oh haventyou heard lucius james then spoke up the perpetrator has been caught and the attacks will stop even the monster is dead lucius turned to glare at james oh really and pray tell who was responsible for these horrible attacks it was voldemort dumbledore said just like the last time only this time he worked through somebody else with the help of an artifact of his he pointed to the diary harry was watching dobby who was pointing to the diary and then to malfoy before hitting himself hard with his own fist yes lucius james said it a curious thing that diary quite a dangerous thing too i wonder if it familiar to you perhaps it something you lost or purposely misplaced how dare you potter malfoy said glaring at james oh i dare very much malfoy james said moving toward the silver haired man until their noses were almost touching you planted that diary in ginny weasley cauldron that day we met in diagon alley was it some last minute instructions from your precious dark lord before he bought it i d like to see you prove that potter malfoy said oh that would be difficult now lucius dumbledore said now that the diary is destroyed yes a real pity james said it seemed quite a clever plan imagine the shock to our world if it became known that the daughter of arthur weasley was attacking muggleborns his credibility as deputy minister would be destroyed fortunately my son and ginny brother ron stopped it even killed the monster in the chamber of secrets that plan is a now a dismal failure i know your former master so hated failure malfoy paled yes your son was quite fortunate he said he turned to the house elf come on dobby we re leaving he then kicked the house elf toward the door oh lucius james said making the silver haired man turn around i wouldnttry spreading any more of the dark lord school things around if i were you i sure my wife can come up with a spell that will trace it back to you lucius merely glared and turned around whacking dobby again on the bum harry then whispered to his dad i ve got an idea to help dobby he asked dumbledore for the diary and placed a sock in it he hurried after lucius malfoy and forced him to take the diary back malfoy tossed it to dobby when dobby opened it and found the sock he was ecstatic since by being given clothes even unknowingly by malfoy he had been freed lucius malfoy was furious and tried to hex harry before even james could interfere dobby blasted malfoy backwards malfoy glared at them and limped out of the school dobby thanked harry for helping him get free of the malfoys and harry made him promise to stop trying to protect him when dobby had vanished with a click of his fingers james turned to look at harry that was a good thing you did son freeing that house elf infuriating lucius was an added bonus thanks dad harry said grinning at his father now james said you better get yourself to the hospital wing and let madame pomfrey look you over i hope most of that blood isntyours nope harry said it mostly the basilisk s it was really messy when i cut its head off good james said you better check on your sister too i also sure you want to see if hermione is unpetrified oh yeah harry said and turned to go oh son by the way james said you re grounded for two weeks and that includes flying dad harry whined in indignation james smiled at the boy better me than your mum giving you punishment for endangering yourself she might have grounded you for the whole summer speaking of which i better tell her what happened she ll probably want to come over once i tell her the events of tonight go on now off to the hospital wing harry sighed and walked away from his dad his good mood over saving ginny and freeing dobby evaporating with the prospect of another two weeks of boredom in potter manor as soon as he was sure his son would continue walking to the hospital wing james turned around and walked back way they had come upon saying the password saltwater taffy the gargoyle stepped aside and allowed james to ascend to the headmaster office using the moving stairs james knocked on the door and entered after hearing enter he found dumbledore examining intently the sword his son had used to kill the basilisk the headmaster had cleaned it up and it now gleamed brightly large rubies glittering along its hilt beautiful isntit dumbledore said as i said earlier this is godric gryffindor own sword i checked it just now against a picture of it in one of my books james moved closer to examine the sword a magnificent weapon better looking than most of the ones we have in the auror training rooms albus yes but still sharp as ever from the ease with which harry cut the basilisk head off dumbledore said so albus james said do you think this has any connection to the prophecy dumbledore sighed i dontknow james one thing it does is provide additional proof that your son is descended from godric gryffindor by blood only a true gryffindor could have pulled this out of the sorting hat about that albus james said how did that happen how did your phoenix know to bring the hat to harry well james dumbledore said harry must have shown true loyalty to me for fawkes to come to him in his hour of need as to the sorting hat it has been here for far longer than me it has strange abilities even i dontknow what is known is that it has a strong affinity to the light and an ever vigilant opponent to darkness now i believe you must inform your wife of what has occurred you can use my fireplace thank you albus james said striding almost immediately toward the fireplace with the crackling fire james bent in front of the fire threw in some floo powder placed his face in the green flames and said potter manor he felt the sensations associated with floo travel until he looked into a familiar living room blinky he called a few moments later the house elf appears in the living room master james you called blinky yes blinky james said please ask lily to come down i need to talk with her a few minutes later lily knelt in front of the fire dressed in a nightgown james what is it is something wrong well love something was wrong tonight but it much better now unfortunately it involved your son and daughter what harry and rose what happened james i think its best you dress up and come here to hogwarts then i and the headmaster can explain it fully an hour later james had explained the night events to his wife lily sat at her husband side gazing at the sword glittering on dumbledore desk so let me understand this albus lily said once again our son has thwarted v v voldemort beaten him a third time dumbledore said yes lily though technically this time it was his sixteen year old self harry defeated in essence that is what happened lily blew out a breath three times already does this have anything to do with the prophecy as i told your esteemed husband lily i dontknow dumbledore said prophecy is a vague thing at times it is self fulfilling james was insinuating earlier if being a half blood was what caused voldemort to choose harry that night he almost killed all of you i not sure it is difficult to delve into the thinking of a madman for all we know he could have randomly chosen harry and then gone on to kill neville longbottom once he had killed your son just to make sure after a few minutes of silence lily stood up and placed her hands on the desk sending a glare at dumbledore how could you have let this get so far albus last year with quirrell at least only harry and his friends were involved this year both my children were in danger plus several other students were petrified including one of their good friends i always thought you were the most powerful wizard alive when we were in school v v voldemort never dared lay a hand here now he has twice touched this school in as many years both times involving my son dumbledore actually cringed as lily continued to glare at him james placed his hands on his wife shoulders trying to calm her please believe me lily dumbledore said i am sorry for what happened last year it seemed the best place at the time to hide the stone no one could have suspected quirinius of being a host to voldemort especially a willing one having known him for years as for this year crisis it was hard to be aware of what was happening to students and be unable to help them salazar slytherin hid his chamber well even now we cannot open the entrance i suspect the way to do so involves being a parselmouth yet i would not ask harry or ginny to help us in that regard their experience there was horrible and need not be repeated i wish i could reverse what has happened but i afraid it would be tempting fate to do so lily continued to glare at dumbledore i hope you re more successful in preventing things like this in the future albus now i want to see my son and daughter she turned to james shall we dear um you go ahead lils james said i ve already made sure they re all right i have a few more things to discuss with albus i ll join you in a while lily looked suspiciously at james but then she said all right i ll see you later albus when his wife had left james turned back to the headmaster albus harry handled himself well enough tonight but he had help he may not be so lucky next time next time james dumbledore asked james blew a breath out as he sat down he removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes with the fingers of one hand you know that someday that prophecy will be fulfilled somehow voldemort will regain his powers and body i want harry to be ready for that i want him to beat the bloody bastard once and for all and live no matter what i want to see my son have his own family to do that he needs to learn things not normally the curriculum of hogwarts yet i dontwant to take him from his friends or some semblance of a normal life what are you saying then james dumbledore asked though he had an idea what the elder potter had in mind well it something i had started to think about while we waited for lily i hope she will go along with it albus some of the things i plan may not be to her liking so this is what i plan to do when harry got to the hospital wing madame pomfrey immediately made him sit in one of the beds as she ran her wand over him checking for injuries in the other beds he could see ginny and rose talking quietly molly and arthur weasley sitting across from them a screen still separated the petrified students from the rest of the ward except for some minor cuts and bruises which were easily healed madame pomfrey pronounced harry fit however she still insisted on him spending the night in bed she allowed him to visit his sister and friends before sleeping harry walked over to rose bed he noticed that ginny had now moved away and was being put to bed by her mother hey sis i glad you re okay he reached over and hugged her thanks big brother she said smiling and hugging him back harry looked at rose then at ginny so are you two okay with each other rose sighed and gave a sad smile well somewhat i told her i didntblame her for hexing me i mean she was under the control of a slimy git but we still have a few issues to settle her need to confide in someone else even in a diary was a bit hard for me we used to tell each other everything now it seems she was keeping secrets harry placed his hand on her shoulder come on now you ve had fights before remember when you were both six and you thought she lost that barbie doll mum gave you for christmas you got really mad and refused to let her come over for a whole week yeah then i found out that the twins had accidentally made it vanish but didnttell her rose cheeks turned pink as she remembered her embarrassment then when their mum forced a confession out of them i had to beg ginny to come over to play then we turned the twins hair blue for a whole day for that rose was now smiling see harry said grinning himself you two always made up you ve been friends for so long it hard to stay apart you ll get through this just give her some space and be there for her riddle was awful to her i just dontknow how much you re right harry rose said we ve been friends for too long to allow a slimy git like that riddle to get between us thanks she gave him another hug all right harry said you get some sleep i need to check on hermione and the others have you seen ron oh he was here until a few minutes before you came rose said he looked in on hermione just after madame pomfrey had unpetrified her they talked for a while then they started having a row madame pomfrey threw him out then his parents were scowling at him when he left in a huff is that the way they are usually with each other harry sighed unfortunately once in a while it just worse in the last couple of months before hermione got petrified i wonder what ron said that started it he did say something about teasing her about missing our trip down to the chamber maybe that was it rose said frankly i glad i didntsee that place from what little ginny had told me so far it a terrible place yeah too many snakes harry said okay get some rest sis he pulled the covers over her and tucked her in harry moved to the screen and peeked around it obviously unpetrified but asleep in separate beds were colin justin and the vaguely familiar ravenclaw prefect harry thought he saw her one time walking in the corridor with percy on the furthest bed he saw hermione sitting up and wide awake her head in a book blimey is she revising she just got unpetrified for merlin sake he slowly approached her bed and said hey she looked up and smiled at him putting the book down after carefully marking her place harry i so glad you re all right i heard from ronald you solved the mystery of the chamber and saved ginny weasley her tone had changed when she said ron name harry blushed uh yeah actually rose helped us guess what the monster was based on things you said he then gave her a detailed account of what happened since she got petrified hermione only interrupted him twice once to say she also believed hagrid was innocent and the second time to praise harry for being true to dumbledore after he had related what happened with dobby hermione smiled and said your dad right harry giving that house elf his freedom is a very good deed harry smiled i glad i did that so what did ron say to you hermione smile was replaced by a scowl sometimes he just infuriates me he starts off shaking my hand and saying how glad he is that i all right and unpetrified then he commented that i d have competition in the brains department as rose was the one who figured out what the monster was so i told him that i already knew it was a basilisk and was just on my way to tell you lot about that then what did he say harry said he said i didnthave to fib to prove i was the smarter one hermione said furious now he actually thought i d lie about that just to say i had done it first i thought he was my friend and would know i wouldntlie about something like that i called him a git for that and he stormed out harry sighed hermione i ve known ron longer than you at times he can be tactless and unintentionally hurtful with his words but he did say you were the smarter one didnthe even if he said it like that oh right i guess he did she said a little flustered now i ll talk to him tomorrow and explain what you were mad about harry said then you two talk it over okay okay so are you all right hermione asked yeah just a few cuts and bruises madame pomfrey healed easily harry said okay go get some sleep harry hermione said i on the other hand had had enough sleep i have to get back to revising just as harry was about to say something they heard the doors of the hospital wing open peeking around the screen harry eyes widened as he saw his mother talking with madame pomfrey and the elder weasley great he thought it my mum he told hermione i better face her now than later at least she cantyell at me here or she ll awaken the others blowing out a breath he walked around the screen to meet his fate lily was now sitting on the bed beside that of rose watching her daughter sleep to his surprise his mother didnt glare furiously at him but patted the space beside her indicating he should sit there when harry warily sat beside her he was further surprised by the fierce hug she gave him that rivaled the one mrs weasley had given him earlier in dumbledore office harry gratefully accepted the hug which lasted longer than usual finally lily released her son and drew back looking shrewdly at him what am i ever going to do with you she asked last year it was saving that stone and this year it was saving your sister best friend you have quite a penchant for getting in trouble to save others harry i know mum harry said i just couldntstand there and do nothing you probably heard from dad that lockhart was going to make a run for it instead of trying to save ginny i had to try to help she my friend too aside from being my best friend sister and my sister best friend lily shook her head i cant really blame you your sister actions show it probably genetic considering your parents defied the dark lord thrice and have dangerous jobs harry raised an eyebrow mum i know being an auror is dangerous but your job cantbe as dangerous i mean researching new spells isntthat dangerous lily raised an eyebrow of her own i ll have you know harry that that includes experimenting with the new spell once its worked out it can be a tad dangerous like the weasley twins experiments for their pranks oh harry said well i guess that makes sense to test the new spells now we ll talk about what you did tonight another time lily said for now you need to rest she helped harry into the bed and under the covers sleep well darling she bent down to kiss him on the cheek mum please not in front of the weasleys harry whined sleepily after a few moments he was fast asleep his dreams now mixed with visions of a pale freckled face framed by flaming red hair a n i had to cut this chapter into two parts as it was getting too long the dialogue just keep growing i couldntget the characters to shut up the next chapter will finish year 2 and extend to the summer between harry year 2 and 3 dontexpect the plotline of prisoner for obvious reasons just wait and see what happens disclaimer i dontown harry potter the characters or the universe of hp except for rose a n merry christmas to all sorry for the long delay but i got sick right after posting the last chapter i had to check in the hospital for a few days but i much better now then the hecticness of the holiday season came up and interfered with my writing anyway here the next chapter it shorter than the rest as i wanted to post it before christmas enjoy and stay tuned for the next chapter chapter 18 end of another schoolyear the next morning harry hermione and rose were allowed out of the hospital wing in time for breakfast ginny on the other hand had to remain for a few more days to rest the other three spent a few minutes reassuring her that they would be back to visit later the potter and the weasley adults had spent the night in the hospital wing at their children side lily and james left after making their children promise to keep out of trouble for the remaining days of the term arthur and molly returned to ginny bedside after a quick breakfast harry hermione and rose ascended to gryffindor tower to change clothes harry was surprised to find ron still in their dormitory hey ron harry said why arentyou down at breakfast yet i wanted to wait for you and hermione harry ron said and i haventthanked you yet for saving my sister he suddenly pulled harry into a hug reminiscent of his mother s pounding him on the back harry was surprised at first but returned the hug and pounded ron back a couple of times you re welcome ron harry said after ron let go remember she my friend too almost like another sister he grinned at ron yeah i know ron said also grinning just so you know rose is like a sister to me too speaking of sisters just what did you say to hermione last night harry asked raising one eyebrow she seemed put out by it ron turned red as his hair well um i just wanted to tease her i mean she brilliant and everything but she can be a bit intimidating with what she knows i thought it would be fun to point out to her that there someone who can be her match in class well she didnttake that comment about fibbing very well harry said you should apologize to her and say you didntmean that you re right i didntmean that ron said i ll tell her i sorry where is she still in the hospital wing nope she just changing in her dorm we can meet her and rose in a bit harry changed quickly and the two boys descended the stairs to the common room just as hermione and rose were about to step out of the portrait hole there you two are rose said we thought you had already left for the great hall nope sis harry i was just explaining something to ron he then nudged ron and shook his head toward hermione ron approached hermione with trepidation um hermione i sorry for saying you were lying about being the first to think that the monster in the chamber was a basilisk i didntmean it you re the smartest person i know it just gets a bit intimidating sometimes hermione looked shrewdly at ron for a moment before smiling a little okay ron i forgive you then she pulled out her wand and pointed it at ron face but dontyou ever accuse me of lying again ron gulped and said n n never again right he scowled at the smirks on harry and rose faces the four gryffindors left the tower and headed down for breakfast when they entered the great hall the noise caused by the gathered students suddenly dissipated as they walked toward the gryffindor table the interrupted conversations resumed the four sat down with relief and ron immediately began piling his plate with food harry had sat down beside neville he turned to his fellow gryffindor second year neville thanks for helping my sister get to the hospital wing last night neville cheeks turned a little pink think nothing of it harry i was glad to help he leaned over to whisper to harry it just one marauder helping another we take care of our own right thanks just the same harry said it a pity we haventhad time for one last prank what with exams and all he turned his attention to the food barely noticing that rose was very intent on her own plate a few minutes later professor dumbledore rose to his feet and called for the students attention my dear students as you may have heard last night one of your number was abducted by the monster in the chamber of secrets well i have the pleasure to tell you that that student is safe and sound and the monster destroyed through the selfless actions of two of your peers while i cannot name the student abducted or the ones who saved her rest assured they will be well rewarded with plaques for special services to the school in addition i have two more announcements since the events of the past month connected with the chamber have been quite troubling to all and have probably affected your concentration on your studies all exams are hereby cancelled as are classes for today you will all relax instead and prepare for a spectacular feast that will be held tonight to celebrate the rescue and the monster demise now enjoy your day the entire hall erupted in cheers and applause except for where hermione was as she was getting upset over not having to do the exams anymore harry and ron joined the cheering students clapping each other backs fred and george appeared beside the two each placing a hand on harry shoulder harry we heard from mum and dad fred said what you did for ginny and we just wanted to say george continued they suddenly pulled harry into a hug thank you harry felt a bit embarrassed at this unfamiliar show of affection from the twins but he awkwardly patted their backs as he mumbled it okay the students soon left the great hall to enjoy the day harry and his friends spent the rest of the morning visiting ginny in the hospital wing no one brought up the chamber or what had happened the night before harry sensed ginny relief at that but he wondered why he could feel it after lunch they allowed ginny to sleep as she was still tired from her ordeal the feast that night was a very satisfying one as the food was even better than the usual fare there was a bit of tension in the air as the students seemed to realize that it was a perfect opportunity for a prank from the new marauders however harry had told the others that he wanted the students to celebrate the end of the threat of the chamber in peace so the night passed without any untoward incidents the bonus of this was that the student body was not prepared for what happened a few days later during the leaving feast ginny was finally out of the hospital wing and looked quite happy seated between rose and hermione anyone who knew the identities of the new marauders would have realized that this fact was as good a reason for the group of pranksters to celebrate as the fact that it was the eve of summer vacation the evening looked normal enough as the students began eating the wonderful feast in front of them however about an hour after the feast had started things started to happen in the slytherin side of the great hall first their entire table was replaced by a stage then the students of slytherin house all changed a third of them turned into clowns and began to jump around and juggle balls another third changed into acrobats and started tumbling and performing tricks on a set of seesaws and a trampoline finally the remaining slytherins including draco malfoy and his two cronies turned into ballet dancers and started doing pirouettes and splits the rest of the students were hooting with laughter and clapping their hands at the slytherins antics snape was repeatedly waving his wand around trying to restore the slytherins to normal but nothing he tried helped finally he simply sat back down in disgust a scowl on his face the rest of the professors tried to keep quiet but failed to keep silent or hold their laughter finally the slytherins finished their routines with a flourish and stood still their faces red with embarrassment when they found that they could move freely the whole house ran out of the great hall the laughter and applause of the other students ringing in their ears snape glowered at the griffindor table for a full minute before rising from his seat intent on following his students then with a puff of smoke his clothes changed to a pink ballerina outfit while his face acquired the look of a clown he looked down at his new look then raised his head high and solemnly walked out of the hall which had become quiet at the sight of the potions master change the silence hung in the air for a good two minutes after snape had left before being broken by a loud outburst of laughter this was followed by applause and cheering as another sign magically appeared above the hall entrance reading a farewell performance from the new marauders enjoy the summer the students remaining in the hall then resumed eating harry and his friends exchanged grins the biggest one on ginny face it seemed a good way to end the term a few days later harry was sitting at the writing desk by his bedroom window laboring over his transfiguration homework he glanced out the window in the garden below his sister and ginny were seated on the grass talking harry was glad that the girls relationship seemed to have recovered from the events of that dreadful night yet somehow harry felt that ginny wasntcompletely back to her cheerful and mischievous self to him her smiles seemed somewhat forced at times he wondered if rose had noticed this as he pondered this he heard a knock on his door his father opened the door without waiting for an invitation to enter and let himself and lily in they sat on the edge of harry bed facing him harry ignored them and kept his back to them as he resumed concentrating on his homework finally lily said harry please dontignore us we arentpunishing you for saving ginny we just wish you had gone to an adult for help like lockhart harry asked his back still turned to them well maybe not him james said when harry didntanswer him he said please turn around and face us harry harry sighed and dropped his quill he turned around to face his parents come on dad who would we have gone to as far as we knew dumbledore was gone we heard mcgonagall tell lockhart to go rescue ginny we didntknow she was just getting rid of him before calling you we were desperate after the attack on hermione the thought of ginny the same way or worse dying well we just sort of panicked just the same son you should know you could have counted on me james said nothing would keep me from helping my kids or their friends he placed his hand on harry shoulder i would die for you harry looked down and gulped i know you would dad he then looked up at his father i would too for anyone i care about james and lily glanced at each other after an uncomfortable silence james said well you were lucky this time son i know dad if it wasntfor fawkes i dontthink ginny or i would have gotten out of that chamber alive yes that probably true james said look harry we didnt come up here simply to talk about what happened you see it become clear to us that you may find yourself in this kind of situation again in the future and i think you should be better able to handle things so i ve come up with a summer project to help you while away the time once you are done with your summer assignments what sort of project dad harry asked his eyes narrowing well james said looking warily at lily i think you should learn a bit more of spellwork than you d get at hogwarts you mean like the spells aurors use harry asked his eyes widening yes some of that james said also you should learn a bit of self defense the muggle way which means some of the martial arts we aurors learn them as part of our training i think it ll do you good harry grinned that brilliant dad i d like that a lot james grinned back i thought you would dad harry said can you also teach my friends at least the martial arts bit i sure they could use it james looked thoughtful for a moment all right harry i guess ron and hermione can join you when we do martial arts in fact i think its best if rose also learned self defense um how about ginny harry asked his ears heating up a bit james raised an eyebrow while looking at him his mother just grinned at him a twinkle in her eye well sure james said if rose learns self defense i guess she ll insist her best friend also learn i ll talk to arthur and molly about it clear it with them harry smiled thanks dad it wontbe a boring summer after all james laughed no it won t though i have to warn you i wontpull any punches i expect you to work hard i going to treat you like one of our auror recruits harry gulped he d seen a bit of how his father worked the recruits his mother looked like she was struggling to keep from laughing his parents then got up from the bed and went out through the door james looked back at harry before he closed the door and said we ll start tomorrow we ll be using the duel practice room harry could have sworn he saw a twinkle in his father eye just before the door closed harry stared at the door for several minutes as he thought about the room his father had mentioned that room on the third floor was one of the few rooms of potter manor he had never entered his father and his uncle sirius sometimes used it to train but harry and rose had been told not to enter it when they were using it harry had always wondered what was in it the prospect of seeing it for the first time elicited both excitement and dread in him grinning at the thought of learning things from his father harry turned back to finish his homework harry potter and the twists of fate disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter 1 first time to hogwart september 1 1991 come on dad hurry up the black haired boy cried over his shoulder his almond shaped green eyes sparkling with joy we have to get to the platform before the weasleys he was pushing a trolley with a trunk and a birdcage containing a white owl in it slow down son his father said hurrying up to the boy i sure we ll be there before them father and son looked almost alike including the messy black hair and glasses they both wore except that the father had hazel eyes and if you watched the boy forehead a lightning shaped scar could be seen behind his front bangs yes harry the red haired woman walking beside the man said laughter in her voice i think we ll be early enough i dontsee why you re so eager you just saw ron yesterday her eyes were the same color and shape as the boy s she was holding hands with a small girl who had brown eyes and the same hair as the woman yes especially since it isnt even 10 yet the man muttered to her really lily it just seems too early now james the woman said lowering her voice so their son couldnthear them you know why we re this early by now the press knows that harry is going off to hogwarts for the first time all that boy who lived and boy who beat you know who business is hard on him you know how he hates all that attention remember the time we were at diagon alley when he was three james grimaced yes i remember the poor little tyke all those people crowding around him all the flashbulbs from those reporters he was scared to leave his room for a whole month i guess he too excited now to realize the press may be here so its good if we re here early soon the four people who were the potters came up to the barrier between platforms 9 and 10 now remember son the man said take a run at the wall and you ll go through just make sure there are no muggles looking all right dad harry said looking around seeing no one paying attention to them he moved quickly at a run and passed right through the wall i wish i was going too mum the girl said to her mother as they watched her father follow her brother now rose you know you re not of age yet lily said it just another year anyway you have ginny to play with all year and next year the two of you will join your brothers rose face lit up in a smile as she remembered her best friend and fellow red head lily then coaxed her daughter with her through the barrier once through they saw harry gazing in awe at the red hogwart express the train also amazed rose go on son james said find a compartment for you and your friends i ll help you with your trunk james then did a levitation charm on the trunk and pushed it slowly towards the train following his son harry soon found a compartment near the end of the train and leaned out the window waving to his parents and sister then as more people starting filling the platform he sat down and moved his bangs to cover his scar several reporters soon spotted harry family especially his father who was head auror of the department of magical law enforcement of the ministry of magic they practically ran over each other in their hurry to reach them mr potter how does harry feel about going to hogwart s mr potter do you expect him to do well are you expecting special treatment for him as he is the boy who lived where is your son anyway is he on the train james did his best to fend off the questions by answering them quickly while harry scrunched down in his seat so they wouldntsee him on the train he wished the weasleys would arrive so he could spend time with ron they had known each other since they were a year old spending weekends and summers in each other house harry loved the burrow as much as potter manor his father ancestral home in spite of a more than adequate income due to his job as deputy minister for muggle affairs arthur weasley kept his family in his old family home that looked like it was held up only by magic because of his mother being muggleborn he and his sister had learned about muggle science and gadgets they had 2 televisions a refrigerator stereos radios and other electrical appliances they ve gone to concerts of the weird sisters and duran duran watched quidditch and cricket matches in the same week and been to both wizarding and muggle places in america europe and africa often with the weasleys then he heard molly weasley voice there they are arthur come along ron harry raised his head just enough to peer out just above the window bottom he saw the weasleys greet his parents he saw his sister enthusiastically hugging ginny weasley looking like sisters rather than just best friends harry smirked like peas in a pod those two were he wondered how it would be next year when the two girls joined them at hogwart s should be fun seeing how vibrant and energetic they both were and both good at quidditch as the boys had learned that summer then harry saw his freckle faced best friend peer around his parents apparently looking for him harry grinned at the sight of the redhead already his mother height psst ron over here he whispered to him ron saw him and slowly edged away from the crowd of reporters then he climbed aboard the train and hurried to harry compartment when ron reached it he plopped himself into the seat across from harry can you believe the circus out there harry he asked harry all of them looking for a glimpse of the boy who lived it a good thing your parents and mine are there to deflect their attention you said it ron harry said grimacing and scrunching down again in his seat there are times i hate being me all that fuss just because of something that happened years ago when i was in nappies after all this time you d think they d forgot about it i mean they ve seen me from time to time over the past ten years yeah well that reporters for you ron said anything for a story dontworry mate he put a hand on harry shoulder it ll blow over once we re in school if anyone bothers you there i ll handle it thanks mate harry said smiling now i remember why i keep you around hey ron exclaimed indignation on his face they soon starting talking about hogwart and what to expect there based on what ron brothers and their parents had told them they were particularly apprehensive about the sorting fred and george ron twin older brothers who were entering their third year had told them several wild stories of how students were sorted into the four different houses ranging from having to fight a troll to trying to perform some magic a few minutes later the twins came into the compartment hello harry fred said or was it george hello wonnykins the other twin said ron face grew red in indignation dontcall me that george now now ronald fred said we were just teasing yeah lighten up little bro george said are you two ready for your first year fred asked harry and ron grinned at the twins of course we are they answered together harry we were wondering now that you ll be in hogwart s we d like to you to consider starting a new generation of marauders fred said yeah after all those stories your dad and sirius have told us we d love to start a new foursome in pranking george said we couldntdo it before since only perfect percy was there with us it ll be worse now that he a prefect fred said hogwart is so dull sometimes it needs some laughs and livening up i dontknow guys harry said dad would like nothing more than to see a new generation of marauders sirius too even remus would be pleased but mum had a talk with me last night and she forbade me to get into any trouble with pranks please harry the twins pleaded showing him their sad puppy dog look which often broke down their mother resolve all right all right harry said i ll think about it but if we get caught i blaming the two of you he could see ron grinning out of the corner of his eye yeah the twins high fived each other then said goodbye to the two younger boys soon the train whistle blew announcing its departure harry and ron now climbed up to the window and waved goodbye to their parents and sisters the reporters upon seeing harry rushed towards the train but failed to get near it as they pulled out of the station harry looked back the last thing he saw were two redheaded girls running after the train until they reached the end of the platform waving frantically at them harry shook his head in wonder at their enthusiasm he realized he would miss them even if they were often exasperating as the express wound its way north the boys settled down to a game of wizard chess after ron beat harry for the third time they switched to exploding snap when the lunch trolley came they bought themselves a large amount of food and candy as they were eating the compartment door opened in the doorway stood a boy with white blonde hair flanked by two larger boys who looked rather dull so it true then the blonde said harry potter is going to hogwart s harry scowled he had heard of this boy or rather his father he was draco malfoy whose father lucius malfoy was said to be a follower of voldemort but he had claimed to be under the imperius curse at that time so he wasntcharged that frustrated harry dad no end what of it malfoy he asked the blonde i just another boy going to school oh you ll never be just another school boy potter draco sneered after what you did to the dark lord how can you be just ordinary harry glared at him is that all you want to gawk at the bloody boy who lived like any fawning fan no potter draco said i was wondering if you d rather associate with those of similar status and history as your family than some upstarts he gazed at ron ron stood up his face red with anger harry held him back as he said no thanks malfoy dont forget that i a halfblood because of my mother i would have thought that would put you off associating with me just when malfoy was about to answer back a voice said what going on here harry and ron saw percy behind malfoy goons malfoy saw the prefect badge pinned prominently on the older boy robes he scowled and said this isntover potter he then turned around and headed down the corridor followed by the two larger boys what was that about harry ron percy asked them nothing perce harry answered just a social call it okay well all right percy said looking unconvinced he closed the compartment door the boys were silent for a while then went back to playing exploding snap as the sun started to go down their compartment door again opened this time a girl with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth stood in the doorway have any of you seen a frog anywhere she asked in a bossy tone a boy named neville seems to have lost it umm no we haven t harry answered the girl looked at harry for a moment then exclaimed you re harry potter i heard you were aboard this train i ve read about you in who who in the magical world modern magical history and great wizarding events of the twentieth century she stuck out her hand i hermione granger harry shook her hand gingerly she then looked at ron and you are ron weasley ron replied harry and i have been best friends since we were babies charmed hermione said but she didntoffer her hand to be shaken you boys better change into your hogwarts robes she said we ll be arriving soon she moved to leave then turned back to ron by the way you have some dirt on your face did you know that she then went out the door closing behind her ron wiped at his face then looked at his hand finding nothing on it he said bonkers that one the two boys then got into their hogwart robes soon the train slowed to a stop beside an open station as the two boys got out they heard a booming voice irst years firs years this way follow me all irst years they saw a towering man with a great beard gesturing towards himself harry grinned and ran towards him hagrid ron followed more slowly the man beard moved and crinkles appeared around his eyes signifying a smile harry you re here at last oh ello ron you guys ready for hogwart s harry grin widened hagrid had been a constant visitor to potter manor since harry could remember he had a soft spot for the gentle kind hearted giant as he hugged hagrid harry hand encountered a hard lump that seemed to be in one of hagrid pockets hagrid what have you got in your pocket hagrid seemed to frown from the movement of his beard never you mind harry that official hogwart business canttell you i was at gringott today on an errand for dumbledore oops i shouldnthave said that come along now best move on harry frowned slightly as he followed hagrid towards what appeared to be a lake and a lot of small boats he wondered what business would drag hagrid to gringott and why it seemed to be a secret later that night harry lay on his new four poster bed just as big and grand as his bed back in potter manor it had been an interesting night he remembered the awe he felt when he first saw the castle from the lake he knew that his companions on the boat ron hermione granger and the boy who had lost the frog neville longbottom had been just as awe struck the sorting had been better than he had imagined with the sorting done by a beaten up old wizard hat he had been shocked when the hat offered to place him in slytherin especially after hearing it place malfoy in that house he was glad that he had made it place him in gryffindor his dad would be proud not to mention sirius the welcoming feast was brilliant with the food rivalling anything that had been served at potter manor or the burrow not that he would say that to his mum or mrs weasley he looked around the first year dormitory at the four other beds ron was asleep in the bed to his right snoring like always his other three roommates were neville longbottom who was a bit pudgy seamus finnegan who was irish and dean thomas a dark skinned boy already he felt a bond with them though not yet as deep as he had with ron yes he couldntwait for morning to come so he could see more of hogwart s chapter 19 summer training and a surprise announcement disclaimer the only things i own in this story are the original characters like rose a n whew i back i sorry for the delay but the christmas season was hectic then i kept on revising this chapter anyway hope you enjoy it protego harry shouted conjuring a shield that blocked the tickling charm his father had just cast on him causing it to bounce back that good harry james said smiling as he dodged the spell which hit the far wall it was friday afternoon in the last week of july and harry birthday was the next day for the past three weeks james had been forcing harry to wake up at dawn daily and jog 2 laps around their property which was about five miles around this was followed by a half hour of pushups sit ups and other calisthenics at first harry could barely walk after the exercises but after four days his body had adjusted to the exertion after a shower and breakfast james and harry moved to the duel practice room where they were now it was a large room on the third floor about forty feet by thirty feet in size with a slate floor covered in mattresses the walls were stone like the rest of the house but reinforced with wards to absorb spell damage they spent the morning practicing spellwork james had been teaching harry advanced spells including the shield charm rose was seated near the wall watching them with interest though she kept glancing at her watch harry knew she was counting the minutes and hours waiting for ron and ginny to floo over after lunch for the last week the two youngest weasleys had flooed over for the afternoon to learn muggle martial arts together with harry and rose under sirius tutelage james had spoken to arthur and molly weasley and convinced them to let their two youngest children learn these things the four children had been ecstatic about it though ron less so due to the amount of work it required however molly refused to let her children learn any of the auror spells james was teaching harry and rose much to ron and ginny disappointment harry decided that that wouldntstop him from teaching his best friends the spells knowing his father would not mind hermione granger wasntwith the group yet much to harry and ron disappointment as she was still travelling with her parents there was a soft pop behind him followed by a high pitched voice master james mistress lily wants you and the children to know that lunch is ready thank you blinky james said turning around to face the house elf please tell lily that we will be down shortly all right kids he said it time for lunch when sirius ron and ginny get here maybe the four of you can practice the judo and aikido moves against each other harry and rose grinned at each other eager to try the moves their father had taught them sirius arrived in time to eat and then james left for work after lunch an hour later ron and ginny came over knapsacks containing extra clothes and the traditional gi outfits slung over their shoulders harry felt the now familiar fluttering in his stomach he felt whenever he saw ginny as well as a feeling of excitement and nervousness apart from his own he turned to look at ginny and the feeling increased followed by a sense of wariness harry quickly looked away as ginny turned her head toward him the four kids and sirius changed into the white gi outfits and headed for the duel practice room sirius led them through the katas for an hour then called their attention all right kids sirius said you ve learned the basic motions and katas in judo aikido and karate now you four pair off harry with ron and rose with ginny face each other about five feet apart he watched the kids comply now bow to each other at the waist like this sirius demonstrated to them then assume the first defense position now try to strike your partner while blocking him or her using the hands only no feet dontput too much force in your attacks for now sirius watched the two pairs spar it became apparent after a few minutes that harry was faster than ron and managed to block most of the redhead strikes ginny and rose on the other hand seemed evenly matched blocking each other strikes harry soon noticed that when he looked at ginny he could get a feel of what she was going to do next it distracted him a couple of times and allowed ron to get a strike in he could also feel her elation when she managed to get past rose attempts to block her after a half hour of sparring sirius saw that both pairs were tiring however harry remained faster than ron whereas ginny and rose seemed equally tired right sirius said let take a break sit down over here in front of me once the four children were seated he continued okay you guys are doing good but you have to work on your endurance i ll suggest to james that you three join harry for his morning run and exercises sirius almost laughed at the expressions on their faces at his suggestion ron looked appalled at the idea while ginny and rose looked at each other and grinned dontworry ron harry said a smile on his face we ll start out slow it only slightly more strenuous than flying in quidditch he grinned at his godfather attempts to hold his laughter in at least we get a breeze while flying harry ron said we re just going to get all sweaty being july and all bloody hell ron language ginny and rose said almost simultaneously ron looked at the two in mock horror you two have been spending too much time around hermione why ronald rose asked do you miss her harry could feel a sense of amusement from ginny as he glanced at her ron cheeks turned pink um er well of course she my friend harry snickered then just grinned when ron turned a baleful eye on him all right sirius said an amused tone in his voice i think that enough rest let resume the sparring okay same partners in the evening after refreshing showers the four children flooed over to longbottom manor to attend a birthday party for neville they exited the fireplace in a large spacious living room decorated in red and gold it seemed as cozy as the living room in potter manor hey neville happy birthday harry said as he saw his friend come into the room to greet them ron and ginny joined his greeting while rose seemed to mumble hers thanks guys neville said a wide grin on his face harry thought he saw neville face turn a little pink but couldntbe sure as he turned to greet neville parents who were right behind their son then harry noticed a girl with long brown hair peeking from behind mr longbottom legs oh neville said turning around to look behind him you haventmet my sister yet come on maggie say hello he turned back to them this is margaret ann maggie for short she ten and will be going to hogwarts next year she was visiting some of our relatives in america last year so she wasnthere then for that joint party harry and i had then he then introduced his four friends to maggie who shyly nodded her head at them ginny and rose rushed over to the girl and ron and harry said hi to her harry felt a feeling of glee at finding a younger girl to make friends with another feeling that wasnthis own they then proceeded outside to the garden where the rest of the guests like dean seamus lavander brown and the patil twins were already enjoying the party as the sun set over all it was a great party and it was almost eleven when the potter and weasley siblings went their separate ways home full and tired later harry lay on his bed mulling the foreign feelings and thoughts he had been feeling for most of the summer as well as the strange feeling in his stomach whenever he saw ginny what happening to me are these strange feelings i ve been getting coming from ginny why could i sense what moves she was going to do against rose right before she did them am i reading her mind do i fancy her harry finally fell asleep after a couple of hours still with no answers when he woke up a few hours later he saw that the sun was just rising he glanced at his closet door and saw the calendar hanging there seeing the date he grinned as he remembered that it was his birthday and his father had given the four kids the day off to celebrate he quickly got up remembering the wake up call his sister had given him the year before he did his morning ablutions in the bathroom and changed from his pajamas before running down a chorus of happy birthdays greeted him when he passed into the kitchen his parents and sister were there with the house elves holding another huge birthday cake this one lit up with thirteen candles a wide grin formed on harry face as he relished the fact that he was now a teenager almost a man just four years more to coming of age in the wizarding world harry stammered his thanks as he sat down at the kitchen table still in awe of being thirteen then rose ran up to him a mischievous smile on her face happy thirteenth birthday big brother she said as she laid a kiss on his cheek harry eyes grew wide while his cheeks turned red his sister hadntkissed him since he was six then his eyes narrowed in suspicion she seemed to be in a good mood in spite of the fact that she hadntstarted his birthday with a prank like last year or did she the second that thought left his brain he noticed some sort of white powder on the table under his hands then he felt himself change shrinking in size and growing feathers white feathers and a beak he was now looking up at the table from the edge of the chair he had been sitting on then he heard his mother shout rose lily potter what have you done to your brother on his birthday of all days rose merely smirked and said in an innocent voice what mum oh dontworry birthday boy will change back in a while cantlet him have all the fun today can i his mother simply glared at rose then at his father as james was clearly holding his laughter in with his hand jammed in his mouth sure enough after a few seconds harry feathers and beak fell off and he grew back to his old size harry just shook his head a small smile on his face unwilling to let the prank ruin his good mood or day the family then settled to a good breakfast while lily placed a preserving charm on the cake for later after breakfast harry and rose watched some saturday morning cartoons on the television for an hour and then went into the back for some aerial tag on their brooms neither ron nor ginny put in an appearance by lunchtime and harry and rose assumed that the weasley siblings had slept late due to their late night out at longbottom manor they knew that those two were not morning persons true enough ron and ginny came by the floo two hours later they greeted harry enthusiastically and harry felt warmth on his face and ears and flutterings in his stomach when ginny gave him a peck on the cheek harry felt a wave of embarrassment and concern which was separate from his feelings along with a stray thought wondering what possessed me to do that whoa he thought that definitely was not me to distract himself harry challenged ron to a game of wizard chess unfortunately the girls decided to watch causing harry to lose more spectacularly than usual ron just smirked as he prepared the board for another game after losing two more times in less than 30 minutes harry decided it was time to go flying the two pairs of siblings then played two on two quidditch with brother sister teams instead of the usual same sex teams of previous years they then found that ginny skill was slightly better than rose s while ron was definitely worse than harry as a seeker the weasley siblings were able to keep a slight lead over the potter children even when harry was getting stray thoughts of ginny planned moves harry had a feeling that she was anticipating some of his own moves about an hour into the game neville arrived by the floo with his sister maggie who harry had invited followed almost instantly by hermione neville introduced maggie to hermione who was glad to have another girl in the group they then settled down to watch the game while sitting on the chairs on the porch the four players stopped their game once the weasleys reached a score of 200 though the potters were not far behind with 190 points ginny had scored the last point by stealing the quaffle from harry rose scowled at her brother who could feel a wave of amusement coming from the other red haired girl harry then talked to neville and hermione about joining them in martial arts training which the two agreed to on the condition that they got their parents permission soon the other weasleys arrived along with sirius remus neville parents dean seamus lavender the patil twins oliver wood angelina johnson katie bell and alicia spinnet dinner was held in the garden on a long table afterwards they had harry cake and some ice cream harry then got to open the presents he had gotten he loved all of his presents especially the dragonhide arm holster for his wand that his parents and sister had given him and one from the weasleys he had gotten a feeling of apprehension and worry when he had started to unwrap the gift from his red haired friends followed by a feeling of relief when he grinned and thanked the weasleys for the new broom compass the evening ended with everyone feeling contented and happy the following monday ron rose and ginny joined harry for the morning run and exercises to make it easy for the other three james had them do only 1 lap around their property at the end of the five mile run harry hadnt even felt warmed up he was surprised that ginny and rose were not too tired ron however was on his hands and knees james allowed them to rest for ten minutes before having them do pushups sit ups and other exercises ron and ginny joined them for breakfast then flooed home to freshen up and attend to some chores around the burrow after lunch they returned for their martial arts training and neville and hermione who had gotten their parents permission joined them maggie longbottom came along to watch the two newcomers paid much attention to the instruction provided by sirius and their friends by the following week hermione and neville had learned enough to allow all six children to spar with each other even the boys against the girls sirius allowed them to use all the moves he had taught them harry noticed that whenever he and ginny sparred with each other each could barely get past the other blocks as if they could anticipate the other move whenever they made eye contact he could feel her feelings and hear her thoughts more clearly like another voice in his head it seemed both of them quickly looked away whenever that happened unfortunately hermione turned out to be the slowest and least skilled during their sparring sessions which was a bit upsetting to her surprisingly it was ron who helped her usually pairing up with her and praising her when she managed to block his strikes harry didntmiss the slight reddening of his friends ears during these times ginny birthday was again celebrated in the burrow with a great lunch party aside from the weasleys and potters other invited guests included hermione neville and his sister colin creevey a couple of ginny dormmates melinda pipper and lisa mcdougal and a girl in ginny year in ravenclaw luna lovegood harry discovered that luna lived nearby with her father a widower who ran the tabloid the quibbler he had heard of it sometimes being scoffed at by his father for its tendency to print stories of mythical beasts they also discovered that luna had a tendency to make odd pronouncements and statements as they learned during the party colin had prevailed upon the party guests to have a picture taken after they had eaten and the only seat left for harry to take was on ginny right side harry had ducked his head while sitting down to hide the blush that had appeared on his face after the picture was taken luna approached him and ginny and said in a dreamy voice you know the two of you make a good couple photographically speaking maybe in other ways too harry felt his ears heat up and he quickly got up saying that he wanted to challenge ron to a chess game he felt a wave of annoyance and sadness behind him as he moved away harry avoided being in close proximity to ginny for the rest of the party even when she opened her gifts when the gift harry and rose had given her was revealed to be a diary harry felt a wave of alarm and fear from her harry felt his heart constrict it had been his idea to get the diary for her a muggle diary with a lock to prevent unwanted intrusion as a way to help her get over the last term problems rose who was beside her whispered something to her ginny looked up at him and smiled mouthing a thank you to him he felt his ears and face burning as he felt her gratitude he smiled back and mouthed a you re welcome harry enjoyed the feeling of happiness and joy that he then felt from her he didntmind the fluttering in his stomach then he noticed the looks of mischief on fred and george face as they looked between him and ginny he didntwant to think about what they might do of course he was sure ginny would give her a taste of her infamous bat bogey hex if they got out of hand the other party guests soon left including harry parents leaving harry rose hermione neville and maggie who had all been invited to dinner they talked with ginny ron and the twins about the coming term quidditch and their training for the rest of the evening james allowed kids the day off the following day and let them enjoy themselves even maggie came over they played quidditch and even few muggle games like tag their hogwarts letters arrived two days later as they sat down to breakfast rose took the letters from the school owls giving them a bit of bacon she gave harry his before opening hers james looked over at his son so harry what elective subjects are you taking this term harry had harry looked back at his father well dad um i decided to take care of magical creatures ancient runes and divination why are you taking divination his mother asked raising an eyebrow harry knew she thought it was all rubbish she had said so last term when he had written to ask for advice on his electives because ron taking it too rose answered before harry could in fact he chose subjects ron was taking also hey harry glared at her we re only sharing two subjects he taking muggle studies while i taking ancient runes rose merely smirked back harry turned back to his parents noting the scowl on his mother face of course his father was smirking like his daughter harry lily said that not a good reason for choosing an elective you have to choose what you would be interested in harry sighed i know that mum it just that we werentexactly given enough time to think about it plus with what was going on at that time next year subjects wasnta topic of high priority lily pursed her lips as she realized what harry meant anyway harry continued nothing much interests me aside from dada and charms the important stuff is what i need to be an auror he looked quickly at his father james had a look of pride on his face he turned to his wife come on lils lay off the kid remember i took divination too until fifth year lily simply stared at james with a look that said we ll talk about it later harry and rose looked at each other in puzzlement at their mother reaction they shrugged and started to eat as they scanned their letters for the list of books they needed after lunch their friends arrived and they discussed the coming term and the subjects they would be taking as they sparred the following weekend the potters and weasleys went to diagon alley to get their school supplies they were surprised to see no sign of the malfoys for which they were glad considering what had happened the previous year however harry saw a glimpse of worry on his father face the next week harry noticed his mum looked a little sick whenever they sat down for breakfast in fact she hurriedly left the table for the loo on several occasions he asked his dad about it but james remarked that she may be just having the flu then as they sat down to dinner a couple of days before rose birthday harry and rose noted that their mother seemed happier than usual after they had eaten lily stood up and looked at her children and husband with a big smile on her face you ve all noticed how i seemed out of sorts the last few days she said well i went to st mungo earlier today and saw healer bradshaw our family healer what did he say james said a look of concern on his face well he said that what i feel is natural for someone in my condition she said smiling at her husband what condition is that james asked harry and rose felt apprehensive as they waited for their mother to answer lily grinned then said i pregnant a n so how was that i didntput too much description in the martial arts part as it would make it a lot longer and i haventdone anything like that in years i decided to put the family reactions in the next chapter which will include the start of harry third year please review thanks for reading chapter 20 start of term disclaimer i dontown harry potter or anything associated with it except the characters i have created like rose potter and maggie longbottom flashback to the last chapter lily said i pregnant the other three potters stood around in shock for a moment then rose squealed and ran up to hug her mother james stood up with a dazed expression on his face harry leaned back in his chair stunned by the news james walked up to his wife and put his arms around her shoulders as rose stood back he looked in her eyes and asked really we re having another baby lily looked up at her husband with a smile and said yes james after all these years we get to have another little one harry face then broke into a grin as he thought i going to have another sister or better yet a brother he then moved up to his parents and together with his sister hugged them after a few seconds james said hey wait a minute you better sit down love harry rose let your mother sit he pulled lily back to the table and into a chair now you just sit there lils he said dontdo a thing blinky and the others will take care of everything why dontyou put up your feet he started to move off to the living room i ll get you that stool in there to put your feet up on lily started laughing james james stop i only a month pregnant i not tired rose smirked as she watched her father fussing over her mother she turned to lily was he like this when you had me or harry mum her father stopped whatever he was doing to glare at his daughter oh yes lily said a twinkle in her eye the minute he found out i was pregnant with either of you he insisted i stop work and stay home she turned to james smiling come on now darling relax we still have eight months of this you ll tire yourself out before me sit back and let just eat james sighed and sat back in his chair then he grinned i going to be a father hey rose and harry said at the same time you re already one the following day rose and harry told their friends as they came over for the last session of martial arts training for the summer ginny and hermione were ecstatic at the prospect of a new baby so harry neville asked do you know if it going to be a boy or girl nope harry said dad said it was too early maybe they ll try to find out in another month or two i hope it a boy mate ron said that ll even out the numbers there are just too many girls lately hey there are not the three girls yelled at him neville and harry just shook their heads at ron lack of tact sirius was quite happy when he was told of lily pregnancy while he and the kids were getting warmed up for their session he had always told james that two kids wasntenough and that he and lily were still young enough to try he told harry that he and remus would probably compete for the honor of being the godfather of the new potter child when he or she was born later harry was able to avoid pairing up with ginny for sparring he hadntyet figured out what was going on between him and his sister best friend best friend sister he was somewhat looking forward to going back to hogwarts since it would be easier to avoid her there until he could understand what was happening he needed to talk it over with someone that night he knocked softly on the door of rose room upon hearing her say come in he entered the room and closed the door quickly rose was on her bed leaning against the headboard while reading a book looking up she raised an eyebrow on seeing her brother what up bro she asked him she glanced at her clock it still to early to wish me happy birthday harry sat down beside her on the bed sis i ve got to talk to you about something something that has to do with me and ginny rose put her book down and sat up fully facing harry what is it harry she raised an eyebrow donttell me you two are dating already there was an amused tone in her voice no that not it he replied he took a deep breath then let it out ever since we got to dumbledore office after getting out of the chamber i ve felt feelings that werentmy own i ve noticed those times were when i was with ginny during those two weeks i was grounded i d sometimes watch you two playing in the grounds and i could feel some sadness and nervousness that slowly gave way to joy especially as i watched her laugh rose eyes widened what do you mean by that harry can you sense her emotions harry sighed again and looked down at the floor i dontknow sis maybe i can it could be more than that ever since we started sparring i could sense what she was going to do when we play quidditch i ve had an inkling of where she was going and what she was going to do with the quaffle if that was so harry rose asked then why cantyou and ron beat the two of us i dontknow harry said there were times when she seemed to be doing the same to me lately whenever our eyes meet i get a stronger feeling of her and even sense what she sees have you told anyone else like mum or dad rose asked her eyes going wider no harry said they might get mad think i a freak or worse a pervert rose placed a hand on one of harry s no they won t harry she said but they will try to help you figure out what going on harry sighed a third time no not just yet i want to figure this out on my own for now okay i just needed to tell someone like you my sister and her best friend just dontyou freak out on me rose sighed all right bro i wonttell anyone yet but you better tell her i will eventually harry said dontlook at me like that i need to wait for the right time i dontwant her to hate me for it he got up to leave all right harry rose said tell me if anything else happens okay harry paused at the open door okay sis good night and happy birthday then he left and closed the door rose looked at the door for a few moments then she sighed a slight smile on her lips no brother mine i dontthink she ll ever hate you as he headed for his room he felt relieved that he had told someone about what had been bothering him all summer the realization that he was feeling some of ginny weasley emotions had appalled and frightened him at first but when he felt her happy it just seemed to make him happy after the events of the past term he was glad she was better still the few times he had felt her feeling sad and tense had also made him sad he marveled that she had held out against tom riddle manipulations for a while whereas quirrell had succumbed almost immediately of course he couldnt tell rose that he realized that he did fancy ginny nope not until he told ginny herself as to when he would well he wasntsure yet maybe in a few years rose celebrated her birthday with a lunch party the next day all their friends were invited including melinda lisa luna and colin the food was great they played some muggle party games and board games rose loved the many gifts she got like a new magical plant from neville and his sister a wand holster of her own from sirius and remus and new clothes from ginny and the weasleys but she especially loved the one she got from harry and their parents a new broom a nimbus 2001 harry felt a little jealous over his sister new broom but laughed as he watched her zoom around above their backyard whooping with joy he was surprised when he only felt happiness and contentment from ginny as she shadowed her best friend on her own broom a cleansweep 8 which was handed down to her from the twins later that night as they sat down to dinner harry decided to bring up something that he had been wondering about dad how do i continue with my training while i at hogwarts james looked over at his son well the running and exercise is easy all you have to do is get up early like 5am just take a lap around black lake then do the calisthenics you should have enough time afterwards for a shower before breakfast harry nodded he was already used to getting up early he looked at rose who nodded to him harry smiled he knew she d join him and get their friends to continue their martial arts practice maybe they could do that during the weekends now as to your spell training james continued i ve already spoken to professor dumbledore about it your new defense against the dark arts teacher will take over for that since it may arouse suspicion if i drop by hogwarts every week at any rate with your mum pregnant i cant be far from home for long james ignored the glare that lily was giving him they ve had several discussions already on his overprotective attitude new dada teacher rose asked who is it anyone should be better than lockhart james grinned oh you ve got that right anyway i dontwant to spoil the surprise you both will see tomorrow he refused to say anything more and they started eating later lily made sure that harry and rose were fully packed before they went to bed as she wanted to leave early for king cross station the next day harry drifted off to sleep almost as soon as his head hit his pillow the potters got to the station and platform nine and three quarters with plenty of time to spare harry and rose got a compartment near the end of the train and waited for the weasleys and hermione to arrive greeting their other classmates and friends in the meantime hermione arrived first bringing her trunk and her new cat crookshanks rose had commented the first time that they saw it in diagon alley that it looked strange for a cat ginny had suggested that it may have kneazle blood looking out the window harry saw draco malfoy walking toward the train in his usual arrogant manner harry noticed that draco was accompanied only by his mother narcissa he thought it strange that lucius malfoy wasntseeing his son off then he saw a smaller boy walking behind narcissa looking younger than draco he had the same blonde hair as draco yet he walked despondently with none of the arrogant air as older boy the boy face had enough similarity to draco to suggest that they were related great harry thought another malfoy at hogwarts he better stay away from me and my friends harry refrained from saying anything to rose or hermione the weasleys arrived a few minutes to eleven rushing to the train the twins said hello to them before moving off to find their classmates percy sat with them for a few minutes his chest puffing out to show off the head boy badge pinned there thankfully he excused himself after seeing harry and rose werentimpressed i bet he gone off to find penny ginny said giggling penny harry asked her giggles sent his stomach into somersaults penelope clearwater rose answered she was the um ravenclaw prefect who got attacked with hermione she looked askance at ginny and hermione the two didntbat an eyelash at her referring to the events last term harry however felt a momentary stiffening of ginny which passed quickly why would he go look for her harry asked more to draw the conversation away from those painful events than out of real curiosity she his girlfriend ginny said giggling again i once caught them in an empty classroom snogging he been writing her all summer eww ron said hermione rolled her eyes at him do fred and george know harry asked smirking not yet ginny said i haventtold them yet i was trying to decide whether i can use the threat of telling them against percy that way we can get him to back off whenever we pull off pranks harry was impressed percy had been suspicious when they pulled that prank during the leaving feast glaring at him and ron he realized that the twins would find ways to torment their older brother and his girlfriend percy would do anything to avoid that even let the new marauders alone to do their pranks harry grinned at ginny good thinking ginny i believe this year will be a good one for the new marauders we just have to be careful about snape he probably suspects us but cantprove anything he felt the joy in ginny over his approval of her truth be told he in turn felt happy about making her happy not minding the fluttering in his stomach as he watched her face light up with a smile a little while later the door to their compartment opened harry pulled his wand out expecting draco and his cronies but was surprised with whom he saw at the door remus he cried what are you doing here remus lupin smiled i your new defense against the dark arts professor really rose asked when remus nodded she leaped up and enveloped him in a hug she seldom saw her godfather and was quite fond of him then a worried look shadowed her face she looked up at him and whispered but what about your condition oh that remus said softly dontworry about it professor dumbledore has that covered there ll be someone covering for me during the full moon at this comment hermione ron and ginny turned and looked at harry a questioning look on their faces harry just shrugged his shoulders then his eyes met ginny just as the word and image of a werewolf crossed his mind she gasped but didntsay a thing ginny looked back at remus then moved backwards in her seat only harry seemed to notice a frown forming on his face did she read my mind remus chatted with them for a few more minutes before excusing himself to return to the teacher compartment as soon as he left hermione turned to rose and said what was that about the full moon rose sighed and turned to harry harry waved his hand at her giving her permission to speak he waved his wand to cast a silencing charm around their compartment one of the spells his father had taught him this summer all right you three she said what i say here doesntleave this compartment dontsay anything to anyone not even fred and george not a word okay the two weasleys and hermione nodded their heads uncle remus is a werewolf she said sighing at the looks of horror on ron and hermione faces she noticed that ginny didntreact at all it not his fault he was bitten when he was very young even before he started at hogwarts do your parents know ron asked shakily of course rose answered he one of their best friends they knew about it when they were studying at hogwarts they told us three years ago we didnttell you lot then since we saw no point in it you d never meet him during a full moon he locks himself in a house somewhere on those nights i guess professor dumbledore arranged something to keep him safe during the full moon wicked ron said imagine being friends with a werewolf while at hogwarts you dontknow the half of it ron harry thought he hadntbrought up the fact that his father and sirius were animagi and why they were animagi rose hadnteither james had told them about it at the same time that he had told them about remus right now harry didntthink it important for his friends to know about that and it seemed so did rose neville joined them in the compartment an hour later and the six friends spent the rest of the trip chatting and playing around harry allowed himself to be trounced by ron in wizard chess twice they also played several rounds of exploding snap hermione revealed that she was taking four of the electives divination care of magical creatures arithmancy and ancient runes harry was glad to have her in all three of his classes but wondered how she could cope with so many subjects the train pulled into hogsmeade station on time they managed to fit in a carriage with little difficulty though the tight fit caused harry to press closely on ginny causing them both to blush rose smirked at this but didnt say anything they soon arrived at the castle and headed for the great hall taking seats near each other at the gryffindor table harry rose and ginny on one side neville ron and hermione across from them harry barely listened to the sorting ceremony until he heard a certain name malfoy tiberius augustus professor mcgonagall called out what ron said another malfoy looks enough like him to be his brother rose said i bet he as arrogant as draco i dontthink so ginny said look at him he looks almost scared he smaller and thinner than draco was at that age harry could see she was right ron snorted hermione glared at him i agree with ginny hermione said he not as sure of himself as draco ron snorted again one malfoy is the same as another harry watched as the blonde boy sat apprehensively on the stool and professor mcgonagall placed the sorting hat on his head a full minute passed and the students started to get restless harry saw that draco was frowning harry remembered that the hat had sorted draco into slytherin almost as soon as it had touched the blonde boy head then the sorting hat shouted out gryffindor the whole hall was suddenly silent a n tada a malfoy in gryffindor the world is ending heheh what do you think then harry has told someone about what he getting from ginny and thinks he fancies her where will it go please review chapter 21 befriending a malfoy disclaimer i dontown harry potter or anything associated with it except the characters i have created like rose potter and maggie longbottom a n here the next chapter sorry for the wait enjoy in the silence that followed the sorting of a malfoy into gryffindor you could hear a pin drop no one moved most especially the boy on the sorting stool the boy named tiberius augustus malfoy finally mcgonagall removed the sorting hat from the blonde boy head and pushed him not too gently in the direction of his new house table harry noted that the assistant headmistress mouth was set tightly into a thin line tiberius walked slowly to the gryffindor table like someone walking down death row everyone stared at him harry felt a wave of sympathy for the boy remembering how it felt when the other students had stared at him during his own sorting tiberius finally reached the end of the gryffindor table his apprehension and nervousness apparent on his face the students sitting at that end moved over leaving a wide space where tiberius finally sat down in a good five feet separated him from the other students harry looked over at the slytherin table draco looked furious and was openly glaring at the new gryffindor who looked back with fear in his eyes professor mcgonagall resumed the sorting which ended with warren irma being sorted into ravenclaw dumbledore then stood up and smiled welcome to another year at hogwarts dumbledore began i sure the returning students are looking forward to another year of fun learning and experiencing for the new first years i hope you will find learning here fascinating and exciting now a few announcements we have two new additions to our staff this year first we have a new defense against the dark arts professor remus j lupin who i enticed away from the ministry for the position remus stood up and acknowledged the applause which was loudest coming from the gryffindor table the weasley twins cheered wildly and whistled thank you for your enthusiasm and good luck professor lupin dumbledore said beaming now professor ashton our old care of magical creatures professor decided to retire after he had that accident with the flesh eating slugs at the end of the last term so i am pleased to say that our own rubeus hagrid has agreed to take the position good luck to you professor wild applause again greeted this announcement especially from harry and his friends rose and ginny joined fred and george in their whistling even percy was applauding hagrid grinned as he stood up to acknowledge the applause shaking the head table and knocking several glasses on their sides however harry noticed that malfoy and several other slytherins didnt applaud which he felt did not bode well for his large friend thank you again dumbledore said now on to other announcements he gave the usual speech about the forbidden forest and filch finally he said tuck in food immediately appeared on the tables and the students started eating harry exchanged a look with rose then the siblings got up and moved towards tiberius malfoy who looked uncertain and uneasy the blonde boy eyes widened as he looked at harry and probably saw his scar he moved back in the bench away from harry harry inwardly sighed but put a smile on his face and stuck out his hand hi welcome to gryffindor he said your name tiberius right i harry potter tiberius looked at harry hand warily and slowly took it in his own and shook it once yes tiberius augustus malfoy he said his voice lacking the arrogant tone that was always in draco voice i know who you are draco been ranting about you since you two first met he hates your guts harry shook his head as he sat down beside the younger boy well i guess the feeling is mutual but i wontlet that affect what i think of you at least until we get to know each other you re his brother then tiberius sighed yeah his younger brother you dontseem too fond of that rose said sitting down on the opposite side of the blonde boy oh harry said to tiberius smiling this is my annoying yet lovable younger sister rose lily rose this is tiberius augustus malfoy rose scowled at harry then smiled sweetly before shaking hands with tiberius harry noticed that tiberius had smiled slightly at this well he said looking at rose i not fond of being draco younger brother he always teased me and pushed me around just because i dontlike the things father talks about you know all the pureblood and anti muggle nonsense harry never thought he d see the day he d hear a malfoy call their underlying beliefs nonsense he could like this boy well rose said you dont have to worry about that here you re a gryffindor now your brother wouldntdare try something especially with us around come on let not let this feast go to waste she turned around and starting piling food on her plate harry saw tiberius stare at her for a while and then he followed her example and began placing food on his plate harry also began to eat after a while harry looked back to where he had been sitting and at his friends hermione looked back at him and nodded ron on the other hand had a scowl on his face as he stuffed food into his mouth when harry looked at ginny he could feel pride and understanding coming from her as she smiled at him harry smiled back and then went back to eating and talking with tiberius he found out that tiberius loved quidditch and was a fairly good player of wizard chess tiberius was also looking forward to attending hogwarts though he had been apprehensive of being in slytherin at the end of the feast tiberius said shyly thanks harry i thought i d be ignored and picked on in gryffindor because of my family you re welcome tiberius harry said i glad you donthave the same beliefs as your family so am i harry tiberius said you can call me ti i think tiberius is just too formal i never actually liked it harry smiled sure ti i think that people will like you once they find out you re nothing like your brother you know i think sirius would love to meet you i sure he d be thrilled to know someone else in his family isnt attracted to the dark side rose giggled you re right harry uncle sirius will definitely enjoy meeting ti ti eyes widened you mean sirius black the auror i ve heard a bit about him over the years i know he my mother cousin do you think i can meet him harry smiled i think that can be arranged i ll ask professor dumbledore about it you better go and join the other first years ti or you may get lost on the way to our common room ti smiled and joined the other first years as they were led to their common rooms harry saw his friends standing off to one side of the staircase to gryffindor tower waiting for him and rose ron was still scowling harry sighed but smiled when he saw ginny smiling at him hey guys harry said thanks for waiting up but i dontthink we would have gotten lost fred and george laughed that quite funny harry they said the new marauders headed for gryffindor tower just as they reached the portrait of the fat lady ron stopped and turned to face harry why d you do that harry ron asked why d you talk to that little git he a malfoy his name is tiberius ron rose said he may be a malfoy but he no draco rose is right ron harry said he nothing like his brother how do you know that harry ron asked now glaring at harry from just talking to him one time for one thing hermione interrupted he a gryffindor now that doesntprove anything ron insisted he pulled off some trick or something on that hat maybe used some dark magic ronald hermione said you canttrick the sorting hat and you cantcast dark magic here with professor dumbledore right there in front well he did something hermione ron said there no way a malfoy can end up in gryffindor why not ron harry said i almost ended up in slytherin the others except for rose and ginny looked at harry in shock you re just saying that harry ron said his voice shaking a bit no ron harry said the sorting hat tried to put me in slytherin but placed me in gryffindor because i asked it not to put me in slytherin i didntrealize you can tell the sorting hat where to put you hermione said no hermione rose said you canttell it where to place you but just where you dontwant to be hermione and ron looked at rose it tried to place you in slytherin too didntit hermione asked rose nodded yeah it was about to but i said no way was i going there so it placed me in gryffindor i guess it thought i was brave for daring to contradict it maybe that why it placed ti in gryffindor harry said he may have asked it not to put him with his brother ti fred asked harry smiled sheepishly it what he wants to be called he thinks tiberius is too formal fred and george exchanged glances we like this kid maybe he ll be willing to join us and prank his brother i d like to see that too neville said grinning ron glared at them no way i dontthink so there no way he joining us that not your decision ron ginny said it harry s remember that we chose him as leader of our merry band fine ron said you lot go on and be a friend to a bloody malfoy i going to bed he said the password proud leos to the fat lady and practically ran into the common room and up the stairs to the boy dormitory harry sighed and entered the common room which was almost empty of students he said good night to the others and followed ron up to their dorm later that night ginny was brushing her hair just before going to bed she was also going through the events of the day she felt proud of harry and his willingness to give ti malfoy a chance without any influence of his feelings toward draco she had been able to hear bits of harry conversation with ti whenever she looked at harry and concentrated she had been mortified at first when she realized she could feel what harry was feeling and could read some of his thoughts especially if she concentrated hard enough lately she had been more accepting of this strange ability she found it also strange that it was only harry that she could read she felt a bit guilty when she used it against him whenever they sparred against each other in martial arts as she was musing over this rose came up to her hey gin she whispered i think we need to talk ginny raised an eyebrow but rose raised a hand in warning before ginny could say anything ginny allowed herself to be led to rose bed she waited while rose drew the curtains shut and cast a silencing charm like the one harry had cast earlier on the train now gin rose began back there on the train when i told the three of you about uncle remus being a werewolf you werentreally shocked or surprised i d like to know why ginny mind desperately searched for an suitable lie while she intelligently said um well ah i think you knew he was a werewolf because you read harry mind rose said ginny eyes widened how did she know that but how err how did you to ginny surprise rose giggled i guessed that was how you knew i bet you can feel what he feels too ginny felt her face heat up as she looked down at the bed sheets rose patted her hand dont worry gin i wonttell anyone for now so when did you first find out about this ginny looked thoughtful for a moment well looking back i think i first felt something that morning i woke up in the hospital wing i felt happier than i thought i would you know after all that happened that night i was a bit upset with it then i realized that it wasntreally my feelings then during the summer when i was coming over to your place i d occasionally get flashes of annoyance or irritation they d get stronger if i happened to glance up at harry window hmm rose said that interesting i did notice you glancing at his window once in a while when we were in the back i thought you were looking for a glimpse of him but kept myself from asking you ginny blushed well i did feel sorry for him i mean he saves my bloody life and gets grounded for two weeks i thought it quite unfair yeah i thought so too rose said but mum and dad said they grounded him only because he didnttry hard enough to get an adult to help anyway gin what happened when harry was let loose did you get better at feeling him it was random at first ginny said i couldntcontrol it one minute i felt only my own emotions then bang i d feel a whole set of different emotions after a while i got better at feeling him if i concentrated hard enough i could even feel him while i was home then when we started with the muggle martial arts i started getting more than emotions like random thoughts after a few days i could actually tell what he was going to do that how you were able to intercept the quaffle so well when we played on harry birthday rose said how about when the two of you were partnered during our sparring sessions were you also reading his thoughts ginny nodded a small smirk on her face i d say i gave him something to think about didnti i dontwant him to join my brothers in the protect ginny since she made of glass crowd i dontneed another overbearing protective brother oh i sure you did gin rose said smiling ginny wasntsure why she was smiling but didntdare ask we d better get some sleep rose we dontwant to be late for classes tomorrow we can talk some more about this some other time all right rose nodded still smiling at ginny shaking her head ginny got off rose bed and went to her own pulling the covers over her and was soon fast asleep much later that night harry was slowly moving through the corridors of hogwarts headed for the owlery hidden under his invisibility cloak he had written a letter to sirius about ti and couldntwait to get it to his godfather as he reached the steps up to the owlery harry heard the sound of movement coming from inside he carefully climbed the steps trying to be silent when he reached the top he saw another student tying a letter to a magnificent looking eagle owl his back turned to harry he noticed the student was male and had platinum blonde hair harry stepped into the shadows as the other boy released the large owl who flew off immediately the boy turned around and harry saw his face draco draco looked around then headed out the door of the owlery harry watched him go down the steps and disappear harry waited for several minutes making sure the slytherin boy didntcome back before he removed his cloak and called hedwig after attaching his letter to hedwig and instructing her to go to sirius he sent her off then he threw his cloak back on and headed back to gryffindor tower wondering all the way there as to why draco had sent a message out in the middle of the night the next day as harry entered the great hall for breakfast he noticed with sadness that ti was sitting at the far end of the gryffindor table separated from the rest of the first years by several feet harry said hello to ron hermione ginny and rose who were already sitting down in their usual places then ignoring ron scowl harry moved down the table and sat beside ti hi ti harry said mind if i sit here i need the company ti nodded with a shy smile on his face harry sat down on the end of the bench forcing ti to move closer to the other first years then rose and ginny sat down on ti other side with rose next to a brown haired first year boy hi rose said to the boy i rose potter you re albert dowley right she d paid more attention to the sorting than her brother the boy eyes widened for a while and then he said in a low voice yes that right pleased to meet you albert rose said she stuck out her hand which albert took gingerly and shook then rose waved one hand at ginny this is ginny weasley she said the boy shook hands with her too oh the boy on ginny other side is tiberius malfoy i sure you met him last night since he a first year like you i sure he wontmind if you call him ti since you ll be roommates for the next seven years rose said smiling at albert all the while albert looked warily at ti before nodding and saying hi ti um pleased to meet you the other three gryffindor first year boys had stopped eating as they watched the interaction between rose ti and albert rose asked them their names and then introduced ti to them making sure they at least greeted ti harry then introduced himself two of the boys albert and paul longshore had stunned looks on their faces as their eyes traveled for a second to harry scar harry ignored their stares and began talking to them occasionally drawing ti into the conversation through the topics harry used to talk to them they found out that albert and paul were halfbloods whose fathers worked for the ministry which meant that they had heard of the malfoys albert father was deputy minister for international games and sports while paul father was an auror the other two boys jake stone and bradley martin were muggleborns however albert and paul had told them a bit about the malfoys the previous night which made them nervous being near ti by the end of breakfast harry rose and ginny had made the four boys less wary of ti by showing him to be a shy and good natured boy the three older students were glad when the five boys walked together to their first class ti among them harry knew without looking at ginny that she shared his pleasure at helping ti with his dorm mates however ron didntshare that sentiment scowling at harry and leaving the great hall without so much as a hello hermione shook her head at the redhead attitude just as he and hermione were about to leave the great hall harry heard a voice calling him he turned around to see remus lupin hurrying towards him harry told hermione to go on ahead while he talked to the new professor when the older man reached him harry grinned and said good morning professor are you ready for your first day on the job remus grinned back oh i think so the question is are you ready for what i have in store for you harry laughed oh i hope so harry i saw what you did with the younger malfoy that was very kind of you considering the animosity your fathers share i know professor i just felt it was the right thing to do mum once told me that you shouldntjudge a child for what his parent does i decided i would judge him on his own merits that very good harry lily would be proud of you harry grinned oh by the way i thought that sirius would want to meet ti that the nickname he wants to be called by what do you think i already sent him a letter by owl remus looked thoughtful for a moment then he smiled hmm that a good idea harry being narcissa son sirius would be an uncle to ti knowing each other may be good for the two of them let me know what sirius says okay harry smiled sure thing professor you better head for class harry i wouldntwant to make you late as to ti i think you should go on making friends with him of course professor harry said see you over the next few days as professor lupin advised harry rose ginny hermione and neville would make it a point to greet ti and the other gryffindor first years and talk to them for a while ron however refused to do that on monday afternoon as the gryffindor and hufflepuff third years came into the entrance hall on their way in from herbology harry saw the back of a man with long silver hair dressed in stylish robes and holding a stylish cane lucius malfoy he seemed headed for the headmaster office harry had a bad feeling as to the reason why the elder malfoy was at hogwarts sure enough at dinner mcgonagall approached ti at the gryffindor table her lips a thin line on her face mister malfoy their head of house said please follow me to the headmaster office ti gulped stood up and followed mcgonagall out of the great hall harry and his friends except ron exchanged worried glances harry glanced over at the slytherin table and noted that draco had a smirk on his face finally unable to withstand the suspense harry got up and headed for the doors he wasntsurprised when hermione rose ginny and neville joined him as he reached main staircase when they reached the gargoyle guarding the stairs to dumbledore office harry suddenly remembered that none of them knew the password just then the stairs started to move harry and the others just had time to stand aside when lucius malfoy came striding out a furious expression on his face the man glared at harry and his friends you had something to do with this potter he said his face reddening this isnt over no son of mine will be a filthy gryffindor he stalked off at a furious pace harry and the others watched him leave then turned back to the stairs which had started moving again this time mcgonagall and ti were the ones on it harry and his friends breathed a sigh of relief mcgonagall raised an eyebrow when she saw the students at the base of the stairs well mr malfoy i think your fellow gryffindors can help you back to the common room with that she left them harry turned to ti and was surprised to see him with tears in his eyes hey he said softly placing an arm gently on ti shoulder what wrong what happened please i dont want to talk about it ti said i want to go to bed he then started walking rapidly the others exchanged worried glances again but no one said anything they hurried to catch up to ti and the group walked up to gryffindor tower in silence as soon as they entered the common room ti rushed up the stairs to his dormitory leaving the others bewildered and confused wow rose said what ever happened in dumbledore office must have been really bad maybe we should leave him alone for now hermione suggested maybe harry said at any rate i going to find out what happened tomorrow from mcgonagall or dumbledore the others agreed though hermione did with reluctance and they went their separate ways to their dormitory harry found ron already asleep when he got to his bed he was glad for that as he didntwant to face ron anger over being concerned for a malfoy the next day harry hurriedly ate his breakfast so he would have time to approach mcgonagall or dumbledore about ti he noticed that the younger malfoy was only picking his food barely eating anything harry rushed over to the teacher table as soon as he had finished he spotted dumbledore and mcgonagall there as soon as he was near the table mcgonagall saw him yes mr potter she asked what is it well professors he began we re concerned about ti he looked terrible last night after coming from professor dumbledore office me and my friends assumed his father had a talk with him and the headmaster mr malfoy looked very angry when he came down from the office he even thought we had something to do with ti being in gryffindor ti dumbledore asked oh i see interesting nickname he has chosen it better and warmer than tiberius there was that characteristic twinkle in his eye sir what happened in your office that upset ti harry asked ah harry dumbledore i afraid i canttell you without ti permission it is his story to tell though i can tell you that lucius was not pleased that his younger son was not in slytherin with his brother harry could sense a slight amusement in dumbledore voice i suggest you give him time to overcome his feelings harry then maybe he ll tell you for now just be as supportive of him as you and your friends have been the past few days harry eyebrows rose up a few inches in surprise as to the headmaster recognition of the efforts of his group in befriending ti all right sir harry said we ll do that later harry mood was improved when hedwig delivered a letter from sirius his godfather was happy to hear about a malfoy who wasntarrogant and obsessed with being pureblood sirius was willing to meet ti as soon as he had a break from his duties as an auror harry smiled he hoped this good news would cheer up ti a n so how d you guys like a good malfoy anyone surprised that harry would accept a malfoy like that as to lupin and hagrid being professors this is something from the books that i wontchange including what happens in their classes of course the days of the week where the classes are set will be different since i saw from the calendar of 1993 that september 1st was a wednesday if you check poa hagrid class happened on the first day of classes which would be september 2 which is a thursday on the calendar now after draco got beaten up by buckbeak the book says he only came back to classes on thursday morning that s what a whole week so i adjusting the days of the classes chapter 22 strange first lessons and hermione birthday surprise disclaimer i dontown harry potter or anything associated with it except the characters i have created like rose potter and maggie longbottom a n had to revise the chapter due to a couple of mistakes one with hagrid making ti a second year and the date of hermione birthday please read it again to see the changes unfortunately ti seemed less enthusiastic about meeting sirius as when harry had first given him the idea he did however agree to think about it harry was distracted from ti situation by his first classes in divination and care of magical creatures the divination teacher sibyl trelawney seemed to have picked him as the student this year that she would subject to predictions of dying his consolations were that hermione was not impressed with her and neither was mcgonagall he enjoyed hagrid lesson on hippogriffs especially when he got to fly on one of course the whole class was appalled when the hippogriff attacked draco malfoy who had approached the animal without bowing properly in respect harry elation that draco had to spend several days in the hospital wing was ruined by hagrid absence at dinnertime and the concern about lucius reaction to draco injury harry rose hermione ginny and ron snuck out after dinner to find out what happened to hagrid the two younger girls had already learned of the incident from harry they knocked on the door of hagrid hut a vaguely familiar voice told them to enter when harry pushed the door open he and his friends were surprised to see remus lupin seated on one end of a huge couch in front of hagrid who was seated in a huge armchair looking despondent and holding a huge pewter tankard ah hello kids remus said smiling i was wondering when you would show up it seems our friend here is in need of some cheering hello professors the five said simultaneously oh you donthave to call me that when we re alone remus said smiling come on in the five gryffindors entered the hut and tentatively approached hagrid harry felt his heart clench at the depressed face of hagrid rose and ginny then rushed forward and embraced hagrid tightly dontyou think about it hagrid rose said it wasntyour fault yeah ginny agreed that arrogant ass deserved what he got the other four nodded their heads vigorously agreeing with ginny now dontlet him or any of the other slytherins hear you say that ginny remus said chuckling well it true harry said draco should have listened to you hagrid we re witnesses to that we ll tell anyone who asks gee thanks you lot hagrid said sniffing i preciate it then he hugged the two redheaded girls hermione eyed the tankard in hagrid hand hagrid maybe you ve had enough to drink she took the tankard and went outside to empty it remus stood up and followed her thanks hermione i ve been trying to get him to stop drinking for about an hour now hermione beamed at remus hagrid then got up unsteadily well i guess she right he said he then headed outside too the four students still in the hut heard a loud splash when hermione came back inside harry asked her what d he do he stuck his head in this huge barrel of water she answered hagrid came back inside with his hair and beard very wet remus at his heels thanks all of yeh for comin ta see me he said i really am thankful fer yer support think nothing of it hagrid remus said sitting on the couch again the five students then sat down as hagrid sat again in his armchair so how malfoy doing ron asked timidly oh madame pomfrey fixed him up as well as she could hagrid said he claims it still agony moaning and carryin on i pect she ll be keepin him fer a while in the hospital wing good harry said that keep him out of our hair for a while i know someone else who ll be glad not to see draco for a while rose said ginny giggled remus smiled i believe i know who you re talking about my dear goddaughter he turned to harry so how is ti doing they ignored the dark looks ron was giving them yeah harry hagrid said how is the younger malfoy i haventhad the first years yet so i kinda curious well harry began and they spend about an hour discussing the gryffindor malfoy and speculating on what happened in dumbledore office the previous night not even remus knew what had occurred there or if he did he didnt want to tell them yet when it was near curfew remus made the five students leave under his escort hagrid again thanked his five young friends for their support as they were walking through the corridors of the castle remus spoke up that was a good thing you guys did tonight he told them it was nothing remus harry said he been our friend for so long it would have been unthinkable not to show him our support i hope malfoy dad doesnttry to have him fired i dontthink so remus said especially since professor dumbledore pushed for his position quite forcefully with the minister of education i dontthink they want to tangle with him again that good to know rose said so harry ron hermione remus said smiling at them are you guys looking forward to your first defense lesson tomorrow harry grinned oh yes professor definitely hermione and ron nodded oh i sure you ll love it rose said beaming up at her godfather oh they probably will rose remus said though it wontbe the same lesson i gave you second years since they re third years they arrived at the fat lady portrait and remus bid them a good night the five friends entered the tower and went to bed the next day harry was pleasantly surprised to see ti sitting with the other first year gryffindors chatting while eating breakfast the younger boy seemed less nervous the third year gryffindors had dada after lunch excited for their first lesson remus greeted them warmly and informed them that it would be a practical lesson he showed them a large wardrobe cabinet and told them about the boggart inside it after a few questions about boggarts he taught them the ridikulus spell used against boggarts then asked them to line up one by one as they tried to repel the boggart the class laughed at things their classmates made the boggart do to elicit laughter then it was harry turn harry raised his wand as remus opened the cabinet door the boggart came out looking like his dad smiling at him harry was confused then the james boggart got hit by a greenish light and collapsed it stood up now looking like his mother who also collapsed after getting hit by a greenish light the boggart went through the same thing as rose and ginny before turning back to james and it started over again all this took place in a matter of seconds but harry froze unable to think remus stepped in front of harry and the boggart changed into a full moon that turned into a balloon after remus said the ridikulus spell harry vaguely heard remus dismiss the class then turn to him harry are you all right remus asked moving in front of him and placing a hand gently on his shoulder harry was now breathing rapidly his heart pounding in his chest he realized what the greenish light was the killing curse remus had explained to the class that the boggart shows one greatest fear is that my greatest fear losing my family or having them killed in front of me why is ginny there why isntron harry felt remus pull him gently back to the classroom desks and make him sit in one of them kneeling in front of him hermione and ron sat down on either side of him harry come on now remus said snap out of it harry looked to either side of him seeing the look of concern on hermione face and the confused look on ron s then he looked at remus and saw only compassion and understanding remus placed his hands on harry shoulder and squeezed gently hey come on harry relax it nothing to get panicked about seeing one family die is a fear all of us have i sure ron and hermione have that fear too harry looked at his best friends and they nodded slowly it true harry hermione said no one wants to see one of their family die yeah mate ron said slowly i d hate for anyone in my family to buy it even percy ron hermione said well it true hermione he said percy can be a real git sometimes but i dontwant him to die anytime soon harry had to smile at his friend loyalty to his family he felt the same way too even if rose sometimes got on his nerves see remus said there there the smile we all like to see all right you can rest here a while then head for your next class he handed harry a bit of chocolate eat this harry you ll feel better remus walked up to his office harry ate the sweet and did feel less agitated he glanced at his friends who smiled obviously glad he was feeling better after a few more minutes harry got up and told them that they could go outside they were surprised to find neville waiting for them you all right harry neville asked yeah neville harry said i was just shocked by what the boggart turned into i ve never thought about my parents or sister dying especially to the killing curse i know what you mean neville said when i was younger i always worried about my parents being aurors they sometimes go off on dangerous missions hunting for dark wizards yeah i guess i felt the same way about my dad harry said but i dontrecall having the same fear about my mother or sister thankfully none of his three friends mentioned the presence of ginny among his identified family hopefully they thought it was just a replay of rose unfortunately harry happened to glance at hermione and he thought that she had a knowing smile on her face harry steered the conversation away from that subject as they neared the charms classroom for their next class when he sat down to dinner at the gryffindor table harry was surprised to get hugs from rose and ginny harry dipped his head after ginny hug to hide the blush on his face rose explained that they heard about what had happened in remus class and they wanted to offer some comfort and support harry thanked them and realized that they did make him feel better draco returned to classes that thursday with his arm bandaged and in a sling oddly he didnt try to bring any attention to his injury all he d do was scowl and glare at his brother during mealtimes there were rumors that he had received a howler while in the hospital wing but no one not even madame pomfrey would confirm it the third sunday of the month was hermione 14th birthday the new marauders greeted her before they went on their early morning workout they promised to give her their presents that evening during breakfast dumbledore handed her a present from her parents along with a letter hermione opened the letter first the whole great hall was startled when she let out a shriek while reading it what wrong hermione harry said as he righted his glass of pumpkin juice that he had dropped in surprise at her yell harry grew alarmed at the tears he saw in her eyes hermione ron asked is it your parents hermione wiped her eyes then smiled in a way my mum said that she pregnant i not an only child anymore i going to have a sibling isnt that great she was grinning now wow that great hermione rose said her other friends agreed even dumbledore said it was wonderful so how far along is your mum ginny asked does she know if it ll be a boy or a girl well she said she about six weeks pregnant she wontknow what the baby sex is until another month or two when the ultrasound can show that ultrawhat ron asked confused it a muggle device ron hermione explained patiently it uses sound to see body organs how do you know that ron asked you seem to really know everything that because i read ron hermione said plus my mum explained it in her letter harry grinned amused with their antics he could see ginny and rose placing their hands in their mouths to stifle their laughter hermione was in a happy mood all day she allowed the new marauders to just relax around the lake with no mention of homework that evening the gryffindors held a party for hermione the twins managed to get some food and drinks from the kitchens along with a large cake remus and hagrid joined them for a while they were happy for hermione about her becoming an older sister ti was pulled into the celebrations by rose and ginny who took it upon themselves to act like older sisters to the boy hermione even got him to participate in a few party games the two redheads organized much to ron displeasure still ron refrained from saying anything that night the rest of september passed quickly after that ti was now fully accepted by the other gryffindors except by ron harry occasionally caught him and hermione bickering over the younger malfoy thankfully when ti was not around harry hoped his male best friend would get over his prejudice on the last saturday of september harry received an owl from sirius his godfather had arranged to meet ti on the first hogsmeade weekend which was on the weekend before halloween the news both excited and dismayed harry he was excited for sirius to meet his nephew but he was dismayed that he may miss going to hogsmeade for the first time he had gotten his parents permission to go now that he was a third year and had been looking forward to it after hearing all the twins stories about the village in the end harry decided that being there for ti when he met sirius was more important than harry enjoying a day in hogsmeade after all there would be other hogsmeade weekends he couldntwait to see his godfather again anyway a n i still tallying the readers preferences for the sex of the coming potter sibling chapter 23 when sirius met ti disclaimer i dontown harry potter or anything associated with it except the characters i have created like rose potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy the day of the first hogsmeade weekend was bright and cool in spite of the rain the previous night harry was excited to see sirius and both curious and nervous over his meeting ti in addition he had quidditch practice at 3 that afternoon since their first match would be the following saturday the day before halloween sirius had agreed to apparate to hogsmeade then walk to hogwarts for his meeting with ti in dumbledore office an hour before lunch ti looked equally nervous barely eating anything at breakfast harry and rose kept reassuring him that it would be fine and that he would like sirius hermione and ginny were eating silently simply watching the potter siblings talk to ti ron on the other hand was ignoring them and talking to fred and george about hogsmeade and the shops there after a while hermione said i d still like to stay with you three while ti and sirius talk harry nah harry you should see hogsmeade and its sights hermione especially the bookstore we ll be fine here these two are still mad they cantgo there yet he added waving at the two redhead second years rose eyes flashed i think it unfair allowing only third years and above to go to hogsmeade we re not little children who cant behave harry smirked oh come on sis i know you d like to see sirius again maybe he got a few new judo moves to show us rose pouted for a while then she smiled all right big brother you caught me i d like to see uncle sirius again it been more than a month ginny giggled harry could feel her amusement at her best friend antics and again felt the gurgling in his stomach that had nothing to do with hunger as he heard her laugh for the past few weeks he d been spending more time with the two redheads as hermione and ron often got into a row over ron treatment of ti over that time harry sensing of ginny emotions and thoughts had gotten stronger this proved a little distracting in class as he occasionally felt her even if he was in another part of the castle he d then discovered that he could tune out her thoughts if he concentrated hard enough finally fred and george got up from the table fred said well it time to go george added filch should be standing in the courtyard to check out everyone permission form fred said so come on ron george said ron got up and moved to follow the twins then he stopped and turned around come on hermione hermione looked at harry who mouthed go on at her hermione sighed and got up from the table she whispered good luck to ti before following ron rose and ginny finally forced ti to eat more than toast the four gryffindors then moved to the quidditch pitch to while the time away ginny had managed to borrow fred broom for ti who had left his broom at home in malfoy manor they decided to play two on two with rose and harry against ginny and ti the three older gryffindors found ti a much better player than his older brother the two pairs were evenly matched harry and ginny seemed to anticipate each other though ginny was a better chaser than harry while rose skills compensated for harry and ti slower broom handicapped their side the score was tied by the time it came to the time they had to meet sirius the four kids then change quickly ginny and rose accompanied ti to dumbledore office while harry walked to the gates to meet sirius sirius harry shouted when he saw his godfather striding up the path from hogsmeade he ran up to the older man harry sirius said hugging his godson how are you so cissy came up with a son who not his father son cissy harry asked astounded that narcissa malfoy nickname only to me and your aunt andromeda sirius said grinning referring to his cousin andromeda black tonks who was also narcissa sister harry had met andromeda and her family four years ago when the potters had joined sirius for christmas he liked the muggleborn wizard ted tonks andromeda husband and their daughter nymphadora who had graduated from hogwarts years ago together with charlie weasley there was a time then that the two were dating but harry didntpay much attention to that harry laughed i dontknow if ti will find it funny anyway he seems okay loves quidditch isntan arrogant ass like draco and really wants to meet you well then come one sirius said let head for dumbledore office as they walked harry asked speaking of aunt andromeda how nymphadora in auror training dad doesntwant to talk about it first off harry sirius said grinning dontcall her nymphadora at least within her hearing i swear she one of the clumsiest witches i ve ever seen she nothing in stealth or tracking if she wasnta metamorphmagus she probably would have been removed from the program last summer as it is she already passed the first year of training we ll see in a couple of years harry grinned they talked about the gryffindor quidditch team dada and the training he and his friends were doing when they got to dumbledore office harry was surprised to find remus there standing with ginny rose and ti dumbledore wasntin the office what remus asked upon seeing the surprised look on harry face did you think i d miss this i seldom see sirius these days he smiled and shook hands with sirius harry grinned then turned to ti ti this is sirius black my godfather and your mother cousin sirius this is ti malfoy your cousin second son sirius approached the younger boy a smile on his face and extended his hand ti slowly grasped his hand and shook it a guarded expression on his face hello ti sirius said i pleased to meet you hi uncle sirius ti said a nervous tone in his voice i m um glad to meet you too now dontcall me that makes me too old sirius said grinning just sirius is fine okay unc uh sirius ti said why dontwe leave these two alone now remus said looking at harry ginny and rose ti looked at remus um i dontmind if they stay professor sirius is that okay with you remus asked it fine with me remus sirius said ti is used to these three imps by now so they can stay all right remus said conjuring a long sofa and a couple of armchairs let all get seated sirius and remus sat in one of the armchairs each rose made ti sit on the end of the sofa nearest sirius she then sat on the other end forcing harry to sit beside ginny between her and ti she noticed a faint blush appear on both their cheeks once they were all seated the room was silent for a few seconds finally remus said so ti how are you finding hogwarts um it not quite like i thought it would be professor ti said remus smiled you can call me remus ti when we are alone like this so how did you imagine hogwarts would be well all i knew about it was what draco told me he said that slytherin was the best house for us purebloods and no one got in their way he called the other houses pathetic and that only scum was sorted into them why that little git sirius said he just like his father he turned to ti did you know your father was seventh year when me remus and harry parents were first years no i didntknow that ti said well he was an arrogant ass already sirius said at least you didnttake after him ti so are you enjoying your classes made any friends yet in your year glad for the change in topic away from his father ti said well i like transfiguration and charms professor flitwick is funny and i managed to float my feather in the first lesson that great ti harry said i also did it in the first lesson as did hermione ron though couldntmanage it then how about your other classes ti sirius said how is snape treating you um i dontreally like potions we have it with the slytherins and professor snape likes to take points from gryffindor though he hasnttaken any from me yet in fact he hasntpaid me any attention harry eyebrows shot up to his hairline he exchanged a look with ginny and rose that real strange ti rose said he not one to ignore a gryffindor isnt he your brother godfather remus asked i think so uh remus ti said why i know what you re thinking remus sirius said i would have thought he d pick on ti considering he a malfoy who in gryffindor something like i was back when we were here thank merlin snivellus wasnta teacher then what do you mean ti asked a bit bewildered back then when you were here well sirius said your mother probably told you about the blacks being an old pureblood family right when ti nodded sirius continued well my family has always been in the dark arts and thus always been sorted into slytherin including your mum and aunt bellatrix sirius faced took out a sour expression as he remembered his deatheater cousin rotting in azkaban with her husband and brother in law then your aunt andromeda was sorted into ravenclaw that wasntso bad but then here i come along and get sorted into gryffindor your granduncle malfidus my late father was so angry but couldntdo anything about it he didnttry to have you resorted ti asked his voice a little shaky resorted remus asked that seldom done only under the most trying of circumstances usually when the student has been at hogwarts for a few years then harry realized something wait a minute ti was that why your father was here that day he wanted a resorting done is that why you were up in the headmaster office that evening ti fidgeted in his seat finally he looked down at the ground and nodded that arrogant bastard sirius said how dare he he even more a git that i thought well what did dumbledore do ti fidgeted again then said well the headmaster asked me if i was happy in gryffindor at first i wanted to say no with the way father was glaring at me then i thought of the people i ve met the other gryffindors like harry rose and ginny and my dormmates i mean after that time at breakfast on the first day of classes they started talking to me and we really hit it off he turned to harry and the two redhaired girls i haventthanked you guys for that he gave them a shy smile thanks a lot you re welcome ti harry said yeah think nothing of it ginny and rose said so what happened then sirius asked ti ti thought for a moment then said well i told the headmaster that i was fine in gryffindor that i liked it there father looked even more furious he started to shout saying that a malfoy in gryffindor was a disgrace he he said he didntwant his son contaminated by muggleloving blood traitors he demanded that the headmaster have a resorting of me tears were shining in ti eyes as he related his story the bastard sirius said so what did dumbledore do then he told father that there was no reason for a resorting to be done since i was quite happy in my current house then father shouted that that was not the end of it he then stormed out of the office yeah harry said that must have been when we were standing around at the bottom of the stairs to the headmaster office he came storming down all red and sputtering he even threatened me almost immediately harry regretted saying that what sirius said what did that slime ball say harry well he just said he thought i had something to do with ti being in gryffindor and said that that was not the end of the matter all right sirius said i thought he threatened to hex you he turned to ti look ti your situation is the same as mine when i entered hogwarts my parents were furious that i was in gryffindor when i got home at the end of the school year they threatened to pull me out of hogwarts and put me in durmstrang i had many rows with them and threatened to run away if they tried that that held them off until fifth year when they did try it what did you do ti asked well i carried out my threat i got some of my stuff and left the house we lived in harry grandparents and dad were kind enough to put me up in their home if it wasntfor them i dontknow what would have happened to me remus then looked at his watch hmm it time for lunch you can sit with the kids at the gryffindor table sirius most of the students are at hogsmeade anyway sure why not it ll give me more time to talk with ti sirius said he turned to harry what about you harry you still have time to go down to hogsmeade i saw ron and hermione down there when i apparated in nah harry said there ll be other hogsmeade weekends and i ve got quidditch practice later i d like to spend some time with you it been almost two months since we saw each other last rose is lucky since remus is here oh yeah right rose said he too busy teaching classes to see me everyday the four kids and two adults then headed for the great hall when they got there the students already there saw sirius and started whispering the noise died down as they approached one end of the gryffindor table sirius sat beside ti with harry on his other side ginny and rose sat across from them sirius continued talking to ti as they ate so you see ti i know what you re probably feeling but dontlet your family reactions affect you you re in gryffindor because of something the sorting hat saw in you that is stronger than ambition or the taint of the dark arts in your blood something nobler and better ti nodded weakly attempting to smile he continued eat slowly after a few minutes of silence sirius said harry said you like quidditch a lot so how good are you he quite good rose said we were playing while waiting for you sirius he d make a good chaser he and ginny made a good team against me and harry i know harry a great seeker but he not chaser material hey harry said i right here you know i know bro rose said smiling sweetly still i think you should stick to being a seeker you are great at it sirius smirked oh dontmind them ti they get like that sometimes it just part of the way they show their love for each other hey harry and rose said their cheeks now reddening harry could feel the amusement coming from ginny sirius then drew ti into a discussion of quidditch teams in the national league harry was amused and surprised to learn that ti liked the chuddley cannons maybe that would help them convince ron that ti wasntthe slimeball draco was after an enjoyable lunch the younger kids and sirius accompanied harry to the pitch to watch the gryffindor practice harry introduced oliver to his godfather once oliver found out that sirius had been a beater during his hogwarts days he started begging the former gryffindor for game winning tips which sirius gladly gave it was near dinnertime when sirius finally left he surprised ti by hugging him and saying that he hoped to come see him again soon harry and the others pretended not to notice when ti wiped the tears that had formed in his eyes the three older gryffindors smiled at this they knew that sirius got a bit lonely sometimes in spite of his playboy lifestyle all in all it was a good day for harry ti seemed to be warming up to sirius quidditch practice was very good even oliver wood hadnt been his usual manic obsessive self during practice harry looked forward to the game on the next saturday wanting to beat slytherin badly a n so how d you guys like this chapter please review i ll have the next chapter up by next week chapter 24 quidditch and halloween disclaimer i dontown a thing about this story except the characters i invented like rose potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy wood called for another round of practice the next day right after lunch at least we can sleep in since it a sunday harry thought unfortunately fred and george had other ideas someone jumping on his bed roused harry from an interesting dream where he was chasing a laughing red haired girl around the grounds he blearily opened one eye to see the blurred image of two tall redheads standing on his bed he groaned and lay back down come on harry one of them said wake up we want to do some planning before practice no lemme sleep harry said into his pillow you asked for it he heard someone say then he was suddenly drenched in very very cold water hey what d you do that for harry said sitting up soaking wet oh come come one twin said oh esteemed leader the other said donttell us that the first twin said you re too lazy to the second twin said plan a prank the first twin said harry heard several other people laughing and felt someone else amusement oh oh harry quickly reached for his glasses and put them on as the room swung into focus he noticed that ron and neville were hugging each other as they laughed uncontrollably over to his left side near the door hands to their mouths to stiffle their laughter were his sister and ginny and behind them was hermione glaring fiercely at the twins harry quickly pulled the bedcovers over himself as he had slept shirtless the night before he felt a blush creep up his cheeks hey you girls shouldntbe in here he said the three girls then smirked hey bro rose said there isntanything there i haventseen before ginny of course might be more interested ginny then quickly backed out after shooting a glare at her best friend harry could sense her embarrassment come on rose hermione said let just wait for them in the common room she closed the dorm door once they were through it harry glared at the twins you two are gonna get it he got out of bed and cast a drying charm on his bed picking out some jeans and a red short sleeved shirt he went to the bathroom for a quick shower he then dressed and descended to the common room the others were waiting for him in the empty common room the twins back was turned to him he took out a paper bag and snuck up to the twins he blew up the bag and popped it right behind them causing the twins to leap up at least six feet and tumble down in a heap of limbs all right you two harry said to the twins that for getting me wet now about this prank you wanted i assume it for halloween yup rose answered for the twins who were still picking themselves up glaring at harry all right guys let have some ideas harry said drawing them to sit around the fireplace they spent the rest of the morning planning then went to lunch after lunch he and the twins went off to practice where wood was his usual manic self when harry woke up monday morning he heard the rain falling against his window he hoped the weather would clear soon unfortunately it didn t in fact it got worse and worse so that by wednesday the wind was howling like a banshee it got even worse at lunch when oliver approached them i ve just been told that we ll be playing hufflepuff on saturday instead of slytherin oliver said angrily flint claims his seeker is still injured what harry said that a load of crap malfoy arm is fine now he doesnteven have it in a sling anymore i know harry i know oliver said he looked out towards the window i bet they just dontwant to play in this bloody kind of weather the rain and wind continued so that on saturday it was difficult to stay on a broom yet the match wasntcalled off as harry circled high above the pitch saturday morning he shivered in his thoroughly wet quidditch robes holding tightly to his broomstick lightning flashed through the sky every few minutes it was a good thing hermione had cast a charm on his glasses to keep it dry or he wouldnthave been able to see a thing harry hovered for a few seconds to watch angelina and katie make a spectacular goal he could barely hear the commentary from lee jordan over the howling wind he glanced up to see the hufflepuff seeker cedric diggory watching him he was a sixth year much larger than harry was which made him slower but his size gave him a greater reach harry hoped his broomstick would give him an edge harry heard a scream and turned back to the game he saw someone in red robes hurtling towards him their broom rear on fire from the screams he recognized alicia spinnet voice she turned away from him and plummeted straight down out of control harry hesitated for a second then plunged after her his nimbus speed allowed him to catch up with her he pulled alongside her and reached out grabbing the handle of alicia broom he steered it to the ground to the gryffindor side of the pitch allowing alicia to land safely thanks harry alicia said breathless and still shaking a bit by now the rain had extinguished the flames coming from the broom she looked up go on harry i fine now get back up there before oh too late potter a voice bellowed from above get back up here harry groaned he knew it was oliver wood who was shouting as he looked up their team captain was hovering in front of the goal posts his face red harry groaned again and guided his broom back up to the sky once he had gotten high up he looked around then he saw diggory streaking upward about twenty feet from him harry moved after him and saw that the hufflepuff seeker was indeed chasing the snitch harry pushed his broomstick forward willing it to go faster he drew closer to diggory he felt a sinking feeling as he saw the older boy closing in on the snitch harry threw himself flat on the broom as he got closer to diggory he watched with bated breath as the yellowclad seeker outstretched right hand neared the snitch then just as diggory hand came within a couple of inches of the snitch a bolt of electricity flashed between the snitch and diggory causing his hair to stand on end the hufflepuff somersaulted backwards away from the snitch and downwards harry caught a glimpse of the stunned look on the older boy face as he passed him harry didnthesitate but sped after the snitch harry moved after it weaving among the clouds he was now so high he couldntsee the pitch below then the snitch suddenly dove and harry dipped his broom to follow it soon he was vertical heading straight toward the ground gaining speed as he struggled to control the broom against the ever increasing wind the snitch swerved below him forcing harry to an even steeper angle almost upside down closer and closer he came to the snitch one foot then eleven inches eight inches five inches two inches half an inch then his hand was closing around the golden winged ball just as he was about to touch the ground he rolled upright and zoomed a little higher he lifted his hand to show the struggling golden ball as the crowd roared their approval then harry saw several red and yellow blurs hurtle toward him and they jumped on him knocking him off his broom they all fell the last few feet to the ground laughing and cheering as they got up muddy and dripping wet the team became awash with their supporters harry was hugged immediately by two female redheads ron and hermione looked on with a look of disgust and amusement respectively harry could see his parents in the back of the crowd waving his father grinning from ear to ear fred and george shouted party in the common room tonight above the noise of the crowd the crowd then started to disperse leaving the team and their closest friends that was a great move son james said grinning as he lily and remus approached the team thanks dad harry said grinning back he stepped back when lily tried to hug him mum please i all muddy he said and not in front of the team the last part in a low tone lily laughed and ruffled harry hair even if he was already as tall as she was the team hurried into the changing room to shower and change to clean clothes when they exited the changing rooms only the weasley siblings hermione lee jordan harry parents and sister and remus were left waiting they all headed back to the castle as they reached the front steps of the castle harry saw ti waiting shyly in the shadow of the doors hey ti he called to the younger boy come on over here ti slowly made his way down to him harry ignored the scowl on ron face as the younger malfoy neared them harry took ti by the arm and led him to his parents dad mum i d like to ti ti malfoy ti meet my mum and dad ti looked nervously at the potter parents then james smiled and clapped a hand on his shoulder i pleased to meet you ti james said sirius and harry have told me quite a bit about you i have to admit that i was a bit surprised and suspicious about a malfoy getting sorted into gryffindor i sure you know that your father and i have a bit of history since voldemort fall james and harry noticed ti flinch at the mention of voldemort name but james continued if my children and best mates think you re all right then i guess i can also james smiled again lily smiled at ti that right ti we trust our children judgement and choice of their friends and sirius is a difficult man to convince so we re glad to finally meet you gee thanks mr potter mrs potter ti said smiling shyly though i think my father wontbe pleased about me meeting you ti grinned after saying that james laughed no i dontthink he will harry parents talked to ti a bit about his experiences in hogwarts and quidditch for several minutes then james and lily bid goodbye to the kids and left after congratulating harry again for winning the game remus also took his leave of the kids who hurried off to the great hall for lunch after lunch harry managed to get the other new marauders together in an empty classroom and they finalized their plans for their prank for the next day rose kept an eye on the marauder map during their meeting to make sure they werentfound by any other students or the teachers they finished in time for dinner after dinner the gryffindors trooped back to their tower the common room was decorated with red and gold banners and there was a lot of food the twins seemed to have managed to get some butterbeer in music both wizarding and muggle blared into the air harry was gladdened by the sight of ti happily interacting with his other housemates who showed no animosity the party itself lasted until midnight when mcgonagall came in dressed in a tartan dressing robe demanding they get to bed as it was a sunday halloween started with a better breakfast than usual if there was such a thing in hogwarts in fact both breakfast and lunch were spectacular leaving the students groaning from their full stomachs and anticipating the feast in the evening harry and his friends didntgo on their usual morning run after breakfast they rested for a couple of hours then found an empty classroom to practice some martial arts harry still felt uncomfortable sparring with ginny and paired off with neville he did notice her glancing at him from time to time whenever their eyes met he felt heat creep up his cheeks and thought he saw her flush as well their martial arts prowess was increasing as a whole but harry found he had the fastest reflexes in the group followed by ginny rose neville ron and hermione naturally the boys had more power in their strikes but the girls were more flexible and had a greater range of moves available to them after lunch they went out to the grounds to play around and enjoy the day which was sunny a lot of the other students were there as well to enjoy the outdoors since more rain was expected as winter drew closer as the sun started to set harry and his friends slipped away from the grounds one by one few noticed them leave when it came time for the feast the whole school entered the great hall together they gazed with awe and amusement at the different decorations in the hall pumpkins larger than most of the students were in the middle of the tables scary faces carved into them bats flew around the hall real spider webs were strung along the ceiling from rafter to rafter platters and goblets made of gold and silver instead of the usual brass and tin were on the tables also empty for the present after the students had all taken their seats at their tables dumbledore stood up and said his usual halloween speech then came the words the students especially ron had been waiting for tuck in food immediately appeared on the tables in the previously empty serving platters the pitchers filled with pumpkin juice and water the students started helping themselves to the tremendous amount of food including the different sweets and chocolates harry ate slowly anticipation for what the new marauders had planned building in him his head was bent down but he was eyeing the slytherin table through his bangs he knew the others were excited to see what would happen if the feelings he was getting from ginny were a sample about an hour into the feast a cloud of smoke suddenly appeared covering the slytherin table when the smoke cleared all the slytherins from third year up were in the colors of the rainbow every part of their body was a different color as in their heads were purple one arm was red the other arm was green and so on the hall was filled with laughter as the other houses gawked at the sight the younger slytherins were just staring at their older housemates and glancing uncertainly around at the other houses harry and his friends joined in the laughter grinning at each other harry glanced at the head table noting that the teachers reacted just like they had on previous pranks dumbledore gazed on the sight calmly with his characteristic eye twinkle mcgonagall looked sternly on though a upward turn of one corner of her mouth betrayed her amusement flitwick and hagrid were laughing sprout and vector were smiling and snape was openly glaring at the gryffindor table most especially at harry finally unable to stand it the affected slytherins got up from their table and fled the hall snape went up to the slytherin table and told the rest of his house to follow their jinxed housemates he then followed them after glaring one final time at the gryffindors the laughter soon died down and the feast resumed harry and his fellow marauders grinned they didntcare to advertise their involvement this time figuring that the rest of the school would know who was responsible they had not included the first and second year slytherins since they didntwant to traumatize them as they werentas bad as their older housemates their prank was a great way to end a great weekend a n so how d you like the prank i got the idea from the fic harry potter and the secret sanctuary i d like to acknowledge the author of that fic as he has some nice pranks and i enjoy the story chapter 25 a couple of sirius visits disclaimer i dontown a thing about this story except the characters i invented like rose potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy after halloween november seemed to fly by quickly as it got colder and colder the third weekend of november was another hogsmeade weekend and this time harry went with ron hermione and neville rose and ginny pouted all through breakfast complaining about the unfairness of it well mostly it was rose ginny barely spoke but harry could sense the feelings of sadness and disappointment coming from her he tried to dampen his own feelings of excitement and anticipation so as she wouldntfeel more down the three took harry all around the village harry found it all interesting and stared at all the different buildings and businesses he decided to buy a lot of chocolate and candy at honeyduke for his sister and her cute best friend hey where did that thought come from harry thought he heard some giggling in the back of his mind along with a little heat harry gawked at all the different joke items in zonko and bought quite a few thinking of sharing it with rose and ginny as well then the gryffindor foursome headed into the three broomsticks and harry had his first butterbeer which he loved the second it touched his lips the four gryffindors had lunch there and continued their wandering around the village they soon ended up outside the shrieking shack and while the others talked about its reputation as the most haunted place in britain harry looked at it with mixed feelings he and rose knew its true purpose as a safe place for their uncle remus to transform to a werewolf during his hogwarts days and even now remus had secretly told him and rose at the beginning of the month that he was again using the shack to stay in during the full moon in fact the four gryffindors had overheard some of the patrons at the three broomsticks discussing the renewal of the strange sounds from the place after a lull of over a dozen years thankfully it was a few more days to the full moon harry was thankful when ron suggested that they head back to the castle he and rose found remus condition painful and didntlike any reminder that he was a werewolf he remembered the dada class after halloween it was right after a full moon and remus was too tired to teach unfortunately dumbledore chose snape to substitute for remus the greasy haired professor had made them study werewolves during that lesson in spite of being informed by hermione that they wouldnttouch the subject until the next term snape had even assigned them two rolls of parchment on werewolves as homework fortunately remus showed up for the next lesson and told them that they didnthave to do that assignment when the four gryffindor third years got to the entrance hall they were surprised to see sirius there talking to ti rose and ginny harry hurried over to them ignoring the scowl that was on ron face sirius he called what are you doing here sirius grinned as harry stopped in front of him surprised i asked dumbledore to visit and told him not to tell any of you i wanted to see you all after all i have a new nephew to get to know better and i cantmiss a chance to visit with my godson and his sister not to mention my other favorite redheads neville and hermione too he greeted the others and suggested that they all move to the lake shore ron excused himself bringing a frown to the others faces and a sad look on ti s hermione looked furious but stayed with them sorry i missed the game harry sirius said as they walked down the path to black lake i was on duty that day couldntget anyone to trade shifts with me harry smiled that okay sirius there ll be other games when they arrived at the lake sirius asked them about their martial arts training ti listened with interest harry decided to include the first year in their workouts no matter what ron said sirius and the others agreed when harry told them even more when ti face lit up with the prospect of joining them sirius stayed for dinner learning more about ti and his home life he wasntpleased to learn that draco often picked on him even when lucius was present he was quite surprised to learn that narcissa was more lenient with ti though she dared not disobey lucius harry was pleased when ti and sirius again embraced before the latter left with this development harry was starting to think of ti as a younger brother as he had occasionally been envious of the larger weasley family not that he didntlove his own but the thought of having many siblings to care for had always been a dream of his now with ti and the new baby coming it seemed to harry like that dream was coming true the next day ti joined the six other gryffindors in the secluded area of the lake shore where they usually did their workout ron didntlook happy but stayed and kept his mouth shut harry felt a twinge of satisfaction that wasnthis own he turned to look at ginny and noted the smirk on her face harry guessed she had had a talk with her brother about ti harry grinned and decided he really liked this girl even if she was his best friend sister and his sister best friend at that thought he noted a blush creep up ginny face he found that interesting harry and rose helped ti learn the basic martial arts moves and soon had him doing exercises with them by the time the first snows came in the first week of december he was joining their sparring sessions harry made sure not to pair him with ron as he knew he and hermione still rowed over ti acceptance into their group as of now they hadnt let him into the new marauders yet even when the twins had voiced their support of that idea the new marauders had played a few more pranks on the school populace during the week including themselves in several to deflect suspicion away from them they sent fake letters through the school owls at random people which blew up and sprayed red ink over the person that spread further if someone cast a cleaning charm on the affected person harry rose and neville allowed themselves to be included in that prank much to the amusement of their co pranksters another prank involved spiking the pumpkin juice with a mild truth potion brewed by harry and neville using a recipe harry had found in a book at potter manor the potion prevented anyone affected from lying for 24 hours needless to say it caused some interesting situations like when a seventh year slytherin boy was caught by his slytherin girlfriend snogging another girl and admitted he liked the other girl a hufflepuff better and when one of gryffindor fourth year girls got a new though hideous set of clothes and asked her roommates for their opinion the success of ti lessons in martial arts became evident on the first sunday night of december harry and his friends were all seated around one table in the nearly deserted common room an hour before curfew doing their homework when the portrait hole opened harry was bent over writing an essay for charms when he heard a gasp come from rose and ginny who across from him facing the portrait hole at the same time he felt a wave of alarm and panic pass through him coming from ginny he turned around and was surprised to see ti and neville standing there in torn and bloodied robes and wide grins on their faces ti neville what the bloody hell happened to you harry asked luckily for him hermione was too far to smack him for his language though she did humph at him ti grinned and said draco and his goons cornered us coming back from the library if that how you two react to being cornered by draco rose said i d hate to see what gets you down come on over to the fireplace she grabbed their arms and pulled them to sit down in one of the couches in front of the fireplace sitting herself beside ti harry sat on neville other side while ginny hermione and ron sat in the other couches so tell us what happened rose asked well ti said neville was helping me with my herbology essay and we were the last ones to leave the library on the fourth floor draco and crabbe step out in front of us from inside a classroom then goyle and nott moved behind us they surrounded us and backed us into the wall good old draco started saying he wanted to teach a lesson to two blood traitors he taunted me for staying in gryffindor even when father wanted me to be resorted then he tried to punch me like he used to do ti turned to harry a grin on his face i ducked like you taught me then grabbed his extended arm and threw him into the wall yeah neville said it was a great move the others were shocked and we kicked their butts they barely laid a hand on us the blood on us is from them yeah guys ti said those marital arts you taught us really saved us it martial arts ti rose said smirking we re glad they helped you two they all laughed as ti launched into an actual demonstration of the fight with some comments from neville while they were recovering their breaths from laughing so hard ron looked at harry then turned to ti uh ti ron said uncertainly i um think that it was brilliant how you taught draco and his gang a lesson gee thanks uh ron ti said shyly then ron turned to look at hermione who looked sternly at him and motioned toward ti with her head none of the others missed this exchange ron sighed and turned back to ti look ti ron said i want to say i sorry for the way i ve treated you since you got here i just couldnthelp but compare you to your brother then i was shocked at how easily harry and the others accepted you hermione been talking to me about my attitude just talking ron ginny asked with a little irritation in her voice that seemed more than just talking about it yeah if that was just talking rose added i d hate to see what an real row between the two of you is like ron turned a bit red but didntanswer the two female redheads anyway ti ron said i sorry for treating you badly i hope we can be friends he stuck out his hand ti looked at his hand nervously for a couple of seconds then extended his own hand slowly to shake ron hand sure ron i d like that ti said giving a shy smile to the taller boy great rose said now he can be part of the new marauders yeah yeah ron said we can take him in new marauders ti asked that group that been playing pranks wait donttell me some of you are in this group right oh i heard about them from draco from the bad side of course how i d love to prank his sorry behind harry smiled actually ti all of us here are part of the new marauders just add fred and george weasley and you have the whole bunch ti eyes widened really wow that great he looked at harry i d love to join you but first i d like to know why that name harry grinned he cast a few privacy and silence charms around them and proceeded to tell ti about the old marauders at the end of harry tale ti was smiling broadly at the prospect of being a marauder like his uncle sirius they went to bed after that promising to ti to meet together to plan a prank for the last weekend of the term the following weekend was another hogsmeade weekend the last before christmas and sirius had come after lunch again to visit ti they played in the snow with rose and ginny harry ron and hermione joined them after spending the day in hogsmeade they told sirius about having ti join the new marauders sirius was ecstatic to finally have someone related to him as part of the new band of hogwarts pranksters as the group walked up the front stairs with sirius heading for the great hall for dinner someone called out tiberius ti turned around and gasped his face turning almost as pale as his hair father sirius and the others turned around to find lucius malfoy coming up the steps towards them he wasntalone with him were fudge looking a bit nervous and two aurors the older gryffindors looked at each other worry evident on their faces why was lucius back at hogwarts why the hell are you here malfoy sirius said evidently ignoring the minister and his fellow aurors lucius looked with distaste at harry and his friends and at sirius with loathing we are here to see the headmaster black you dont need to know the reason if it has something to do with ti sirius said then i making it my business you have no rights in that black lucius said i am his father and it is my right to do what i must to make sure he follows the family tradition i know all about your family tradition malfoy sirius said angrily it the same stinking tradition as my family the so called noble house of black lucius sneered oh how the mighty have fallen your family used to be highly regarded and respected among all purebloods you ve ruined it black you re a blood traitor just like potter father harry and rose gasped harry started to reach for his wand sirius was turning red and glaring at lucius just then they heard a voice say ah minister lucius you are here they all turned around to see dumbledore standing there at the top of the stairs sirius walked up to dumbledore albus is he here to force a resorting like he tried to do back in september he asked in with a hard tone i afraid so sirius dumbledore said ti had turned even paler when he heard sirius question harry and the others looked uncertainly at each other unable to think of what to say to comfort their friend lucius simply looked smug and had an arrogant smile on his face dumbledore turned to fudge minister lucius i think we should discuss this in my office harry i think you and your friends should accompany ti back to gryffindor tower in the meantime i coming with you to your office albus sirius said someone has to represent ti better interests lucius opened his mouth to protest but dumbledore said of course sirius he turned to fudge minister shall we fudge looked at lucius then turned to dumbledore and nodded the adults entered the entrance hall and headed for dumbledore office as the adults left harry turned to ti who looked again like that scared boy at the beginning of term um ti he said placing a comforting hand on his shoulder come on it ll be all right let go to gryffindor tower like the headmaster said ti reluctantly allowed harry to steer him up the stairs back to gryffindor tower when they reached the common room ti broke into a run and headed up the stairs to his dorm harry and the others exchanged looks of concern and worry no one could think of anything to say they sat down in silence at their usual seats in front of the fireplace harry felt a rage similar to his own coming from ginny he wondered if she could feel his feelings too after about half an hour a knock was heard from the portrait hole harry opened it and found sirius standing there a scowl on his face he let him into the tower and the others crowded around the black haired man what happened sirius harry asked his godfather lucius malfoy happened harry sirius spat out that bloody bastard got fudge to issue a special education decree in favor of him ordering dumbledore to have a resorting of ti he looked around the common room where is he anyway harry sighed he went up to his room ran up to it actually i dont blame him cant professor dumbledore fight the decree rose asked i dont know rose sirius said albus had an option to present the case against it in front of the wizengamoot but that will take a while i not sure what will happen to ti in that event he decided to allow the resorting he turned towards the stairs we better get ti down here albus did insist that the resorting take place in front of the school so its results would be uncontested we need to get him to the great hall rose and ginny looked at each other we ll get him rose said ron sputtered you cantgo into a boy dorm oh you re wrong dear brother ginny said you boys cannot go up the stairs to our dorms but we girls can go to yours anytime the two redhead girls strode up the stairs to the boys dormitories without any problem ron looked shocked and didntspeak after a couple of minutes rose and ginny came back down arm in arm with a visibly distressed ti his face looked like he had been crying harry felt bad for him and hoped dumbledore knew what he was doing if ti got sorted into slytherin it could crush him the group slowly made their way to the great hall when they entered they saw that the entire student body was there along with most of the faculty mcgonagall stood beside the sorting stool with the hat in her hand and a stern frown on her face lucius malfoy and fudge were seated at the faculty table mcgonagall strode up to the group and said please take your usual seats for now the headmaster will explain the situation to the students and then will call ti harry looked at dumbledore and noted him smiling slightly with a twinkle in his eye he turned to ti dontworry ti it ll be all right trust dumbledore he knows what he doing harry didntlet his friend hear the i hope that he came into his thoughts at that last statement i hope so too he plainly heard inside his head in a female voice eyes widening he turned towards ginny and saw she had a slight smirk on her face the six gryffindors sat at their table harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw draco with an evil smile on his face causing harry to clench his fists in anger ti simply looked down at his feet then dumbledore stood up my dear students i know you are all curious as to why we have delayed our dinner tonight and why the esteemed gentlemen to my left are here well to dispel the rumors i will tell you tonight you will witness something that is seldom done a resorting dumbledore paused as the students reacted to the news when they settled down after a few seconds he continued such a thing is not done lightly as it can cast doubt on how we assign students to their houses however the ministry has decided to intervene in the case of this student as requested by his father the whole hall broke into a flurry of whispers as the students speculated on the identity of the unlucky student harry and his friends didnt take part as they already knew who it was then dumbledore voice sounded over the noise mr tiberius malfoy please come up here the whispering became louder as the students watched ti slowly get up and walk toward the stool his feet shuffling along the ground he sat on the stool and mcgonagall placed the sorting hat on his head the whole school held its collective breath as they waited for the hat to speak a n well here a little cliffhanger what will the sorting hat do will ti get resorted to slytherin stay in gryffindor or maybe hufflepuff lol please review oh the next chapter may be delayed a week or two i just found out i have to enter the hospital for an operation dontworry it nothing serious i just gives me time to work on a couple of chapters chapter 26 where does ti go disclaimer i dontknow anything you recognize but rose ti and maggie are mine a n i back and on the road to recovery thanks for all the reviews now on with the show er book ti walked nervously to the sorting stool he wondered how his father had managed to make dumbledore have a resorting he had thought his father had given up after that day in september especially when he had not done anything after draco was injured by that hippogriff as he sat down on the stool ti wondered where the hat would place him he didntthink he belonged in gryffindor anymore as he had run off to his dorm crying as soon as he had gotten back to gryffindor tower he blinked back the tears as he thought of the friends he had made in gryffindor knowing he would miss them especially rose and ginny when professor mcgonagall placed the hat on his head he again heard the voice in his ear that he had talked to last september first ah young tiberius malfoy we meet again the voice in his ear said it seems some people arenthappy where i placed you why do they not listen to me er i dontknow sir ti replied it my father he doesntlike me being in gryffindor he wants me in slytherin like he was and my brother is now my you are a polite one it replied just like three months ago no one had ever called me sir until you did and like i said three months ago young tiberius you are nothing like your father or brother you have some cunning but not the ambition to succeed at any cost that they have you have a good mind though not enough for ravenclaw you are loyal to those you consider your friends but not to your family however your greatest trait is your courage courage ti said how can i have courage when i ran crying to my dorm less than an hour ago ah it is to be truly courageous when you face something or someone even when you just want to give up or run away you are sitting here in spite of the chance you may not be with your friends again even if some of them had to drag you here you fought back against your brother and his companions even when they were greater in number that is why you must stay in gryffindor ti sighed in relief as his housemates broke into a loud cheer that soon spread to the hufflepuffs and ravenclaws the slytherins were shocked into silence gryffindor harry and his friends let out their breaths and broke out in cheers with the rest of their house as they heard the sorting hat pronouncement ti jumped off the stool and ran back to the gryffindor table as he got there rose and ginny leaped from their seats to hug him fiercely ti sat happily beside harry a huge grin on his face harry matched it with one of his own see ti harry said you had nothing to worry about dumbledore knew what he was doing when he let this occur now your father cantdo anything anymore about you being in gryffindor it where you belong they looked together back at the head table dumbledore smiled at them with a twinkle in his eye sirius remus and hagrid had grins wider than the cheshire cat mcgonagall looked stern except for a slight upturn of the corner of her mouth snape just looked bored and unconcerned the other professors simply looked amused and relieved lucius malfoy on the other hand looked furious he got up from the table and stormed out of the great hall minister fudge running after him with a confused and frightened look on his face the aurors followed him looking somber dumbledore then stood up well after that excitement i believe we could use a good meal he clapped his hands and the tables were filled with the usual overflow of food and drink go ahead tuck in harry and his friends enjoyed the food as usual ti seemed to have regained his appetite just as they were eating dessert sirius came up and squeezed in beside ti so sirius said a sheepish grin on his face i guess there wasntanything to worry about after all harry grinned well all of us felt the same he turned to ti i hope your father gives up after this at this ti suddenly deflated and looked apprehensive what is it harry asked what wrong now i just realized that i have to go home for christmas ti said what will happen when i do harry and sirius looked at each other the others also suddenly realized what ti meant rose said you donthave to go home ti students are allowed to stay here during the christmas holidays yeah that right harry said you can just ask professor dumbledore i sure he ll understand i hope so harry hermione said usually a student needs his or her parents permission to stay here well sirius said there no harm in asking i think yeah harry said you can ask him tomorrow ti we ll go with you thanks ti said sirius bid goodbye to them after that telling ti not to worry anymore unfortunately he was wrong the next day the new marauders were all eating breakfast together after a good workout and martial arts practice when a large majestic looking owl swooped into the great hall and dropped a letter with an elaborate seal on ti lap harry who was seated beside ti saw that the younger boy hands were shaking as he picked it up what is it ti harry asked who is it from what that seal i i it the malfoy family seal ti said shaking it must be from f f f father ti shakily broke the seal and opened the letter he read it then uttering a gasp dropped it and ran from the hall harry and his friends were stunned and alarmed rose and ginny immediately ran off after ti harry picked up the letter and read it tiberius i am deeply disappointed in you i had hoped the damned sorting hat had made a mistake the first time when it placed you in that despicable house and not in noble slytherin unfortunately for you that is i was wrong it appears you lack the qualities that make a proper slytherin and in essence a proper malfoy ever since you were born i had hoped that i had another son to proudly bear the family name and devote to salazar slytherin noble cause of blood purity as you were growing up i watched your interactions with draco i was disappointed when you did not seem to defend yourself in the proper slytherin manner instead resorting to physical means like some dirty muggle to fight your brother i had hoped you would be more cunning in your later years but it was not to be in retrospect i should not have allowed your mother to change my mind on sending you to durmstrang instead of hogwarts you would have been forced to develop the proper qualities of a malfoy to survive or perish the latter would have been preferable to you betraying your family by allowing yourself to be in gryffindor in addition to being in that despicable house you have the temerity to associate with the potter brats and other blood traitors that is the last straw as head of the malfoy family i hereby disown you as of this moment i only have one son and heir as such you need not return to malfoy manor for christmas or the summer holidays whatever possessions you have at the manor will be sent to hogwarts never ever darken our lives again lucius malfoy harry felt a hot rage go through him doubling within seconds as he felt ginny own rage he flung the letter down he was barely aware of it being picked up by hermione that freaking bloody bastard language harry he heard in his head not now where ti we re in the quidditch pitch harry heard hermione gasp as she reached the end of the letter he was already at the door of the great hall in less than a minute he was at the pitch ti was sitting on the ground his legs drawn to his chest and his arms clutching them ginny and rose were sitting beside him unsure what to do harry dropped to his knees beside ti and hesitantly placed a hand on the younger boy shoulder hey you okay he asked stupid of course he isntokay how would you feel if your family disowned you ti didntanswer he started to rock back and forth harry heard footsteps behind them and looked over his shoulder he saw hermione and the others come running up worry and anger on their faces rose moved to kneel in front of ti and placed her hands on his shoulder ti come on dontdwell on this it going to be all right he looked angrily up at her how can you say that i ve been disowned by my family i no longer a malfoy i no one he then hugged his knees and started to cry the others looked at each other unsure what to say finally rose moved forward and wrapped her arms around ti ginny moved to hug them both harry placed a hand on ti shoulder and squeezed gently you are someone ti rose said you re our friend that right ti harry said you are our friend and a fellow marauder the others joined in with a chorus of yeah that right and you re one of us ti pulled back from rose and wiped his eyes th thanks guys he said i glad you okay now ti rose asked um not really he answered but i guess i will be rose nodded and she ginny and harry helped him up i guess i will be staying here at hogworts for christmas after all ti said sadly well you wontbe staying here alone harry said i ll ask dad and mum to let me stay here with you i sure rose will too rose smiled at him showing she agreed with him hey ginny said if you two are staying so am i the look she gave harry told him that keeping ti company wasntthe only reason she was staying she then looked at ron ron sighed oh all right i staying too if mum will let us ginny and rose looked at the others hey so will we the twins said together um sorry guys hermione said looking embarrassed i promised my parents already that i d be home for christmas but i ll try to come back early me too guys neville said i have to be home for christmas maggie will kill me if i not i ll try to be back before new year s maggie ti asked who she do you have a girlfriend already neville neville cheeks turned pink and he sputtered trying to answer rose and ginny laughed and harry and the others grinned ti looked in confusion at them no ti harry said smiling maggie neville sister neville doesnthave a girlfriend yet harry grinned as he added unless he been keeping it from us who said ti didnthave anything slytherin in him neville face turned as red as the weasleys hair yeah ti cute little girl fred said who ll be here next year george said though you may meet her fred said even before then george finished up all right you two hermione said that enough teasing they moved out of the quidditch pitch and walked back to the castle when they reached the entrance hall ti thanked them all for being willing to stay for him now i wish i knew where to stay once summer starts he said sadly are you daft ti harry asked i know of someone who d be willing to put you up during the summers who would that be harry ti asked his face showing his skepticism you re joking right harry asked one eyebrow raised you dontknow anyone who was delighted to meet you and spend time with you during hogsmeade weekends of course harry rose said who else but sirius ti eyes lighted up with hope you think he would of course ti harry said all we have to do is ask maybe he can spend christmas with us here at hogwarts come on we have to talk to dumbledore a n so what do you guys think how mean can lucius be right now for those of you who are waiting harry and ginny will get to talk things over in the next chapter or two chapter 27 christmas with ti disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize but rose maggie and ti are my own inventions dumbledore was saddened by news of ti expulsion from his family he told ti that he would still allowed to use the surname of malfoy while at hogwarts until ti either was adopted by another family or reached his seventeenth birthday at which time he could choose his own name dumbledore also allowed ti to stay at hogwarts though he needed to find a place to stay over the summer as no student was allowed to live in hogwarts during the summer holidays dumbledore gave harry and ron permission to floo their parents to ask for permission to stay at hogwarts with ti during the christmas break when harry reluctantly told his mother the reason why ti was not going to malfoy manor for the holidays lily became furious and wanted to invite ti over to potter manor harry told her that maybe they d bring him over for christmas day but for now ti would be more comfortable at hogwarts molly also wanted to have ti over at the burrow for christmas so harry and the others promised to talk to him about having dinner on christmas day at the weasley home molly told ron to tell percy to stay so he could keep an eye on his younger brothers and sister ron grinned knowing his older brother didntlike babysitting especially as his girlfriend was going home for the holidays later that afternoon harry rose ron and ginny accompanied neville and hermione to the hogsmeade train station on board the horseless carriages they helped them get their trunks into the train neville and hermione again promised to try to get back early as they said their goodbyes as the train was pulling out harry saw draco leaning out one of the windows a big smirk on his face enjoy your holiday with my non brother potter the slytherin boy yelled as the train moved faster harry glared after the train i giving it to that git when he gets back we all will harry all the marauders together he looked behind him and locked gazes with ginny we have to talk all right tonight at midnight in the common room dinner that night was done in one table as there were few students left at hogwarts aside from the potters weasleys and ti there were only three ravenclaws and four hufflepuffs left and no slytherins remus ate with them and entertained them with some hilarious stories about sirius during their time at hogwarts he was sympathetic about ti situation and helped harry compose a letter to sirius that night harry made sure that ron was asleep before putting on a robe and creeping down to the common room when he arrived it was empty he sat down in one of the armchairs in front of the dying fire he pulled his wand out and muttered a spell causing the fire to flare back to life then he leaned back and waited after a few minutes he felt the presence of another and knew without turning around who it was the other person took the armchair opposite his hi he said softly looking at ginny she was dressed in a light green nightgown she looked nice in it hi she answered back shyly the silence between them stretched for several minutes as both of them stared into the fire finally harry looked up and said so i guess something happened to us in the chamber you mean other than you rescuing me she asked smiling shyly yeah harry said smiling back so when did you notice you could sense what i was feeling she leaned back in the chair her face screwed up in thought i guess it was the first time i came to your place last summer i started getting flashes of annoyance or irritation that got stronger when i looked up to your room i could feel your glee and happiness that day as you and rose played in the garden harry said but that wasntthe first time i felt your emotions it wasn t ginny asked no harry said i first felt your feelings that night in dumbledore office i could feel your sadness and fright i didntthink much of it at the time but then next day i felt your relief when no one brought up what had happened and later in the feast your joy then as the summer passed i felt more and more of your feelings it got stronger with me too harry ginny said and not just your feelings she looked directly in his eyes i could sense your thoughts when we started doing that martial arts stuff harry returned her gaze i know i could do the same thing i guess that why we could barely hit each other whenever we sparred now we can even send thoughts to each other then ginny suddenly leaned back in her armchair hugging herself harry felt fear and apprehension coming for her he rushed out of his chair over to her kneeling down in front of her what happening to us harry she asked him the fear evident in her voice harry placed a hand gently on her knee i dontknow gin he said i dontreally know but please tell me is it really bad sensing each other feelings being able to share our thoughts she thought about it for a moment not really harry i was just worried you wouldntwant to be this way with me harry raised one eyebrow why ever not he asked her you re my friend as well as my sister best friend you re also a pretty smart and loving person so dontever think i mind what happening to us he had felt a twinge of disappointment from her when she heard him call her a friend but harry ignored it for now just think how much fun it will be being able to talk without anyone knowing we are she giggled oh yes we can share secrets and information without anyone knowing what the farthest we can be to speak to each other with thoughts alone i dontknow harry said right now after what happened this morning i d say the farthest we can do it is the distance from the great hall to the quidditch pitch well ginny said i think that something we should test during this holiday harry grinned i agree we will now i think we should get some sleep ginny then hugged him i glad you re okay with this harry harry returned the embrace and noted how contented he felt i glad too harry drew back after a while taking note of the blush on ginny checks though he didntsay anything about it gin i have to tell you i ve talked to rose about this she blushed again so have i well actually she dragged it out of me the night we got back here well it about time you two talked about it said a voice from behind them i was getting frustrated that neither of you seemed to want to talk they turned around and found rose standing there in her nightgown a smirk on her face my what a picture you two are right now she said a grin now on her face it a good thing ron isntthe one who found you two puzzled harry and ginny looked down and found that they still had their arms around each other they jumped apart quickly and looked away from each other um well i think we should go to bed now harry said his cheeks heating up yeah ginny said i think we ve finished up for now with that they rushed up to their respective stairs past the smirking rose the next three days passed with the seven gryffindors enjoying themselves around hogwarts and in hogsmeade ti received special permission from dumbledore and mcgonagall to visit the village as he had no guardian at the moment percy avoided the others except for meals which was fine with them as they were also busy planning pranks to play on the school populace once the new term started the day before christmas the seven friends received a surprise when sirius came into the great hall while they were having lunch harry and rose ran up to the black haired man while ti followed reluctantly after a push from ginny what are you doing here sirius harry asked grinning as he hugged his godfather hey sirius said grinning as he returned the embrace canta guy visit his godson and that godson sister and his nephew not to mention their friends without a reason he also hugged rose and then turned to ti who was standing uncertainly at a distance hey you sirius said to the younger boy opening his arms come on over here and give your old uncle a hug ti hesitantly approached sirius then embraced him when the man enfolded him in his arms tears running down his cheeks come on ti sirius said gently i think we should have a talk he led the boy away and out of the great hall harry and rose watched them leave and rose turned to her brother what that about she asked i have an idea sis harry said but we ll have to wait for sirius to tell us come on let get back to the others there a treacle tart with my name on it rose rolled her eyes and playfully slapped her brother arm as they walked back to the table sirius and ti were not back by the time they had finished lunch to pass the time the remaining six gryffindors decided to have a three on three quidditch game harry ginny and rose were on one team with harry and ginny as chasers and rose as keeper while the twins and ron on the other team with the twins as chasers and ron as the keeper rose smiled inwardly she knew the twins were a formidable team as they thought alike she also knew that with their ability to project their thoughts to each other harry and ginny could be as formidable it would be interesting which team came out on top after two hours the scores were practically tied at 80 70 in favor of the potter team the twins were surprised at how well their sister and harry acted together intercepting many of their passes they realized that it was only ron skill as a keeper that kept the score from being even more lopsided just as ron barely blocked another of ginny throws they spotted sirius and ti coming into the pitch the six friends immediately descended and landed beside them harry noted with relief that both were smiling so you guys had a good talk harry asked sirius grinned yup he looked down at ti go on ti tell them ti smiled sirius is arranging to be my guardian and if possible adopt me that great harry and rose said together the weasleys agreed with them yeah sirius said the paperwork in dumbledore and james have given their support in writing to the ministry we should hear about a decision after the holidays he turned to ti then we can show you your new home one weekend so you ll finally have someone in grimmauld place other than you and remus huh sirius harry said especially since remus is here at hogwarts yeah sirius said finally gives me a reason to clean up the rest of the place i ve told ti all about the noble house of black and the changes i ve made to the place so far ti smiled it ll be great to live in a place without any signs of the dark arts a lot of the things in malfoy manor just give an aura of wrongness you might say it was hard growing up there sirius placed an arm around ti shoulder well you wonthave to worry about those things anymore harry was glad for his friend and sirius he hoped they would be good for each other after a few minutes they all went back to the castle for dinner the kids didntlinger long in the common room afterwards but soon turned in for an early night the nest day harry woke up ti who was surprised to see several presents at the foot of his bed happy christmas ti harry said smiling h h happy christmas harry ti said tears of happiness running down his cheeks come on harry said gather up your presents the others are waiting in the common room so we can open them together ti gathered the presents from the floor in front of his bed he was heading out the door when he suddenly stopped ti harry asked what is it i i i didntget anyone anything ti said new tears forming in his eyes i donthave much money anymore since since i was was disowned harry placed a hand on ti shoulder ti dontworry about it your being here with us is enough the chance you could be with sirius and maybe be like a son to him is as good a present as i could want so dontyou worry about not having anything to give us ti nodded touched by harry words the two boys descended the stairs down to the common room the others greeted them and they all turned to their presents no one had any complaints about their presents especially ti he had gotten a wand holster from harry and ron a book on quidditch from ginny rose and hermione a whole bunch of zonko products from the twins and a book on defense from remus and sirius there was even the traditional weasley jumper for ti in red and gold with a white t on the back harry could tell from ginny thoughts and feelings that she liked the gift he had gotten for her a silver pendant in the shape of a cat with tiny green eyes he knew she loved cats he also liked the gift she and rose had given him a practice snitch with his name engraved on it he thanked ginny mentally and felt happy when she smiled and thought a you re welcome back to him they then went to the great hall for a sumptuous breakfast the potter siblings helped ti floo over to potter manor after breakfast while the weasleys went home to the burrow for a while as soon as harry rose and their guest stepped out of the fireplace harry called out mum we re here in moments lily appeared at the doorway from the kitchen she hugged her children then stepped in front of ti who was standing off to one side hello again ti she said smiling welcome to our home welcome to potter manor she then stepped forward and hugged him ti cheeks went red as he awkwardly returned the embrace thanks mrs potter he said his voice muffled thanks for having me over lily released him and smiled down at him it a pleasure ti she said any friend of my kids is always welcome here now i have things to do in the kitchen harry and rose will show you around come on ti rose said grabbing his hand let go this way harry followed as rose led ti from room to room ti was surprised at the beauty and brightness of the potter ancestral home this is really nice ti said shyly it not as large as malfoy manor but there none of that feeling of eerieness or wrongness in fact it feels so warm and friendly here thanks rose said beaming at him after the tour of the interior of the house they took him out back and showed him the garden and quidditch pitch this delighted ti since malfoy manor didnthave its own quidditch pitch seeing his excitement harry lent him his old cleansweep and the three kids chased each other around the pitch while waiting for the other guests to arrive soon the weasleys remus sirius and professor dumbledore came over to fill the potter home with christmas joy ginny introduced ti to her parents who looked glad to finally meet the younger malfoy boy ti looked shyly at mrs weasley thank you for the sweater mrs weasley he said softly a shy smile on his face it the first piece of clothing i have in gryffindor colors that not a school uniform he was surprised when molly pulled her into a fierce hug you re welcome dear she said when she finally released him it the least i could do after hearing what your father did that awful man how could he do that to his own flesh and blood her eyes looked wet and ti didntlook far from crying himself arthur put his arms around his wife now now molly let not upset the poor lad come on it christmas a time of joy and fun giving an apologetic look to ti he led molly toward the dining room before ti could start to feel sorry for himself again rose came up and tugged on his arm come on now ti let go to the ballroom remus is about to play on the piano some carols he really good ti allowed himself to be dragged to the crowd of people around the grand piano as they sang it became apparent to the others that ti didntknow any of the christmas songs they were singing sirius and harry took it upon themselves to teach him the songs with the help of some sheet music once he was comfortable with the songs ti turned out to have a pretty good singing voice after lunch the kids moved to the family room where they introduced ti to muggle videogames he was a bit apprehensive at first since he had been taught from birth to dislike if not hate muggle devices but after a while he was enjoying the game doom in the late afternoon all the people moved to the burrow for dinner ti was even more impressed with the weasley home he thought it was more inviting and friendly than malfoy manor for which he received another smothering hug from molly as usual the meal prepared by molly was delicious and everyone ate until they were bursting ti commented that he had never tasted such good food even at hogwarts this comment brought tears of joy to molly eyes and she wondered to her husband how such a sweet boy could have grown up as a malfoy the kids flooed back to hogwarts before midnight and quickly went to bed ready for pleasant dreams unfortunately for harry that not what he got a n another cliffie of sorts hope you guys liked the chapter especially the talk between harry and ginny there ll be more of that in later chapters just be patient chapter 28 a nightmare and a dream come true disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize the rest is mine and mine alone harry was flying on his broom enjoying the feel of the wind against his face as he chased after someone on a broom someone with long red hair he was getting closer and closer just a few feet from the other person the other person a girl looked back for an instant and harry could hear her laughing just as harry closed to within a foot of her his surroundings changed he was no longer on his broom he was standing in a strange house at the foot of a flight of stairs he d never seen this place before it looked large and old most of it in darkness it was night outside looking up the stairs harry saw a stream of light coming from above curious he started climbing the stairs slowly one step at a time after a few minutes he saw a partially open door through which the light was coming he stepped up onto the landing in front of the door he approached the door which slowly opened without him touching it within the room he saw a man he recognized kneeling before a large armchair which was faced away from him toward a fireplace with a roaring fire it was lucius malfoy mr malfoy was looking down as he knelt down on one knee are you comfortable my lord the voice that answered lucius was cold and high pitched a voice harry had last heard two years previously coming from behind a certain professor head yes lucius this place is moderately comfortable it will suit our purposes as i knew it would now where is nagini i i dontknow my lord lucius answered she went to explore the house when we arrived you must milk her later tonight lucius voldemort said i will require feeding before retiring the journey we made was tiring there seemed to be a note of amusement in his voice yes my lord lucius answered a slight tone of disgust creeping in his voice do not worry lucius voldemort said quietly i will require the draught for only a little while longer once our plan comes to fulfillment i will be whole again yes my lord lucius said there was a pause as if he was weighing his next words my lord about the plan surely i can do it alone you dare question me lucius voldemort said menace in his voice lucius paled again no no my lord i do not mean it that way i meant that we do not need anyone else for your plan to succeed after all the more people who know the greater chance for discovery that may be lucius voldemort said but i need someone who is loyal to me but my lord lucius said i am loyal after all i came looking for you i found you dontmake me laugh lucius voldemort you came looking for me after twelve years you only decided to look for me because you want revenge against the potters lucius looked up then shock on his face oh yes lucius voldemort said cold amusement in his voice i know what happened to your second son you blame young harry potter for his being in gryffindor but you are tiberius father it was your responsibility to educate him in the ideals of salazar slytherin if he did not retain the right attitude and beliefs then you are the only one to blame he paused for a moment as lucius continued to stare at him so you see lucius i need someone who is both loyal and competent but my lord lucius said i am still the one who found you and i brought that bertha jerkins to you ah so true lucius voldemort yes the information i managed to get out of her will prove useful especially in finding my other faithful servant of course the fact that she would have recognized you and caused a lot of questions as to why you were in albania had no influence on you bringing her to me did it lucius paled again of of course not my lord i had not realized that at that time liar voldemort said again the amusement in his voice even more pronounced at any rate it was very useful information we will leave in the morning to retrieve him then we will proceed with my plan i have an idea who will use for it who my lord lucius asked ah ah lucius voldemort said for now let it be my secret you ll know soon enough now nagini comes and i need my draught turn me around from the fire lucius moved forward and turned the armchair into harry line of sight with a gasp harry opened his eyes his breathing labored as if he had been running a marathon he realized then that he was lying in his bed in his dormitory in hogwarts the scar on his forehead was throbbing like a white hot poker had been pressed into it he sat up one hand still on his scar while the other reached out for his glasses he tried to recall the dream he had just had it had seemed so real harry are you awake a sleepy female voice said in his mind gin yeah i am did i wake you maybe i have a bit of a headache just when i woke up sorry ginny my scar hurting i sorry you can feel it um did you have a strange dream involving lucius malfoy i dontthink so why harry breathed a sigh of relief oh it not important right now go back to sleep ginny we can talk in the morning my scar pain is lessening so your headache must be too yeah it is less you re sure you re all right yeah i can go back to sleep in a while thanks for asking anytime harry i guess that one of the benefits that this thing we share will have good night good night gin harry felt her go back to sleep then after a few more minutes he tried to remember the details of the dream they were slowly fading from his memory what he did remember was lucius talking to voldemort in a strange almost deserted house bits of their conversation were on the edge of his memory of someone or something called nagini voldemort needed a plan a person they had captured for information harry finally gave up and sank back on his bed he soon dozed off a few hours later harry came down into the common room to find ginny waiting for him a book on her lap the room was otherwise empty good morning harry she said were you able to go back to sleep and what was that about a dream with lucius malfoy in it yes harry replied i got back to sleep okay you did hear that then let talk later she gave a single nod of her head the others have gone to breakfast already let talk now she dragged him over to one of the couches in front of the fireplace all right she said softly as soon as they were seated what did you see was voldemort in this dream harry eyes widened in surprise from her perceptiveness yeah he was how d you know i dontknow i just felt it would please tell me about it all right i dontremember that much but here goes harry then tells her all he remembers about the dream until he woke up with his scar hurting has your scar hurt before harry ginny asked two years ago harry replied i never did get to ask dumbledore about that it hurt on and off then but it really throbbed when i confronted quirrell who had voldemort on the back of head i think you should tell the headmaster about that harry ginny said that and the dream maybe he can make some sense of what malfoy and voldemort are up to maybe we should even talk to him about this mental thing we share i dontknow gin harry said let start with this dream and the scar first i want this thing we share to remain between us for now okay okay harry gin said smiling now let get some breakfast i starved harry smiled grabbing her hand and leading her through the portrait he felt a tremor in her hand for a moment he also felt a swirl of butterflies in the pit of his stomach after breakfast harry purposely lagged behind as their group moved to leave the great hall when the others had left harry approached dumbledore uh professor he said can i talk to you later tonight there something i need to tell you and it may take a while i dontwant my friends to worry of course harry dumbledore said come up to my office at about 9 o clock the password is toffee tonsures yes sir harry said thanks later that night harry pretended to be tired and went to his dorm he arranged his bed and pillows to appear that he was already asleep then he put on his invisibility cloak and sneaked down to the common room ginny whom he had told where he was going distracted the others so they didntnotice the portrait hole opening and closing without anyone near it when he got to the gargoyle blocking the stairs to dumbledore office harry removed the cloak and gave the password the gargoyle stepped aside and allowed harry access to the moving staircase harry knocked on the door once he got there come in harry dumbledore said please take a seat thank you sir harry said sitting down in a chair in front of dumbledore desk now what is it you want to tell me dumbledore asked harry then recounted as much of his dream as he could ending his story with walking up with his scar burning he didntmention ginny at the end of harry tale dumbledore sat silently staring at the ceiling obviously deep in thought after a couple of minutes dumbledore looked at harry harry has your scar bothered you before well harry said yes sir it was two years ago during that time with the stone it would hurt on and off after christmas but the worst was during my confrontation with quirrell and voldermort he gazed at dumbledore with fear in his eyes sir what does this mean dumbledore sighed i believe it means you have a connection with voldemort through your scar it probably an effect of the curse he threw at you harry gulped a connection through my scar can he feel me can he feel ginny through me harry what is it gin i have to tell him about what we have i dontwant voldemort to get at you are you sure harry yes ginny i dontwant you to get hurt from voldemort if we have a connection all right harry if you think it best harry dumbledore asked what is it you seemed to be far away from here for a moment professor harry said there something else you have to know something happened between me and ginny that night we were in the chamber of secrets harry told dumbledore about him and ginny feeling each other emotions and hearing each other thoughts and being able to converse with their minds again dumbledore became thoughtful that interesting harry you say that all this started the night after you rescued miss weasley from the chamber yes sir harry said do you know why we can do all that stuff i mean it brilliant and everything but why us i not exactly sure harry dumbledore said but i have my suspicions tell me harry how do you feel about miss weasley harry was surprised by the question what do you mean sir what do i feel about ginny i feel she brilliant funny smart a great quidditch player that what you think about her harry dumbledore said but what do you feel about her er feel about her sir harry asked turning red i i like her a lot she been a very good friend this feeling and thought sharing thing not withstanding dumbledore raised an eyebrow his eyes twinkling just a good friend harry the reason i asked that is because of my suspicions what you and miss weasley have been going through may be the formation of a soul bond a soul bond harry asked what that dumbledore smiled it a type of magical bonding entered into by two people who have fallen in love with each other at a young age this bond allows the two to share their thoughts and feelings and to sense each other over long distances this reinforces their love and sustains them for their entire life however the negative side of the bond is that when one of the couple dies the other does not linger long in this world which is why few people nowadays are willing to have the bond formed now usually the bonding requires an advanced form of ritual which establishes the bond and its abilities immediatley however there have been times when the bond forms naturally as the result of one of the couple risking his life for the other the exact circumstances necessary when this occurs are not known it simply happens in such cases the bond forms gradually over several weeks to months in the end it is much stronger than the type formed by the ritual harry was stunned did it mean he was in love with ginny he thought about the strange sensations he had been experiencing whenever she was near him starting the previous year he d known her his whole life and had to admit that he had never minded her presence did that mean that he loved her harry then smiledit probably did and he thought that was brilliant maybe you re right sir harry said but if i have a connection to voldemort and and can feel ginny then does that mean no harry dumbledore interrupted harry that is different the connection you may have to voldemort through your scar has nothing to do with the bond they are on separate levels your scar is there because of voldemort hate and fear the bond is a connection of love something voldemort cannot understand so there is no way he can feel or harm ginerva that way harry breathed a sigh or relief then he looked up at dumbledore uh sir can we keep this bond thing a secret just between you me and ginny we might tell our parents someday soon but other than that i think it should be something private between us dumbledore smiled again ah of course harry the bond is a beautiful thing yet something that belongs only to the two bonded he then looked up at his clock well i think you should get back to gryffindor tower it getting late i believe your other half may be waiting for you the twinkle was there again in his eye harry felt himself blush uh yes sir goodnight then headmaster he got up and walked to the door good night harry dumbledore said when harry got back to the gryffindor common room he wasntsurprised to find it empty except for ginny she was sitting in an armchair watching the portrait hole harry walked over and sat next to her hey so did you hear all that um yeah ginny said quietly all of it a soul bond that really wow they were silent for a while then ginny said shyly harry was it true what you were thinking about me you know being brilliant and all harry looked at her and said of course it true he moved closer to her their faces were now mere inches apart you re the prettiest funniest and smartest girl i know and i ve known you all my life i love you with that harry brushed her lips with his when he pulled back he was alarmed to see tears in her eyes ginny what wrong she shook her head nothing harry it just that hearing those words from you has been my dream since i was like eight i ve known you for longer than that not as the boy who lived but as the real harry i love you too she pressed her lips to his when she pulled back several seconds later they were both grinning after staring at each other for a while harry said so now what she playfully slapped him in the arm what do you think you silly prat harry smiled um will you be my girlfriend yes ginny said throwing her arms around her neck and giving him a quick kiss on the lips harry grinned as he placed his arms around her waist brilliant then his face fell what is it ginny asked what wrong i just remembered ron said last year that he d break the arms of the first guy who kissed you harry said ginny frowned dontworry about ron or any of my brothers they ve known you for a long time they ll be okay with this or they ll regret it harry grinned again ginny was a real force when she was angry something he d seen for years and experienced a few times i wouldntwant to face her temper now no you wouldn t potter especially now i have a claim on you oh do you now oh yes you better watch it this bond thing will make it hard for you to hide from me as if i want to i promise gin we ll be together forever now we better get to bed ginny smiled i guess so good night harry she gave him a peck on the lips good night gin harry said he watched her climb the stairs to her dorm then went up to his own he went to bed with a smile on his face his dreams that night were more pleasant dreams of flying alongside ginny a n well that my version of harry and ginny first kiss how was it it not as dramatic as in half blood prince but it is three years early please review disclaimer i dontown harry potter though a few of the characters are my own a n by the way this is my first attempt at any kind of fan fiction to iluvwater thanks for the review hope you ll like the way i rewrite jkr great work although it ll just be little adjustments enjoy chapter 2 strange goings on harry sat in a table in the gryffindor common room hunched over a bit of parchment it was early on a friday morning and harry was gathering his thoughts so he could send a letter to his parents about his first two weeks at hogwarts it had been an interesting two weeks at first the other students were constantly pointing to and gawking at him their voices muffled in whispers behind his back harry tried to ignore them pulling his robes tightly around himself and making sure his bangs covered his scar luckily ron the twins and occasionally percy would run interference whenever another student got too close or tried to ask harry questions harry was grateful for his favorite redheads hogwarts was turning out to be even more fascinating and confusing than he had imagined from descriptions of his parents sirius remus and the older weasley brothers the numerous corridors and shifting staircases made finding one classroom an adventure and made being late a distinct possibility luckily his father and sirius had taught him as much about the secret passages of hogwarts that they knew as they could using them allowed harry and ron to get to their classes on time in spite of being among the last to leave the great hall after meals there were numerous ghosts in hogwarts who were more interesting than the ghoul in the attic of the burrow there was nearly headless nick the gryffindor house ghost whose head was almost completely severed when he was executed for having an affair with a lord wife the blood baron the slytherin house ghost was the terror of the other ghosts worst of all was peeves a mischievous poltergeist who loved to play mean pranks on students the classes themselves fascinated and dismayed harry he realized that there was still a lot for him to learn in spite of being exposed to the wizarding world all his life the teachers were both encouraging and intimidating like professor flitwick the tiny wizard who taught charms and was head of ravenclaw house and professor sprout the little dumpy witch who taught herbology and was head of hufflepuff house the defense against the dark arts teacher professor quirrel was a strange person to be teaching that subject since he stuttered often and seemed easy to intimidate he even wore a turban which was a gift of gratitude from some african prince he had saved from a zombie history of magic which was taught by a ghost professor binns was the most boring class of all professor mcgonagall his head of house seemed to be a strict and clever witch who deserved respect she taught transfiguration and gave them a stern warning about being serious in its study their first lesson transfiguring a match into a sewing needle was already difficult at the end of the hour only hermione harry and neville longbottom had managed to make any change in their match harry noticed that this seemed to upset the bushy haired girl harry was surprised on finding out that neville parents were aurors his father seldom mentioned his co workers and harry was so often with the weasleys that he had never had the time to meet the children of other workers he thought it a pity since the pudgy boy seemed clever but a bit nervous harry resolved to get to know him better potions seemed the worst subject to harry for two reasons first they had it with the slytherins and second it was taught by professor snape harry had been warned by sirius that the greasy haired potions master may be hostile to him but never explained why when the gryffindor first years had their first potions class professor snape sneered at harry and tried embarrass harry by asking him several obscure questions about potion ingredients fortunately having been forced by lily to study his books for at least two hours a night in the month before going to hogwarts harry was able to answer the questions after thinking hard harry noticed that hermione tried to answer the questions faster but was ignored by professor snape which also dismayed her the most interesting and terrifying day for harry had been the previous day and night it had started normally with regular classes but that afternoon during the first flying lesson with the slytherins the day turned strange one of the slytherin boys fell off his broom and broke his wrist necessitating madame hooch the flying instructor to bring him to the hospital wing though she gave a stern warning to the rest of the students not to go up alone on pain of expulsion while landing neville dropped a glass ball called a rememberall it had been sent by his mother since he was sometimes forgetful malfoy happened to pick it up and refused to return it when harry demanded its return malfoy took off on his broom and taunted harry to get it from him now harry having been flying since his father took him up on his broom when he was not even a year old was a natural flyer he immediately zoomed up to malfoy in spite of hermione warning malfoy in surprise threw the rememberall as far as he could harry rushed after it and caught it just before it smashed into a far wall of the castle unfortunately mcgonagall saw harry and called him out however instead of being expelled mcgonagall introduced harry to the captain of the gryffindor quidditch team oliver wood as the new seeker wood was ecstatic and hoped harry would help them win the quidditch cup harry was stunned and ecstatic at this that night dismayed that harry had not been expelled malfoy challenged him to a wizard duel at midnight neville and ron offered to be his seconds hermione tried to stop them from leaving gryffinder tower but found herself locked out of the tower when the fat lady painting who guarded their entrance had gone wandering off the four went off to the agreed place of the duel but malfoy didntshow up instead they were almost caught by the caretaker angus filch for being out of their dorms after curfew in fleeing from him they found a huge three headed dog behind a locked room and barely made their escape back to their tower harry decided to leave that last adventure out of his letter no sense in worrying his parents since he had no intention of going anywhere near that beast again he wondered why there was a monster like that in a school hermione had mentioned that it seemed to be standing on a trapdoor guarding it harry remembered an article in the daily prophet newspaper about a break in at gringott bank on september 1st specifically at into a vault that had just been emptied hagrid had been at the gringott earlier that day and seemed to be hiding something in his pocket harry wondered if there was a connection between the mysterious object in hagrid pocket the monstrous dog and the break in at gringott s it seemed just like a case his dad would be interested in he added a note to the letter asking his parents to send his old broom a comet 260 so he would have his own broom for use during the quidditch matches once he had finished his letter he waited for ron to come down to accompany him to the owlery so he could use his owl hedwig to deliver the letter to potter manor that night during dinner hedwig returned together with artemis his mother eagle owl carrying a long and thin wrapped package between them there was note attached to hedwig leg with read this first on it harry immediately ripped the note open and recognized his father untidy scrawl interspaced with his mother lovely handwriting harry congratulations son we are proud of you i knew you had it in you to make it to the team though i never dreamed you d be in it in your first year imagine you re the youngest seeker in a century now james control yourself harry we ve talked with the headmaster and professor mcgonagall we re arenthappy with the way you attracted her attention with your flying skills young man anymore rule breaking and we ll come down there and have a talk with you now lils let the boy have some fun merlin knows its boring just studying it fine to have fun james but not while breaking the rules those are meant to keep him safe definitely he canthave fun like you did in our fifth year you know i only had fun with those gits who deserved it ouch james language harry you better not pull any pranks while in school i know the weasley twins have been trying to convince you to start a new generation of marauders how did she find out harry wondered wait this is mum she knows everything what was that comment about their fifth year please lils let me finish this okay son now about the broom the owls brought you we got permission from the headmaster and professor mcgonagall to sent you this it isntyour old broom we thought you deserved something worthy of a seeker consider it an early christmas present dontopen it until you get to your dormitory dont think this is a reward for rule breaking harry remember we ll be in touch with your teachers especially professor mcgonagall who was our head of house really lils okay harry that it for now good luck we ll try to be there for your first match love mum and dad harry was stunned and wary could it possibly be there was a certain broomstick he had been eyeing at quality quidditch supplies on diagon alley his mother had told him he wouldntget a broom like that until at least his thirteenth birthday he passed the note to ron and caressed the wrapped broom his insides clenched in anticipation ron eyes widened as he looked from the note to the broom as soon as dinner was done the two boys were the first to leave the great hall when they were in their dormitory room harry jumped to his bed and proceeded to rip off the brown wrapping paper a beautiful broomstick was revealed it was made of mahogany and had a lovely tail of precisely trimmed twigs on its handle were the words nimbus 2000 it was the broom he had been gazing at in the display window of quality quidditch supplies harry was ecstatic and wished he could be outside right now to try it wicked ron said grinning now that you have that there no way anyone will beat you in getting the snitch we re sure to win the cup this year the weeks passed in a flurry of classes homework and practice wood was pleased with the level of natural skill harry possessed the older boy threw golf balls as fast and as far as he could for harry to catch and harry never missed his new broom was a great help soon it was halloween harry and ron were looking forward to the feast after all the twins had told them about it but it turned into another interesting day it started in charms with hermione granger correcting ron pronunciation of the levitation charm words ron had called her a nightmare as they left class later they noted her absence from their next classes and even the feast parvati patil commented that she was in the girl ground floor bathroom crying then professor quirrel had burst in during the feast screaming about a troll being in the dungeon before fainting as the students were being led back to their dormitories for safety harry convinced ron to find hermione to warn her about the troll unfortunately the troll found her first the boys rushed to her defense and ended up with ron levitating the troll club over its head and knocking it out the professors were stunned by what happened the boys were equally stunned when hermione took responsibility for the incident that led the two boys to accept her as a friend and their duo became a trio a couple of weeks after that harry noticed that professor snape was limping a few times he barely heard him muttering something about three headed beast get past it and bother changing the dressing he wondered whether snape knew of the huge dog in the third floor corridor and why he would want to get past it by the time of harry first quidditch match the three were closer than anyone else in their year harry and ron introduced hermione to harry parents when they came to watch the match harry was quite nervous and hoped he wouldntdisappoint his parents especially his father then in the middle of the match just as he had seen the snitch harry felt his broom lurch and start to buck until he was hanging on to his broom by his fingernails hermione spotted professor snape staring at harry with his lips moving ron she said grabbing the redhead arm i think professor snape cursing harry broom look at him his lips are constantly mouthing words ron stared at the said teacher what what do we do it ll take too long to tell an adult she said leave it to me she moved to the back of the bleachers where the teachers were sitting and set fire to snape robes with a spell this forced him to jump around bumping several other professors including professor quirrel and professor sprout harry quickly regained control of his broom he almost crashed into the ground as his hand grabbed the snitch before the slytherin seeker even saw it his parents rushed over as soon as madame hooch blew her whistle to end the match in favor of the gryffindor team harry reassured them that he was fine as his teammates carried him off the field on their shoulders later after the gryffindor tower had settled down from celebrating the victory ron and hermione told harry about snape why would he want to do me in harry asked the two i dont know harry hermione answered but he has been a bit harsh on you since we started here i noticed he and your dad never looked at each other much less said hello to the other i noticed that too though he and mum were civil enough harry said i know from remus that they were all here together in the same year there seemed a bit of tension at home whenever snape was mentioned you think they ve got a history together ron asked after all your parents sirius and remus were gryffindors and snape was most likely in slytherin maybe but that cantexplain cursing harry to fall off his broom hermione said it a bit too far just for an old grudge let ask hagrid tomorrow harry suggested he been here since before my parents started here maybe he knows something the next day which was a sunday the trio visited hagrid in his hut and asked him about snape and harry parents now you three leave that be hagrid said it not me place to tell that d be between professor snape and harry parents but hagrid harry said we think he tried to kill me nonsense harry hagrid said no teacher here would try to kill a student but he d try to get past a three headed dog harry said suddenly three headed hagrid said here now how d you know about fluffy fluffy ron said surprised that thing has a name yeah he mine hagrid said got him from a greek chappie i met in the pub las year dumbledore borrowed him to guard the the what harry asked never mind hagrid said forcefully that all top secret but snape may be trying to steal it nonsense hagrid said as a hogwarts teacher he wouldntdo such a thing then why did he try to kill harry hermione said it cantbe from a grudge he has against harry dad now you three listen ere whatever is between james an snape is their business and it isntany reason to kill harry i dontknow why snape would try to do such a thing forget about it and forget about fluffy and whatever it is e guarding that between dumbledore an nicolas flamel so this has something to do with a nicolas flamel harry said hagrid just glared at them and refused to say anything else chapter 29 family time disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize the rest is mine and mine alone a n wow i ve gotten more than a hundred reviews already and am on the alert list of over a hundred people thanks guys and gals this chapter is pure fluff and romance enjoy the next morning harry came down into the common room to find ginny again waiting for him this time he smiled and said good morning gin before giving her a kiss on the cheek then he sat beside her she smiled back at him any dreams last night harry looked down at his feet as he blushed yeah all of you and none of voldemort good she said giving him a quick kiss on the lips she took his hand in hers and pulled him up as she stood let get some breakfast they walked down to the great hall holding hands it felt strange but harry was elated to be doing that it ll take some getting used to but i like it ginny smiled at him apparently picking up his thought definitely but i like it too they entered the hall still holding hands went up to the lone table and sat side by side a little closer to each other than usual harry glanced quickly around the table to gauge the reactions of the various people seated there ron was busy eating so it seemed he hadntnoticed their entrance rose had a smirk on her face as she ate her cereal ti just smiled remus and dumbledore didntsay anything though they both had a twinkle in their eyes and a smile on their faces disturbingly the twins grinned and wagged their eyebrows not good harry thought dontworry about it harry i ll talk to them okay at least they re not glaring at me i wonder when ron will notice we re friendlier than usual ginny snorted ron didntnotice it may take a while he pretty thick when it comes to certain things maybe i should tell him before the rest of the school comes back it up to you harry i dontcare if he knows or not it none of his business well i dontwant to antagonize my best friend but i guess we can wait a few days they finished breakfast quietly after that they all went outside to play in the snow that had fallen the night before harry and ginny stayed near each other when ron had gone to use the bathroom the twins came up to harry and ginny and slipped their arms around them sly grins on their faces well well harry sis fred said we noticed that said george the two of you were fred continued holding hands on the way george said into the great hall so fred said is there something we george said should know fred said about you two george asked ginny glared at the two while harry just turned red oh we see fred said and he began to sing harry and ginny sitting in a tree k i s s i n g george continued then comes ginny pulled her wand out continue with that song gred and forge and you ll be wearing bat bogeys for the rest of the day the twins gulped and held their hands up in supplication temper temper ginny fred said donttake offense yeah george said we re actually glad you and our esteemed leader have gotten together right fred said we re happy for you the one you have to worry about is ron at the mention of his best friend harry face fell ginny saw the look on his face and gently touched his arm with her hand hey dontworry about it harry ron knows i ll hex him into next week if he says anything bad and i ll help her rose said coming up behind them causing all of them to jump she placed her arms around harry and ginny i glad you guys have paired up i ve always wanted to have ginny as a sister now she ll be my sister in law harry blushed er i dontthink we re at that point yet sis right rose said a smirk on her face you just keep thinking that the twins and rose then left the two alone ginny turned to harry with a questioning look oh and what was that you said last night about us being together forever harry they donthave to know that yet gin after all we re only twelve and thirteen it ll be years before we can get married ginny looked at harry with a smile at least you re thinking about it harry grinned but didntanswer her verbally or mentally ron soon joined them and they all got into a snowball fight the day passed pleasantly for all the next morning they were all eating breakfast when a familiar eagle owl came swooping in and dropped an envelope in rose lap before landing in front of harry hey artemis harry said feeding her a piece of bacon so how mum rose opened the envelope and scanned the letter within no way she suddenly cried harry mum having twins what harry said how d she found out she went to st mungo for a check up yesterday with dad rose said reading the letter slowly the medi witch did a spell and said there are two babies a boy and a girl she looked up at harry isntthat great harry grinned yeah brilliant we ll have a new brother and sister that evens out the sexes in the family the others offered their best wishes ginny smiled at harry sending him her feelings of happiness and joy for his family new members then she and rose went off saying they were going to research baby names harry shook his head thinking that his parents would already be doing that the five younger gryffindors spent the next few days divided between finishing their holiday homework and having fun hermione arrived back during lunch on the last day of december much to the delight of her friends i really sorry she said as she sat down at the table i really wanted to come back right after christmas day but i had to help my mum she only five months pregnant but she already having difficulty it too bad i at school here as she needs help around the house that okay hermione harry said your mum needed you at least you re here now and speaking of expecting mums mine just told me she expecting twins he then grinned that great harry hermione said hugging him i happy for you and rose then she noticed that harry and ginny were seated quite close to each other she glanced at rose an eyebrow raised rose merely nodded her head once hermione smiled and started to eat that night the group went by floo to potter manor to spend new year eve there lily was banned by her healers from travelling due to her condition so molly graciously acceded to having the celebration at the potter home rose ginny and hermione hovered around lily for most of the eveniong going over name suggestions for the babies the babies were quite active tonight and james couldnthelp but place his hand over lily swollen abdomen trying to feel his new children moving harry and rose did it too pleased whenever they felt the slightest movement from one of their new siblings as midnight neared they all went into the gardens to enjoy some fireworks sirius and james had prepared ginny made her way to harry side capturing his hand in hers at the stroke of midnight as the fireworks started harry looked ginny in the eyes and said happy new year love then he kissed hoping the others were too busy enjoying the fireworks to notice this unfortunately he was wrong oi what the hell are you doing kissing my sister potter they heard ron bellow a second after they had kissed they turned to face him harry looking nervous and ginny looking furious i said ron shouted his face turning as red as his hair what were you doing kissing my sister potter and on the lips it was ginny who answered ron why do you think ron why do you think he d kiss me on the lips she had her arms planted on her hips making her look very much like her mother it because we like each other very much but but you re only twelve you cantbe with boys like that ron said sputtering by now the rest of the people who were in the potter garden were gathering around them including both sets of parents only twelve ron ginny said still glaring at her brother that one year older than when you went with harry hermione and neville to save the stone that one year older than i was when i was possessed by riddle and it the same age you and harry were when you went to save me in the chamber so dontuse it as a reason i cantbe with harry she then grabbed harry hand and dragged him away ron just stood there a stunned look on his face hermione and rose shook their heads and gave him looks of pity ti just looked embarrassed while the twins wore huge grins on their faces sirius and remus were also grinning both sets of parents on the other hand had bewildered looks finally james turned to lily and asked when did ginny start to channel you and molly that earned him a punch on the arm from his wife and glares from molly and rose ginny meanwhile pulled harry into the house where they ended up in the living room once there ginny dropped harry hand and stood in front of the fireplace her back to harry and her arms crossed in front of her chest harry could feel the anger and hurt whirling through her he could hear her thoughts as she fumed that git how could he do that how dare he i older than twelve after what tom did to me harry stepped up behind ginny and slowly touched her shoulder hey he said in what he hoped was a soothing tone she suddenly turned around and threw her arms around him i sorry harry she said her voice muffled as she had her head pressed against his chest i didntmean to blurt out our relationship for everyone to hear like that harry placed his arms around her attempting to comfort her er that okay gin the twins and rose already knew our parents would have figured it out eventually though i dread having to talk to ron after tonight what you did out there was brilliant she looked up at him it wasntthat far up as harry was only a couple of inches taller than ginny right now really oh yeah harry said smiling now it really shut him up and you know how hard that is to do it really did didntit ginny said giggling i wish we could have taken a picture of that she then gave him a peck on the lips as she pulled him over to one of the couches she made harry sit down then sat in his lap her head on his shoulder and her arms encircling him harry gently wrapped his arms around her and leaned his cheek against hers as they cuddled they felt a warm feeling of contentment settle over them i could get used to this harry said enjoying the feel of ginny in his arms you d better ginny said smiling i intend to do this as often as we can and for a very long time to come at least forever harry smiled but didntanswer her verbally he let her feel his feelings of happiness and contentment soon they drifted off to sleep hours later harry mind slowly woke up he felt a weight on his chest and shoulders and couldntfeel his legs he blearily opened his eyes and saw a sea of red hair resting on his shoulder then the redhead moved and looked at him with her gorgeous brown eyes good morning she said to him in his mind still groggy with sleep good morning he answered her mentally a smile forming on his face are we still on the couch i think so what time is it i think it probably midmorning the sun coming through the windows she looked up alarm on her face you mean we slept her all night she asked in a whisper i think so he answered also in a whisper otherwise we wouldntbe sitting together this way she buried her head in his chest embarrassment radiating from her oh my god i bet everyone saw us this was even our parents i guess so we re out in the open in front of the fireplace it kinda hard to have missed seeing us as they came in oh god i wontbe able to face my parents or yours harry gently tilted her head upwards to look at him hey i dontthink we have much to worry about i dontthink our parents would have let us sleep on in this position if it wasntokay with them you think so harry ginny said softly yeah i think so harry said then he pecked her on the lips ew okay ginny said morning breath not very nice come on i think we d better get up before anyone else does and get cleaned up she got off harry and stretched harry flexed his legs wincing as blood flow returned to them then he got up and took her hand come on i think you were supposed to share rose room with hermione he led the way up the stairs to the second floor when they got to the door to rose room he wrapped his arms around ginny again and gave her a hug which she returned i ll see you in a while he said giving her a peck on the cheek he let go and walked to his room he slowly opened the door and peeked in ron and ti were asleep side by side in his bed he smiled hoping his best friend was really getting along with the younger boy he went to his drawers looking for clothes to change into harry he heard ron say softly harry turned around ron was now sitting up on one side of the bed looking at him warily um harry about last night i i sorry for blowing up like that but i not sorry for the reason i did harry frowned you dontapprove of me dating ginny er not exactly harry ron said running his hand through his hair i just thought it was too early for her to be doing that you know what ginny thinks of that dontyou harry asked ron sighed yeah i do i heard what she said last night he sighed again well i had a long while to think about that i guess she isntyoung and innocent anymore i cantimagine what it was like to be possessed by you know who i guess she kinda grew up too fast yeah ron she did harry said he now stood before him a bit nervous did you see us in the living room last night ron ran his hand through his hair again yeah we all did he looked sheepishly at harry look i wanted to wake you two but dad told me not too mum wasnttoo happy about that but your mum said she d have one of your house elves look in on you so we all just went up to our rooms oh harry said he sat down beside ron and regarded him for a moment then he said i love her ron dontask me how i know but i do i care about her a lot i not going to hurt her ron looked at harry then sighed all right mate i guess that as good as i ll get heck i ve known you all my life it might as well be you who gets stuck with her for the rest of her life then ron grinned that ll make you more than an honorary brother harry blushed not for a few more years ron but eventually yeah ron then stuck out his hand good luck you do know you re stuck with her temper right harry laughed as he shook ron hand yeah i do but that one of the things i like about her ron shook his head bewildered you re getting mental mate now go on and take a shower i want to get some more sleep that is if i can sleep over ti snores blimey how can a tyke like him have such a loud snore harry grinned apparently ron you haventheard yourself you were that small once and that loud in fact you still are harry laughed softly as he ducked a pillow ron had thrown at him as he headed for the bathroom harry was glad ron had accepted his budding relationship with ginny now he just had to see what the reaction of the rest of the school would be later as harry came out of the bathroom clean and dressed he found his father waiting for him son i think we need to talk james said placing his hand on harry shoulder harry gulped and allowed his father to guide him into the master bedroom once they were seated on the bed james eyed harry critically then he said so you and ginny huh when did this happen er just a couple of days after christmas dad harry said we got to talking and it came out we have feelings for each other we er kissed and um i asked her to be my girlfriend james shook his head what is it with potters and redheads at least you ve gotten her this early it was only in sixth year that i got your mum to let me take her on a date now do you need the talk harry paled and his eyes bulged out dad we haventdone anything yet but kiss what happened last night was the first time i uh i dontthink we re ready to anything more yet james wiped his hand across his brow that good harry i was afraid that you two had already done some experimenting i know it hard to resist your hormones when you re a teenager maybe we can postpone that talk for another time maybe this summer now you let me know if you get any urges okay harry felt his cheeks warm uh sure dad i ll uh owl you with that harry got up and practically ran from the room that was certainly the most uncomfortable conversation he d ever had with his father luckily it seemed ginny hadntbeen aware of it a n so how was that lol how d you guys like the interaction between harry and ron and harry and james chapter 30 school time disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize the rest is mine and mine alone a n just for clarification from now on anything in italics within quotation marks will be harry and ginny talking mentally to each other thanks for all the reviews woohoo i ve got 120 now the kids spent the rest of the day at potter manor before taking the floo back to hogwarts with remus in time for the arrival of the hogwarts express which was carrying the rest of their school mates they all walked down to hogsmeade to greet it accompanied by remus when the train pulled in to the station neville came up to them and apologized profusely for not being with them during the holidays his parents had taken him and his sister to visit their relatives in america harry and the others brushed aside his apologies and got him to talk about the things he saw across the pond as brits often referred to the atlantic ocean they had to divide into two carriages harry ginny ron hermione and ti took one while fred george rose and neville took another harry did note that ti seemed a little disappointed with those arrangements i wonder what up with him he wondered i think he wanted to ride beside someone else ginny told him oh who harry felt a bubble of amusement come from ginny rose i think he got a crush on her huh how when why ginny smiled at him i dontknow why maybe he was touched by the things she and i did for him this year i did notice he seemed to prefer her company more often but why her and not you ginny shrugged would you mind harry if he had a crush on me she asked softly well um probably not as long as i know you dontreturn his feelings why harry i didntthink you d be the jealous type she said amusement in her thoughts yeah well um harry said intelligently dontworry harry you ll never have a reason to be jealous my heart is yours and yours alone ginny punctuated this with a kiss on the lips oi ron said not in front of me please ginny sent him a smile before giving harry another kiss causing ron to scowl they arrived at the castle before ron could make any other comment they then followed the rest of the students into the great hall for the return feast the four long tables were back in their usual places laden with empty bowls and plates harry ginny hermione and ron sat together on one side of the gryffindor table while rose ti and neville sat on the other side opposite them fred and george spotted katie angelina and alicia and sat beside them once all the students were seated dumbledore stood up and smiled as he looked them over welcome back my dear students i hope you enjoyed the holidays i know a few of you had an interesting time his gaze seemed to linger over the group of harry and ti for a few seconds his eyes twinkling now i know many of you are tired from the long journey back and want to get some rest for classes tomorrow so let the feast begin with that the plates and bowls on the tables filled with food and the students began serving themselves harry and the other new marauders exchanged gazes and smiles as they ate just when everybody was finishing the meal a puff of smoke appeared at the slytherin table when the smoke cleared draco malfoy found his robes replaced by a long flowing red gown with high heeled shoes on his feet and his hair lengthened and in pigtails he let out a yelp and ran from the great hall after a moment of stunned surprise the rest of the school started laughing ti fell of the bench clutching his stomach as he laughed only the slytherin table was silent most of that house members were in shock snape looked around the hall with disgust his glare stopping when he saw harry then he got up and with a swish of his cloak walked to the door and left he ignored his smiling and grinning colleagues after a few minutes the laughter abated and dumbledore again stood up my my he said i wonder how that happened i hope professor snape can return mr malfoy to normal now it off to bed with you all the students all got up and left the great hall still grinning and snickering except of course for the slytherins who were now glaring at the other students after that night the castle inhabitants got down to resuming their academic endeavors harry and his friends resumed their early morning workout and martial arts practice much to ron dismay also to ron dismay harry and ginny spent as much time together as they could meeting up for meals studying side by side in the common room walking together around the grounds to ron bewilderment rose didntseem to mind unfortunately it was also at this time that harry and ginny first experienced a bad side to their bond harry was sitting in charms class watching flitwick demonstrate a new spell when the diminutive professor form wavered and harry found himself staring at both flitwick and mcgonagall superimposed over each other he shook his head but instead of clearing he found himself looking at the charms classroom and the transfiguration classroom occupying the same place in addition to the teachers er gin you re in transfiguration right now right he asked ginny with his thoughts um yes harry and you re in charms arentyou ginny answered yeah so you re seeing flitwick and mcgonagall at the same time too yes harry i am well i guess that means we re seeing what the other is seeing at the same time i guess so this is making me dizzy yeah me too i also getting a headache harry said starting to rub his forehead after a couple of minutes their visions cleared and returned to normal whoa thank merlin harry heard ginny think i guess we re back to normal eh i guess so harry but what was that she asked i not sure it may be part of the bond we can ask dumbledore about it okay harry see you at lunch of course ginny harry said a smile in his thought the same happened twice more that day harry was in ancient runes after lunch when he saw the charms classroom at the same time it passed within a few minutes but left him nauseous for another ten luckily hermione didntnotice it was worse later when he was in potions he was adding some dragon blood to the potion they were brewing when he saw the image of a plant snapping at him in his surprise he dropped in more drgaon blood than was called for causing the liquid in his cauldron to turn purple instead of orange then it started to emit smoke as harry vision returned to normal potter he heard snape bellow he winced and had to control himself as he was berated by the potions professor ron and hermione gave him sympathetic looks though it seemed there was also a suspicious look in hermione eye when the man had finally moved away after vanishing his cauldron contents harry glared at his retreating back i sorry harry he heard ginny say to him harry sighed that okay gin it not your fault and snape was just his usual slimy self no it this double vision thing we really need to talk to dumbledore about it after dinner harry lagged behind to ask professor dumbledore about speaking with him later he was told to go to his office an hour before curfew when ginny wanted to accompany him harry only put up a half hearted argument before agreeing harry borrowed the marauders map from rose explaining that he needed to talk with dumbledore he then went up to his dorm on the pretext of getting to be early and slipped into his invisibility cloak in his dorm he sneaked back into the common room when no one was paying attention ginny joined him under the cloak they soon entered dumbledore office to find the headmaster waiting for them ah harry ginerva he said to what do i owe the honor of your visit this evening harry launched into a narration of what the strange visions they had that day after harry related the incident with snape dumbledore looked thoughtful for a few seconds stroking his beard hmmm dumbledore said fianlly i not sure about this harry ms weasley i have not heard of such a thing happening it might be an extension of the bond that is unique to the pair of you i suggest we observe this for a while as long as you are aware what is happening i do not think it will be harmful to you other than the risk for something accidental to happen with surprises such as what harry experienced in potions harry and ginny looked at each other what do you think harry she asked i dontknow gin i d hate to have something like that happen again ginny turned to dumbledore professor is there anything we can do to lessen the effects of this i not sure miss weasley he answered i will need some time to research this let us give it time and we shall see what i can find out in some books i have about bonds harry and ginny looked at each other again well i guess it better than nothing harry at least he knows and he ll try to figure something out ginny said to him all right i guess we ll just have to be careful harry replied they thanked dumbledore and returned to gryffindor tower on the following saturday harry was surprised to see sirius sitting at the head table when he and ginny came down for breakfast after their regular work out hurrying over to his godfather harry embraced him sirius returned his hug then did the same with ginny why didntyou tell us you were coming harry asked him oh i wanted this to be a surprise sirius said especially for ti harry wondered what he meant for a couple of seconds before the light came on in his head you mean he said to sirius shh sirius said a smile on his face you ll spoil the surprise now get back to your table he could be here any minute harry and ginny exchanged happy looks then walked back to their table hand in hand they agreed that it was lucky they came down before the others a few minutes later ti came in followed by the others they all sat at their usual places and began eating halfway through the meal rose suddenly raised her head and said hey harry isntthat sirius over there at the head table ti head looked up so fast harry thought he might have sprained something the younger boy eyes widened he started to tremble rose placed a hand on his arm hey she said softly why dontwe go ask him why he here come on she gently pulled him from his seat and they approached sirius together harry and ginny quietly followed them sirius grinned when he saw the four of them come up to him hey kiddos he said hugging them in turn how are you guys i bet you re all wondering why i here right yeah we were rose said well i ve got news sirius said specifically for ti come on if you re done eating we should do this outside away from curious gits he nodded toward the slytherin table harry looked in that direction and saw draco glaring at them sirius got up from the table but turned to remus moony old pal why dontyou join us remus smiled of course padfoot the four kids and remus followed sirius outside to one of the courtyards of the castle once there he motioned them to sit down on one of the stone benches okay he said once they were all seated i said i had news for ti it good news actually he grinned as he gazed at ti my boy meet your new guardian me ti looked at him with a stunned expression for a moment before throwing his arms around the black haired man the other three kids grinned you did it then harry said the ministry allowed you to become ti guardian yup sirius said as he returned ti embrace it took a while as lucius tried to block it it was a really pathetic attempt something i didntexpect possible for that slimy git anyway it was just approved yesterday so as of he looked at his watch two hours ago i am officially the legal guardian of one tiberius formerly malfoy plus since your father forbade you to use his family name you are allowed to use mine sirius smiled again so from now on you re tiberius black congrats kiddo sirius clapped him on the shoulder before hugging him again yeah congratulations and great were all uttered by harry ginny and rose as they slapped and hugged ti in turn remus smiled and added his own congratulations so harry asked how does it feel to have a family again great ti said grinning i glad for you ti harry said though i wonder if sirius can be a proper guardian by himself sirius raised an eyebrow at his godson and what do you mean by that you turned out pretty good only because mum was there harry said grinning i shudder to wonder what would have become of me if you and dad had been left on your own or worse if you had to raise me by yourself hey sirius said scowling i not that bad oh sorry sirius rose said entering the conversation that is so untrue i ve lost track of the number of times mum had to shout at you and dad for indulging us harry and rose were now smirking while ginny and ron exchanged looks of amusement hands over their mouths sirius glared at his best friend children and their friends then noticed that remus had his own hand over his mouth probably hiding his own smile hey remus sirius said why dontyou help me with these young whippersnappers remus raised both his hands palms out facing sirius oh no i wouldntdare contradict my goddaughter and her brother especially when they re right sirius scowled as harry rose ginny and ron had now burst out laughing having remembered many of the incidents rose had been alluding to ti stood by looking confused at their actions remus seemed to notice and placed a comforting hand on ti shoulder now dontmind them they do this all the time it just their way of showing their affection for each other ti shook his head still confused i it strange to see that f father never allowed joking around or making fun of each other like that remus smiled well you ll learn that it okay to joke around as long as it not done to hurt the other person harry and his friends had all stopped laughing now though they still had grins on their face sirius sighed it a miracle i haventgotten gray hairs from being around these four for a dozen years now he turned to ti and smiled well now that these delinquents have had their fun how d you like to see the place you ll be coming to live in this summer ti eyes lighted up even more really he asked we can go to your place in london yeah sirius said smiling obviously pleased with ti reaction i talked to dumbledore earlier and he gave permission to take you home today i ll show you around and you can tell me how you d like your room fixed up we ll stay overnight and you can be back tomorrow after lunch ti grinned and asked when can we leave sirius grinned as soon as you ve packed a few things he turned to harry and the others sorry guys i d like to do this on my own you can come with ti another time harry smiled that okay sirius this is something the two of you need to do alone they all walked back into the castle and up to gryffindor tower so ti could pack the rest of january passed quickly after that fortunately for harry and ginny there were only a few double vision episodes none of them causing any damage or embarrassment otherwise their relationship was proceeding well after waking up one morning in the first week of february harry happened to glance at a calendar and noted a particular date encircled in red the 14th he initially wondered why it was marked then he put on his glasses and saw the caption he gulped oh no valentine day is coming he reached out and felt that ginny was still asleep he breathed a sigh of relief he d heard that girls particularly liked that day considering it a special day for romance harry had seen his dad try to make it a wonderful day for his mum over the years he wondered how ginny would like to spend it he d never had a girlfriend before over which to worry about pleasing and enjoying he needed help to make the day special for ginny but who to ask he pondered on that for a few minutes finally he decided to do something he wouldntdo normally ask his mum chapter 31 first valentine day together disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize from the books the rest are mine harry was nervous he hoped ginny liked what he had planned for valentine day as valentine day this year was on a monday dumbledore had suspended classes in the afternoon and allowed the students to dispense with school robes during their morning classes he also allowed the students eligible to go to hogsmeade after lunch however since ginny was not of the age allowed to go to hogsmeade harry couldnttake her there for a regular date so harry had decided on an alternative based on his mum suggestion for their valentine day date which was also their first actual date right now harry tried to keep from thinking about his actual plans as he dressed for the day since he didntwant ginny to know of his surprise yet if he thought about it she d find out as they had gotten very good in reading each other emotions and thoughts once he was dressed in jeans and a black collared shirt harry went down into the common room to wait for ginny after only fifteen minutes their bond allowed him to feel her presence as she came down the stairs from the girls dormitories harry was captivated by her beauty despite her young age and very little make up she was wearing a nice green turtleneck blouse it was still cold outside and a light yellow skirt with a pair of sandals on her feet harry was pleasantly surprised and pleased to see that she had the pendant he gave her for christmas around her neck good morning ginny harry smiled as he mentally greeted her while she was walking down the stairs you look great thanks for wearing the pendant ginny smiled back blushing a bit thanks i glad to wear it you look great too happy valentine day gin harry said walking up to her as soon as she reached the bottom of the stairs and giving her a quick kiss on the lips luckily ron wasntin the room ginny smiled and gave him another kiss happy valentine day harry she pulled something out of her pocket and this is for you thanks harry said taking the box carefully wrapped in paper that was red studded with white hearts he felt a twinge of disappointment from her when he didntgive one in return he restrained himself and kept his thoughts firmly on the gift she had given him i ll open it later come on let get to the great hall i starving she shook her head but took his hand and they walked down to breakfast hand in hand as was their normal way the others were already in the great hall when they arrived while they were eating the mail owls came among them was a large eagle owl that came up to ginny and dropped a bouquet of flowers and a wrapped box into her lap ginny looked at the bouquet and saw it was a dozen red roses there was a card among the roses with her name on it she looked at harry do you have anything to do with this harry i might harry said to her why dontyou read the card ginny opened the card and read it dearest gin i hope you werentdisappointed earlier when you didntget a gift from me the moment we met in the common room i also hope you like these flowers and what in the box but that not the end of your gifts you ll see later for now open the box it the wrapped thing happy valentine day love harry ginny smiled up at harry and gave him a quick kiss then she unwrapped and opened the box inside was silver bracelet with three golden charms on it a quaffle a cat and a heart ginny threw her arms around harry oh harry i love it thanks harry its great you re welcome gin harry said returning her embrace i glad you like it he pulled back looked in her lovely chocolate brown eyes and gave her a quick kiss he wanted to prolong it but ron was already at the table watching them carefully come on harry ginny said handing him the bracelet help me put it on harry took the bracelet and carefully put it on her left hand fumbling for a moment with the clasp ginny admired the bracelet for a moment then turned to harry she smiled at him well arentyou going to open yours harry smiled back all right if you insist she playfully slapped his arm as he ripped the paper off and opened the box inside was a silver necklace with a golden snitch suspended from it harry could feel the same apprehension and fear coming from ginny that he had felt at christmas he grinned and took the necklace out of the box holding it gently it great gin harry said still grinning i like it he then put it around his neck making sure the snitch pendant was resting outside his shirt he turned to ginny thanks gin this is really nice i ll always wear it even in the shower harry grinned even in the shower then ron yelled at him oi harry come on or we ll be late for class hey that hurt he said the last to hermione while rubbing his arm where the bushy haired girl had hit him rose and neville shook their heads at ron insensitivity while ti just looked on a little confused ginny glared at ron for a moment before turning back to harry so see you at lunch yeah but not here harry said smiling meet me in the clearing beside hagrid hut after your morning class is through ginny looked at him curiously oh what have you planned potter tut tut miss weasley harry said smiling you ll find out and no mental peeking i wontlet you know before the time is right they shared one quick kiss and went their separate ways harry caught up with neville ron and hermione heading for charms while ginny joined rose to head for transfiguration ti had already joined his roommates to go to potions as they walked rose and ginny admired the bracelet on ginny wrist rose shook her head i cantbelieve my brother had it in him to be so sweet ginny giggled well to be honest neither did i hey i resent that harry no eavesdropping this is a private conversation oh all right i just missed you already ginny giggled well i ll see you at lunch for that surprise you have planned oh no you re not getting me to think about it so you can get a hint i ll see you ginny felt him turn to concentrate as professor flitwick started to talk to explain their lesson for the day so rose said grinning what did my brother have to say for himself ginny smiled he just misses me you know rose said it gets a bit weird when you re talking to him without saying a word even to someone like me who knows a bit about it oh rose ginny said i so sorry we haventtold you what dumbledore told harry and me that night it was just so strange and well i guess we owe you that much keeping what you know a secret i ll ask harry later about it it all right rose said smiling a little i glad you and harry have gotten together i ve seen the way you looked at him for years and noticed he was looking the same way at you for several months now i hope you two have a nice lunch just dontsit too near the lake oh and donteat the apples as they had reached the transfiguration classroom and it looked like mcgonagall was already there ginny couldntquestion rose on what she meant by that later after charms the third year gryffindors walked down the stairs heading for the great hall harry continued on towards the entrance hall walking fast as he wanted get to hagrid hut before ginny hey harry ron called where are you going the great hall is this way i not going to the great hall for lunch ron harry called back but i heard ginny tell you to meet up for lunch ron said starting to walk towards harry hermione and neville reached out to grab one arm each to hold him back hey what are you holding me for ron asked i think harry has something special planned for your sister for lunch ron neville said what ron said then he turned to harry hey what have you got up your sleeve potter his face was turning red that none of your business ron hermione said it bloody well my business ron said turning to hermione now she my sister and i have to look out for her hermione glared at him she may be your sister ronald but she her own person she alone should decide whom to be with hermione placed her hands on her hips as she continued talking i thought you were okay with harry you ve known him almost all his life and he known her just as long he wouldnthurt her or take advantage of her he just got something special planned for her today so lay off ron ron looked at her a bit embarrassed now um well you have a point hermione then he turned back to harry sorry mate i guess i still not used to it yet have a good time okay harry smiled thanks ron i know you still have doubts about ginny and i i appreciate you trying to protect her and i promise you i ll do the same i love her and will do whatever i need to do to keep her safe with a final nod ron turned and walked away neville gave harry a thumbs up before following hermione smiled and waved to harry before doing the same harry grinned as he returned the wave he then walked out the castle front doors and headed for hagrid hut when he reached the large structure he knocked on the door after a few seconds the door was opened by hagrid who beamed as he saw harry arry it great ta see ye harry grinned hi hagrid oh sorry professor hagrid laughed oh now yeh can lay off on the professor bit when we aren in class that okay professor harry said i love calling you that now um did my package arrive harry struggled to keep from thinking of the contents of the package yeah hagrid said it here arrived just an hour ago carried by hedwig i guessin this has ta do with valentine day an a certain redhead he wagged his eyebrows and winked harry laughed yeah something like that he entered the hut and spotted the wicker basket on the table all right i ll just wait for ginny to arrive i here harry ginny called to him in his mind now what are you planning and what with the basket harry groaned he d have to concentrate better next time he went outside with the basket and saw ginny standing with a smirk on her face all right ginny harry said you win since you cantgo to hogsmeade yet we re having a picnic lunch near the lake i think near the water edge would be a good spot sure harry ginny said smiling that a wonderful idea you know that i love picnics er yeah harry said that why i decided on this wait a minute harry ginny said hold that thought i think someone else suggested the picnic since you just mentally slapped yourself for not remembering that er no no harry said much too quickly whatever gave you that idea tut tut mr potter ginny said shaking a finger at him you know you canthide much from me now with this bond we share we share our thoughts now so donttry to hide things from me harry deflated all right all right i couldntfigure out where to take you for our first valentine day since you werentallowed into hogsmeade yet as i told you earlier i um actually asked my mum and she suggested taking you on a picnic on the school grounds really gin i just wanted you to have a good time today being a special day for couples and all that ginny smiled and gave him a quick kiss that fine harry i touched that you wanted me to have a special day from what i hear most blokes just give their girlfriends a box of chocolate and flowers but you wanted to do something more thank you she wrapped her arms around him and gave him a deeper kiss he in turn wrapped his arms around her waist and returned the kiss with equal enthusiasm they would have continued that way if someone rather large hadntcleared his voice they jumped apart and looked at hagrid in embarrassment their friend was grinning beneath his beard sorry yeh two hagrid said but if yeh go on any longer yeh both may pass out from lack o air plus yer food may get cold in spite o the preserving charm that on it go on now before it gets late thanks hagrid harry said i ll see you in class yeah thank you ginny i cantwait to have you next year hagrid blushed as he waved them off harry and ginny walked hand in hand toward the lake once there harry moved to go down to the lakeshore where a few other people were walking but ginny pulled him back wait harry ginny said why dontwe have our picnic over there by that large oak tree harry raised an eyebrow at her why gin it may be much better by the water just then a wave of water splashed up on the beach drenching the people there who ran back shrieking out on the water the tentacles of the lake resident giant squid could be seen waving back and forth agitating the water whoa harry said maybe you re right let set up under that large oak ginny nodded a bit unnerved by the action of the squid they moved to the tree harry pulled a blanket out of the basket and spread it on the ground in the shadow cast by the tree then he and ginny sat down side by side on the blanket by now most of the people outside had gone in to have lunch harry began removing the contents of the basket and spreading it out on the blanket each item was placed in a covered plate and was still warm there was a loaf of freshly baked bread steak and kidney pie roast beef lamb chops mashed potatoes treacle tart shepherd pie pumpkin juice and two rosy red apples ginny smiled harry this is great how d you get all this food together harry looked down at the blanket to hide his blush er i got my mum to help i think she cooked most of it i really wanted this to turn out well ginny grinned that great harry i touched that you asked your mum for help most blokes would die before they do such a thing harry grinned and handed her an empty plate taking a fork and knife each they then dug into the food they talked quietly while they ate soon there was very little left on the plates then harry reached for one of the apples he placed it on a plate and cut it open with a knife yuck he said moving away from it the inside of the apple was crawling with worms ginny got the other apple and sliced it open it too had worms in it so that what she meant by donteat the apples she muttered under her breath who said that gin harry asked never mind harry ginny said it isntimportant right now what is important is what you want to do now all right gin harry said how about relaxing right here he grinned and leaned back against the tree ginny moved beside him and leaned her head on his shoulder harry then placed one arm around her and she snuggled against him that was really great food harry ginny said the only one who can rival my mum in cooking is yours yeah gin that true i dontknow how i d have turned out without my mum cooking this had been a really great day harry you ve made it really special she leaned over and started to kiss him harry returned the kiss and deepened it he wrapped both arms around her pulling her even closer to him they stayed under that tree for the rest of the afternoon alternately talking and snogging when they noticed that it was getting dark they placed the plates and blanket back into the basket and returned to the castle harry brought the basket to the owlery to have hedwig bring it back to potter manor then they went to the great hall for dinner which was another feast harry went to bed feeling satisfied and pleased that the day had turned out well however the next day wasntso great during divination hermione was insulted by professor trelawney and left in a huff after knocking aside one of the crystal balls after the class harry found the crystal ball at the bottom steps of the stairs and decided to return it to the classroom ron and neville declined to accompany him when harry got back to the divination classroom he placed the crystal ball on one of the tables as he turned around he ran into professor trelawney who had a strange look on her face she suddenly grabbed him and said in a hollow voice it will happen tonight the dark lord will return tonight with the aid of the vengeful servant he rises again more terrible than before beware to the chosen one for this will allow the false one to return for revenge on him trelawney then coughed and looked at harry oh sorry my boy is there anything you want she asked er no no harry answered stunned and troubled by what had happened sorry professor must get to my next class harry hurried out pondering what had happened harry what was that ginny called to him i dontknow ginny it was really strange i ve never seen that happen before do you want to tell dumbledore about it um maybe but not tonight i want to think about it maybe we can tell him tomorrow well all right harry ginny said though she seemed a bit reluctant to do so harry didntanswer her but keep wondering what trelawney had said what did it mean was that a prophecy unfortunately except for the part about the dark lord which they assumed was voldemort harry couldntfigure it out what trelawney words meant who was the chosen one who was the vengeful servant who was the false one who wanted revenge these questions followed harry to sleep that night a n another chapter done surprised by the words of trelawney lol what will happen on a side note i d like to take suggestions for the names for harry and rose new siblings so what should james and lily name the twins when they are born chapter 32 a nightmare that isnt disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize from the books the rest are mine harry woke up with a start his scar throbbing outside his dorm window it was still dark from the position of the moon it was probably just after midnight he sat up and tried to remember what had awakened him it was some sort of dream he remembered a graveyard there appeared to be a very large old house in the distance then his attention focused on a large headstone near the center of the graveyard with a boiling cauldron in front of it there was a name on the headstone harry wracked his brains trying to remember the name it began with an r he lay back and closed his eyes and tried to remember the other letters as the memory returned he sat up again his eyes growing wide the name of the tombstone was riddle tom riddle the rest of the dream started to come back to him two figures had come into the graveyard both appearing to be men one of the men had been carrying someone in his arms he had placed the person against the headstone then conjured ropes to hold that person in place it was a woman dressed in a nightgown and clearly unconscious she had appeared to be middle aged and broad with a square jaw she had seemed vaguely familiar to harry the other man had been carrying a small bundle when that man stepped into the light cast by the fire below the cauldron his face had become visible it was lucius malfoy malfoy had opened the bundle to reveal a strange deformed creature it was hairless and scaly looking with thin arms and legs and a flat and snake like face taking the creature in his arms malfoy had stepped up to the cauldron and lowered the creature into it malfoy then had said some words that included bone of the father and thrown a long white object into the cauldron the other man who harry didntknow as his face was always in shadow had then come up to malfoy malfoy had taken out a large knife from within his robes said some more words then cut off the other man hand throwing it into the cauldron the other man his face contorted with pain had then sunk to his knees finally malfoy had approached the woman tied to the headstone he had cut into her arm and taken some blood in a glass phial he had then emptied the phial in the cauldron the cauldron had then shimmered sending diamond sparks all over then a white smoke had billowed from the cauldron after a long while the figure of a man had stepped from the cauldron as harry gazed at the man face his scar had exploded in pain the pain had awakened him harry shuddered remembering the face that he had seen it had been whiter than a skull with wide livid red eyes and a flat nose that had slits for nostrils harry reached out with his mind he sighed in relief as he felt that ginny had not been awakened by his dream a dream no more like a nightmare knowing that he couldntgo back to sleep without seeing that hideous face harry got up and decided to study he put on a robe and went down to the common room with his book on transfiguration after about five minutes he felt ginny stir harry why are you up she answered sleepily then she sat up what wrong you seem uneasy or troubled did you have another nightmare wait you did i can see flashes of it oh harry wait there i ll be down in a moment bloody bond harry cursed to himself he d have to learn how to shield these things from ginny he didntwant her to worry maybe dumbledore could help him in that ten minutes later ginny came bounding down the stairs from the girls dormitories she came over to the couch in front of the fireplace where harry was seated staring at the dying embers and sat beside him harry come on she said softly tell me about it please it just some silly dream ginny how can it be if it bothers you like this harry sighed oh all right he then proceeded to tell her what he could remember of the dream after he had told her about it she wrapped her arms around him and they lapsed into silence staring at the fireplace together she sent calming thoughts to him finally she looked up at him you have to tell dumbledore harry harry sighed why gin so he can see what a twisted imagination i have she glared at him no you prat that was no product of your imagination you remember dumbledore said you have a connection with riddle you have to let him know what happened he sighed again all right let go and get it over with i ll just get the cloak so we dontget caught by filch he pulled her up and she waited while he retrieved his invisibility cloak from his trunk they slowly walked hand in hand under the cloak to the gargoyle guarding the staircase to the headmaster office once there they remembered that they didntknow the password harry forehead furrowed okay it been some sort of candy we just have to name as many as we can for five minutes they said the name of every kind of candy they knew finally ginny said three musketeers the gargoyle moved aside harry shook his head it had to be a muggle candy ginny smiled well you know dumbledore come on let get this over with we dontwant to be here when the rest of the castle wakes up harry nodded while folding his cloak and placing it in a pocket they stepped on the moving stairs that carried them up to the door to dumbledore office before harry could knock they heard the voice of the elderly man come in harry ginevra harry shook his head in wonder how does he do that one of these days i finding out you and me both harry it just too weird that he knows whoever is in front of his door they entered the office and stood before the headmaster they noticed that the portraits of the previous headmasters that hung around the office all seemed to be asleep good evening dumbledore said smiling please sit down to what do i owe the honor of this night visit once he and ginny were seated harry cleared his throat er sir i was awakened earlier by another dream about voldemort oh dumbledore said leaning forward what did you see in this dream harry harry told dumbledore as much as he could about the dream when he had finished dumbledore was quiet leaning back in his chair and his fingers steepled in front of him harry and ginny watched him for several minutes exchanging worried glances every minute finally harry said sir what happened tonight dumbledore sighed and looked at harry harry remember what i told you last christmas when you told me about your first dream about voldemort yes sir harry nodded that we have a connection through my scar yes that dumbledore said it appears that when voldemort gets very emotional or excited you are able to see what he is doing i dontknow why you are seeing it from a separate view rather than from his view but what matters is that you see what he is doing at that moment harry eyes widened sir do do you mean that what i saw wasntjust a dream that it was happening dumbledore nodded a sad look in his eyes yes harry i believe what you saw in your dream were actual events harry eyes widened even more then then that means that that voldemort has gotten a new body he has returned dumbledore said a fierce look in his eyes something harry had never seen before harry felt fear and horror course through ginny doubling his own he reached out and pulled her in his arms trying to comfort her as she started to cry shh it ll be all right gin i wontlet him hurt you or even get near you ginny sniffed and nodded harry looked up at the headmaster professor what was it exactly that i saw happening in the graveyard dumbledore face darkened that was a dark ritual harry it is a ritual that gives someone like voldemort a new body or form it is seldom done because of the requirements needed what you saw was the sacrifice of the items needed a bone from the recipient father a body part from a faithful follower and blood from an enemy was that woman i saw an enemy of voldemort harry asked dumbledore nodded any decent person would be considered an enemy of voldemort harry but i believe he would choose anyone who had actively fought against him then he could have chosen me harry said i was the reason for his downfall why didnthe use me ah harry dumbledore said it would be difficult for him to get you you are here right now at hogwarts the wards here protect the students at other times you are at potter manor or the burrow which have their own wards protecting these places so it would have taken a lot of planning and time if he had wanted to use your blood for the ritual harry breathed a sigh of relief he certainly didntwant to be part of that horrific thing he sure didntwant to see voldemort in person twice was already enough professor do you know who the woman was harry asked she seemed vaguely familiar dumbledore looked thoughtful and saddened at the same time from your description harry i have my suspicions i would guess that you would have known her i will need to check with the ministry in the meantime you must not tell anyone else about this at least until i can determine who he captured for that ritual he then looked kindly at the two of them i think the both of you should get some rest now you may go back to gryffindor tower harry nodded and pulled ginny up with him their walk back to gryffindor tower was even quieter than their walk to dumbledore office when they were back in the common room harry guided ginny towards the stairs to the girls dormitory but she stopped him and made him face her harry she said softly to him in his mind as she looked up at him yes gin he answered looking down at her what is it gin do you mind if we just stay down here in the common room i dontwant to be in my bed alone not after hearing dumbledore say v v voldemort is back harry hesitated for a moment before answering her having felt apprehension and nervousness coming from her all right ginny let go sit on the couch harry gently guided her to the couch in front of the fireplace he sat down and gently pulled her down beside him ginny curled up against him and settled her head against his shoulder as he placed his arms around her they didntspeak as they sat in each other arms they just stared at the dying fire as they tried to get some comfort from each other presence finally harry reached out to her with his mind relax gin dontworry dumbledore said hogwarts has loads of wards we re safe here he cantget to us it not that she told him i not worried that much about us i worried about my family they re out there not knowing he back my parents opposed him just as much as yours did he ll want revenge against all those who fought against him before i know gin harry said i worried about my parents too especially mum being pregnant will make her less capable of doing magic i just hope the wards around our homes and the ministry are strong enough well i sure dumbledore will inform them about this they ll figure out something after a few moments gin spoke up again in harry mind harry you forgot to tell dumbledore about what happened between you and trelawney oh bugger harry said well it too late now i ll just have to tell him tomorrow they lapsed again into silence soon the slow crackling of the logs on the fire and the comfort they felt from each other presence lulled the two young lovers to sleep after harry and ginny had left his office dumbledore had remained at his desk contemplating harry dream he was not as sure of voldemort return as he had appeared to harry but he thought it better to assume that it was true at least until he had checked it out he knew the portraits of the previous headmasters of the school had all been listening when harry had described his dream a few had reacted to it with dread and apprehension though harry and ginny had not noticed he talked to several of the portraits and they all agreed that it was best to assume voldemort had really returned phineus nigellus had even suggested he check on voldemort last known hiding place dumbledore considered doing just that but first he had to inform some people about it as well as confirm his suspicion on the identity of the victim voldemort and lucius malfoy had used for the ritual dumbledore moved to the fireplace set in his office throwing in some floo powder he called out potter manor master bedroom then stuck his face into the fire when his face had settled to the view of the aforementioned bedroom he saw two people fast asleep on a large bed one with red hair dumbledore called out softly james james please wake up the man on the bed stirred slowly sat up and sleepily looked around the room seeing dumbledore face in the fire he seemed to wake up instantly james potter got out of bed and strode quickly to the fireplace he bent down on one knee and looked at dumbledore image in the fire albus what is it james said softly so as not to awaken his wife it the middle of the night did something happen to harry or rose he was getting agitated now james calm down dumbledore said yes it has something to do with harry but he fine right now i have to talk to you and lily may i come over of course albus james said you know the wards are adjusted to let you in through the living room fireplace anytime we ll see you in there in twenty minutes twenty minutes later dumbledore flooed into potter manor to meet a worried couple as soon as dumbledore was in the room lily stood up and advanced on him albus what wrong lily said anxiously what happened to harry let sit down lily dumbledore said in a kind voice and i ll tell you once they were seated dumbledore told the potters about harry dreams about voldemort especially the second one when he had finished james said why didntyou tell me the first time he went to you albus his voice had an indignant tone after all i his father dumbledore sighed forgive me james i wanted to investigate it further before telling anyone else in addition harry asked me to keep it a secret for a while i didntwant to break his trust in me however if he really did see voldemort regain a body then it is important for you to know about harry connection with voldemort james looked to be deep in thought for a minute then he said all right albus we ll forget that for the moment now how do we determine if what harry dreamed about really came true well the last information i had on voldemort was that he was hiding in albania dumbledore said i will go there and make sure he is no longer there i should have gone there the first time harry said he dreamed of voldemort but the affairs of the school came first now you james need to find out the identity of his victim for that ritual do you have any idea who it was albus lily asked from harry description i have my suspicions lily dumbledore said i wish i could have had a look at her myself but you know that dreams cannot be viewed in a pensieve however james can find out if she is missing who do you think it was albus james said when dumbledore said the name james paled while lily gasped hmm maybe it was her james said two fingers grasping his chin as he thought about it i heard that she sent word by owl that she was ill someone should have checked on her he frowned then if it was her then it a great loss for us she was a formidable witch dumbledore looked saddened i agree james it would be a very great loss you check on her while i am in albania it will take me a few days to determine he is no longer there and to see if he managed to get here minerva will be in charge of the school in my absence dumbledore and the potter parents talked for a while longer before dumbledore returned to hogwarts once the headmaster was gone james turned to his wife and was startled to see tears in her eyes he embraced her and held her as she cried on his shoulder why james she wailed why does it have to be our harry i dontknow lily james said i just thankful that we are here to help him through this i dontknow how he would have managed if we werentaround when lily had cried herself out james helped her back to their bedroom he didntgo back to sleep however instead james got dressed and prepared to do what dumbledore had asked him to do he just hoped dumbledore was wrong about the identity of the woman voldemort had used in his ritual a n so who was the woman in the graveyard chapter 33 a conversation with rose and hermione disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize from the books the rest are my invention harry stirred he slowly became aware that he wasntin his bed he groggily opened his eyes and saw a sea of red in front of his eyes he smelled a lovely combination of vanilla and roses coming from it he then became aware of the arms around him and his arms around someone familiar he fully opened his eyes and saw he was on the couch in front of the fireplace in the gryffindor common room and ginny was in his lap just like that time on new year day at potter manor she still seemed to be asleep a glance at the clock on the fireplace mantel showed it was already after 6am ginny he called gently in her mind wake up sweetheart come on before someone sees us like this she stirred a bit but then tightened her arms around him murmuring five more minures mum okay gin harry said sofly as he moved to lift her off his lap come on it morning already we really need to get up before someone finds us too late potter a voice said behind him sounding much like mcgonagall harry yelped and leaped up unceremoniously dumping ginny on the floor he turned around and was met by laughter standing behind them was rose now laughing hermione and ron the latter face was red and his eyes were hard points as he looked between harry and ginny harry you prat she screamed in his mind why the hell did you do that sorry ginny he said to her as he helped her up my prat of a sister made me think it was mcgonagall who found us oh she said to him er did we fall asleep down here she looked apologetic to him yup just like we did at potter manor on new year eve harry then turned to rose hey dontdo that rose look what happened rose stop laughing but still had a smirk on her face well i couldntlet the opportunity go to waste i haventhad a chance to tease you two yet oh yeah ha ha harry said as he turned to ginny meet you back in ten minutes make it twenty ginny said i need a good shower i need to wash away the memories made up by your dream harry frowned but only said okay see you he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and headed for the boys stairs he barely registered the calculating look on hermione face ginny headed for the girls stairs trailed by rose when harry got out of the boys bathroom he found ron waiting for him in the bedroom their other roommates had already left harry started to dress ignoring ron who was watching him intently finally as he was tying his shoes harry had had enough of ron staring all right ron harry said what is it if it about me and ginny being together in the common room all night nothing happened beyond sleeping side by side okay ron looked at him critically are you sure harry yes harry said forcefully look ron i not ready for more than snogging we re not ready for more than that we ve agreed that we re too young for more so dontworry we re taking it slow all right ron said still looking a little skeptical but why did you two end up in the common room together harry hesitated slightly wondering how to answer ron harry just tell him you had a nightmare and i came down to comfort you why do i get to have the nightmare just tell him will you it close enough to the truth hurry up i starving harry ron said what is it you seemed to space out for a moment sorry ron harry said it just that it s er a bit embarrassing to admit i had a nightmare last night and came down to the common room to relax ginny must have sensed it and came down to comfort me at least that what she said anyway we were so relaxed that we fell asleep all right ron said smiling as he placed a hand on harry shoulder well dontworry i wonttell anyone that you needed to hold your girlfriend hand after having a nightmare harry frowned uh yeah thanks he could hear ginny laughing in his mind be kind gin ginny giggled in his mind all right harry you better not let the twins hear that i ready let get some breakfast when they entered for breakfast harry noticed that dumbledore was not at the head table he frowned and wondered why the headmaster was not there maybe he gone to find out who the woman was harry ginny said to him mentally maybe gin harry said back i just wish he had told us beforehand now we ll have to wait for him to come back before we can tell anyone what trelawney said near the end of breakfast harry saw an owl fly over to mcgonagall she read the note the owl had delivered harry saw her lips tighten to a thin line then she leaned over to professor sprout and talked to her the portly herbology professor became a bit distressed after her conversation with the assistant headmistress professor sprout came down to the hufflepuff table and spoke to one of her students a girl in harry year who had her hair in a long plait the girl had tears running down her face after that and almost ran out of the great hall wonder what that was about ron said it looked like bad news he turned to harry harry do you remember who she is oh honestly ron hermione said she been taking some classes with us since we started here that was susan bones i know susan neville said he turned to harry you should know her too harry her aunt is madam amelia bones head of magical law enforcement oh she dad boss then harry said then he looked at neville she our dads boss neville nodded i heard susan been under her care since you know who killed her entire family in fact madam bones is susan only family harry looked sharply at ginny ginny you dontthink that the woman in the graveyard was madam bones ginny asked i recognize her now harry said i met madam bones once when i was nine you remember the ministry picnic your dad organized at that park in devonshire four years ago how could i forget that harry ginny said a blush forming on her face that was actually the first time you kissed me maybe that when i first fell in love with you yeah well harry said looking down as he blushed himself it was just on the cheek and that was on a dare from fred and george anyway dad introduced rose and me to her then she was actually the first ministry official who didntfawn over me as the boy who lived i liked her merlin i hope it wasnther calm down harry ginny said we ll find out when dumbledore gets back yeah i guess harry said i hope it soon he turned fully to her it time to head for class i ll see you at lunch ginny smiled and nodded see you harry she gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and moved off with rose and colin harry went off to join hermione ron and neville and head for dada at the end of the class harry busied himself fixing his bookbag waiting for the classroom to empty he whispered to his friends to go on to the great hall and he d see them there he then went up to remus remus he asked the professor remus looked up from the papers he was reading harry what can i do for you um i noticed dumbledore wasntat breakfast today harry said do you know where he is remus frowned i sorry harry i don t minerva simply told us this morning that professor dumbledore would be gone for a few days and she would be in charge in the meantime was there something you needed from him maybe i can help er not really remus harry said stammering a bit i guess it can wait till he comes back he hurriedly left and went to the great hall when he got there he immediately sought out ginny she was sitting already at the gryffindor table but stood up when he appeared at the doors when harry sat down ginny took his hand and held it sending soothing words through their mental link to calm his agitated state they ate a quiet lunch together harry other friends noticed this but didntsay anything not even ron later at the end of their class in ancient runes hermione manage to corner harry as they walked out of the classroom harry what going on between you and ginny hermione asked him in a whisper what harry said a smirk on his face i thought you figured it out already after all you practically told off ron we re dating hermione glared at him it more than that harry i see you and ginny simple staring at each other yet your faces show all sorts of emotions really hermione harry said quickening his pace what can that mean well that what i see hermione said wait a minute she stopped a moment then ran to catch up with harry are you two talking to each other in your heads like some sort of telepathy oh come on hermione harry said how would we be able to do that i dontknow hermione said but it would explain everything that it isntit come on harry you and ginny can trust me ginny are you hearing this harry asked her yes harry she replied every last bit of it so what do you think harry asked should we tell her i think we should harry ginny replied she can help us research this bond thing we haventheard anything more from dumbledore about it um i also think we should tell rose everything harry groaned ginny why harry james potter she your sister she already knows we can feel each other emotions she might as well know it all besides she can help hermione with the research about the bond all right all right harry said shaking his head just dontyell in my mind like that we can tell rose too um what about ron hmm why dontwe see how it goes with hermione and rose before we go bringing my overprotective brother into this where do we meet you um there a secret passage to hogsmeade on the third floor behind this painting of a mother holding a baby the password is little peggy all rght harry see you in a bit you re talking to her in your mind again arentyou hermione asked him just then uh yeah harry said sheepishly i had to ask her if she wants you to know what we re doing since she part of this i needed to get her permission ok harry hermione said that makes sense i guess so can you tell me harry looked around making sure there was no one else around yeah but not here ginny also has to be there come on he led her down the corridor and up a couple of staircases once they reached the portrait harry had told ginny about hermione looked at him with a questioning look harry held up his hand wait a minute he walked up to the portrait and whispered the password the woman in the portrait bowed to him and slid it aside the opening led into a storeroom of sorts that narrowed at the other end and continued on into the darkness harry smirked at hermione gobsmacked face he went in and lit his wand what is this place harry she asked as she followed him in the opening closed after her it one of the secret passages to hogsmeade my dad and sirius told me about before i came to hogwarts harry replied it also makes a good meeting place as no one else knows about it or the password to open the portrait just then the portrait slid aside again hermione tensed for a moment before ginny peeked in the youngest weasley entered the secret room followed by rose potter once they were all settled on some old boxes that they dusted off with a good scourgify spell hermione looked expectantly at harry harry sighed and looked at ginny oh no ginny said to him you re the one she asked you be the one to tell her and rose harry sighed again all right hermione you re right ginny and i can talk to each other in our minds i knew it hermione declared then started bombarding harry and ginny with questions in a rapid succession harry laughed slow down hermione i ll start at the beginning some of this rose already knows as we both talked to her about it separately you see it all started after i rescued ginny from the chamber harry then proceeded to tell them everything including their conversation with dumbledore but he still left out his dreams about voldemort and dumbledore speculations about his having connection with voldemort through his scar he pointedly ignored ginny question on that once harry was done hermione looked thoughtful for a few seconds then she said a soul bond huh hmm we need to find out everything known about that it good you included rose in this she can help me with the research right rose rose the three of them looked at rose who had a stunned expression on her face she only snapped out of it when ginny shook her wow rose said i thought what you were doing was great but as part of a soul bond that so cool she was grinning now so that means you re both really destined to be together forever right yeah harry said according to dumbledore pretty much ooh wait till mum and mrs weasley hear about this rose said her eyes twinkling with mischief they ll be planning the wedding harry eyes widened dontyou dare sis we re not even finished with school yet he could feel ginny amusement dontyou start gin why didntyou tell them about your dreams with voldemort harry i didntwant to shock them all at once ginny i ll tell them now he looked at hermione and rose okay there is something else hermione raised one eyebrow but didntcomment harry drew a deep breath and told them about his two dreams about voldemort and dumbledore speculations at the end both girls were wide eyed then rose rushed forward to embrace harry her eyes filled with tears oh harry rose said her voice muffled as she was pressed against harry chest why cantthat bloody bastard leave you alone hey harry said returning her embrace it ll be all right but harry hermione said tears in her own eyes if dumbledore is right then he come back he could try to kill you again they all lapsed into silence at those words harry continued to hold on to his sister well with dumbledore here there no way he d try ginny finally said he better not try i ve got you now potter and there no way i letting tom take you away i ll bat bogey hex him into the next century thanks gin remember what i told you the other night i not letting him get you either okay that it rose said as she pulled away from harry and stood up hermione they re talking to each other mentally again hmm hermione said we ll have to look up this soul bond thing as soon as possible well you two can do that ginny said as she grabbed harry hand and headed for the entrance as for me i hungry and i want my boyfriend beside me while i eat when the four arrived at the great hall and sat down at the gryffindor table ron looked up from his plate hey what took you guys so long i ve been saving your places for over a half hour sorry ron harry said hermione wanted to ask professor vector some questions after class so i waited for her then the moving staircases got us into the wrong corridor well okay ron said then he went back to eating harry heard ginny giggle in his mind that ron for you you canttake his mind from his food for too long yeah i know that harry told her smirking i was counting on it so he d swallow the lame story i gave him they then started on their own dinner chapter 34 bad news disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize from the books the rest are my invention a week later harry ginny rose and hermione were studying in the common room after dinner when mcgonagall came in through the portrait and came up to their group mr potter i would like you and miss potter to please accompany me to the headmaster office right now harry and rose looked at each other apprehension and curiosity warring in their minds harry you and rose haventdone any pranking without us have you no gin you know that there no way i could have done anything without you knowing about it professor harry said as he got up what is this about you ll find out when you get there mr potter mcgonagall said her mouth a thin line which increased harry apprehension um okay professor harry said can ginny come with us under the circumstances i suppose she may mcgonagall said i sure she ll know what it about as soon as you do anyway there was a twinkle in her eye for a moment just like dumbledore had harry ginny and rose followed mcgonagall down the corridors of the castle harry and ginny tightly clasping the other hand harry ginny said do you have any idea what going on no gin harry said like you i in the dark here when mcgonagall ushered them into dumbledore office they saw that there were other people in the office besides the headmaster remus sirius and dad harry cried ginny was also surprised to see james in the office they both noticed that rose wasntas surprised they were what are you doing here harry asked dropping ginny hand and moving forward to hug his father then he stopped short when he saw the grave expression on james face what wrong is it mum harry heart was pounding now ginny grabbed harry hand again and gave it a squeeze no no james said she fine a sad smile formed on his face now she a bit hormonal now but she okay he didntcomment on seeing ginny with his children then why are you and sirius here harry asked james ran his hand through his hair a habit harry shared we came to warn you and rose harry warn us harry asked his eyes narrowing about what dad sirius spoke up for him wormtail escaped from azkaban yesterday we re afraid he may come here for you harry me harry said surprised why probably he wants revenge for what happened to him james said since he cantget to me and sirius he may try to get you or rose harry noticed the short pause before his father added rose name but he didntsay anything wait a minute dad harry said how d he got out of azkaban i thought no one ever escaped before i once heard you say that that was why the dementors were there the dementors have left azkaban haventthey rose said suddenly james and sirius looked at her with surprise how the hell did you figure that out sirius blurted out he turned to dumbledore and mcgonagall with a sheepish look sorry professors then he turned back to rose how d you find out sirius then turned to james who was now glaring at him whoops sorry prongs sir is that true dad sirius harry asked have the dementors left azkaban when both men didntanswer him harry said they have haventthey i bet they ve gone to join voldemort they most likely have harry dumbledore said sadly i ve warned the ministry before about using them they are foul creatures whose only desire is to suck all the happiness from their victims and to feed on their souls they have served every so called dark lord it was only a matter of time before they joined voldemort and without the dementors around to weaken his will wormtail was able to assume his animagus form james said wearily it very hard to catch a rat what about the rest of voldemort followers who are in azkaban harry asked well they re still there sirius said your father had to assign a third of the aurors to augment the guards there then he muttered and that new department head isnthelping much harry i think you should tell dumbledore what professor trelawney said to you oh all right gin professor harry said looking at dumbledore there something i forgot to tell you before the day after valentine day something strange happened after divination harry then told dumbledore about the strange pronouncement given by trelawney harry dumbledore said if you dontmind i d like to make a recording of that from your memory okay i guess professor harry said how will you do that i ll simply extract the memory from your mind with my wand and place it in my pensieve dumbledore said dontworry it wonthurt do you know what a pensieve is he directed the question to the three children um i think it a magical device sort of a shallow basin used to hold memories rose answered isntit a rare object professor very good miss potter dumbledore said smiling 10 points to gryffindor yes you are right on all counts it is a rare device used to hold memories i have one given to me as a birthday gift many many years ago i use it on occasion to clear my mind when the memories clutter it up a problem with one my age i afraid now let me just get it dumbledore went up to a black cabinet standing in the back of his office he opened the cabinet and brought out a shallow stone basin carved with runes around the edges he set it up on his desk and activated it with his wand harry ginny and rose stared with fascination at the pensieve as it emitted a bright silvery light its surface became ruffled like water beneath wind and then swirled like clouds in the sky now harry dumbledore said please come over beside me all you have to do is to think of what trelawney had said that day tell me when you have the memory and i will extract it harry walked up to dumbledore he concentrated for a few seconds then said all right sir i have it in my mind all right harry just hold still for a while dumbledore placed his wand against harry temple then started to pull out a silvery gossamer fine strand from harry forehead once he had it all dumbledore dropped it in the pensieve now that we have it here dumbledore said let see the whole thing he prodded the silvery substance with his wand tip the head and upper shoulders of professor trelawney appeared above the pensieve she said the same thing harry had heard that day it will happen tonight the dark lord will return tonight with the aid of the vengeful servant he rises again more terrible than before beware to the chosen one for this will allow the false one to return for revenge on him harry james said once the memory had faded why didntyou tell the headmaster about this before i forgot dad harry said some other stuff was going on at that time yeah i know james muttered just what was that professor rose asked i afraid it may have been a prediction of some sort dumbledore said after all it came from your divination professor harry eyes bulged you mean she not a fake mr potter mcgonagall said please have some respect for your professor sorry professor harry said he did notice that neither mcgonagall nor dumbledore refuted his statement mcgonagall even seemed to have a slight smirk on her face do you know what it could mean professor ginny asked well miss weasley dumbledore said softly it is obvious that the dark lord is voldemort as to the identities of the others i have some idea but for now i will need some time to check them something then clicked in harry mind wait a minute dad harry said you werentsurprised when i said the dementors have probably gone to join voldemort that means you think voldemort may be back you d only think that if you know about my dreams he turned to dumbledore you told him yes harry dumbledore said i told your father about your dreams i needed someone to know that voldemort may be back who better than your father i assume he told sirius and remus he only told us last night about them harry remus said i haventhad the chance to talk to you about them well all right harry said now my father and his friends know how much of a freak i am he felt a slap against the back of his head turning around he saw ginny standing there glaring at him stop it harry cantyou see they haventsaid anything about that if they had thought you were a freak they wouldntbe here now warning you about wormtail even with those dreams they still care about you just like me so stop with the feeling sorry for myself act stunned by that harry just looked at ginny for a few seconds then sighed he turned around to find the other people in the room looking at them with different expressions dumbledore gazed serenely at them with his usual twinkle in his eye mcgonagall looked stern but had a slight upturn of her mouth his father and his friends were looking speculatively at him rose had a hand covering her mouth as if she was trying to keep from laughing er headmaster he said to dumbledore was my dream real is voldemort really back dumbledore expression became a dark one i afraid that may be so harry as you know i was absent this whole week i was looking in all of voldemort usual haunts and could not find him the disappearance of the dementors from azkaban only confirms his reemergence only someone as evil and powerful as voldemort could call them away well no one in the ministry will believe it james said bitterly especially that cow fudge placed as head of my department dad harry asked slowly i thought madam bones was head of your department james and sirius exchanged grave expressions she disappeared harry james said she sent an owl a few days ago saying she was going on sick leave i checked her place out the morning after professor dumbledore told us about your dream there was no sign of her no one seen her since he took on this pained expression in the meantime fudge placed his deputy minister dolores umbridge in charge of the department stupid bitch sirius muttered sirius mcgonagall said watch your language in front of the children sirius looked at her with an apologetic look sorry minerva but that woman is a real pain harry noticed that the professor didntsay anything about that then he felt a hand on his shoulder he looked up and stared at the hazel eyes of his father looking down on him with concern and love harry i cantbegin to understand what dreaming about voldemort is like but it doesntchange how much i and your mother love you we wish you didnthave to go through that but remember we will always be here for you harry felt a surge of relief over this show of support by his father hug him you prat ginny told him harry moved forward and embraced his father tightly thanks dad james hugged him back no thanks are needed harry he released harry from his embrace but kept his arms around his son shoulders now because peter is on the loose you re going to have to be careful i dontwant you to go to hogsmeade i dontwant you to be alone he looked at ginny well i guess that wontbe a problem just stay with your friends wherever you go james beckoned rose over he placed one arm around her when she came up to them sweetie he said looking down at her i dontwant you to go anywhere alone either it a good thing you and ginny share your classes and dorm you just stay out of trouble okay sure dad rose said oh i sorry to have to say this james said an apologetic look on his face but that means no pranking either dad harry cried in protest then he looked at the three professors in the office and noticed they seemed to have gone deaf and blind for the moment i mean it harry james said he turned to his friends who had started snickering padfoot moony stop that this is serious he returned his gaze to harry i have an idea how and when you do your pranking son so as much as i hate it you ll have to lay off the pranking for now harry sighed all right dad we ll do it for now he thought he heard mcgonagall breath a sigh of relief all right you three remus said it getting late i ll take you back to the common room thanks moony james said he drew his children into another hug and then pulled ginny in too all right take care all of you ginny keep my children out of trouble especially harry ginny grinned ignoring the glare harry gave her and his father of course mr potter i will thanks oh you can call me james james said after all you re going to be my daughter in law of course not for a few more years i hope ginny blushed furiously er thanks um james cut it out harry harry had been laughing at her in his mind he sobered up quickly when she yelled into his mind harry and rose said their goodbyes to james and sirius and to dumbledore and mcgonagall the three kids followed remus back to the gryffindor tower remus said good night and left them at the portrait as soon as they stepped through the portrait they found ron neville and hermione waiting for them at their usual place in front of the fireplace so what was that about ron asked what did dumbledore want harry exchanged glances with rose and ginny my dad and sirius were here they wanted to warn us that peter pettigrew escaped from azkaban ron neville and hermione eyes widened but why did they want to warn you ron asked ron isntit obvious hermione said pettigrew betrayed their family to v voldemort because of that he was sent to azkaban he d blame them for that and now wants revenge that right hermione rose said that exactly what dad said how would he get in here anyway neville asked hogwarts has loads of wards protecting it you cantapparate in or floo in without dumbledore knowing harry dontyou think we should tell them that pettigrew an animagus they re our friends knowing that would help them keep an eye out for him um all right gin but i dontwant them to know yet that my dad and sirius are animagi too all right harry well the thing is pettigrew is an animagus harry said the other three gasped wow neville said what his form a rat rose said appropriate wasntit ron snorted yeah a real stinker he turned to harry so i guess your dad warned you not to be alone anywhere here yeah harry frowned leaning back in his seat he even warned us not to go pranking as that the time we re usually alone but you ll be under the invisibility cloak ron said surely that will keep you hidden i dontknow ron hermione said i doubt harry dad would have told him to stop pranking if he thought the cloak would keep him safe from pettigrew after all he gave harry the cloak harry frowned again that what i figured hermione so i guess for now the slytherins are safe we ll just have to be together wherever we go even the loo harry rose asked smirking well harry said blushing er i know you girls go together there i guess ron or neville can go with me whenever i need to go except when i need to shower one thing for sure harry rose said grinning you and ginny canthave any more alone time you d both be too distracted to defend yourself harry and ginny both blushed as the others laughed chapter 35 a visit to st mungo the days passed quickly the group celebrated ron 14th birthday on the first day of march with a party after dinner the twins managed to get an inordinate amount of food and drink for the occasion hermione and rose combined their money to give ron a pair of quidditch keeper gloves with his name stitched on it neville and ti gave ron a load of chocolate and candy from honeyduke s harry and ginny got him a book on wizard chess strategy which he ended up reading until dawn the next day causing him to miss their morning workout much to their amusement a party was held for remus lupin on the dada professor own birthday on the 10th of march aside from harry and his friends sirius harry parents and the other teachers of hogwarts were there even snape had come in spite of his obvious dislike for the birthday celebrant of course he kept to himself most of the evening though harry noticed the potions professor was often scratching his right forearm james and lily were happy to help their friend celebrate another birthday the chance to see their children even on a school night was a great bonus harry asked his father for news about pettigrew but there was nothing new james however had more disturbing news it seemed the dementors had returned to their posts at azkaban a few days after leaving the ministry had not tried to question the creatures as to why they had left and why they had returned in fact fudge and umbridge had allowed them to continue on with their duties at the wizarding prison harry shook his head at the stupidity of the ministry head he did wonder why voldemort had allowed the dementors to return to ministry control harry he heard ginny call in his mind dontthink about that for now just enjoy the evening harry smiled as he gazed at his girlfriend smiling back at him as she was talking with rose all right gin he turned to talk to sirius about the quidditch league in the second weekend of march ravenclaw beat slytherin in a game where skillful flying overcame blatant attempts of cheating since both slytherin and ravenclaw had won against hufflepuff already this made ravenclaw the team gryffindor needed to beat for the quidditch cup in the final game set in april oliver wood scheduled more practices for the gryffindor team tiring out harry and the twins so thoroughly that they couldntmake the morning workouts any longer the gryffindor team was coming back from a particularly grueling practice saturday afternoon when mcgonagall came upon them she looked critically at their muddy and worn out appearance but didntcomment mr potter mcgonagall said i have important news for you hopefully good news what is it professor harry said a bit apprehensive your mother has gone into labour mcgonagall said a slight smile forming on her face your father just floo called he bringing her to st mungo s what harry said his eyes going wide dad said she was due in april well i believe that twins have a tendency to be early mcgonagall said now professor dumbledore has given you and your sister permission to be with your parents until sunday evening hopefully the babies will be born by then go get cleaned up rose will await you in the headmaster office the password is hershey bar yes professor harry said a bit dazed now harry that so wonderful ginny said to him in his mind as he hurried to gryffindor tower and the boy dormitory you re going to be there when your brother and sister are born thanks gin harry said i wish you could come with me but you wontbe a legal part of this family for a few more years now please tune me out i need to take a shower and i dontwant you to repeat what happened two days ago ginny blushed in her mind as she remembered what he was alluding to she had gone to breakfast early that day she had tried to call harry mentally to hurry up and accidentally saw through harry eyes while he was standing in front of a mirror fresh from taking a shower the glimpse she got of harry developing body had caused her to drop a pitcher of pumpkin juice and spill it all over herself the reactions of their circle of friends werentsomething she wanted to repeat either harry had also blushed when he realized what she had done hermione and rose had both raised eyebrows in amusement as they had known that she was talking with harry ron neville and ti had confused looks on their faces while the twins had grinned at her while wondering why she was blushing after getting covered in pumpkin juice harry showered and dressed quickly after placing some clothes and books in a bag he hurried to dumbledore office he gave the password to the blocking gargoyle and stepped on the moving stairs when he entered the office he found remus waiting with rose rose had a bag over her shoulder also filled with clothes and books hey remus harry said are you coming with us yes harry remus said you know i wouldntmiss the birth of a potter child i was there for yours and rose s you know harry and rose smiled the three flooed over to st mungo s as soon as they arrived remus went over to the reception desk may i help you the witch at the desk asked yes remus said i d like to know the room of lily potter she giving birth oh yes the witch said she on the fifth floor in a private room in the amanda manners ward next to the hospital shop remus thanked the reception witch and led harry and rose to the lift they quickly found lily room mum rose and harry cried together as soon as they entered the room lily was sitting up on the bed james seated beside her lily smiled hello my darlings holding her arms out to them then drawing them into an embrace harry and rose gingerly avoided her swollen belly hey kids james said grinning he hugged both of them and ruffled harry hair then he turned to remus hey moony it great to see you i glad you could escort my wayward kids and be here with us remus laughed you know i wouldntmiss this prongs i know james said then he looked at his watch i know sirius wouldnteither but he is running late ah well come on kids remus take a seat so harry said once they were all seated how are you doing mum it just like when you and rose were born lily said i doubt you care for the details she looked critically at harry now son i know you and ginny are a couple now i hope she doesnthave to come here like me for several years harry blushed mum come on we re not doing anything more than kissing we realize we re too young for anything else well you both haventreached the peak of puberty yet i just hope you dontlet your hormones get the better of you i dontwant to become a grandmother when i still a new mother harry turned even redder dontworry mum we ll restrain ourselves he could feel ginny turn as red as him harry knew by what he was seeing through her eyes that she was lying on her bed in her dormitory reading her charms textbook harry you know it scary how much like my mum yours can get you said it gin i guess it has to do with being a redhead what does that mean potter wait till i tell rose about that remark we ll show you what redheads can do harry gulped no no no i just meant that redheads can be so passionate nice save harry now i d like to show you how passionate i can get when you get back now that is something i d look forward to of course we cantgo forward too much gin ginny giggled i know harry i just like to tease you dontworry i dontwant my mum or yours to think i a scarlet woman just then they both felt her stomach grumble ginny frowned well i think i ll go get some dinner i wish you were here with me right now i know gin i wish you were here with us i just hope my new siblings come soon i ll see you when we get back just be careful all right harry i ll see you at least i can get some homework done without any distractions yeah i know i brought some books too it may be a long wait see you gin i love you harry felt her happiness over his words i love you too harry see you soon harry turned his attention back to the room he was in luckily his parents and remus didntseem to have noticed his interlude with ginny rose however did and she just gave him a knowing smirk then lily suddenly grimaced as she held her bulging stomach james rushed forward to hold her hand another contraction honey lily nodded mutely as she rode out the pain once it had passed she said they re getting closer and closer just then a pretty blonde woman came in dressed in the orange robes of a healer she had a kindly smile on her face lily james it so good to see you again though it been years i never thought to see you again for a delivery she moved to hug the two potter adults james smiled as he drew back from her it so good to see you too sam are you still single she nodded a blush forming on her face james turned to his children kids this is samantha turgis she the healer who delivered the two of you years ago she was barely out of healer training then she was in ravenclaw in hogwarts two years behind us yes that right sam said smiling you remembered i was quite grateful that you trusted me back then to deliver your children even when you were in hiding harry and rose looked at each other they had never known who had delivered them especially rose who had been born in the safehouse in godric hollow sam turned to remus hello remus nice to see you again hello sam remus said shaking her hand it good to see you too she looks a bit like madame pomfrey doesntshe rose whispered to harry are you talking about madame pomfrey the hogwarts nurse dear sam asked having heard rose comment rose turned red as she nodded she the sister of my mum sam replied in fact she was the one who encouraged me to take up the profession lily gasped and her face screwed up in apparent pain oh dear sam said those contractions are coming more often i ll need to examine you she arranged lily and drew the curtains around her bed after a few minutes sam emerged from the curtains she fully dilated james we need to get her to the delivery room you can come with us sam stepped out of the room and returned a moment later with a gurney she carefully levitated lily onto it and arranged the sheets over her just then sirius burst into the room have i missed it he saw lily on the gurney oh thank merlin i haven t you almost did sirius sam said then her voice suddenly hard sirius then noticed her er hi sam long time no see he had a sheepish look on his face sam glared at him then turned to james i see you re still friends with that one well i wonthold it against you we better get going or lily might give birth here sam guided the gurney with her wand out the door james graced sirius with a smirk then followed her all the while harry rose and remus had watched the scene with interest and amusement finally rose asked you dated her didntyou sirius sirius turned to her a sheepish grin on his face yep for a whole year after harry was born he turned to remus who was struggling to keep from laughing now dontyou start moony remus finally gave in to his laughter drawing bewildered looks from harry and rose after a few seconds remus stopped laughing and just grinned sorry padfoot i couldntresist after seeing your face he then sobered up what did happen between the two of you i thought it was getting serious you never date a girl for more than a couple of months sirius frowned it was getting serious then after rose was born the deatheaters were stepping up their attacks especially on aurors and their families i thought it was too dangerous for her to be seeing me i broke up with her even when she didntwant to it wasnta pretty scene we haventseen each other since harry was surprised his godfather didntmake an effort to make a serious sirius joke she still single padfoot remus said softly i think she still has feelings for you no no moony sirius said just as softly if you know who is back then it still dangerous if you say so padfoot remus said harry and rose exchanged glances but remained silent after a few minutes remus spoke up i think it ll take a while for lily to deliver your new brother and sister let get some dinner the coffee shop is just around the corner after their meal there was still no word harry and rose got out their books and did their homework while sitting on the bed eventually they fell asleep meanwhile ginny was in the almost empty gryffindor common room doing an essay for potions she felt harry fall asleep and smiled she was glad he was getting some rest she wished she could also go to bed the portrait opened up ginny quickly drew her wand but sighed in relief when hermione stepped in where have you been ginny asked the older girl it late already what were you doing alone shh hermione whispered as she sat beside ginny i was in the library researching about the bond i found some interesting facts about it is harry awake i d like to go through this just once sorry hermione ginny said he just fell asleep cantyou just tell me first we can tell harry and rose when they get back hermione thought about it for a minute or two then she got several pieces of parchment from a pocket of her robes and said okay ginny i dontknow how much professor dumbledore told you and harry but here what i found hermione voice turned to the lecture mode tone ginny often heard her use on ron and harry the soul bond is a form of magical binding of two people in love which allows the couple to feel their partner feelings and sense their thoughts when they are together amplifying their love for each other it also allows them to share their magical energy though it causes exhaustion the bond is usually created by a magical ritual done by a married couple who have been in love with each other since their teens hermione turned to ginny there a long essay on the ritual itself but i think we can skip that she turned back to her notes after ginny nodded the bond however has been created naturally in several instances all these occurrences have several things in common first a powerful wizard saves the one he loves at the peril of his own life second the witch he saves is also in love with him and would have died if he had not saved her third and most important they are unaware of the other feelings hermione looked up at ginny wide eyed wow that sure covers what happened in the chamber ginny who was also wide eyed nodded wh what else did you find about the bond oh yes um hermione said looking through her notes well according to stories about those who had the bond form naturally they started to experience each other thoughts and feelings soon after the event wherein the wizard saved the witch these naturally formed bonds developed to become stronger than the ones formed by the ritual the couples were able to share their feelings and thoughts over longer distances some were even able to talk to each other over a distance of up to 100 miles hermione put down her notes and looked up again at ginny have you tried talking to harry since he and rose went to st mungo s er yes i have ginny said hermione how far do you think it is from here to st mungo s i not sure hermione said but since it in london it definitely farther than 100 miles wow ginny said looking a bit stunned until today the farthest distance we ve talked over was within hogwarts before that we were feeling each other emotions between the burrow and potter manor that barely 30 miles apart oh that interesting hermione said from the looks of it yours may be the strongest one yet if it is the soul bond you and harry are forming you ll be the youngest couple to form the bond until now the youngest couple was about 17 and 15 years old when they started to form the bond wow that something ginny said er hermione you mentioned those things that the naturally formed bonds had in common where did you get that information professor dumbledore said no one knew the exact circumstances when the bond forms well the exact circumstances arentthe same but they have those similarities hermione replied as to where i got the information i um found a book in the restricted section of the library ginny raised one eyebrow the restricted section how did you get in there i dontthink that you asked a teacher for permission hermione turned red and pulled out a silvery piece of cloth from another pocket er no i didn t i um sneaked up to the boy dormitory earlier and nicked harry cloak from his trunk i sneaked into the restricted section under it ginny giggled you didn t oh hermione harry would be proud of you not to mention ron and the twins hermione handed the cloak to ginny here you give it back to harry the rest of the stuff i found about the bond can wait until he and rose get back after all you still have that essay to finish for professor snape ginny groaned you had to mention that oh all right i ll get back to work hermione smiled dontworry i know you do good work even for snape good night gin ginny grimaced good night hermione harry felt he had just gone to sleep when he was shaken awake by a hand on his shoulder harry wake up a voice said it took him a few seconds to recognize that is was sirius voice wake up kiddo wha what time is it harry said looking up at a blurred image of his godfather it almost noon harry sirius said handing him his glasses it time to meet your new brother and sister harry shot up to a sitting position as he put on his glasses they re here yup sirius said grinning your mum should be in here in a few minutes with them remus was gently shaking rose rose come on wake up rose stretched and grinned where are they how mum james came in the room at that moment your mum fine she ll be here in a bit as to your new siblings sam cleaning them up before bringing them over how was it dad rose asked did mum have a hard time not really james said it wasntas long as when she had you or harry the door of the room opened again this time revealing a tired looking lily sitting in a wheelchair holding two bundles in her arms one blue and the other pink james moved up to her to get one of the bundles he brought it over to harry and rose harry rose he said meet andrew james potter he placed him carefully in rose arms they peered into the bundle to see a pink face with tiny wisps of red hair oh no harry thought he might be mistaken for a weasley and what wrong with that potter oops i didntrealize you were awake already ginny er nothing wrong with that it just that he my brother i want to make sure people know he a potter well all right for a second i thought you didntlike weasleys anymore how can i not when i in love with the youngest weasley all right i forgive you for that remark he is quite cute that he is here comes dad with my sister now this is daisy amelia potter james said holding the pink bundle for them to see harry didntmiss seeing sirius raise his eyebrows or his dad giving sirius a stern look when james had said the name daisy looked almost like andrew and had a tuft of black hair already she opened her eyes and it seemed to be brown she real cute harry i like them both yeah they look cute i wonder though how they ll be in a few months probably just like fred and george charlie once told me they wouldntstop moving around once they were able to crawl oh great just what we need younger versions of gred and forge ginny giggled i d like to see how your parents would handle them harry shook his head grinning mentally i doubt mum would have much trouble she been handling dad and sirius for years and they re as bad as fred and george that true well anyway i going to lunch harry when are you coming back here dunno i ll ask dad harry turned to his father dad now that the twins are born when can we get back to hogwarts i have some more homework to do hey i dontwant to go back yet rose said you just want to get back so you can see ginny well er that is harry said intelligently he could feel ginny laughing and feeling happy that harry wanted to see her james laughed how about before dinner that way you can surprise her and get to eat a good hogwarts meal not the questionable hospital food remus has a portkey back to hogwarts that can be activated by a password since you cantfloo back it ll take you straight to albus office okay that fine dad harry said i ll see you gin meet me outside the headmaster office before dinner all right harry see you a few hours later they were saying goodbye to james lily and the babies harry could feel ginny walking down the corridors of the castle heading for dumbledore office anxious to see him he felt the same suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his back that seemed to come from ginny then he lost consciousness harry james said rushing over to his son who had suddenly collapsed harry stirred the moment james touched him james helped him sit up what happened son james asked is it your scar no harry said getting up something happened to ginny i felt it she was walking to the headmaster office when something hit her in the back and she blacked out we have to get to her remus where the portkey harry looked frantic slow down harry james said how do you know this how d you know it ginny rose touched her father arm with her hand he knows dad trust me he knows if he says something happened to ginny then something did how can he know rose remus asked i just do okay harry said his voice rising we need to get back to hogwarts now remus right now the adults looked at each other bewildered well all right remus said sirius come on if something has happened to ginny we ll need your help james you stay with lily well all right moony james said looking worriedly at his panicking son let me know if you need my help remus took an old leather glove from his pocket and held it out okay harry rose padfoot take a grasp of the glove once they all had a hold of it remus said home to the castle they vanished with a pop a n heheh another cliffie sorry that just the way i see it did anyone like the names of the new potter siblings how about the details hermione found about the bond that just the tip of the proverbial iceburg harry and ginny will find more later now some explanations about a few things in this chapter i found no mention of a maternity ward at st mungo on the hp lexicon so i placed it on the top floor accordint to the same source the location of the burrow should be close to london to allow arthur to use muggle taxis to bring harry and his friends to king cross station without bankrupting him i then placed potter manor near enough to allow the kids to go back and forth without much hassle thanks to all who read this story please review chapter 36 once more to the rescue disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations harry rose sirius and remus landed on the floor of the headmaster office harry immediately got up and ran out the door there was no sign of dumbledore in the office harry wait for us he heard remus call after him but he didntstop harry ran down the moving stairs and reached the foot of the stairs in seconds he frantically looked around ginny ginny where are you he called in his mind there was no answer yet he felt her somewhere in the area within a few miles of him the corridors were empty and dark except for the light from the torches on the wall then he spotted something long and thin on the floor he stooped to pick it up it was ginny wand harry he heard behind him he turned around to see remus and rose coming down the moving stairs look harry said holding out the wand this is ginny s she was here something happened to her she wouldntgo anywhere in the castle without it harry sirius said you said back at st mungo that she was walking here when something happened to her how did you know that it doesntmatter now sirius harry said agitated now what matters is that we find her someone hit her with some kind of spell that knocked her unconscious she must be nearby sirius and remus exchanged a look and sighed all right harry sirius said we ll start looking remus i d say the rest of the school is at dinner in the great hall tell dumbledore what we think has happened we ll need help searching the castle rose why dontyou go with remus no rose said let me go with you and harry i can help look for her sirius looked at harry who nodded sirius sighed all right let go they all headed for the ground floor at the foot of the main stairs remus turned for the great hall sirius turned to harry and rose all right assuming that harry is right and ginny has been stunned and kidnapped who would be the one most likely to do that oh for heaven sake rose said suddenly she then broke into a run back up the stairs hey rose harry called after her where are you going she didntanswer and he turned back to sirius shaking his head well never mind her for now sirius said now back to my question who d attack ginny well there malfoy and his cronies harry said that draco by the way i glad i can go back to calling him by his last name having to refer to him by his first name was just too creepy and familiar okay so it could be our favorite slytherins sirius said but then they d have to miss dinner it would be too obvious anyone else you can think of no no one harry said his thumb and index finger gripping his chin wait a minute you dontthink that wormtail it a possibility harry sirius said but why harry asked he was put in azkaban years ago just as we started to be friends with the weasleys he wouldntknow that grabbing her would make me chase him would he i dontknow harry sirius said wearily just then rose came running down the stairs where have you been harry asked crossly we have to find ginny i know she close but not where at least not until she wakes up i just remembered we have the perfect weapon to find ginny and whoever grabbed her rose said waving a piece of parchment at them of course harry said slapping his forehead the marauder map rose you re a genius rose smiled i know she started to spread out the map before them just then remus appeared accompanied by professors dumbledore mcgonagall hagrid sprout flitwick sinistra vector and unfortunately snape ron hermione neville fred george and ti were right behind them rose quickly hid the map out of sight ron ran up to harry harry are you sure that ginny been kidnapped yes ron harry said please dontask me how i know right now just trust me on this ron gave a small smile when have i not trusted you on things potter are you sure she not in the dormitory potter snape said maybe she had enough of you and is hiding i sure she not professor rose said before harry could retort i was just there harry looked angrily at snape his eyes smoldering with hate sirius was also glowering at the greasy haired professor all right severus that enough dumbledore said we ll have to find her he turned to harry and asked in a kindly voice harry do you know where she last was she was in the corridor leading to the stairs to your office professor harry said ignoring the inquiring looks on the faces of ron the twins ti most of the professors and sirius all right dumbledore said turning to the professors and sirius we ll search the castle severus will search the dungeons and sub levels with argus remus and sirius will take the first and second floors filius and pomona take the third and fourth floors victoria sinistra and lucinda vector please take the fifth and sixth floors minerva and i will search the seventh floor and the north and west towers hagrid please check the grounds be careful we are not sure who has done this but they may be dangerous with that the adults all separated sirius just shrugged his shoulders to harry and went off with remus heading up the stairs to the next floor dumbledore turned to harry and his friends harry i think you and your friends should join the rest of the students in the great hall i have already asked the head boy and head girl to keep everyone inside until we find miss weasley please professor harry begged let us help you you know i can help all right harry dumbledore said kindly you and your friends can search this floor however if the one responsible for taking miss weasley is who i suspect you are in grave danger the risk is too great wait here if you dontfind her he turned to mcgonagall all right minnie as soon as dumbledore and mcgonagall were out of sight harry turned to rose she not on this level sis i cantfeel her i should be able to even if she knocked out bring out the map rose opened the parchment and said the magic words i solemnly swear that i am up to no good the map formed on the parchment the eight children looked at the map searching through the names that strange i never noticed the map getting green harry thought as he searched for ginny finally neville said there she is she in the area of hogsmeade blimey she in the shrieking shack i i isntthat supposed to be the most haunted building in britain ti asked er that made up ti rose said it not really haunted i ll tell you about it some time she seems to be alone ron said harry nodded good i going to her he started to move off but felt a hand on his arm hold him back looking back he saw hermione face let me go hermione harry said i have to get her back wait harry hermione said we have to let the professors know where she is there no time harry shouted who knows when whoever grabbed her will be back i have to go now hermione let go of him tears starting to form in her eyes harry sighed tears forming in his own eyes look hermione i have to do this i cantstand just waiting around while she in danger if it pettigrew who captured her then it me he wants he ll forget about her and let her go when he sees me pettigrew fred asked you mean the git that betrayed your family to you know who george said thought he was fred said in azkaban george said er he escaped about a month ago rose said dad and sirius came over and warned us that he might come and take us for revenge for being placed in azkaban fred turned to harry all right mate he said you can go get ginny but we re going with you george said after all she our sister fred said and you ve already saved her once george said yeah harry ron said we ll all go then we can watch your back in case whoever got her comes back that right harry neville said between us we should be able to capture that git while we save ginny harry smiled and said thanks guys let go wait a minute harry hermione said as she turned to ti ti you should stay here no way ti said turning to harry harry let me help i want to save ginny with you she been a good friend to me harry put one hand on ti shoulder ti you can help you can help by waiting for the professors to come back and telling them where we went that a very important job especially if we get into trouble ti thought about that for a moment then he nodded all right harry you can count on me i ll send the teachers to you as soon as they come back harry smiled thanks mate he turned to the others catching hermione approving smile all right let go we ll have to go through the whomping willow there a passage to the shack that starts among its roots the seven gryffindors went out through the front doors they sprinted across the grounds past hagrid hut up to the whomping willow where they stopped looking at the massive old tree in apprehension the tree was already waving its branches okay ron said how do we get pass that bloody tree ron hermione said language we ll try to sneak past it harry said sirius told me about a knot on the tree that calms it down when pressed we just have to pass its branches oh great neville said looking in apprehension at the tree flailing branches the seven children moved closer to the wildly flailing tree weaving and jumping to dodge the branches then a thick branch slammed fred and george at waist level hurling them back to land in a heap 50 feet away fred george harry cried he sprang back and ran to them harry knelt down in front of the twins and checked their pulses like he d seen on television harry couldnttell if they had broken anything but at least they were alive though knocked out then neville yelled i through the branches i see the knot there got it sure enough the branches of the whomping willow stopped moving the others gathered around harry and the unconscious twins we cantwait for them to wake up harry said we have to go though someone needs to watch over them he looked at rose you stay here sis no harry rose said i going with you i want to help save ginny she been my friend for ages not to mention my future sister in law harry face went red at that last comment well someone got to stay here i ll stay harry neville said walking up to them you four go on and save ginny harry looked up at him and smiled thanks nev you ve been great help already wait for the teachers hopefully remus and sirius will be here soon he turned to ron hermione and rose all right let go the four gryffindors moved to the roots of the whomping willow where there seemed to be an opening peering in harry saw it was the beginning of a tunnel he looked back at the other three all right i think we go through here he ducked down and went into the darkness meanwhile remus and sirius were searching the rooms on the second floor remus i think this is a waste of time sirius said somehow harry knows that something happened to ginny maybe he can find her without us running around like headless chickens remus turned to him well i doubt the headmaster would have sent us out to search the whole castle if he thought harry could help us that because he doesntknow about the marauder map sirius said that right remus said i ve forgotten james told us that he had given it and the cloak to his children we ve better get back to the kids good sirius said turning around the way they had come because rose already had the map and was about to activate it when you came with albus and the rest of the professors as much as i think albus would have enjoyed examining the map i doubt minerva and snivellus would have been as happy to ignore its use for trouble making remus smiled i gather that as they reached the end of the corridor sirius asked remus can mold affect parchment remus raised an eyebrow i dontthink so why do you ask because i caught a glimpse of the map in rose hand before she hid it sirius said there was a tinge of green on the map do you remember what had a tinge of green the last time we saw it remus paled you dontthink merlin i gave it to peter after we made the final one with that they broke into a run down the stairs as they neared the bottom they saw that the entrance hall was empty except for one small boy seated on the last step ti sirius called where are the others ti stood up sirius we looked at that strange map rose has it showed ginny in the s s shrieking shack they went to get her sirius stopped in front of ti did you see anyone with ginny ti shook his head no she seemed to be alone seemed to be is right remus said come on padfoot we better get going let me come with you ti said no sirius said this is dangerous i dontwant you getting hurt but the others ti started to say the others went because we werenthere to stop them from going remus said kindly as he knelt down beside the boy ti please wait here for the rest of the professors you have to tell them where we went okay ti slowly nodded his head okay professor remus and sirius then nodded to each other drew their wands and went out the front doors of the castle at a dead run harry ron rose and hermione walked slowly down the dark tunnel only hermione wand was lit the others had theirs ready at their side after several minutes they came up to the start of some wooden steps that headed upward curving slightly to the right harry could feel the presence of ginny at the top of those stairs rose harry whispered let take a look at the map again rose activated the map and the four gryffindors looked again at the area of the map corresponding to their location all right harry whispered again there ginny i think she in the room at the top of these stairs there a door there looks like she still alone he looked at rose and hermione ron will come with me up to the room while you two stay down here in case pettigrew or whoever did this comes back rose and hermione exchanged a glance then nodded good harry whispered come on ron i ll go first harry slowly went up the flight of stairs heart pounding as the stairs creaked softly with his every step finally after what seemed like hours but was only a few minutes he reached the top step the door before him had a few holes in them through one of the holes he could see a small form with red hair lying on a couch ginny wake up he called to her mentally she stirred sluggishly but didntawaken desperate harry quickly turned the doorknob and pushed the door open before ron could stop him harry rushed into the room to ginny side she seemed to be tied up by ropes and gagged with a piece of cloth he could here some footsteps behind him that sounded like ron s coming closer he knelt beside the bed ginny was on and began untying her ginny please wake up come on gin wake up he said both verbally and mentally his voice growing louder as the seconds passed as ginny barely stirred finally she opened her eyes and gazed wearily at him harry she said softly suddenly her eyes widened as they looked behind the two boys harry look out behind you she screamed in his head as harry started to turn around he heard someone say expelliarmus twice and felt his wand fly out of his hand a yelp of surprise beside him signaled to harry that ron had lost his wand as well a high pitched voice then said colloportus and the door shut and locked by then harry had turned around to face the source of the voice in front of them standing in where he would have been behind the door as he and ron had entered was a short balding man who seemed to have once been plump and was dressed in a dirty striped outfit with numbers on it the man had a haunted mad look in his eyes at last he said a grin on his face you are here hello harry my but how much you have grown you really look like james i sure many people have told that ah but you have lily eyes such beautiful eyes she has a hot anger coursed through harry and he felt the same coming from ginny who was now standing beside him how dare this man mention his parents like they were still his friends he who had betrayed them to voldemort you bastard harry shouted at him how dare you mention them he pushed ginny behind him no harry let me at that pathetic excuse of a wizard how dare he sneak behind me wait a minute ginny stay behind i ll distract him i ve got your wand in my back pocket slowly reach for it he continued talking to wormtail how the hell did you get behind us where the hell were you wormtail was now smirking as he answered him i ve been here all along harry just waiting for you to come save your girlfriend what do you mean been here all along harry asked perplexed now you werentin the room on the map wormtail grinned oh you mean this map he held up a familiar looking piece of parchment i so sorry harry but this is the marauder map what you probably used to try to find your lovely girlfriend with is merely a test map we used to perfect the spells we needed to make the real map it surprising how easily a small rat can get around hogwarts i managed to exchange them while everyone was in class a while ago i ve been here for weeks now watching you and your little group he now scowled you were always together and there were too many people in the castle i couldntget to you harry so i had to make you come to me luckily i found your girlfriend alone this afternoon ginny i so sorry it my fault you were stunned and captured harry dontblame yourself i should have asked hermione or ron to come with me earlier but i was so eager to see you we both were never mind that for now i ve got my wand what do we do all right i ll keep him talking when i say so try to stun him then accio my wand to me and we ll get him wormtail was now smiling i knew once i had here you d try to find her and rescue her all i had to do was make sure you didntknow i was here i hoped you would use the map and you did now here you are now that i here harry said what are you going to do what do you want with me he grinned a maniacal glint in his eye i going to kill you harry because of you i was placed in azkaban if it wasntfor you the dark lord would not have allowed that to happen i served him loyally he would have helped me you bastard harry said you served him loyally by betraying my parents they were your friends and you betrayed them thank merlin they re still alive enough of this wormtail said now that he is back he will reward me for killing you he started to raise his wand now ginny harry yelled in his mind to her as he dove to one side behind a sofa stupefy ginny cried her wand pointed at wormtail then she cried accio harry wand as she jumped towards harry ginny spell had knocked wormtail off his feet harry caught his wand when it flew out of wormtail hand wormtail started to get up almost immediately firing a stunner at ron which missed as the red head jumped out of the way behind the couch ginny had been on then ginny said chiropterus muccus wormtail screamed as large bat shaped gobs of snot came out of his nose and crawled all over his face stupefy harry cried just as the door exploded open hermione and rose rushed into the room they would have gone right into the path of harry spell if rose hadntgrabbed hermione and pulled her down unfortunately they distracted harry enough for his spell to miss wormtail then leaped behind a large four poster bed still battling the bat bogeys coming out of his nose hermione rose harry shouted make sure he doesntcome out behind that bed ginny and i will try something hermione and rose nodded and kept their wands trained on opposite sides of the bed harry and ginny were crouching now side by side behind the sofa harry took hold of ginny hand they felt a sharp jolt pass between them though they felt no pain harry what was that i have no idea ginny let worry about it later right now this is what we have to do to get this guy i ll fire a reduction curse on the bed hopefully it throws the bed away from him once he visible shoot a stunner at him i ll try to do the same okay harry let do this harry could feel the determination in her mental voice merlin that one reason i love her he thought save it for later potter i still want to show you how much i missed you harry could feel her smirk all right gin get ready one two three reducto harry shouted the red bolt from his wand hit the bed and blew it into five pieces revealing the crouching wormtail stupefy ginny shouted a bare second after harry her spell caught their opponent and threw him against the wall he then slumped to the ground totally out what the hell ron said as he stood up slowly from behind the couch he whistled merlin those were some strong spells you and ginny just cast harry harry and ginny stood up and gazed at the prone form of their foe and the remains of the large bed their eyes wide then they looked down and noticed that their hands were still joined they could feel a tingle still running through them meanwhile hermione came up and conjured ropes to hold wormtail ron stooped down to pick up his wand from where wormtail had dropped it as they all gathered in the center of the room they heard footsteps pounding up the stairs remus and sirius burst into the room and skidded to a halt staring at the five wands pointed at them whoa kids sirius said it just us where wormtail over there rose pointed at the bound body sirius eyes grew wide and he gazed at the remains of the bed wow you kids can sure fight i glad i on your side well rose said that was all harry and ginny harry felt a flush on his face he knew ginny was also blushing then he suddenly felt his head swimming and the room started spinning he saw ginny shaking her head and knew she was also getting light headed finally he saw the floor coming up towards him and knew no more a n whew that was one long chapter hope you liked it please review by the way chiropterus is the zoological order to which bats belong i made the incantation up since jkr never told it to us pardon me if my latin stinks we dontlearn it in school where i live chapter37 revealing the bond disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations harry slowly opened his eyes he seemed to be lying down on a bed he wondered where he was but his vision was blurry he turned his head to look for his glasses but started to get dizzy he unintentionally made a moaning sound as he shut his eyes tight to dispel the nausea that threatened to overwhelm him he felt the bed sag as someone sat on it beside him then he opened his eyes to see a blurred face crowned with red staring down at him gin he asked his voice sounding a bit hoarse a gentle laugh came out of the person above him as he felt his glasses being placed gently on his face sorry lover boy the person said it just me his vision cleared so that he saw the person above him was his sister harry saw that white curtains had been drawn around his bed he must be in the hospital wing harry smiled hi sis how re you doing it not me you should worry about big brother rose said her voice suddenly serious it you and your girl ginny harry said where is she he stretched out his mind and then he sighed as he felt her nearby she in the next bed harry rose said asleep just like you were a while ago what happened harry you and ginny just collapsed right after we got wormtail i really dontknow sis harry said i suddenly felt weak and dizzy then i blacked out just before i lost it i felt her getting dizzy too just then madame pomfrey pecked in through a gap in the curtains ah good you re awake mr potter she said move aside miss potter i must examine your brother now he is awake the nurse stepped inside the area and ran her wand over harry after muttering a spell well you appear to be in perfect health mr potter she said for someone who has been unconscious for several days harry eyes widened several days sis how long have i been unconscious well er rose said we went after wormtail sunday evening harry it now afternoon of the second monday after you and ginny have been unconscious the whole time eight days harry said we ve been asleep for eight days what happened to us did the headmaster say anything well harry rose said when you two fell unconscious remus and sirius levitated you both onto a pair of stretchers and brought you here professor dumbledore and dad came and asked us me ron hermione and neville to leave the twins were kept here for observation after they were healed from the damage the whomping willow had caused them we camped out in the corridor all night professors mcgonagall and snape went in as well no one told us anything until the next morning then professor dumblodore just said you and ginny needed to sleep he never gave us a reason for that harry looked at madame pomfrey with a questioning gaze i canttell you anything mr potter the nurse said not without the headmaster permission he did ask me to inform him when either you or miss weasley woke up i must go call him now maybe he ll explain it to you she left them then harry turned back to rose so fred and george are all right oh yeah rose said they only suffered a few bruises and lumps that madame pomfrey cured easily she just kept them in for one night just to make sure they did try to stay more by pretending to still be in pain madame pomfrey gave a wave of her wand and pushed them out of the ward they sulked for about a day but quickly recovered when some of their classmates asked about their encounter with the whomping willow it made them instant celebrities rose laughed now the story gets bigger and bigger every time it gets retold harry grinned that just like them harry where are you he heard ginny call him in his mind she still sounded sleepy dontworry gin i right in the next bed how are you harry turned momentarily to rose ginny awake now i asking her how she feels i feel stiff and wooly ginny replied like i ve been sleeping for a whole week that because you did gin or we did huh we did ginny said why i dontknow ginny but dumbledore might madame pomfrey called him to tell him one of us was awake do you think this has something to do with the bond harry i dontknow gin maybe it does we ll just have to wait for dumbledore harry turned to rose er sis could you pull back the curtains i d like to see ginny for myself rose smirked as she stood up and drew the curtains back from their frame revealing another set of curtains she drew them back too harry now saw ginny lying in another hospital bed morning sleepy head or rather good afternoon he said to her smiling he felt stronger now ginny smiled back hey hello to you too just then dumbledore arrived in the hospital wing and smiled as he approached them ah i see our hero and heroine are awake harry and ginny both blushed er what are you talking about professor ginny said i cantbe a heroine i was the one being rescued well my dear ginevra dumbledore said it was the two of you who captured pettigrew in spite of the circumstances at the beginning in the end it was you and harry who did the deed the ward doors opened again this time letting in arthur molly james remus and sirius dad sirius remus harry said mum dad ginny cried the weasley elders hugged ginny while james clapped a hand on harry shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze they then conjured some chairs to sit in between the two beds dad how mum and the twins harry asked he noticed his dad had dark circles under his eyes she was a bit upset when she heard what you guys did james said but the twins have been keeping us awake so she had little time to think about it now i d like to know how you knew ginny had been attacked and abducted right at the moment it happened harry turned to ginny what do we do gin i guess we ll have to be honest with our parents harry and tell them about the bond after all we told rose and hermione i guess you re right ginny i hope they dontmake a big deal about this wait i ll ask professor dumbledore to help us ask him to call ron and hermione harry she found some useful information on the bond i think it best we tell ron while our parents are here that way he wontreact like he did last new years all right gin harry turned to dumbledore though he noticed the other adults looking strangely at him and ginny er professor could you have ron and hermione come down to join us it would be best for them to hear this too of course harry dumbledore said he turned to remus remus would you please ask ron and hermione to join us i believe they re in the gryffindor common room all right headmaster remus said and he left the hospital wing dumbledore turned back to harry harry i gather you have decided to tell your parents about the bond yes professor harry said ginny and i have both decided that bond what bond molly asked how did you two decide that james asked you ve only just awakened and barely had a chance to talk james molly please dumbledore said all will be explained once remus brings ronald and miss granger here harry and ginny both sat up in their beds the others lapsed into silence that lasted only a few minutes before ron and hermione came hurrying in with remus unfortunately fred george neville and ti also came with them harry ginny hermione said you re both finally awake are you all right ron also had a relieved but concerned look on his face you had us worried there for quite a bit are you two really all right yeah bro ginny said smiling we re fine just a little stiff from being in bed for so long fred and george grinned at them neville and ti looking relieved that their friends were all right and awake smiled at harry and ginny harry also smiled at them but he looked at ginny er gin shall we tell your other brothers and ti and neville as well we ll have to harry they re here already fred and george would badger or prank us if we made them leave i sure ti and neville wontsay anything all right i guess it time to be honest i want all our family and closest friends to know we trust them dumbledore called their attention well harry ron and hermione are here though with a few other people than you intended that all right professor harry said they d find out anyway somehow later ginny and i have agreed to tell them all however could you make sure what we reveal wontleave this area of course harry dumbledore said he raised his wand and warded the entire area casting spells to shield them from eavesdroppers all right albus molly said now what is going on with my daughter and harry well molly dumbledore said i believe what happened to harry and ginny after the confrontation with pettigrew is related to james question of how harry knew ginny was in trouble you see these two wonderful young people are in the midst of forming a soul bond a soul bond albus arthur asked i ve heard something of that isntthat formed by means of a magical ritual a complex and powerful ritual that the usual way arthur dumbledore said but there are a few instances where this form of magical binding forms naturally how albus james asked how can that happen what exactly is a soul bond well james dumbledore said through a certain set of circumstances or by means of a magical ritual two people who have fallen in love with each other at a young age bind their souls and magic together for all eternity it allows them to read each others feelings and thoughts and even sense each other over long distances though i must admit harry having felt ginny predicament here at hogwarts all the way from london is the farthest distance over which i have heard that occur but albus molly said what exact circumstances allowed harry and ginny to form a bond like that without any ritual does that mean that they already love each other that deeply yes molly dumbledore said smiling and a twinkle gleaming in his eye i believe so it would have to be a true love of great strength and depth for the bonding process to begin the natural soul bond forms over a period of time usually over several months as to the circumstances required i believe miss granger has been researching about the bond for a few weeks now and has found some interesting facts hermione face went crimson at dumbledore statement ron looked at hermione in surprise then anger you knew you knew what was happening to them and you didnttell me they told me ronald hermione said to him angry herself at his reaction harry and ginny told me and rose just after valentine day i couldnttell you without their permission ron now glared at harry and ginny why couldntyou tell me especially you ginny is this bond the reason you two are together ginny glared back at ron no ron we are together because we love each other the bond simply formed because of that love and what happened in the chamber the chamber of secrets molly asked what has that horrible place got to do with the bond um everything mrs weasley hermione said the set of circumstances where a natural soul bond is formed was fulfilled by what happened in the chamber that night harry rescued ginny she pulled some parchment out of her bag before continuing you see according to the book magical bonds both by ritual and nature naturally formed soul bonds have several requirements that must be fulfilled in order for one to form first a wizard and witch who are very strong in magical power fall in love with each other at a young age usually before the age of twelve second an incident occurs where the wizard saves the witch he loves from a deadly fate at the peril of his own life third and most important they are unaware of the other feelings at the time of the incident the bond starts to form during the incident usually when they touch each other while he saves her wow sirius said i d say that thing in the chamber sure counts as harry saving ginny at the peril of his own life doesntit so does that mean they have been in love with each other even before last year molly asked they arentjust in puppy love or infatuation harry and ginny cheeks turned pink at molly question dumbledore smiled again it would appear their love is real molly as i have said a soul bond would only form in the presence of true love it is a manifestation of a love that will last their whole lives but they re so young albus molly said ah molly love does not know any age limits dumbledore said it finds you whether you are nine or ninety love at such a young age as theirs is a truly precious thing er professor harry said to dumbledore you said earlier that what happened to us after we got wormtail is related to the bond so what happened to ginny and me why did we get dizzy then black out why were we asleep for more than a week well harry dumbledore said the bond increases the magical power of the two people who are bonded to each other it also allows them to share their magical energy letting them cast even more powerful spells however doing this can be exhausting especially the first time i believe physical contact is required to do it the first time yes sir harry said we linked hands just before we cast our spells we felt a shock pass between us then there was still a tingle after wormtail was down we still had our hands linked only letting go when we started to get dizzy dumbledore looked thoughtful that shock may have been your magical energy being shared with each other did you concentrate very hard on the spells you cast harry ginny um i think so professor harry said index finger and thumb touching his chin as he tried to remember i was worried that my reductor curse wouldntmove the bed enough so i concentrated very hard as i cast it i also concentrated on my spell sir ginny said i d cast a stunner at him earlier and it didntaffect him much so i wanted it to be stronger ah dumbledore said that confirms my supposition in concentrating as much power into your spells as you could you both exhausted your magical reserves that why you both fell unconscious afterwards that also the reason why you both slept for this long your bodies needed rest to recharge your magic your having awakened now is a sign that your magical reserves are fully restored does that mean we can get out of here professor ginny asked dumbledore smiled ah now that i leave to madame pomfrey she the expert on health i dare not step into her domain molly moved then to hug ginny then harry oh harry she said tears starting to form in her eyes as she hugged him fiercely i ve known ginny liked you a lot since she was about eight or nine but i didntknow you felt the same er i only realized it lately mrs weasley harry said his voice muffled by being pressed against the plump weasley matriarch but i guess i was having those feelings for quite a bit longer now harry dear molly said you ll have to learn to call me molly of course not until you re out of school and you and ginny are married harry eyes grew wide er i dontthink you need to worry about that for several years mrs weasley i intend to be working for a living before asking ginny to marry me harry felt ginny mental squeal and warring emotions of disappointment for waiting that long and pride over his mature decision he could hear the twins and sirius snickering somewhere in the background his own father had a smirk on his face molly smiled i happy to hear that harry she turned to her husband say something arthur well arthur said i a bit overwhelmed to know that at her young age ginny is already in a committed relationship where marriage is inevitable however knowing harry as well as i do and knowing his parents i am very happy for the two of them he looked at james smiling well james in a few years we ll really be family james smiled back it wontbe that different arthur we ve already felt like family for years lily and i have never had the chance to say how grateful we have been for you and your family aside from sirius and remus we haventreally anyone else i glad for that hear hear rose fred and george said together grins on their faces everybody laughed at that at least almost everybody as most of the people in the ward separated to talk harry noticed ti sitting by himself on another bed a lost look on his face hey ti he called the younger boy come over here ti slowly walked up to him an uncertain look on his face hey why the long face harry asked er i just not used to seeing so much happy emotions ti said harry frowned i dontthink that the reason ti please be honest with me i your friend i wontget mad ti looked down at his feet his arms behind his back well it just that you let me hear about this bond thing you have with ginny and i not even part of either of your families i ve never really experienced the kind of closeness you all seem to have harry placed a hand on ti shoulder i sorry if you ve never had that kind of feeling ti he said but i d like you to know that since you re with sirius you re a part of this family all of it ti looked at him for a moment then smiled thanks harry that means a lot to me right now then he was called by fred and george and walked over to them a hand clasped harry shoulder in turn harry looked up to see sirius beaming face thanks harry sirius i glad you feel that way about ti he a great kid it a wonder he turned out the way he is when he was raised by lucius malfoy well i glad he with you sirius harry said you need someone to show you there more to life than dating every witch with a pretty face sirius turned red hey i haventdated anyone for the last couple of years they just didnthave what i was looking for maybe because you found her already sirius ginny said walking up to them and sitting on harry bed that sam seemed nice she still seems to like you sirius how the bloody hell did you sirius started to say oh it that bond thing isntit you saw her through harry didntyou yeah sirius harry said she did that one of the things the bond allows us to do it was weird at first when it started to show we couldntseparate what was in front of us from what the other was seeing it was like some strange form of double vision but lately we ve been able to turn from one to the other with some effort now we re getting away from what i wanted to say you should try to ask her out again sirius yes sirius ginny said i think she still cares for you otherwise she wouldnthave minded you being in the same room sirius sighed you really think so he asked well there only one way to find out remus said from behind him go see her padfoot i know you re worried about her being in danger from death eaters because you re an auror at least tell her that and let her decide for herself if she wants to resume your relationship dontrefuse her it not often one finds love these days sirius looked at them with a thoughtful expression on his face all right i ll try after a few seconds of silence he turned back to harry now enough of me tell me oh glorious godson what have you and ginny been up to since you got together been meeting up in any broom closets for a quick snog harry and ginny turned crimson er not exactly harry said being able to talk to each other mentally helps to stave off the need to always be with each other of course we do try to eat together and do other stuff together when we can get the time someone snorted and the group looked to see ron smirking at them with the twins rose neville and hermione beside him amused expressions on their faces when you can get the time ron asked honestly if it wasntfor classes and having to sleep in separate dorms these two would be with each other every single second you know they actually walk around holding hands even while eating it quite disgusting really ow hey what d you do that for he was rubbing the back of his head where hermione had hit him the bushy haired girl was glaring at him honestly ron you re the most tactless insensitive person i know imagine telling on your sister and best friend that is between them ron scowled yeah well they donthave to let me see that especially when they re kissing it looks like they re trying to suck each other tonsils out ow hey cut that out hermione he was rubbing his right shin which hermione had just kicked that for continuing to be insensitive and embarrassing harry and ginny hermione said still glaring at him her hands on her hips really ron ron sat down on ginny bed fuming fred and george were grinning rose had a smirk on her face as did neville neville then spoke up harry i really appreciate being part of the group you and ginny told about the bond harry smiled of course nev you re our friend plus you re part of the new marauders we re glad to have you as part of our little circle yeah fred said we new marauders should stick together george finished that right rose said together through thick and thin just then molly came over to them where percy i expected he d have been with you to see his sister after she d waken up from a week long coma fred and george faces darkened well mum fred said he was studying at a table in the common room when professor lupin came to get ron and hermione and told us that harry and ginny were awake we expected him to follow us but george said a scowl now on his face the git simply asked the professor if ginny was all right when he was told she was otherwise fine he just went back to reading his stupid charms textbook i know it his newts year but for merlin sake ginny his only sister yeah ron said we ve been worried sick about harry and ginny this whole week and perfect percy big head boy hadnteven bothered visiting the hospital wing just once ron molly said please dontsay that about percy i sure he was also worried he probably thought that there nothing he could do and decided to use his time constructively rather than worrying needlessly after all albus had already reassured us harry and ginny were in no danger in spite of her words defending her third son molly mouth was set in a straight line whatever mum ron said i not concerned with that git if he canttake even five minutes to visit with his family molly didntsay anything more but harry knew that percy blas attitude about his sister condition had not set well with his mother he hoped the stuck up idiot wouldntregret it a n so the parents know of the bond at least james for the potter side i sure he ll tell lily thanks to all my latest reviewers hope you loved this chapter disclaimer i dontown harry potter etc etc chapter 3 christmas at potter manor in the two weeks leading to the christmas holidays the trio tried to find out who nicolas flamel was from books in the library unfortunately since the only time they had was between lessons they hadntfound anything flamel wasntin modern magical history great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time there were a lot of books to search from even hermione was getting frustrated harry wondered if any of the books in the library of potter manor might help his mum had hundreds of books both muggle and wizarding there collected over the years harry and his sister had often spent as much time there as playing outside in the grounds around the manor he mentioned that to ron and hermione who were intrigued by the idea hermione even suggested asking his mother but harry balked as lily was bound to ask the reason why they were searching for him i dont think that flamel would be the topic for any homework we have for the holidays guys he told the two and they had quite an amount assigned to them especially by snape and mcgonagall soon the start of the holidays arrived harry and ron said goodbye to hermione who was going home to spend the holidays with her muggle parents who were both dentists the boys along with the twins and percy were going to the burrow harry parents and sister would pick him up from there when the five boys arrived at the burrow molly greeted them with her usual bone breaking hug she asked harry if he was recovered from his near mishap in the last quidditch game harry just grinned and thanked her for her concern he greeted mr weasley and ginny who he noticed seemed a bit distracted he and ron moved outside to allow ron to try harry nimbus 2000 harry laughed at the aerial stunts ron tried ginny begged him for a go but ron refused to come down finally ginny stormed off into the house harry parents and sister soon arrived distracting ginny attention away from harry broom the potter elders accepted a dinner invitation from the weasleys so it was late at night by the time they got home to potter manor potter manor had been the traditional home of the potter family for generations harry had always loved his home it was a three floor mansion set in the midst of a two acre estate the front doors were large double doors set with the potter family crest on each door which opened into an elegant entry way from the entry room a guest would be led into a large living room with several comfortable couches and fluffy chairs a large stone fireplace with a marble mantle and a television set in one corner an set of sliding double doors allowed one entry to the dining room with its lovely wooden dining table with room for up to twenty people the kitchen was through a swinging door opposite the doors to the dining room was another pair of double doors which led to a medium sized ballroom the large library was located beyond the ball room another set of glass and wood double sliding doors led from the ballroom to a porch that had a good view of the spacious gardens an elegant marble staircase led from the ballroom up to the second floor the second floor of the manor contained half a dozen bedrooms at present only three rooms were in use the master bedrooms and the two bedrooms of harry and rose there was also a sitting room at the top of the stairs where several comfortable fluffy chairs were located in front of a large television set and state of the art entertainment system the third floor contained a large playroom with both magical and muggle games a potions lab and a duel practice room the last two rooms were seldom entered by harry for the first few days of the holidays ron was kept busy at the burrow by chores harry spent the first day home telling rose about hogwarts but the succeeding days he spent in the library doing his homework while surreptitiously looking for references to nicolas flamel rose was a bit put out over this lack of attention since they used to play a lot together whenever the weasleys were not with them to placate her harry allowed her to try his nimbus 2000 as long as their parents were not around and a house elf of which four worked for the potters as free elves was watching her to make sure she stayed below 30 feet on christmas morning harry was awakened by his sister enthusiastically jumping on his bed obviously excited to open her presents harry laughed at her bright spirit and followed her down to their living room where a huge christmas tree stood their parents were already there seated on the couch by the fireplace james and lily greeted their children with big hugs and warm smiles harry enjoyed the warmth and joy being with his family brought rose then went to sit beside the pile of presents at the foot of the tree she handed each present to the owner all the while piling her own in a neat stack harry on the other hand immediately ripped each of his presents open as soon as he got each one lily looked disapprovingly at the mess he was creating while james looked on with amusement harry received a wide assortment of candies and sweets from ron a book entitled catching the elusive 1001 seeker strategies from hermione a hand carved wooden flute from hagrid a pair of ankle high leather boots from uncle remus and a leather jacket with the words best seeker in the world flashing in bright colors on its back from his godfather sirius harry laughed at this last one and hoped he could wear it to the burrow his parents gave him a dragonhide wand holder while rose present was a red baseball cap with a snitch flying around it harry hugged his sister in thanks saying it would go well with the jacket soon the potters flooed over to the burrow where they would have lunch with the weasleys even bill and charlie were home on vacation from their jobs in egypt and romania respectively sirius and remus were also invited to complete the day everyone was having christmas dinner at potter manor any luck mate with flamel ron asked harry quietly when they were alone their sisters having gone off together nope harry replied i ve been through half the books in our library already mum suspicious already she caught me looking for him in one of the older books i told her it was for an assignment for binns that should put her off right ron asked i thought so too harry replied then i realized two things one she a mum and they can usually tell when a secrets being kept from them and two binns only gives homework about goblin rebellions ron grimaced i guess that would be bad ron knew from his experience over the years of how bad it was to hide things from mrs potter after lunch the boys got together for a pickup quidditch game molly and lily forced them to allow the girls to play with them so the players were harry ron ginny rose fred george bill and charlie they decided to forego one chaser on beater and the seeker and to divide into two teams by draw bill and charlie were chosen to be captains and the keepers bill team was composed of harry and ron as chasers and fred as beater charlie team had ginny and rose as chasers and george as beater the winning team had to score 100 points harry wasntsurprised by the flying abilities of the two redheaded girls but what surprised him was the level of coordination they had in passing the ball faking and shooting the quaffle toward the hoops it was only through some fancy flying that bill managed to block many of their shots twice harry had the quaffle tucked under an arm as he raced for a hoop only to have it knocked loose first by his sister then by ginny then the girls intercepted several of ron passes to harry even with harry new broom his team was outscored the game ended with charlie team winning by 100 80 i hope you re a better seeker than a chaser harry ginny laughingly said as she flew around well i hope you girls get into gryffindor next year harry said i hate to see you on the quidditch team of another house especially slytherin hey both girls cried out in indignation soon the potters left to make the manor ready for their guests dinner was as usual delicious and well received after an evening of singing christmas carols their guests departed feeling very satisfied no one mentioned the three extra places at the table which had always been empty for the past ten years lily always sent an invitation to her sister petunia her husband vernon dursley and their son dudley who was the same age as harry to spend christmas dinner with them however they never came or even asked how to get to potter manor ever since deatheaters killed lily and petunia parents during lily seventh year petunia refused to have contact with her younger sister except for her and james wedding even then the tension between vernon and james and the other wizards had been almost unbearable yet lily tried year after year to reconnect with her only remaining family aside from her husband and children sometimes lily wondered what would have happened to her children if she and james had died that night that voldemort had attacked them she wondered how her sister would have treated her niece and nephew who were obviously magical considering she and vernon hated anything to do with magic but lily thought no need to worry about that after all her and james will specifically stated that if anything happened to her and james they wanted sirius to raise their children with help from remus she couldntimagine any reason for that wish not to be followed that night as harry was getting ready for bed his father knocked on the frame of his open door can i come in for a while son harry grinned sure dad what up harry eyebrows rose in surprise when his dad closed the door and put up some spells he recognized as locking and privacy charms he seemed to be holding a package in his hand now son james said i have another christmas gift for you i only giving it to you now because i dontwant your mother to know you have it harry eyebrows went even higher james smirked dontworry it not anything dangerous it just something of mine that can help you get around at hogwarts without being seen he handed harry the package go on open it harry ripped the plain brown wrapping off revealing a silvery flowing bundle of cloth that felt strange like it was made of water what is it dad he asked james fascinated with the gleaming material james smiled it an invisibility cloak harry head snapped up to look at his dad a what an invisibility cloak james answered go on harry try it on when harry had thrown it over his shoulders james said now look down harry gasped his feet were gone he hurried to the full length mirror in the door of his wardrobe his head seemed to be floating in midair the rest of his body gone he drew the cloak over his head and his reflection promptly vanished harry removed the cloak and launched himself into the arms of a surprised james thanks dad this is great now filch wontbe able to see me james chuckled oh no he won t i ve used this myself many times to evade hogwarts esteemed caretaker now harry dontlet your mum know you have it lily made me promise not to let you know of this cloak until you were done with school but after finding out from the weasley twins that you may consider restarting the marauders i couldnthelp but give you a way to avoid getting caught harry grinned sure dad mum wontfind out from me i ll keep it hidden at the bottom of my trunk can i show it to ron sure harry james said but not here wait till you get to hogwarts the rest of the holidays passed quickly ron was able to come over to potter manor daily though he had to go home before dinner he was a bit annoyed at times since ginny usually came over with him to visit rose harry noticed this and after a few days asked him ron you seem a bit put out these days when you come over with ginny come on harry ron replied i dontlike my little sister tagging along everywhere with me you didntused to mind before ron we ve been doing this for ages now since we could walk what changed ron raised an eyebrow in puzzlement in case you haventnotice harry we re going to hogwarts now we re big boys we cantspend time around little girls anymore especially little sisters better not let rose or ginny hear you say that ron especially ginny you know how her temper is good thing she doesnthave a wand yet she d probably hex you into next week ron face flushed which surprised harry erm yeah she already got a mean left hook harry looked over at his friend smirking it seems you ve gotten more than a punch from her ron face darkened further okay okay if you must know she more than punched me when she gotten angry at least once as far as we know what do you mean ron harry asked well my mum thinks she done accidental magic when she gotten mad ron replied once when i was six i was teasing her about a beatup old doll she was rather fond of yeah yeah i know he said when harry frowned it not really like me to bully others but hey she my little sister and i was young then anyway she was getting red and had started to tear up before i knew it there was a flash and i had these huge bogeys shaped something like bats coming out of my nose and attacking my face i hollered for mum but it took her hours to get rid of them afterwards she and dad asked her about it and she said she didntknow what she did but was just so angry at me wow harry said looks like she invented a spell all her own would be great to use that to hex malfoy imagine bat shaped bogeys coming out of his nose now that is really an image i d like to come true ron said anyway let forget about my sister for a moment his voice dropped to a whisper and he glanced toward the door of harry room where they were sitting on harry bed have you had any luck with flamel harry sighed nope like i said at christmas no mention of him yet there are so many books here i dontknow where to look yeah ron said i ve seen your library makes me wish that hermione was here harry eyebrow rose to his hairline well she is good at research and all that ron said quickly with the three of us here we could find him faster then we could really enjoy the holidays yeah i guess you re right harry said we could even tell mum we were just showing her the library she is kind of obsessed over books you said it mental that one when it comes to studying and books ron said anyway how about a game of exploding snap you re on harry said after all we still have a few days left the last days of the christmas holidays passed quicker than harry realized it was the night before he was to go back to hogwarts and he still was unable to locate any mention of nicolas flamel as harry was finishing packing he saw his collection of chocolate frog cards scattered on top of his bed gathering them he looked at a few reading the descriptions of the wizards and witches pictured on them when he got to the card of dumbledore his breath caught as he read the text considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore that it he thought he couldntwait to tell ron and hermione to think he had spent all that time in the library when the clue he needed was in his room all along chapter 39 the end of another school year disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations from rose p o v the next morning rose watched as harry and ginny entered the great hall together she noticed that everyone stopped eating the moment the young couple stepped up to the doors for days after the attack of wormtail many people had come up to her and harry other friends asking where he and ginny were even she and ginny dorm mates melinda and lisa asked about them finally she threatened to hex the next person who badgered her rose sighed as she watched harry and ginny walk toward the gryffindor table ignoring the low murmuring of whispers and the eyes following them her brother had never had it easy for as long as she could remember harry had been hounded stared at pointed at whispered about and printed about sometimes she felt jealous of all the attention he got as the bloody boy who lived but most of the time she felt bad for her older brother bad that people couldntleave him alone give him the privacy she knew he craved this was such a time she forced a smile as they sat beside her hey bro hi ginny how are you guys this morning we re okay sis harry said in a low voice though it looks like we should have come down to breakfast earlier when there were fewer people to stare at us dontmind them harry ginny said let just eat i starving and we only have a half hour to class rose giggled oh you are definitely a weasley ginny even being with my brother cantdistract you from your stomach ginny gave her a mock glare dontyou start i a growing girl she turned to harry who was probably speaking to her mentally she suddenly blushed and hit him playfully in the arm rose felt a little strange watching their mental exchange she wondered what harry had said to her to make her blush like that then again maybe she didntwant to know after all he was her brother and ginny was her best friend she noticed that hermione and the twins were watching them with amused expressions as usual ron was too busy stuffing his face to notice then a voice beside her softly said you know i dontthink i ll get used to seeing them like that even after knowing exactly what they re doing rose looked to her right and locked her hazel eyes with the dark brown eyes of neville longbottom who she found was seated next to her she started to feel her cheeks heat up as she stared at him for a full three seconds his face had lost most of the fat from the last two years making him quite good looking quickly turning away she said er i dontknow if i could either get used to them like that i mean she could see the questioning look on neville face out of the corner of her eye er have you tried the scones she said not looking at him they re still warm um okay neville said still looking strangely at her i ll try some he reached over and got one buttering it rose continued to eat turning her attention to watching harry and ginny as they ate one handed finally the school bell rang indicating it was time to head for the day first class rose quickly wiped her mouth and stood up she turned to ginny come on ginny it time for class you ve got a week work to catch up on you can see my brother later she leaned closer to her friend anyway you can still talk to each other wherever you are she whispered with a sigh ginny got up gave harry a peck on the cheek and moved to her side rose looked back at neville for a split second thankfully he was talking with seamus finnegan she then left the great hall with ginny headed for the dungeons later that night rose was lying down in her bed thinking of the day that had gone by what was i thinking staring at him like that it like i was one of those fangirls who subscribe to witch weekly thank merlin he doesntknow i sent that valentine card to him last year it was terrible when that dwarf tackled him how could i have done that she turned over and hit her pillow in frustration i thought i was over him after that but lately i ve blushed every time i see him what do i do thank merlin we stopped those early morning workouts so i only see him at meal times and in the common room maybe i should eat earlier she turned over again and fell back on her pillow with a sigh why did i have to develop a crush on neville bloody longbottom he probably just thinks of me as harry little sister once more she turned on to her stomach and smirked into her pillow at least it not ron eww imagine what ginny would think of that on top of that there are these visions why is it i see events of little importance why didnti see what happened to ginny agghhh i really need to talk to someone about it but not ginny harry will find out and i dontwant him to yet she thought about who she could talk to of course she thought who else to talk to but gryffindor own resident genius hermione granger i ll talk to her she ll be able to keep it a secret together we can figure this out with that thought rose fell asleep march soon passed into april with the two week easter holidays starting in the last week of march harry insisted that he and his friends resume their early morning workouts and martial arts sparring rose was reluctant to continue much to the surprise of harry and ginny but she eventually agreed to join them to celebrate the twins 16th birthday the new marauders charmed the slytherin common room and dorms bright pink snape was furious but had no proof as to who the perpetrators were it took him three days to undo the charm a few days after easter hermione received wonderful news her mother had given birth to a boy her parents had named him daniel anthony granger hermione was ecstatic her friends all offered their congratulations dumbledore allowed her to go home for the weekend to see her new brother the third saturday of april was the quidditch finals match between gryffindor and ravenclaw slytherin was already out of the running due to harry spectacular catch of the snitch in the match played on the saturday before valentine day harry woke up that day to a lovely spring dawn peeking through the windows of gryffindor tower perfect flying weather he reached out with his mind and found ginny still asleep he smiled and got up to get ready as he bounded into the gryffindor common room he felt her finally stir good morning ginny good morning harry are you ready for the game harry gave a nervous laugh in his mind i guess nice weather for flying though go on and have breakfast she told him you ll need it i ll catch up with you in the great hall all right gin i ll see you in a bit he went to the great hall and found the rest of the team already sitting down at their table oliver wood turned around to see him finally the seventh year said it good you showed up harry you ll need a lot of energy to keep up with the ravenclaw seeker cho chang even though she a fourth year she as small as you harry said all right all right he started putting some eggs and bacon on his plate he forced himself to place it in his mouth and swallow in spite of the churning in his stomach from the usual nervousness he felt before a game eat slowly harry ginny voice sounded in his head you ll be able to keep it in you do need your strength i know ginny i trying i ll be better after i up in the air are you coming down soon in a bit harry i just waiting for rose however from the looks of wood i think you ll be going to the pitch early for his usual pep talk harry groaned in his mind sure enough 10 minutes later oliver stood up from the table and turned to the rest of the team all right let get going to the quidditch pitch we need to get ready fred turned to him oi oliver we still have more than an hour before the game what the rush of course after three years with wood he knew his appeal was useless well oliver answered we need all that time come on everybody up grumbling the gryffindor team exited the great hall and walked across the grounds to the pitch they changed to their uniforms in the lockers then wood made them sit down and started to give them a speech on how this match was the most important of the year and it was also his last as he was finishing hogwarts he droned on and on causing harry to get drowsy harry was awakened by fred nudging him in the ribs harry it time mate as the teams moved onto the quidditch field harry heard lee jordan voice call out each of the team members names madame hooch signaled the start of the match and they were off harry immediately took a position a hundred feet above the pitch taking note of the action while searching for the pitch a little ways below him he saw the ravenclaw seeker cho chang who seemed to be watching him so that cho chang he thought idly as he gazed at the asian girl she pretty but not as pretty as ginny my my mr potter you should get a reward for that last remark he heard ginny say in his mind just wait until after the game now catch the snitch it ll be lunch soon yes ma am harry smirked he started looking for the snitch even more intently ignoring cho much to ginny satisfaction even then the match dragged on after two hours harry chanced a glance at the score it was 130 50 in favor of gryffindor suddenly ginny shouted in harry mind harry over to your right about 50 feet above you harry looked quickly where she indicated and saw the snitch floating in the middle of the pitch unfortunately cho chang saw it as well and she was already speeding for it harry flattened himself against the shaft of his nimbus and sped after her urging it faster he soon came up right beside the older girl they were neck and neck as they chased the snitch which sped away from them towards the gryffindor goal hoops as harry and cho neared the gryffindor hoops harry could see wood was shouting dontlet her get it potter he cried forger being a gentleman that last part horrified harry he surely couldntpush a girl around do what wood says harry ginny shouted into his mind causing him to flinch get that snitch any way you can bloody hell he muttered and starting elbowing cho aside he stretched as his nimbus finally overtook cho broom then he felt the feathery touch of the fluttering golden ball and closed his fist around it harry potter catches the snitch lee jordan cried gryffindor wins gryffindor is the quidditch champ harry flew down towards wood the rest of the team streaked towards them and they all met together by the gryffindor goal hoops pandemonium broke out as the rest of their house poured onto the pitch they started hoisting the team onto their shoulders harry scanned the crowd searching for his girlfriend he felt her presence nearby then he spotted her red hair as she ran up to the team harry immediately jumped down from their supporters ginny then leaped at him laughing both out loud and in their shared mental link then she kissed him hard whistles and catcalls sounded out around them both of them blushed the party that followed took all day and lasted up to midnight when mcgonagall came up in a tartan dressing gown and demanded that everyone go to bed the following sunday harry rose and their friends went to potter manor for the christening of the potter twins they went to a small church just outside of london for the ceremony frank longbottom stood as andrew godfather while arthur weasley stood as daisy godfather molly stood as andrew godmother surprisingly sam turgis turned up and stood as godmother to daisy even more surprising was that she arrived at the church walking hand in hand with sirius harry couldnthelp but smile at the goofy grin on his godfather face they all went to potter manor for a good lunch to celebrate the day event harry ginny rose and hermione spent most of the time with the twins who were well behaved throughout the affair another surprise of the day for harry was seeing ron and ti talking during lunch from the smile on ron face and his wild gesturing harry thought they were discussing their mutual interest in the chuddley cannons he noticed that ti smile seemed a bit forced but decided it was just because he was still uncomfortable around ron after that day the days passed quickly in a flurry of classes and meals as the school year wound down toward the end of term exams which were set for the first week of june the teachers all seemed to band together to keep them busy with tons of homework and class assignments harry thanked all the known deities and merlin for the bond as he and ginny seldom got time to spend with each other during those hectic weeks of revising and doing homework it allowed them to talk with each other even when separated by several floors one thing he did notice was that snape seemed a bit tired at times he occasionally saw the potions professor rubbing his left arm again harry wondered about that but the pressure of studying drove it out of his mind on the first sunday of june the day before the start of exams harry and his friends came down to the great hall as usual for breakfast as they sat down they noticed a commotion at the slytherin table harry looked over and saw several people talking to draco who was actually beaming wonder what up with the git he seems too happy for it to be good you re right harry ginny said in his mind he does seem very happy about something just then a large owl similar to artemis swooped down and dropped a package onto draco lap draco smile grew wider when he had opened the package to show a set of dragon hide boots he turned to look at someone at the gryffindor table a smirk on his face harry turned to see who draco was looking at it was ti who was seated a couple of places from him the expression on ti face was one of sadness and longing which surprised harry hey ti harry said what wrong what the matter ti turned to harry for a moment before looking down at his plate n nothing harry it nothing harry got up and moved to sit down beside ti placing a hand gently on his shoulder i dontthink it nothing ti harry said softly if it has something to do with your ex brother then it has to be something why is draco so happy he seems to be taunting you ti sighed well um he happy cause it his birthday oh harry said then that owl just delivered his birthday present ti said sighing again that the malfoy family eagle owl caesar if it his birthday harry said why would he be taunting you wait a minute ti when is your birthday er um ti said april 24th he looked down at the table again what harry said a bit loud he felt ginny surprise and dismay double his own he realized that that had been the day of the twins christening their other friends looked at them wondering what was going on ginny got up from where she had been sitting beside harry previous place and moved to sit on ti other side why didntyou tell us ti ginny said softly we should have known that okay ti said forcing a smile it was the christening of harry and rose new brother and sister i didntwant to bother anyone i just pretended the party was also for me harry squeezed ti shoulder gently it not okay ti you re our friend we would have celebrated your birthday at dinner by now the other new marauders had come up to them hey harry ti neville asked what wrong nev i afraid we ve been terrible friends to ti harry said it seems we forgot his birthday it was april 24 oh my rose said ti why didntyou say anything ti looked down at the table again i just didntwant anyone to make a fuss nonsense hermione said a birthday should be celebrated with family and friends exactly harry said we need to make it up to you ti he turned to the others his voice lowering plus it seems to be draco birthday i cantthink of a better belated present to ti than to give draco a special present the others looked at each other smirks breaking out on their faces ooh i like that fred said definitely george said what the plan harry come on harry said beckoning to the doors he turned to rose sis please get the map we need a place for some private planning he got up and headed for the doors exiting the great hall his friends gathered around him including ti they ignored the smirk on draco face as they walked by that evening as the students gathered for dinner harry and his friends were waiting for something to happen dumbledore stood up and said tuck in as the students began eating draco suddenly got up and jumped onto the table a puff of smoke covered him momentarily when it cleared he was a she dressed in a low cut dress with long blonde hair makeup and breasts the size of melons he she started singing i am pretty oh so pretty in a surprisingly good voice laughter rang throughout the hall plus some catcalls from the older students draco sang the whole song then jumped down from the table and ran toward the head table once there he she knelt in front of snape proclaiming his her undying love and begged him to marry him her snape looked torn between horror disgust and anger finally he wiped out his wand and yelled finite incantum draco changed back to normal he stared wide eyed around him as laughter continued to sound around the hall after a few seconds he bolted from the great hall harry and his friends were laughing hard especially ti harry felt a slight pressure on his mind he looked up at the teacher table and saw snape staring malevolently at him harry shrugged his shoulders as the rest of the students settled down to eat again later the new marauders trailed behind the rest of their house discussing the prank in low voices i really liked that part about him proposing marriage to snape ron said yeah that was hilarious rose said grinning she turned to ti that was a good idea ti ti smiled well i thought it fitting as he draco godfather i certainly dontwant him married to professor lupin or professor dumbledore he shuddered they all laughed by now they were in front of the fat lady portrait hey ti said where are fred and george oh they re around here somewhere harry answered vaguely go on ti let get inside okay ti said turning to the fat lady to give the password lions are king she smiled as she swung her portrait open as soon as ti stepped inside a great cry of surprise sounded in the gryffindor common room ti stared wide eyed as he beheld the brightly decorated room with a banner saying happy birthday ti strung over the fireplace he turned to his friends tears in his eyes you you did this yeah harry said we figured it a great reason to have a party we re sorry we didntknow earlier come on everyone wants to greet you ti moved deeper into the room where the rest of the house crowded in to greet him causing the young boy to grin a table in one corner was groaning with all sorts of food and several cases of butterbeer and jugs of pumpkin juice harry steered ti toward the fireplace where a pile of brightly colored packages lay on a small table the rest of the new marauders followed them wha what this ti asked as he stared at the pile they re your birthday presents harry said a smile on his face but but how did you ti stammered tears of joy forming in his eyes ah that my boy is a secret fred said grinning you dontneed to know george said grinning like his twin come on ti rose said open them ti opened the gifts slowly carefully handling each revealed present like they were made out of glass harry and ginny gave him a wand holster for his wrist ron gave him a shirt with the chudley cannons logo on it and a wizard picture of a chaser on the back hermione gave him a book called the black family history rose and neville each gave him a bunch of honeyduke chocolates and candy the twins gave him a bunch of zonko joke products some gifts apparently had been sent in from people outside hogwarts he got a cake from mrs weasley and a set of dragonhide boots from harry parents there was also a gift from sirius when ti opened it he gasped tears started to flow from his eyes what is it ti rose asked ti showed her the gift it was a wizarding picture of him and sirius one taken at christmas harry placed a hand on ti shoulder sirius wanted to come but there was some sort of emergency and they needed him he said he wanted you to have a picture of the two of you to place by your bed now this is the best gift i ve ever had he said in fact this is the best birthday i ve ever had thank you he turned to look at all his friends thank you all you re welcome ti harry said smiling like i said before you re family needless to say the party lasted up to midnight not even mcgonagall who came by at 9pm to greet ti called a halt to the celebration the week of exams flew by quickly harry again thanked merlin for the bond since it allowed him to tune hermione out by talking to ginny whenever his bushyhaired friend ranted over her answers after each test he was puzzled that fred and george didntstudy as hard as their fellow 5th years in spite of it being their o w l exams percy had locked himself in his head boy room in between his exams as it was his n e w t s year the new marauders spent week after exams generally having fun together and playing pranks on the slytherins especially draco try as he might snape couldntcatch them or prove that harry and his friends were responsible dumbledore simply smiled whenever the potions professor complained to him strangely harry noticed that rose and hermione seemed to spend time in the library even after exams he wasnttoo surprised about hermione but wondered if his sister was taking after his friend when the final grades of the year were announced harry and his friends were all relieved that they had passed of course fred george and percy wouldntget their results until july the end of year feast was as great as ever the students and teachers were almost finished eating when there was a bright flash from the ceiling everyone looked up and someone screamed overlapping and partially covering the stars on the great hall ceiling were streams of differently colored lights they undulated like ribbons across the magical sky they formed patterns like animals magical creatures and even faces of the staff everyone laughed as they saw snape face in blood red dumbledore in purple mcgonagall in blue and hagrid in yellow then the ribbons of light disappeared for a moment it looked like the show was over suddenly there were brightly colored explosions like fireworks forming different patterns for more than twenty minutes this continued the students oohed and aahed in the right places then there was one very bright flash of white light when the light cleared words spelled in letters of different colors formed on the ceiling this magnificent show was brought to you by the new marauders as a tribute to the past year enjoy your summer till next year the hall broke out in cheers and thunderous applause harry and his friends looked at each other as they joined in the applause bright smiles on their faces even draco had seemed impressed harry glanced at the head table all the professors were smiling except of course for snape though he didntexactly scowl either remus was actually grinning harry then caught dumbledore eye the headmaster smiled and raised his glass in silent praise harry grinned and he and ginny agreed mentally that it was a great way to end the year chapter 41 summer troubles disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations the following day dumbledore returned to find ginny already waiting with harry ah excellent dumbledore said you are ready as ready as we ll ever be professor harry said his hand tightly clasped in ginny s both were nervous and excited at the same time the three of them moved to the dueling room where dumbledore again cast wards over the room dumbledore then had the pair sit on the floor and taught them how to relax their minds and clear them harry and ginny found this brought their bond to a new level of awareness and peace it was like they were in a world of mist where they were the only people their magical auras outlined them in a halo of light almost too bright to look at dumbledore had them concentrate on trying to control the brightness of that light it took them two days to dim the light even a fraction this exhausted them initially but by the end of the week they could alternately increase and decrease the brightness with little effect harry and ginny would then take walks around the manor grounds after dumbledore had left before ginny had to go home then a week and a half after coming home harry came down for breakfast and found rose alone in the kitchen he had noticed that rose had been sullen and quiet lately he wondered what was up as he sat down harry said morning sis how ve you been to his surprise rose looked at him with a sad expression on her face okay i guess she said with a shrug of her shoulders harry looked at her skeptically you dontlook okay what wrong you ve been so quiet lately that just not like you no i fine really she said again no you re not fine harry said come on it me harry your brother you can tell me her expression suddenly changed from one of sadness to one of anger you want to know what wrong she shouted as she stood up knocking her chair back fine ever since we were babies ginny and i have done everything together went everywhere together now since you two formed this bond we never spend time together she always with you even when we were in class she could talk to you i thought we could spend time together this since we got home you re together the whole day with dumbledore where does that leave me she then ran off apparently headed for her room harry sat there in shock not understanding for a moment what had happened then he heard ginny in his mind oh harry what have we done how could we have been so callous she asked i i i dontknow gin harry answered i never thought rose would react this way i thought she was happy for us she was harry we often talked about it in our dorm ginny said i guess she been lonely the past few days this is the first time we haventspent time with each other for more than a day harry sighed so how do we fix this gin i dontwant to lose my sister and i sure you dontwant to lose your best friend over this no i don t harry ginny said go talk to her apologize for neglecting her i ll be there in a few minutes all right gin harry said i ll see you i dontwant to have to choose between you and our bond and rose neither do i harry ginny said i love you both just in different ways now go harry hurried up to rose room he found the door closed he knocked but there was no answer come on rose he said as he leaned against the door let me in let talk please minutes passed just when he thought about leaving the door lock clicked open harry cautiously opened the door he found rose sitting on her bed facing away from him and towards the open window harry sat down behind her and tentatively touched her shoulder she shook his hand off harry sighed rose look at me please sis come on she still didntturn around all right i sorry ginny and i were prats okay we were selfish trying to find time for ourselves and not thinking about you and our other friends we re sorry please forgive us after a few more seconds rose turned around harry could see the track marks left by tears on her cheeks it was heart breaking for him to know that he had cause his sister pain he took her hands in his please sis we re sorry for neglecting you he gave her hand a gentle squeeze rose sniffed and squeezed his hand all right i ll forgive the two of you just promise me that i ll get to spend more time with the both of you i missed my brother and my best friend i promise harry said gin will promise you too as soon as she gets here okay rose nodded and wiped away another tear okay she said smiling i knew she fancied you a long time ago i never thought you d fancy her back especially this early she giggled harry smiled i just dontfancy her rose i love her you heard professor dumbledore only true love for one another could allow the bond between us to form even if i had saved her life if i didntlove her like i do nothing would have happened i know that true the way i see her is like the way dad sees mum seeing how much they love each other makes me want to show ginny the same thing just then ginny poked her head through rose door hey you two she came inside the room and sat beside rose rose she said i know harry already said it but i d like you to hear it from me i really really sorry for neglecting you these past few months this bond thing and the feelings we have for each other just came up and it was like nothing else mattered i especially sorry for the past few days i know we usually spend this time together but when professor dumbledore told us about the training well again nothing else seemed to matter it okay ginny rose said i understand really i know how important it is for you and harry to control your magical power well you may understand rose ginny said but that doesntmake it okay now today we ll spend time together doing the things we usually do okay but what about your training with professor dumbledore rose asked harry will attend to that by himself today ginny said smiling at harry after all we have forever together surely we can spend a little time apart doing other things harry smiled but not too long rose giggled all right she looked at harry now shoo you this is girl time yes ma am harry said throwing her a salute he headed for the door just as he got there he looked back and saw the two girls already had their heads together talking and giggling harry could guess what they were talking about without having to listen in through ginny he shook his head and headed down the stairs to face dumbledore alone surprisingly at least to harry dumbledore was very understanding and agreed to let ginny skip that day training he then had harry practice controlling his magic at the end of the session dumbledore again surprised harry by announcing that he and ginny had learned enough control and they could now learn more powerful spells in addition he said that their friends could have their own sessions of spell training learning the spells harry and ginny already knew such as auror stealth spells harry and ginny were pleased by that they told rose who was excited to learn the same spells they were learning harry got permission that afternoon to go to the burrow and tell ron the news ron was initially cool to harry but as soon as he was told about the spell training he forgave harry for neglecting him the two friends spent an hour flying around the weasleys property then got around to contacting neville and hermione unfortunately hermione had already left for a holiday abroad with her parents and would only be back for harry birthday neville on the other hand got all excited but asked harry to let maggie come along as she would be starting her first year when the new term started harry told him that it would be up to neville parents and dumbledore harry sent hedwig to sirius with a note asking if ti could join them sirius answered back saying he was glad harry wanted ti to be with them as the younger boy had been in a funk since taking leave of his friends the next day harry friends came over to potter manor james met them earlier at the burrow to allow ron the twins and neville to get through the fidelius charm sirius himself brought ti over dumbledore met them in the dueling room someone else was with him remus harry and rose said as they saw the werewolf what are you doing here professor harry asked oh you donthave to call me that anymore harry remus said i no longer your teacher the children were all surprised why harry asked did someone find out about your furry problem and complain to the board of governors remus smiled no harry that not the reason i ll no longer be teaching at hogwarts that true harry all of you dumbledore said because of voldemort return remus is needed for another task which he will be doing after the summer for now he will be helping me teach you spells as james and sirius are too busy with their auror duties to be here constantly after that they got down to actual spellwork first remus asked harry and ginny to demonstrate some of the spells james and sirius had been teaching harry during the previous summer the others were fascinated by the stealth spells then with dumbledore and remus watching the children practiced casting these spells they did this every morning in the afternoon the others returned home after lunch while dumbledore had harry and ginny practice stronger spells rose often watched them at first harry and ginny would lose consciousness for a couple of hours but as they got stronger they lost consciousness for lesser periods of time during the weekends the sessions were suspended and the children left to do as they wanted these were the times harry and ginny enjoyed most as they could be together with few people watching them they alternated their time between the burrow and potter manor they also took care to include rose and ron in some of their activities like flying on their brooms and swimming in the pond behind the burrow they swam more often as the days got hotter a week before harry birthday remus came alone to that day training session after lunch he led harry and ginny back to the dueling room harry ginny remus said there a new spell albus feels you should try to learn what the spell remus harry asked it called the patronus charm harry remus said it a spell used to repeal dementors since the dementors have joined voldemort the danger of an attack by them is great so far voldemort has not used them but that will change in time so this spell can repeal dementors ginny asked how come we ve never heard of it before remus it a difficult spell to cast ginny remus said it actually beyong newt level however considering the strength of your magic albus feels that you and harry may be able to can you cast it remus harry asked yes harry with some difficulty remus said you see in order to cast the spell you must think of a memory not just any memory but a happy memory he smiled as you know there haventbeen many happy memories in my life harry placed his hand on remus arm but you ve had many happy times with us haventyou remus remus grinned of course harry enough to cast a good patronus but come you and ginny have to learn it it may take a while for you to do so remus led them to one side of the room where a cabinet was set as they got closer the cabinet started to rustle and jump a bit harry and ginny drew back alarmed harry threw a questioning look at remus dontworry harry remus said in that cabinet is a boggart in fact the very one we used in class earlier this year albus has been kind enough to ensorcell it to appear and act like a dementor he faced both of them now i must warn you it will be almost like facing a real dementor you will feel a coldness and sense of despair like no other it will make you relive your worst experience as it sucks out every happy thought both harry and ginny gulped it seemed so terrible now remus continued what you have to do to cast the patronus charm is focus on a happy memory point your wand at it and say clearly expecto patronum this creates a patronus which drives the dementor away if correctly cast the patronus takes the form a silvery white corporeal creature the type of creature that forms depends on the caster no one is sure why all right do you both understand how to cast the charm when both kids nodded he said okay harry you go first step up close to the cabinet now wand at the ready remus then used his wand to open the cabinet the cabinet door drew back and a cloaked figure glided out of it its hood drawn up and a pair of gray glistening slimy dead looking hands poking out of the robes harry felt a cold draft of wind and a feeling of dread and despair he pointed his wand at it and struggled to think of a happy memory he settled on that of his last birthday and shouted expecto patronum a white mist poured out of harry wand it streaked toward the pseudo dementor hit it then dissipated the pseudo dementor moved closer to harry harry vision started to swim as it got colder then as he blacked out he heard a someone screaming his name the voice sounding like his mother and his own voice saying ginny please dontbe dead when he came to remus was helping him sit up ginny was sitting beside them her face pale and drawn harry knew that she had also heard the screaming voice and his voice begging her not to be dead all right harry remus said come on just sit and relax here have a bit of chocolate it helps drive away the cold harry took the large piece of honeyduke from remus and bit into it to his surprise the coldness and despair ebbed as the piece of candy melted in his mouth that was a pretty good start harry remus said smiling most wizards and witches canteven get anything out of their wands with this spell just sparks out of curiosity what memory did you use um my last birthday harry said no no no harry remus said that not happy enough you have to think of a good strong happy one something that makes you giddy and feeling thoroughly wonderful well think about it for now let get you over there by the wall so you can rest a bit remus and ginny helped him get up and walk slowly as his legs felt wobbly toward the far wall they propped him up by the wall then remus and ginny moved off to the cabinet ginny attempt was as better than harry s the white mist from her wand even started to form a shape and she didntlose consciousness though she was pale as she sat next to harry harry had seen through their bond that she had relived part of her experience with the diary while facing the pseudo dementor as soon as she sat down he drew her into his arms ginny buried her head in the crook under his shoulder not speaking a word remus gave them a sad smile i guess that enough for today we ll continue this tomorrow get some rest you two bye remus harry said as the man left them harry and ginny continued sitting on the floor for hours wrapped in each other arms simply drawing comfort from one another only when rose came up to them did they separate and ginny reluctantly went home they worked on the charm over the next few days harry and ginny became less and less affected by the pseudo dementor by the day before harry birthday their mist solidified and drove the dementor back but its form was still vague the potter decided to celebrate harry 14th birthday at the burrow for security reasons much to the delight of molly who took it as an opportunity to pamper her future son in law she had gotten used to idea that harry and ginny bond was a sign that they would one day marry it was a lunch party so the guests started to arrive at half past ten molly forbade anyone except lily from coming into the kitchen and absolutely refused to let the potter house elves help her aside from all the weasleys hermione sirius ti and remus the people invited included neville and maggie dean thomas seamus finnegan lavender brown the patil twins luna lovegood professor mcgonagall hagrid professor flitwick madame sprout madame pomfrey and professor dumbledore the guests especially the females crowded around lily who had andrew and daisy in her arms lavender padma and parvati kept cooing at them harry and ginny drew hermione aside to tell her about their training with dumbledore she apologized for not being there and was pleased they didntmind her spending time with her parents she promised to be there the next day for the training sessions after eating molly delicious feast the group gathered round to watch harry open his gifts from sirius remus and ti harry received a book on defensive magic the professors gave him a foe glass hagrid gave him a huge cake and some rock cakes neville gave him a strange looking magical plant hermione and ron gave him a refill for his broom servicing kit molly and arthur gave him a new coat the twins gave him a box filled with more joke products his other friends gave him assortments of sweets and candies one of the best gifts he got was from his parents and sister a brand new broom whoa harry ron said as harry unwrapped it is that the new firebolt um i guess it is harry said awed by the gift he turned around and hugged his family thanks mum thanks dad thanks sis harry then noticed that there wasnta gift from ginny he looked at her quizzingly i want to give you your gift in private harry she told him mentally harry could feel her nervousness gin i d love any gift from you he told her gently i dontcare what it is as long as it from you i ll cherish it ginny hugged him then dragged him away from the crowd she led him into the woods that bordered the weasley property near the river otter they sat down in a clearing near its edge facing each other they could see the waters of the river just beyond the trees ginny pulled out a brightly wrapped package from behind her and handed it to harry without a word harry could still feel a twinge of nervous anticipation coming from her harry unwrapped the gift carefully more careful than he usually was he found it was a box he opened the box and was surprised to find a picture frame the picture was of him and ginny in it he and ginny were holding hands while walking then harry stopped picked ginny up and whirled her around ginny was laughing hard harry grinned as he looked at ginny he made sure she could feel his happiness and pleasure over the gift he then drew her into his arms thank you ginny he said as he hugged her i ll set this up beside my bed wherever i am that way it ll be the last thing i see before i sleep and the first thing i see in the morning when i wake up it ll have to do until we re married and i have the real thing to wake up beside ginny was evidently surprised and pleased by what harry said because she hugged him harder and started kissing him on the lips harry returned her kiss as they were kissing harry felt the warmth around them start to disappear it got colder and colder which was unusual for summer he knew she could feel it too together they turned around looking for the reason for the cold spell then they saw them dementors a pair of them the river was already freezing over as they crossed it it appeared that they were headed for the burrow though they would bypass the pair in the woods harry what do we do ginny asked both of them were already feeling the effects of the dementors presence it too late to run back gin he said with the speed they re moving they ll reach the burrow before we can get there to warn the others we ll have to try that charm remus taught us i scared harry ginny said i know i am too just remember concentrate on a happy memory i ve got it remember our first kiss think about how happy it made you all right ready one two three together they cried expecto patronum a ball of silver light came out of each wand expanding to form a shape that rushed toward the dementors harry and ginny watched fascinated as their patronus each took a distinct shape and rammed into the dementors driving them away shrieking did you see that harry ginny asked a bit of awe in her mental voice yeah harry said awe also in his voice our patronuses took clear shapes for the first time mine looked like a deer i think the plural is patroni harry ginny said amusement now in her voice not patronuses and that not just a deer with that set of antlers it most likely a stag mine took the shape of a lion wow just then they heard the sounds of running feet coming from behind them they turned and pointed their wands in that direction then they lowered them and let out sighs of relief as james sirius and remus burst into the clearing the three men slowed down and came closer to the two children their own wands still raised what happened harry james asked rose said something about the two of you being in trouble something about dementors yeah sirius said she got quite hysterical when we wouldntbelieve her then it started getting cold she said you were in the woods near the river and she was right harry and ginny eyes widened she said that harry asked well she was right dad we were just talking here when we felt it getting cold then we saw the river starting to freeze over and we saw them there were two dementors crossing the river and headed for the burrow the three men eyes were now wide as well so what happened sirius asked where are they now how did you escape them we we used the patronus charm sirius ginny said it drove them away remus grinned while james and sirius were surprised and awed by this that great harry ginny remus finally said then he turned to his friends i ve been teaching them that for a week albus and i were worried they may need it good thing too it seems he turned back to the two children so did your patroni take on distinct shapes they d have to in order to have driven the dementors off yes remus harry said grinning ginny looked like a lion and mine looked like a stag a stag james asked well that interesting harry you do remember what my animagus form is right harry eyes widened of course it a stag wow that is awesome ginny eyes crinkled as she talked to harry mentally harry if your patronus form is like your dad animagus form then why is my patronus form a lion hmm i not sure ginny let ask dad and remus if they dontknow maybe professor dumbledore might dad harry said my patronus is a stag just like your animagus form why is that why then is ginny patronus a lion i not sure harry james said his right thumb and index finger on his chin my patronus is a stag just like yours maybe we can ask albus at any rate he continued smiling what you and ginny did was to borrow a word from you awesome to be able to cast a patronus charm successfully at your ages is almost unheard off i couldntcast one until i entered the auror training program with it you managed to drive the dementors away before they could do any harm to us and the other people here that really heroic harry and ginny felt their cheeks heat up from embarrassment oh look prongs moony sirius said grinning they re blushing together my my what a couple they make knock it off padfoot james said grinning before the young lady here gets pissed and shows you her trademark bat bogey hex ginny did seem to be getting redder and not from amusement as a scowl formed on her face all right all right sirius said geez i canteven get some fun out of this james and remus laughed well never mind james said let get back to the party and reassure the others as they walked back to the burrow ginny caught harry attention harry she said mentally didntyour dad say that rose told them where we were and that there were dementors involved how did she know all that i dontknow ginny harry said mentally i wondered about that do you think she can read our minds without us knowing it gin no i dontthink that it harry ginny said mentally there must be another explanation what then gin harry asked mentally how did rose know that there were dementors there and we were there in the woods i not sure harry ginny said mentally but remember valentine day when we had that picnic yeah what about it well she suggested that we avoid the shore of the lake and warned me about the apples harry raised an eyebrow and looked at ginny really i remember the squid splashed some of the people on the shore while we were looking for a place for our picnic and those apples had worms in them what does that mean there only one explanation harry ginny said she saw it before they happened harry eyes widened you mean she saw the future that means she s a seer harry ginny said your sister a seer whoa what until mum finds out she doesntexactly have a kind opinion of divination that explains why rose is taking it next term ginny said mentally i wondered why she told me that she found it interesting now it seems she preparing for her future by then they were approaching the burrow and the other people there luckily the three men with them had been busy discussing the dementors and what their attack meant to pay notice that harry and ginny had been preoccupied harry we have to talk to rose we need to find out how much she knows about what happening maybe she knows something of voldemort all right gin we ll do it tonight when we re back at potter manor just then molly and lily came forward and engulfed them in motherly hugs at the same time inquiring about their health harry and ginny assured them that they were fine the bonded pair noticed that rose and hermione were talking to each other just like they had been in the last days of the last term and on the hogwarts express harry do you think rose told hermione about her visions ginny asked harry mentally i not sure gin harry answered they arentas close as she is to you or hermione is to me then again she certainly hasntconfided in us has she no she hasn t ginny said maybe she decided to find out more about seers she knows hermione is great at research and skeptical enough about divination to be objective harry snorted skeptical is kind of a mild term for what hermione feels about it but you re right research is definitely hermione specialty look at how much information she found on our bond so will you ask rose about it ginny asked yeah i will tonight harry answered a n sorry this chapter took so long real life had to be attended to i hope you guys liked it chapter 42 prophecies and anger management disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations harry walked over to rose room and paused by the door he and his family had been invited and therefore stayed for dinner at the burrow after the party wound down to in molly words allow harry time to rest after such a harrowing experience most of the guests left after being warned by dumbledore not to say anything about the dementor attack remus sirius and ti also stayed for dinner neville said he wanted to stay but he had to take maggie home which didntplease his sister who had been listening to stories about hogwarts from the other kids harry was pleasantly surprised to learn that hermione would be staying at the burrow in ginny room for the rest of the summer now she would be able to join them in the training sessions he noted with interest and amusement how red ron face had gotten when it was revealed that it had been ron idea to invite hermione over he also had noticed that rose and hermione had been talking quietly during dinner now he knocked on rose door he heard the muffled yes and answered it me rose can we talk um sure bro come on in she replied harry entered the room and saw that rose was sitting up in her bed her back against the headboard he sat down on the bed sis harry began ginny and i were wondering how you knew where we were and that there were dementors coming er i saw you two sneak away headed for the woods she replied what about the dementors harry asked i uh started feeling cold rose said i remembered what remus said about them harry shook his head no that not exactly true ginny remembered some things you told her last valentine day about not sitting on the lakeshore and not to eat the apples the only way you could have known all that is if you saw it before it happened you re a seer arentyou come on sis you can trust us rose drew her legs up to her chest and hugged them around the knees then she slowly nodded her eyes warily watching harry for his reaction harry placed his hand reassuringly on her knee it okay rose it fine dontlet it bother you i not going to get mad at you just because i cantstand divination this isntyour fault to his surprise rose flung herself at him embracing him fiercely harry ginny said in his mind please let her know it okay with me too okay gin harry said to her um ginny says she fine with it too harry said to rose who was still embracing him tightly we re fine with it as well a familiar voice said behind them harry turned around to see their parents standing there in the open door he had forgotten to close it and they had probably overheard their conversation james and lily sat down on the bed honey lily said why didntyou say anything to us we wouldntthink any worse of you if you are a seer but mum rose said tears in her eyes i know you think divination is full of baloney i didntwant to disappoint you lily drew rose into her arms rose dontthink that i wouldntlove you just because you have flashes of the future this isntsomething you asked for just as harry didntask to be the one to defeat voldemort and get that scar sometimes fate just throws us something unexpected and we just deal with it the best we can so when did you start having these flashes of the future james asked gently um right after my twelfth birthday rose said at first i didntknow what they were just that i d see something happen to people then see it again after a few minutes or hours they would come randomly a couple of instances every week then i realized what they were just before christmas i realized that i could have kept some people from getting hurt if i had warned them about what i saw so i warned harry and ginny not to have their picnic by the lake and to avoid the apples in the basket as they were filled with maggots i never did find out how your picnic went harry lily said smiling harry felt his cheeks heat up um it was fine mum ginny loved it thanks for the suggestion and the food harry you haventthanked your mum for that yet you better not be that way with me potter or you ll be sorry gulp sorry gin things sort of came up after that and i never got the chance all right harry take it as a lesson yes dear harry his mother voice broke into his thoughts you re talking to ginny in your mind arentyou uh yeah mum harry said feeling embarrassed for zoning out on his mother sorry she didntmean to interrupt but she found out i haventthanked you for suggesting that picnic and got miffed at my thoughtlessness lily laughed she scolded you didntshe i ve always liked her it ll be great to have her as a future daughter in law she had a smirk on her face she ll keep you in line when i not here harry scowled but smiled inwardly when he felt the feelings of embarrassment and pleasure coming from ginny over lily words suddenly rose sat up straight eyes glazed over and started to talk in a strange voice they gather now they who would stand by the chosen one his six companions bonded by love deep and true the soul mate his other half his strength the seer his sister in blood his guide the wise lady his sister in all but blood his font of knowledge the strategist his best friend his right hand the green lord his equal in power his general the white ram saved from evil by him his left hand training they need together to defeat the dark lord let not one be lost or all will be for naught and the dark lord will defeat the chosen one rose then slumped against the bed headboard her eyes now closed while harry james and lily stared at her in shock harry ginny said in harry mind did did your sister just make a a p prophecy i i i dontknow gin harry said to her m m maybe that voice was like the voice trelawney used that time i heard her james meanwhile had gotten over the shock and had moved to rose gently checking her out she asleep we should just let her sleep he carefully lifted rose and laid her down on the bed lily drew the covers over her mum harry asked what just happened did rose make an actual prophecy lily looked at her son noting the confusion and unease on his face and posture i not sure harry she looked at her husband james sighed i think we ll have to contact albus and tell him about this he exited from rose room followed by lily and harry and descended the stairs to the living room drawing his wand james relit the fire and threw some floo powder into the fire he then stuck his head in the fire he spoke for a few moments his words too low for either harry or lily to hear when he pulled his head out of the fire he said albus will be here shortly they all sat down after a few moments harry asked dad what going on just who is this chosen one that the second time i ve heard that term professor trelawney prediction also mentioned him i think we should wait for albus before we discuss this harry james said harry noticed that his father seemed nervous ginny was quiet but harry could feel her uneasy presence in his mind silently waiting with them though she was in her room a few seconds later dumbledore stepped out of the fire he had his pensieve levitated in front of him which surprised harry and ginny good evening james lily harry dumbledore said under the circumstances i felt that we may need my pensieve he set the pensieve down on the center table now tell me what happened with rose james relayed to dumbledore all he could remember about what had happened in rose room dumbledore listened until james was finished then said so rose is a seer fascinating it interesting what talents your children are showing james lily he had a twinkle in his eye and a slight smile on his face as he spoke now about this prediction or prophecy i think it wise if we see it as a memory james if you please james allowed dumbledore to extract the memory of rose prophecy from his mind then dumbledore replayed the memory for all to see no one spoke for a few seconds after harry then said so professor who is this chosen one to know that harry dumbledore said you need to see another prophecy made just before you were born he looked at harry parents for a moment then he activated the pensieve and stood back harry watched as the upper body of professor trelawney rose from the stone basin and started to speak the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hands of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies the whole room became silent after trelawney image had descended back into the pensieve harry looked around at his parents and dumbledore they were watching him warily especially his parents what did it all mean harry thought especially that last part about neither living if the other survived what does this have to do with me harry ginny broke into his thoughts her mental voice shaking i i think they believe this prophecy was talking about you the part about being born as the seventh month dies means whoever it talking about was born at the end of july like you how many times have your parents confronted voldemort before you were born y y your scar was caused by voldemort was that the mark it talking about it all clicked then in harry mind they believed he was the chosen one chosen to fight voldemort and hopefully destroy him for good this was about me wasntit he asked the three adults with him you think this thing was talking about me yes harry dumbledore said you and only one other fit the pattern of the prophecy you were born at the end of july to parents who have defied voldemort three times who the other one professor harry asked though he suspected the answer neville longbottom harry dumbledore said as you know he too was born near the end of july and as auror his parents have defied voldemort three times as well however if you note the second part of the prophecy voldemort would mark his nemesis himself harry then raised his hand to touch his scar yes harry dumbledore continued that night voldemort attacked you and james and lily he marked you as the one d d does he know about this prophecy professor harry asked unfortunately harry dumbledore said someone who was working for him at the time this was given happened to hear part of it fortunately he only heard the first part voldemort is unaware that by attacking you he marked you as the one who can defeat him once and for all then this is the reason my parents and i went into hiding back then wasntit harry asked this is the reason he attacked us he thought he could get rid of me before i became a threat to him yes harry james said finally speaking we knew voldemort would try to kill you so we went into hiding even though lily was already pregnant with rose so you knew about this prophecy all along dad harry said his voice starting to rise when did you plan to tell me when he comes knocking at our door again when it not like we wanted to keep it from you harry james said his eyes pleading for his understanding we wanted to you to have a good childhood without worrying about voldemort we thought we had time to prepare you we thought he wouldntbe back for years at least not until you were finished at hogwarts then we were going to start with your real training yeah harry said great plan dad now what he back and i not ready to face him i not sure if i really have this power he knows not that prophecy doesntsay that i ll defeat him does it it just says one of us will kill the other what about ginny then with this bond thing she ll die if voldemort kills me harry could hear ginny saying some things to him but ignored her as he confronted his father harry dontyou think we know that lily asked tears in her eyes we ve always known it was possible that he would kill you instead of the other way around when we learned about the bond it became even worse because of that so we showed arthur and molly the prophecy so they would know what may happen you told them harry asked his voice rising again you told them even before telling me no wonder they ve been giving me sad looks when they thought i wouldntnotice i thought it was because they were seeing their youngest child already close to leaving them i never thought it was because they knew we might soon die harry shouted this last part this was followed by a loud bang they all turned around and found that there was now a large crack running along the marble mantle of the fireplace harry then turned and ran up to his room ignoring the frantic calls of his parents he slammed his door and threw himself in his bed they ve been lying to me my whole life now i know why voldemort attacked us they knew and never told me even after i asked them that night after we saved the stone i hate them no you don t ginny voice said in his mind not now gin please you know we should really ask the headmaster about a way to sever this bond it starting to get annoying to have you in my head all the time you self centered prat how dare you i know why you re doing this you re afraid what would happen if voldemort manages to kill you well for your information mister we re not doing anything to remove the bond we re in this together ginny please it not safe harry dontyou get it you prat remember our magic is a lot stronger together than apart we need to stay together that blasted prophecy doesntchange anything what was that we talked about after we woke up about getting more training it just gives us more reason to train harder harry train harder so we can kick the crap out of tom and go on with our lives harry sighed how do you do that gin how do you know what to say to me so i calm down i guess it comes from knowing you for so long harry ginny began then before she could say anything else an intense pain shot through harry scar the pain became so intense that harry let out a blood curdling scream as his body went into convulsions he shut his eyes and curled his body into a ball spots started to form behind his eyelids he became dimly aware of people running into his room he felt arms wrap around him then he dimly heard his mother voice trying to reach him but the pain was so bad finally another set of arms smaller and warmer wrapped around him he felt another kind of warmth wrap around his mind and the pain slowly ebbed harry heard ginny voice in his mind harry i here it going to be all right open your eyes sweetie harry slowly opened his eyes as the pain in his scar became a dull ache his glasses had fallen off when his body gone into convulsions all he saw was a small face framed by red hair looking at him from her presence in his mind he knew it was ginny looking up he saw three people standing around his bed he felt exhausted he was only vaguely aware of his surroundings you re worn out harry ginny said go on and sleep i ll be here dontworry harry gave in to his fatigue and drifted off to sleep ginny sat up and took hold of harry hand she noticed it was starting to get bigger than hers she then looked up at the adults gathered in harry room he sleeping peacefully now she told them it was tom voldemort he seemed to be very angry his anger bled through to harry scar how did you know what happened ginny lily asked were you two talking earlier yes l lily ginny stammered i heard everything including the prophecy through the bond i knew he was angry so i was trying to calm him down after he got up here when the pain started in his scar i rushed over here then she blushed then as she realized that she was wearing only her nightgown forgetting to even put on a robe in her panic to get to harry as soon as possible the gown was thin and showed her developing body and its curves quite well there was some soot on her gown and face evidence she had used the floo to come over what did you do miss weasley dumbledore asked a few moments after you arrived harry seemed to calm down i not sure professor ginny said i just reached into his mind through the bond and tom just went away interesting dumbledore said a familiar twinkle in his eye it seems to be another benefit of the bond for harry do you know if this has happened to him before miss weasley well professor ginny replied he mentioned having some pain in his scar both times he had those visions of voldemort but this is the first time it hurt him this badly dumbledore sighed and turned to the other people in the room it appears that the connection between harry and voldemort is increasing any strong emotions coming from voldemort now cause harry great pain lily sat on harry other side from ginny she stopped ginny from moving from harry side with a smile and a gentle motion of her other hand please stay there ginny she said gently i think your presence is good for him her smile widened when ginny blushed but stayed where she was what can we do albus lily asked as she gently stroked the hair of her sleeping son is there any way to cut the connection between that monster and harry i dontknow lily dumbledore said as far as i know there isnta known case like this probably because no one else has ever survived the killing curse and had a scar like harry s he continued to stare at the boy sleeping peacefully in the bed his scar was no longer red and angry looking well dumbledore finally said i think it passed but to be certain i think miss weasley should stay by his side in case voldemort is still angry he turned to james and lily with the familiar twinkle in his eye i hope this is all right with you being harry parents that a girl spends the night with him james and lily exchanged a bemused glance and shrugged their shoulders if you think it best albus james said a smirk forming on his face my son is sure a lucky guy ow lily had just punched him on the shoulder really james she said this isntfunny but then her mouth twitched it is kind of cute though she grinned when ginny blushed again just then they heard the unmistakable voice of molly weasley yelling for james and lily undoubtedly looking for her daughter ginny gasped and blushed even more dontworry miss weasley dumbledore said smiling at her i will explain everything to your parents especially your mother i doubt anything serious can happen with harry sleeping deeply he then left the room james and lily smiled and james gestured to ginny to lie down comfortably which she did even though her face was as red as her hair lily arranged the sheets over ginny and harry she kissed harry on the forehead she then leaned over him and kissed ginny on her forehead thank you for being here for him she said to her as she stood up james preceded her from the room as she exited from the room lily paused at the door she looked back at the two kids on the bed ginny had her arms around harry again her head resting on his chest a few seconds later she seemed to be asleep as well in spite of being asleep harry arm also wound around ginny as she closed the door behind her lily was saddened that her son was already drawing comfort from another woman at such a young age she went back down to the living room and found her husband sitting on one of the couches dumbledore still had his head in the fireplace probably talking to molly lily hoped arthur was with her to help the headmaster calm her down she could just imagine molly muttering things about scarlet women lily sat down beside james who placed his arm around her and drew her to him lily laid her head on his chest as he leaned back into the couch they watched dumbledore in silence finally dumbledore stood away from the fire and sat down on an armchair across from james and lily well it took a while he said with a small smile on his face but i convinced molly not to come over and haul her daughter back home with her she reluctantly accepts the fact that harry needs his soul mate right now though she asked me to request that one of your house elves look in on them once in a while to make sure nothing inappropriate happens lily smiled of course albus i ll ask blinky she paused for a moment then said albus about this prophecy from rose what do you think it about dumbledore looked thoughtful for a few seconds well lily i believe it gives a list of people who will help him defeat voldemort or more accurately who will fight at his side when the time comes to confront voldemort for the last time fight at his side james asked do you have any idea who they are albus oh i believe the titles bestowed on each of these six companions plus the descriptions are important clues to their identity james dumbledore said obviously his soul mate is ginny and the seer who is his sister in blood is rose as to the others i have my suspicions for now we will let it lie until we can talk to harry again dumbledore then stood up i must now take your leave it has been a very interesting and tiring day oh james please tell harry and ginevra that due to tonight events i want them to relax tomorrow i shall see them on tuesday at the usual time with that he apparated away james and lily remained where they were staring at the fire and their minds thinking about the day and night events then the clock above the fireplace chimed the hour drawing them from their thoughts lily looked up at james then sobbing pressed her face into his chest james tightened his embrace around her and rubbed his hands soothingly up and down her back it ll be all right lils he said to her she looked up at him again tears streaking down her face will it james two dementors came to the burrow today james if remus hadnttaught harry and ginny the patronus charm i hate to think what would have happened now we learn of another prophecy and it seems rose is involved in this whole bloody mess she got to her feet and faced him what do we do james our two eldest children are going to have to face that monster i afraid that tomorrow there ll be another prophecy telling us andrew and daisy are also part of it i dontwant to lose any of them i ll do what is necessary to protect them james looked down at his feet running his hand through his messy hair a gesture lily noted harry often did himself when he was nervous finally james sighed and looked up at his wife we can only do our best lily he said we just train them as much as we can and stand with them when the time comes that all we can do he got up and extended his hand to her come on sweetheart let get to bed a good night sleep will clear our minds lily took his hand and together they ascended the stairs back to their bedroom hours later harry slowly woke up as his senses awakened from slumber he felt a familiar pressure on his chest he opened his eyes and looked down to see a sea of red hair on his chest he smiled and opened his mind to hers as he expected she was still sleeping harry leaned back in the bed he reached up and touched his scar relieved when he found it was cool to his touch he wondered what ginny had done the previous night to ease the pain whatever she had done he was glad she had done it he slowly reached for his glasses on his night table after some fumbling he found them and put them on sunlight was coming in through his window and the clock on his dresser said it was ten in the morning startled harry reached ginny mind shouting gin wake up it already ten ginny sprang up from harry side causing the blanket draped around them to fall away harry you prat she screamed into his mind her hands holding her head dontdo that you dontlike me doing it to you so dontshout into my mind like that sorry gin harry replied a sheepish tone in his voice i was just surprised by how late it was professor dumbledore probably waiting it was then that harry noticed what ginny was wearing his eyes bulged out of their sockets and his jaw dropped almost to the floor the gown ginny had on gave a better glimpse of her body than he had ever seen including the starting bumps on her chest ginny smirked when her mind detected his reaction she reached out and used one finger to close his mouth and wipe the bit of drool that had dripped from it before either of them could react further there was a knock on the door the door opened a moment later and rose peeked inside she raised an eyebrow as she gazed at them but didntcomment instead she said hey you two mum just sent me to check if you were both awake she also said to tell you that professor dumbledore was giving you the day off training how are you doing sis harry asked do you remember what happened last night rose grimaced and came inside the room closing the door behind her she said down on the bed beside ginny if you re asking about that prophecy i supposed to have made rose said no i dontremember doing that the last thing i remember was mum laughing at you about ginny and valentine day then waking up this morning so you know about the prophecy you made ginny asked her rose nodded professor dumbledore talked to me about it this morning with mum and dad she shrugged i guess it shouldntsurprise me according to all the stuff hermione and i managed to find about seers every single one made one or more prophecies or predictions in their lives after several seconds of silence harry said about hermione sis its good you found someone to help you find out about seers i not happy you two kept it from us but at least you had someone to confide in oh it wasnteasy bro rose said it took me a while to convince her to help me without telling any of you i sure she ll be relieved that the secrecy is over enough about me what happened to you last night that required your bond mate to spend the night with you mum wouldntgive me an explanation harry grimaced and said quietly old voldie got really mad last night and i felt his anger i felt like my scar was on fire and then it spread to my whole body rose eyes widened w w was it that bad yeah it was ginny said softly answering for harry when it started harry seemed to move away from me i could barely feel his presence i flooed over immediately i felt the pain as i stepped inside the room i felt another presence in harry mind dark and evil as soon as i touched harry mind with mine the evil presence left shrieking professor dumbledore told me to stay the night in case he came back she looked at harry who seemed to have gotten quiet and brooding she reached out and took his hand in hers dontthink about it harry it over for now harry looked up to see her smiling at him her mind was caressing his in a way he found soothing and comforting drawing him from his dark thoughts he smiled back and touched her mind with his own sending her feelings of love and gratitude rose voice broke them out of their trance hey now enough of that you two have the day free they looked back at her then at each other so harry asked ginny in her mind what do you want to do today ginny shrugged as she replied mentally i dontknow how about i head back to the burrow for a shower and a change of clothes first then maybe we can have breakfast and try out that new broom of yours harry grinned remembering the firebolt his parents had given him the day before for his birthday you re on gin let go just then rose said hey will you two stop that when there are other people in the room honestly people will think you re trying to hide something oooh maybe you are planning a little secret rendezvous lovebirds harry shook his head you know sis for a minute i thought you were channeling hermione or even worse ron rose eyes widened for a moment before they narrowed i ll get you for that remark brother of mine harry and ginny laughed and got up ginny gave harry a kiss on the lips pulling back before harry could deepen it see you later love she left the room pulling rose along with her harry smiled and started looking in his drawers for something cool to wear the day was already starting to heat up he looked forward to the rest of the summer especially ginny birthday he needed to get permission from his parents to go to diagon alley to get her birthday present a n how was this chapter sorry for the delay i couldntlog in for a couple of days chapter 44 once more at hogwarts disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations the potters and ti arrived at the platform a full hour before the weasleys who came just 5 minutes before the hogwarts express was to leave ginny provided harry with a running account of their progress to the king cross station through their mental link harry couldntbelieve how many times the weasleys had to return to the burrow for forgotten items rose laughed when harry told her about that greetings were exchanged all around harry gave ginny a chaste kiss on her cheek after embracing her conscious of the presence of her mother hermione soon joined them accompanied by her parents and new brother five month old daniel granger had brown hair like his sister though it didntlook bushy yet seeing the new granger beside his brother and sister harry wondered if daniel would be magical like hermione or be a muggle either was possible but if dan went to hogwarts he may form a new trio with andrew and daisy ah well that for the future harry thought soon the children were saying goodbye to the adults harry heard some strange remarks like bill saying that they were going to have an interesting year and charlie mentioning that he may see them at hogwarts soon even his mum and mrs weasley had remarked that they would probably be spending christmas at hogwarts these reminded him about the conversation between his parents that he had overheard then there were the dress robes he had packed away last night which added another layer to the mystery once on board harry ginny rose ron and hermione found an empty compartment while ti went to sit with his dorm mates and fred and george went off to find lee jordan neville and his sister maggie soon joined harry and the others in the compartment later as the hogwarts express sped through the english countryside under a darkening sky harry looked around the compartment ron and neville were playing a game of wizarding chess hermione had her head in a book as usual and rose and maggie were quietly talking harry decided it was a good time to have a mental conversation with ginny who was beside him reading a book gin harry asked her mentally i think i have an idea what might be going on at hogwarts oh ginny said how did you come up with this without my knowing it harry could feel the amusement coming from her well last night after you fell asleep i went down to the kitchen for a drink of water and overheard my parents talking they were discussing some sort of contest or tournament that professor dumbledore wanted to happen for international magical cooperation or some such concept dad seemed to think it was a bad idea especially since fudge wanted it too a contest ginny asked what sort of contest would involve hogwarts and foster international magical cooperation i not sure gin harry said it must be big since even bill and charlie know about it but my mum also mentioned some sort of rules change that wouldntlet me take part in it they think i d be sure to be chosen to be a contestant otherwise they also think that it dangerous and could be a target for voldieshorts wow it must be huge then ginny said dangerous huh then it a good thing you wontbe a part of it i want my man in one piece so i can enjoy him oh really miss weasley harry said grinning now and how with you enjoy your man she put her book down turned around and closed the small gap between them like this she said and brought her lips up against his harry spared a glance at ron before the taste of ginny lips and her flowery scent removed all awareness of the universe beyond him and ginny ron ears were red but he didntturn from his game toward them the rest of the journey passed quickly and they were soon at hogsmeade station unfortunately as they alighted from the train it started to rain heavily neville gently guided his sister towards hagrid and the other first years harry rose ginny ron hermione and neville managed to fit into one of the carriages they were already quite soaked and glad not to have to cross the lake in the heavy downpour as soon as they reached the front steps of the castle they hurried inside and tried to wring as much of the water out of their clothes as they could while waiting to enter the great hall harry noticed draco standing among the slytherins draco was staring at ti who was standing with his fellow second years chatting ti happened to glance in draco direction and to harry and ti astonishment draco gave his former brother a polite nod before turning away whoa wonder what that was about harry wondered that git didntacknowledge ti for most of last year harry did you notice the nod draco gave ti ginny asked harry in his head yeah i did harry answered what brought that on that the first greeting he given ti without a glare or snort do you think he come to accept his brother a gryffindor ginny asked a bit of doubt in her mental voice i not sure gin harry said we d best be watchful of old draco hey look at fred and george the weasley twins were talking quietly to a golden blonde haired boy in ravenclaw robes without any of their characteristic joviality that guy they re talking to seems familiar harry said oh merlin i think that adam billingsley the eldest son of that couple that got attacked the night of the world cup if that him then his younger brother must be among the first years crossing the lake ginny said what a gloomy way to see hogwarts for the first time poor kids they re orphans now i wonder where their sister is i think i heard my dad say that their aunt on their mother side took custody of her harry said i think she a muggle i hope she nothing like my aunt petunia according to mum she hates anything magical so much i d hate to think what she and her husband would have done if i and rose had to live with them dontthink about that harry ginny said it ll never happen i dontthink your parents will let that happen if anything happened to them you rose daisy and andrew will stay with us or sirius thanks gin harry said well enough of the dark thoughts the doors are opening let get inside i starving the students trudged into the great hall and took their seats at the proper tables harry grasped ginny hand under the table as he scanned the staff table he noticed two empty chairs among the familiar faces one of them was most likely professor mcgonagall as she was supervising the sorting ceremony for the first years harry hermione said in a low voice do you have any idea who our defense against the dark arts professor will be this year did professor dumbledore mention anything this summer no hermione harry whispered back he never said anything about that i kinda forgot about it with everything we were doing and all that probably why there an extra empty chair do you think they found anyone ginny asked i really wish remus hadnthad to leave yeah gin harry said i do too but he has more important work to do harry remembered that remus was now on a special mission for the order at that moment the doors of the hall opened again this time to let the nervous first years in led by professor mcgonagall the first years looked like they had been swimming in the lake and were shivering from a combination of cold and nerves the sorting then started after the sorting hat sang another interesting song harry listened with only half an ear as ginny was rubbing his knuckles with her fingers distracting him quite a bit harry only looked up twice first when colin creevey excitedly introduced his younger brother dennis to him and the second time to watch maggie longbottom get sorted into gryffindor much to her brother relief maggie took her seat between dennis and neville across from ti harry and his friends congratulated the first year girl who blushed from all the attention as soon as the sorting was done and professor mcgonagall had taken her seat professor dumbledore stood up and let the feast begin with his words tuck in later after the last of the food had been consumed dumbledore rose to give the usual start of term speech except it was not the usual start of term speech harry listened with a mixture of curiosity and outrage as dumbledore announced the cancellation of the quidditch cup then before he could explain further he was interrupted by the arrival of a strange but thoroughly soaked man who turned out to be both one of the most eccentric of aurors and the new defense against the dark arts professor alastor mad eye moody harry had heard many stories about him from his father and sirius as he watched the strange man fascinated by the man magical eye harry wondered how much of those stories were true further thoughts about the new teacher were interrupted as dumbledore again resumed with his announcements harry again experienced a succession of emotions as dumbledore told the students about the tri wizard tournament and the rule changes the ministry had made to restrict the participants later that night as they lay in separate beds in separate dormitories harry and ginny discussed the night events it too bad about the quidditch cup harry ginny said in his mind it would have been great to see you try out those moves krum used during the world cup yeah ginny harry replied i d love to have tried them out i should have attempted a few of them when we were flying around the burrow or potter manor i thought then that i would be able to once we were back here well maybe next year i guess ginny said after a few seconds of silence she said so what do you think of the new professor for dada harry gave her a mental shrug i not sure dad and sirius used to tell me the strangest stories about him he was dad and sirius training officer when they joined the aurors he has this motto harry took on a loud booming voice for a second constant vigilence he always screamed that i wonder if he ll do the same thing with us what with that blue eye ginny asked wasntit creepy the way it moved around separate from the other i swear it even seemed to go to the back of his head it probably does harry said sirius mentioned he d lost one of his eyes in a battle with several dark wizards one of them threw a cutting curse of some sort at him he got a magical one to replace it very rare that kind of thing according to sirius well we ll see ginny said we get our time tables tomorrow so we ll know when we have dada harry ginny mental voice got serious all of a sudden yeah gin harry asked what is it about the tri wizard ginny said you wonttry to get in will you i dontknow harry said his mental voice a little quiet we dontknow who the impartial judge is it ll be difficult to come up with a way to fool him or her if we dontknow who he or she is please harry ginny said promise me you wonttry to get in remember what your mother said even by yourself you re powerful enough to get in if your name was submitted yeah i guess so harry said so please donttry to enter for me i dontknow how dangerous the tasks they plan will be but if you were out there i d feel and see it through our bond i dontknow if i could take that it one thing to be right there beside you like last term with wormtail but if you were alone there facing who knows what i dontknow if i could stand not being able to help you harry was touched by how deeply ginny felt about it he knew how she felt since he had felt that way when wormtail had kidnapped her a few short months ago all right gin he said i promise no matter what anyone may say i wontenter the tri wizard tournament i swear on merlin honor all right ginny sighed okay harry thank you she yawned then sorry i getting tired see you in the morning love good night good night ginny harry said as he felt her fall asleep harry didntfeel sleepy yet himself in spite of his promise to ginny he couldnthelp wonder how it would feel to become the tri wizard champion he imagined himself standing in the middle of the quidditch pitch raising the trophy over his head to the cheers of the entire school he sighed it was a good dream to have an achievement all his own something separate from his scar voldemort and the prophecy maybe he could try the next time they held it at the moment he couldntthink of a way to make him seem seventeen already he sighed again and closed his eyes the following days were hectic and strange again for harry and his friends after all harry still had divination he groaned when he found that he was still trelawney favorite target for most gruesome death predictions predictably hagrid had them studying another dangerous creature blast ended skrewts when their first dada class came up the following thursday harry and his fellow fourth years were horrified by moody demonstrations of the three unforgivables harry knew that even aurors were not allowed to use those three spells except under very special circumstances he hoped that moody had special permission from dumbledore to teach it to them then just as the students were starting to leave the dada classroom at the end of the period moody said mr potter a moment please all right professor harry said wondering what the ex auror wanted he turned to hermione and ron i ll see you two later harry approached moody who was seated at his desk you wanted to see me professor moody eyed harry with his magical eye for a moment before answering yes mr potter i have something to discuss with you take a seat he waved his wand and a chair came up behind harry sitting down harry asked warily what is it sir well potter moody said i bet you re wondering why i took this job i sure you ve heard stories about me from your father and that godfather of yours stories that would make you think i wouldntcare to teach a bunch of kids let alone a whole school harry shrugged well sir i guess the whole school is wondering i ll tell you why moody said gruffly you you re the real reason i accepted this job i know voldemort is back and i have a feeling you ll be the one to get rid of him you did it once you ll do it again with the proper training harry was surprised by the faith the older man seemed to have in him surprised you didnti moody asked well ever since that night when voldemort attacked you and your parents i wondered how you survived the killing curse as i said earlier in class you re the only one to ever do that after thinking about it for a long time i ve come to the conclusion that there was a purpose to that i believe the purpose was to make you the one who would finally put an end to that monster harry was again surprised he wondered if moody knew the prophecy but decided he didntand had only come to his conclusion after careful thought when harry didntsay anything moody said however for that to happen you ll need training for that matter every single one of your fellow students will need training in order to fight voldemort wontspare anyone when he finally resumes the war he was waging the training you ll need will take time for now you need to know as much about the dark arts as you can that where i come in then maybe later in the year we can start on some actual spells dumbledore told me that you ve already been getting some extra training from him your father godfather and remus lupin that good i ll add to that but for now i wanted you to know why i really hear and that there are people who know the truth about voldemort we re with you thanks professor harry said touched by his support now go on and get to dinner he said waving his hand in a dismissive gesture thank you professor harry said leaving the room now that was certainly interesting harry heard ginny voice say in his mind i ll say harry said as he walked down the corridors on the way to the great hall do you think dumbledore told him about the prophecy i dontthink so harry ginny replied i think he came up with that all on his own i thought so too well at least that means the headmaster can get us the help we need without having to spew out the bloody thing harry ginny said a bit of caution in her tone when are you going to tell ron rose and hermione about trelawney prophecy harry stopped walking and leaned against the wall the corridor was otherwise empty harry ginny asked again a couple of seconds later she appeared at the end of the corridor and walked slowly up to harry who still hadntanswered her ginny looked up at him as she wrapped her arms around him she could feel the turmoil in his thoughts as he thought of the prophecy given by trelawney and the one given by his own sister harry please talk to me i dontknow gin harry said in her mind finally i dontwant them to hate me why would they do that harry you heard the prophecy trelawney gave gin neither can live while the other survives that means i have to kill him either i get murdered or i become a murderer how else will they feel about a murderer he gently moved out of her embrace and walked over to a window which overlooked the grounds he stared out the window his mind still in thinking about the prophecy he felt ginny wrap her arms around his waist again and lean her head against his back harry there no way they d hate you for killing voldemort ginny said in his mind it wouldntbe murder since he not human anymore it would be like getting rid of a mad dog harry stayed silent but ginny could feel him calming down and considering her words so she continued what about me harry i understand what trelawney prophecy requires you to do i dontlike it but i accept it i haventloved you any less for it there no way i going to leave you because of it bond or no bond finally harry sighed and turned around within her arms to face her slowly he wrapped his arms around her he was tall enough now to rest his chin on her shoulder thanks gin harry said to be honest if you hadntheard the prophecy through our connection i not sure if i would have told you i guess i owe it to them to know what they may be getting into dontforget rose prophecy harry we haventgiven it much thought lately but if we can tell ron and hermione about it too then hermione can help us figure it out i think i know who a few of the people are i guess so okay gin we can tell them this weekend i ll find a place we can talk now can we get some dinner ginny grinned sure let go she took his hand and led the way to the great hall the following sunday morning harry ginny rose ron and hermione walked down to hagrid hut ostensibly so they could visit the half giant once there harry thanked hagrid for letting them use his house for some private conversation it all righ harry hagrid said i know how hard it is ter get some privacy here he stood up as they sat down well there some tea on the stove and scones in the oven just help yerselves i ve got ter check on some things in the fores but i ll be back in an hour thanks again hagrid harry said as the large man left through the back door all right harry hermione said what so important we needed to sneak off and hide from the rest of the student body well harry said earlier this summer my parents and professor dumbledore revealed the real reason why voldemort oh get over it ron why voldemort attacked us that halloween night it seems there was a prophecy made concerning someone who could get rid of him harry then recited trelawney prophecy the hut was silent as the implications of the prophecy sunk into the heads of ron rose and hermione harry watched them carefully looking for signs of disgust or revulsion it was ron who broke the silence wow bloody hell ron language hermione said then she added shrugging her shoulders however that about sums up how i feel myself you two dontfind me disgusting harry asked in a soft tone arentyou disgusted with me having to murder someone even voldemort what hermione said no harry of course not that man is a monster he already killed hundreds in the last war someone has to stop him it wontbe murder since he isnthuman anymore yeah harry ron said i not too happy that it ll be you because you could die but you ve already stopped him what three times already i glad there a chance he ll be stopped permanently considering the power you have i sure you can do it thanks you guys harry said that means a lot to me he then looked at rose who was sitting still and hadntsaid a word yet sis are you all right she shrugged yeah i am harry i guess i not surprised by this considering what you ve already done and what i am what you are ron said his blue eyes narrowing what does that mean rose i i a seer ron rose said looking down at her feet a seer ron asked what exactly is a seer as a seer i occasionally see what will happen in the future rose said more of glimpses actually usually of other people future ron eyes widened and his eyebrows shot up his forehead bloody hell ow hermione hermione had punched him on the arm language ron hermione said being surprised isntan excuse for vulgarity well you dontseem surprised by that last bit rose said ron said rubbing his arm hermione cheeks turned red er well she told me months ago what ron exclaimed he turned to harry and ginny i bet she told you two too didntshe harry and ginny shrugged bloody hell ron said slumping backward in the armchair he was seated in just great my best mate in a prophecy and shares a soul bond with my baby sister then his baby sister is a seer what else is there hey we re not babies ginny and rose said together er there is more ron harry said there something else you and hermione dontknow about rose sis is it all right if i tell them i guess so rose said it is part of my being a seer anyway harry turned to look at ron and hermione rose sort of made a prophecy the night of my birthday when we got home to potter manor a prophecy hermione asked what did it say well harry said i think it goes something like this they gather now they who would stand by the chosen one his six companions bonded by love deep and true the soul mate his other half his strength the seer his sister in blood his guide the wise lady his sister in all but blood his font of knowledge the strategist his best friend his right hand the green lord his equal in power his general the white ram saved from evil by him his left hand training they need together to defeat the dark lord let not one be lost or all will be for naught and the dark lord will defeat the chosen one is that about it harry asked ginny mentally i think so harry ginny answered mentally wow ron said bewildered what do you think it means who are those people it mentions i think the chosen one is harry since the dark lord is obviously voldemort hermione said quit that shuddering ron really how can you be a gryffindor if a mere name scares you well it sort of reflex action and seeing my mum and dad react to that name ron said sheepishly hermione shook her head anyway if the dark lord is voldemort and the chosen one is harry the six companions are the ones who ll help harry defeat voldemort that what i thought too ginny said so the soul mate is probably me and the seer is rose as she his sister in blood but who are the other four i think the next two lines talk of ron and hermione harry said the wise lady is hermione and the strategist is ron are you sure harry hermione asked i mean i ve got intelligence and knowledge but that part about sister in all but blood is that really talking about me harry looked at her with a smile of course hermione i ve thought of you always as more than a friend though not er romantically to me you re as much a sister as rose you re like the older more mature sister i ve never had thanks harry hermione said a blush on her cheeks and tears glistening in her eyes i guess i have thought of you as a brother too that still true even if we have danny now he smiled at her then turned to ron and you have always been my best friend you re brilliant in wizarding chess and all those muggle and wizarding strategy games we used to play when we were kids i have no doubt that you re the strategist wow thanks mate ron said awed by harry praise i guess i am quite good in planning stuff like that all right rose said a smile on her face we ve got those settled what about the next two lines who are the green lord and the white ram i not sure rose harry said i d say they re close to me as close as the four of you but i dontknow i doubt it any of our parents or their friends it just doesntfit any of them let me think about for a while harry hermione said maybe i can come up with some candidates all right hermione harry said i glad you three know now about both prophecies now we can continue our training together let have some tea while we wait for hagrid to get back they waited for hagrid and spent the rest of the morning visiting with him for real they then headed back to the castle for lunch as they walked into the entrance hall they saw numerous students coming in as well unfortunately among them were draco and his cronies oho draco said if it isntscarhead his halfblood sister two weasels and a mudblood shut it malfoy harry said we donthave time to deal with your crap ooh draco said smirking getting a little shirty arentyou potter then he saw the linked hands of harry and ginny well well arentyou and the little weasel cozy potter looks like i was right about you two that time in the bookstore eh couldntyou have done better than a weasley i know you re friends with his pathetic brother but to take his sister as your girlfriend really well your families are just the same mugglelovers and blood traitors harry hand tightened on his wand under his robes no harry ginny mental voice sounded in his mind squeezing his hand in hers dontstart anything leave him to me oh all right gin this time i ll not have him insult you ginny looked at malfoy really original with your insults arentyou malfoy at least our families care for each other what about yours your father is an arrogant cruel man who bribed his way out of azkaban your mother has her nose so high in the air i afraid she may pass out from lack of oxygen draco face was red as he started becoming angry shut up about my family the malfoys are a proud and honorable pureblood family so you re just as sensitive about your family as the rest of us eh draco harry said it too bad you disowned the best part of it ti would have given more honor and pride to your family than the rest of you with that harry and the others turned from the three slytherins and started walking away all of a sudden they heard a shout oh no you don t laddie there was a loud bang behind them when they turned around they saw moody descending the main stairs his wand out and pointed at a snow white ferret that was standing exactly where draco had been moody then started to admonish the ferret as it bounced up and down under the direction of moody wand unfortunately professor mcgonagall happened along and discovered that the bouncing ferret was a transfigured student her scolding was enough to embarrass the ex auror and drive the watching children into the great hall harry and his friends had a good laugh over that even ti was amused by what had befallen his ex brother they spent the rest of the afternoon doing homework at the start of dinner dumbledore sent a message to harry asking him and ginny to see him an hour before curfew in his office they went to see him under harry invisibility cloak when they got there the headmaster told them that starting the following week they would continue their occlumency lessons every sunday afternoon harry told him about their interpretation of rose prophecy dumbledore agreed with their ideas of the identities of the soul mate seer wise lady and strategist he told them that he had an idea of who the green lord and white ram were but said that it could wait until the end of the tri wizard tournament the days passed and it was again hermione birthday her fifteenth the gryffindors once again held a party for their resident genius since it was a friday they didnthave to worry about classes the next day harry and ginny gave hermione a magical hairclip in the shape of a butterfly that fastened itself rose gave her some muggle hair styling items ron and neville gave her a gift certificate to the bookstore in hogsmeade even lavender and parvati gave her some cosmetics the other gryffindors gave her various chocolates and candies as september passed into october the fourth years found their workload increased quite a lot mcgonagall explained to them that this was to prepare them for their o w l s which they would be taking the following year harry and his fellow fourth years were further shocked in dada when moody started to cast the imperius curse on them with the purpose of teaching them to overcome it harry found himself able to throw off the curse after four tries the rest were not as successful the worse was draco whom moody had performing all sorts of acrobatic tricks while he was under the curse then on the last monday of october a large notice appeared in the entrance hall announcing that the students from the other two wizarding schools participating in the tournament beauxbatons in france and durmstrang in bulgaria would arrive the following friday which was the day before halloween harry remembered that the champions of each school would be chosen on halloween soon the whole school was abuzz over speculations on what the students from the other schools would be like a n well how was this chapter i ll try to get the next chapter out soon by the way i had to change the last chapter a bit as i had given rose another nimbus 2001 for her thirteenth birthday when she already got one for her twelfth from her parents both times thanks to mikedc39 for pointing that out chapter 45 the choosing of the champions disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations harry sat with the rest of his schoolmates in the heavily decorated great hall watching the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang the foreign students had arrived less than an hour ago on board a huge carriage drawn by elephantine winged horses and a large galleon respectively all of them were in their seventh year except for one of the girls from beauxbatons who looked even younger than a first year it came as a surprise to the hogwarts students that viktor krum the bulgarian national quidditch team seeker was among the durmstrang candidates ron had practically fainted over seeing his idol much to harry and ginny amusement and hermione disgust another surprise was seeing the headmistress of beauxbatons madame maxime who was one of the largest women they had ever seen even taller than hagrid in addition one of the girls from her school had elicited a strange reaction from the male students of hogwarts a reaction harry found disturbingly similar to the one he had seen at the quidditch world cup when the veelas had been dancing she must be part veela ginny had commented mentally to him when she detected that particular thought in harry mind soon professor dumbledore interrupted harry thoughts as he stood up the teachers table was more crowded than usual since there were more people seated there to dumbledore right sat cornelius fudge to the headmaster left were madame maxime and the relatively new headmaster of durmstrang tadeus propanov propanov had been assistant headmaster for many years and only been recently elevated to his present position at the beginning of the present term it was rumored that his predecessor igor karkaroff had disappeared mysteriously near the end of the previous term barty crouch and ludo bagman were also present being seated to the right of fudge dumbledore welcomed the foreign students and the ministry officials then opened the feast as usual the food was excellent one of the french students commented that it was better than the food at their school though a few of his classmates didnttouch some of the english specialties like the steak and kidney pie once everyone had their fill dumbledore rose again he explained the history of the tri wizard tournament then mr crouch brought out a large box and set it on a table in front of the teachers table he then opened it revealing an intricately carved wooden cup this is the goblet of fire dumbledore said this is the method by which the champions from each school are chosen he then proceeded to explain the mechanism for entering oneself in the tournament and the other rules of the tournament including a warning that someone who entered the tournament entered into a binding magical contract and couldntback out no matter what happened after pausing a few seconds to let that sink in he sent them all off to bed as they trudged to their dormitories harry could hear fred and george speculating on how to get past the age line dumbledore was putting around the goblet of fire in order to keep anyone under seventeen out of the tournament he shook his head at their audacity the next morning was full of excitement as the eligible students put their names into the goblet which was set up in the entrance hall there was a nice moment of amusement when fred and george attempted to circumvent dumbledore age line by using an aging potion and they ended up being thrown out of the circle formed by the age line and each receiving a distinguished looking white beard as they ate breakfast harry noticed that an eagle owl had landed beside draco the malfoy heir removed the letter attached to the owl and read it harry was intrigued when draco face became pale after reading it before he could think further of it he heard a commotion from the door and saw a bunch of older gryffindors cheering and laughing as they entered the great hall among them was angelina johnson who was grinning when she reached the gryffindor table the older girl announced that she had just placed her name in the goblet harry and the rest of their house congratulated her since it was a saturday and they had no homework that needed immediate work harry and his friends went down to the grounds near hagrid hut to do some exercises and martial arts after lunch in the great hall they went back to the gryffindor common room to relax after ron had demolished him in a couple of chess games harry invited ginny to take a walk by the lake rose and hermione decided to go out of the common room with them on the way to the library as they were walking harry heard a gasp to his left turning in that direction harry was alarmed to see rose staring at him her face even paler than malfoy had been that morning rose what is it harry asked hurrying to his sister side h harry rose said i ve just had a v vision and we we have to talk to the headmaster right now she was visibly trembling harry quirked an eyebrow but didntquestion his sister instead he gently took hold of rose hand and lead her towards dumbledore office ginny and hermione following them when they reached the gargoyle guarding the stairs to the headmaster office harry didnthesitate to give the password he and ginny had been given for their lessons the four gryffindors then immediately ascended the stairs to the main office as they stood at the door they heard dumbledore voice bid them to enter ah harry miss weasley miss potter miss granger dumbledore said a smile on his face please sit down what can i do for you actually sir harry said as he sat down in a couch with ginny by his side rose said she needed to speak to you miss potter dumbledore said what wrong i i i had a vision professor rose said in a low voice just a few minutes ago while i was walking in the corridors oh dumbledore asked what did you see in this vision rose i s saw you receive a name from the goblet of fire rose said the name you read was harry s she was now looking at her brother with frightened eyes dumbledore eyes widened and he turned to harry whose own eyes had widened harry did you put your name in the goblet no harry said loudly his voice rang through the office are you sure harry dumbledore said you didntask an older boy to place your name in the goblet no professor harry said i promised ginny that i wouldnttry to enter the tournament i would never go back on a promise to her or to anyone dumbledore looked intently at harry for a few seconds before turning away and sighing after a few moments of silence hermione asked professor do you think rose vision will come true you dontthink it just a possibility of what may happen i dontthink so miss granger dumbledore said after the prophecy she has given i dontthink any visions rose will see will be false so that it then harry asked somehow i going to be in this tournament dumbledore sighed again i believe so harry someone has decided that you are to take part in this tournament someone harry said hah do we have to ask who that someone is hands down it moldieshorts there was a bitter resigned tone in his voice wait a minute ginny said she stood up and started advancing on the headmaster her gait much like a cat stalking its prey you mean to tell me that you re going to let this happen her voice started rising with every word you re going to let him take part in a tournament where he could get hurt much less die just bloody great wait till my mum hears this both of them she then stood in front of dumbledore glaring at him harry heart swelled upon hearing ginny implied reference to his mother as one of her mothers he also felt proud of how defensive of him she was hermione and rose on the other hand just stared at ginny shocked that she had shouted at dumbledore someone considered to be one of the greatest wizards alive dumbledore calmly watched the youngest weasley for a few moments then he said now now calm down ginevra when ginny bristled at his use of her despised given name he said ginny please listen to me first as you have seen in the amusing way your brothers attempted to enter it is impossible to get pass the age line if one is underage it will take great magic to fool the goblet of fire so that harry is chosen as one of the contestants if it is indeed voldemort who has planned this then he has a purpose that we must discover if we somehow prevent harry inclusion as a contestant he will simply make another plan one we will be unable to prevent at least with the spells you both have been learning this past summer harry will be better prepared to face the three tasks of the tournament the four students considered dumbledore points finally ginny sighed then she said all right professor i guess there nothing else we can do i hope that with what you ve taught us so far harry can handle whatever is going to happen can you tell us what the tasks will be dumbledore shook his head though he was smiling unfortunately ginny in fairness to the other contestants i cannot divulge that information i must treat harry equally with the other school champions one of the rules of the tournament states that none of the heads of the school may help their contestant so what do we do now sir hermione asked well miss granger dumbledore said it will be time for the feast and the picking of the school champions in less than two hours i suggest that the four of you return to your common room and try to relax relax harry said are you bloody mad oops sorry professor but how can i relax when i know my name is going to come out of that bloody goblet i can imagine what the rest of the school will think when that happens it ll be like second year again when they thought i was slytherin heir then there are the other schools this is going to be bloody awful he slumped into his chair and looked down at the floor dontworry harry ginny voice came up in his mind as she took his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze our little band isntgoing to be like that we ll be behind you you wontbe alone in this she then sent him soothing thoughts through their bond harry felt himself calming down and sighed he looked up at dumbledore all right professor i ll try and looked surprised when it happens i hope you re happy just wait till mum hears this he was a little satisfied on seeing dumbledore visibly wince harry stood up dragging ginny with him and left the office hermione and rose gave a quiet goodbye to dumbledore before following the couple dumbledore leaned back in his chair for a moment before turning to fawkes who was on his perch beside his desk i need you to deliver a message for me old friend he told the phoenix hermione and rose followed harry and ginny as they headed outside to the grounds not stopping until they reached the tree under which the young couple had had their valentine day picnic a few months back harry sat with his back against the tree ginny sat beside him and leaned against him her arms wrapped around him hermione and rose sat down beside them worry over harry evident in their eyes ginny could feel the turmoil in his mind finally she forced him to lay his head in her lap and started to run her hands in his hair as she continued sending soothing thoughts to him how much time passed was unknown to the four until hermione noticed that it was getting dark she reluctantly approached her two friends harry ginny she said it starting to get late it ll be time for the feast soon i know you dontwant to go anymore but it ll look suspicious when your name gets pulled out of the goblet harry looked at her for a moment then reluctantly got up slowly he reached down and pulled ginny up without a word the two walked slowly back to the castle hermione and rose exchanged a worried glance and followed the bonded pair as they reached the front doors they saw the students from durmstrang approaching krum and propanov in the lead they noticed that the goblet was no longer in the entrance hall they saw it when they entered the already filling great hall resting on the teachers table in front of dumbledore empty chair the four younger gryffindors sat down beside fred and george across from ron neville and ti where were you four ron asked leaning across the table you were gone for hours we were sitting by the lake hermione answered almost immediately just talking we forgot the time talking eh fred said his eyebrows wagging i bet harry and ginny werentjust talking fred ginny said blushing her hand still in harry s the light banter of the siblings turned harry attention from the goblet and his worried anticipation he started to eat suddenly finding himself ravenous ginny sensed his change in mood and was grateful she had been afraid that he would not eat and be morose all evening drawing attention to himself finally the plates were cleared of food and dumbledore stood up causing the hall to fall silent the other people at the teachers table had different expressions on their faces ranging from madame maxime and propanov tense expectant looks to bagman beam to mr crouch bored indifference after a few words on where the chosen champions would go upon being named dumbledore lowered the lights of the great hall and the goblet flared brighter than before its bluish flames dancing wildly now that the moment had arrived harry found himself barely listening to dumbledore he was dimly aware of krum being named the durmstrang champion and the veela girl fleur delacour being named the beauxbatons champion finally he heard dumbledore clearly say the hogwarts champion is harry potter harry felt numb even if he had been expecting it now that it had happened he felt cold and terrified he could hear the noise level in the hall abruptly rise as the rest of the hogwarts students started talking he looked at ron who was staring at him eyes wide neville and ti were the same most of those at the gryffindor table were also staring at him open mouthed i i didntplace my name in he said i dontwant to be in this tournament harry ginny said in his mind professor dumbledore is calling you up to join the other champions harry harry winced and looked around at the teachers table dumbledore was beckoning to him mcgonagall was at his side whispering furiously to him madame maxime and propanov were eyeing him with narrowed eyes bagman looked confused while crouch seemed to still be bored harry stiffly got up and walked slowly to the teachers table he could feel the eyes of the rest of the students following him so far there had been no applause which was something he had expected he was dimly aware of ginny quietly telling ron off no ron he didntput his name in you know he couldnthave hidden that from me if he tried he doesntreally want in this thing by now he had reached the teachers table dumbledore directed him to a door behind that table as he passed them harry noted the shocked looks of most of the teachers including hagrid snape however looked at him with loathing moody simply stared at him with both eyes even the bluish one harry went through the door to find himself in a smaller room lined with portraits of wizards and witches and a fireplace blazing comfortably opposite him the other two champions were standing in front of the fireplace conversing in low tones they turned around upon hearing him enter looks of surprise and consternation on their faces what is zis the french girl asked is zer a problem wiz ze ogwarts champion er um i him harry said lamely i mean i the hogwarts champion krum and the girl stared at him their eyes wide before they could say anything the door opened and several people came in led by professor dumbledore those who followed him in the room were bagman mr crouch madame maxime propanov moody professor mcgonagall and snape madame maxime fleur said immediately what iz appening zis little boy is saying that he is ze ogwarts champion harry bristled at fleur statement me a little boy ooh wait till i get my hands on that french hussy how dare he call my harry a little boy harry smiled inwardly and felt a warmth inside himself from the possessiveness coming from his favorite redhead thanks gin dontmind her let see what dumbledore does to appease the other school heads they seemed a bit ticked off he turned his attention to the conversation between the adults i demand an explanation dumbly dorr madame maxime said how can zis boy compete he iz too small to be seventeen she turned to harry how old are you boy harry felt irritated by the imperious tone she was addressing him in but answered anyway i fourteen madame hah propanov said i thought your age line would keep out younger contestants dumbledore if we had known we would have brought younger but equally capable students i dontknow about capability propanov snape said but potter is notorious for breaking rules and crossing lines he should not ever since he started here enough severus dumbledore said this will not resolve our problem he faced harry and gave him a wink that the others did not see harry dumbledore asked did you put your name in the goblet or have an older student put it for you no professor harry answered i have no idea how my name came into the goblet isntthere any way i can withdraw and another contestant from hogwarts chosen i afraid not mr potter bagman said the rules say that once a person name is pulled out of the goblet he or she is obliged to compete there no dropping out or withdrawing barty he turned to mr crouch yes i afraid ludo is right young man crouch said a smile appearing on his face for a moment before he continued in a curt voice according to the rules you are placed in a binding magical contract the moment your name is selected by the goblet there is no getting out of it you are therefore the official representative of hogwarts in this tri wizard tournament harry sighed and muttered well it was worth a try bagman then said smiling widely well now that it all cleared up we can go on to the instructions for our champions barty care to do the honors of explaining the first task yes of course crouch said he faced the three chosen champions the first task is designed to test your bravery and ability to think quickly courage in the face of danger is an important trait for a wizard this task will be performed in front of the other students and a panel of judges on the twenty fourth of november until then you will not be informed of the nature of the task the eyes of harry and the other two champions widened in surprise over this information now mr crouch continued let me inform you of some other rules in the course of the tournament the champions will not be allowed to ask or receive any help of any sort from your teachers to complete the tasks you will face the first challenge with nothing more than your wands information on the second task will be given to you after the first task due to the demands of the tasks and the tournament as a whole the three champions will be exempted from end of year tests do any of you have any questions when none of the three said anything crouch turned back to dumbledore i think that it albus i think i will turn in now this evening events have tired me of course barty dumbledore said argus will show you to your room in the guest wing bagman tried to get madame maxime and propanov to join him for a nightcap but the two headpersons simply collected their respective champion and exited the room harry watched them go then noticed that dumbledore was calling him harry dumbledore said i think you should go back to gryffindor tower doubtless your housemates will want to celebrate just dontstay up too late his characteristic twinkle was in his eye and dontworry about your parents i will inform them harry nodded thankful he didnthave to face his mother wrath yet and left the room the great hall was empty and dark now except for a few lit torches he trudged up to the tower wondering what ron would say strangely he couldntread any emotion from ginny just feel her presence coming from gryffindor tower great he thought now that it happened she probably pissed at me for breaking my promise not to enter the bloody tournament even if it wasntmy fault balderdash he said to the fat lady as he reached the portrait he was nearly blasted off his feet by the level of noise that came through the portrait then he was literally hauled through the portrait hole by fred and george he was stunned to see that the entire house was in the common room applauding and cheering him he was surprised to see red and gold banners decorating the room and a table in the middle groaning with food and drinks several people were now crowding around him demanding to know how he got passed the age line harry repeatedly denied having entered though they refused to listen finally there was a loud bang and the room became silent all right you lot ginny voice rang through the common room leave my boyfriend alone he thankful for your support of him but it been a tiring day for him and he needs to rest with that ginny hauled harry away from their fellow gryffindors now silent and wide eyed with the help of hermione and rose the room remained silent for a few second more then whispering and muttering broke out as the rest of the inhabitants of gryffindor tower began talking about ginny revelation of her relationship with harry harry allowed ginny and the others to sit him down at their favorite spot in front of the fireplace are you all right ginny asked him he was a bit surprised that she had asked the question out loud instead of mentally but decided that she probably wanted him to answer verbally so as to reassure hermione and rose harry shrugged and said i guess i ll be fine even knowing beforehand it would happen didntquite prepare me for the shock he then looked at ginny are you mad at me gin i know i promised you i wouldntenter but he didntfinish his apology since ginny had started kissing him to prove she wasntupset or mad at the same time she was talking to him mentally it not your fault harry just be careful with whatever tasks they have planned i want you in one piece at our wedding oi i thought i told you none of that in my line of sight a familiar voice broke into their thoughts harry drew back from ginny and saw ron coming up to them accompanied by neville and ti ron looked a bit sheepishly at harry running his hand through his hair er for a while there i thought you had entered the tournament without telling me ginny set me straight told me you couldnthave done that without her knowing and you d promised her you wouldn t i know that ron harry said i saw her tell you that sort of ron shook his head that one thing i probably wontget used to how the two of you know what the other is doing most of the time he clapped harry on the shoulder well anyway mate how does it feel to be the hogwarts champion harry thought about it for a moment then grinned honestly it feels weird weird and great now this will be something i can do for myself and be deserving of whatever honor i get his sister and closest friends exchanged looks and knew what harry was talking about unlike his scar and fame for having defeated voldemort as a baby winning the tri wizard tournament would be an achievement he could accomplish on his own talents and magic without the prophecy harry yawned it getting late guys and i whacked i going to bed he kissed ginny good night and headed up to the fourth year boys dorm he quickly brushed his teeth and changed to his pajamas as he climbed into bed his thoughts turned back to the tournament and the first task i wonder what it ll be i hope it isntsomething like dueling some people i hope mum and dad take it easy on me when they hear anyway it isntmy fault i wonder how the other houses will react with that last thought he fell asleep unaware the next day would provide answers to his last two thoughts when harry and ginny entered the great hall for breakfast they noticed the hostile looks harry was getting from most of slytherin and even some of the ravenclaw and hufflepuff students the other ravenclaws and hufflepuffs ignored them harry just shrugged it off as he had expected it as long as none of the gryffindors were against him he could tolerate the lack of support from the other houses he d just chalk it up to another grudge against voldemort if old snakeface was behind his entry into the tournament near the end of breakfast an eagle owl familiar to harry and rose flew into the great hall and landed on the teachers table right in front of dumbledore in its beak it held a red letter that started smoking dumbledore serenely took the letter from the owl which nipped his finger then flew off the red letter then exploded and the voice of lily potter thundered around the hall albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore how dare you allow my son to take part in your bloody tournament you assured james and i that he could not enter how could you you better make sure he survives or descendant of merlin or not it wontbe voldemort who takes you down the whole hall was silent at the end of that tirade harry thumped his forehead on the table three times his cheeks burning with embarrassment over his mother threatening of the headmaster bloody hell why did she have to send him a howler in front of everyone at that now everyone will think i a mamma boy he felt ginny hand grasp his own and give it a gentle but firm squeeze but i like mamma boys especially raven haired ones with glasses and a lightning bolt scar on their foreheads he also felt a small hand on his shoulder where rose was sitting giving him a gentle squeeze dontworry bro rose said it just mum way of worrying over you she just wants to put the fear of merlin on professor dumbledore not that it didntseem to bother him harry raised his head to glance at dumbledore sure enough the elderly wizard didntseem bothered by the howler from lily smiling with his characteristic twinkle in the eye as he gazed back at harry just then the same eagle owl that had delivered the howler to dumbledore landed in front of harry a letter attached to his leg hello artemis rose said stroking the owl beak before untying the letter and handing that to harry harry unfolded the letter and recognized the untidy scrawl of his father as he read it dear harry and rose i ve received word from albus concerning the recent event at hogwarts i have to say that i a bit disappointed to learn what has happened but i dontblame you harry ordinarily i would go along with albus on any of his plans but because it involves you harry and puts you in serious danger i have reservations about it unfortunately there is nothing we can do now but play it by ear if you need any help harry donthesitate to get in touch with me or your mother i know it isntexactly against the rules but you need every advantage you can get if indeed this is part of some plan of voldemort then we cannot afford to take anything for granted i glad moody is there he was one of my greatest instructors at the auror academy he wontbe too bothered to follow the rules so he can help you that said let me just say that i proud of you harry for being a champion of the tri wizard tournament no matter what the circumstances of your entering were good luck and do your best that what a potter does well love dad p s i know your mum sent albus a nasty howler dontmind her she just reacted badly to the news it so bad that i sleeping on the living room couch for the next month oh that so bad rose said having read the letter over harry shoulder poor dad that couch can get pretty uncomfortable after a few nights harry couldnthelp but have a bit of sympathy for his dad who was getting partial blame for his son entry into the tri wizard cup he was also heartened by his show of support he hoped he wouldntdisappoint him like any other boy he felt the need for approval from his father well maybe mum will relent after she thought about it for a while harry said after all it really isnthis fault the potter siblings looked at each other as they remembered several times when their father had been forced to sleep in the living room due to some transgression lily had thought he had done well maybe not harry and rose said together before laughing ginny joined them in their laughter having seen harry memories of james previous escapades and read the letter through her bond with harry since it was a sunday harry decided to spend the day relaxing and forgetting that in 23 days he would have to face the first task he generally succeeded with ginny help of course a n surprise that harry the only hogwarts champion well somehow that happened i hope none of you are cedric fans lol so harry in the triwizard i know a few of you wanted something different but i thought it made more sense to put him in the action i ve made a few changes to the tasks so it wontbe the same as the original just wait for the next chapter once again please r r chapter 46 the first task disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations harry hated publicity hated it all his life even more he hated reporters for as long as he remembered he had been hounded by reporters everywhere he went reporters interested in the doings of the boy who lived harry had been in potions when colin creevey had informed professor snape that harry was wanted by ludo bagman for a publicity shoot together with a testing of the champions wands harry was led by the younger boy to the room beside the great hall where he and the other champions had first gathered much to his disgust harry found out that a certain reporter he really hated was in the room now this particular reporter was a witch who was presently dressed in magenta robes she had blonde hair that was set in an elaborate coiffure and a heavily jawed face upon which a set of bejeweled spectacles was set her hands had thick fingers with two inch long nails that were painted scarlet her name was rita skeeter harry really hated her as far back as he could remember she had written a lot of articles about him for the daily prophet many uncomplimentary to him much to his parents anger fortunately james had somehow managed to convince the prophet management to give her an overseas assignment five years ago but now it seemed she was back in england and very eager to write about harry again now according to ludo bagman skeeter was at hogwarts assigned to write a publicity article about the triwizard tournament in the daily prophet for the ministry she also had a photographer with her as skeeter looked at harry like christmas had come early harry would have much preferred being in class with snape than here with her bloody hell harry thought this woman is going to write another one of her nasty articles just as rita was asking bagman to let her interview harry dumbledore walked into the room followed by madame maxime professor propanov and mr crouch after them came an old wizard with large pale eyes harry was surprised to recognize mr ollivander who owned the wand shop in diagon alley ah rita dumbledore said a benign smile on his face how good it is to see a former student who doesntseem to care who her articles scandalize rita sniffed and said i only write them as i see them dumbledore oh yes dumbledore said no doubt with a quick quotes quill be that as it may we must start the weighing of the wands with that he turned from her and looked at the three champions harry fleur and krum were now seated side by side in front of a long table where the other three adults had taken seats dumbledore introduced mr ollivander who then began checking the champions wands starting with fleur s after his examination ended in a successful conjuration of some lovely orchids he examined krum wand finally he asked for harry s ah yes mr ollivander said running his hand over the wand i remember your wand mr potter eleven inches made of holly with a phoenix feather at its core harry also remembered when he had gotten his wand it had been the saturday after his eleventh birthday when he had gone with his parents and sister to get his school supplies in diagon alley while his father had gone to florentine florescue ice cream parlor with rose lily had gone with him to ollivander to get his wand harry remembered his mother face going pale when mr ollivander had told him that his wand was brother to the one that had given him his scar since the same phoenix gave a feather for the core of each wand harry often had wondered what that meant it was even more important now when it looked like he and voldemort would eventually have to duel each other after ollivander had checked his wand harry and the other champions sat while numerous pictures were taken through it all harry distracted himself talking with ginny as soon as the photographer told them that he was done skeeter latched on to harry arm now how about that interview harry she said her smile showing off her gold teeth after all the readers need to know all about the champions harry was about to give an angry retort when dumbledore again came to his rescue ah harry dumbledore said there something we must discuss about the triwizard tournament some little details so if you ll excuse us rita with that dumbledore took hold of harry arm and steered him away from the reporter who looked very annoyed harry and dumbledore didntspeak as they walked out of the deserted great hall into the entrance hall and up the main staircase there was still a half hour before dinner harry let dumbledore lead him to the portrait guarding gryffindor tower before leaving him at the portrait dumbledore said i decided you needed time to relax after that ordeal harry i know how tiring it is to sit for a photograph a twinkle appeared in his eye as he added they re a real pain arentthey thank merlin i haventhad to do that in over fifty years the one consolation for someone my age is that i dontlook good in a publicity picture anymore get some rest harry i know someone will be coming soon to help you do that thank you sir harry said smiling thanks for the rescue he said the password to the fat lady and entered the empty common room he moved to his usual chair before the cold fireplace as soon as he had flopped down into it he felt the tension from being with rita and the shoot itself bled out of him slowly his eyelids drooped and he fell asleep the next thing he knew he was being awakened by soft lips pressing against his he opened his eyes and saw a cascade of red filling his vision he pulled back a little and gazed at ginny who was smiling how are you doing love she asked softly did you get a good rest yes he answered a smile forming on his face it a bit uncanny how professor dumbledore sometimes knows what you need especially after that ginny frowned for a moment well i glad that over i could feel your tension and anger at that woman i cantbelieve the headmaster let her into hogwarts he knows how horrible her articles were for you over the years harry shrugged maybe the editor at the prophet or bagman didnttell him who was coming to do the article anyway i hungry after that nap i didntmiss dinner did i ginny giggled no harry i just got back from class we can just make it to the table before ron finishes all the food harry chuckled and allowed ginny to pull him off the armchair and out the common room as the days passed harry found the rest of hogwarts slowly coming to terms with him as their champion he got less furtive looks and fewer people were whispering behind his back of course the slytherins were still throwing glares at him except strangely enough for draco who always had a neutral look on his face whenever he and harry faced each other snape on the other hand often threw insulting comments at harry centered on his entry into the tournament while harry hunched over his cauldron if it wasntfor ginny sending calming thoughts through their bond harry would have hexed the git a week before the first task harry was in care of magical creatures taking care of the blast ended skrewt they were assigned to raise when hagrid came up to him hagrid leaned down looking at the skrewt as he whispered to harry arry about the first task i sugges yeh meet me ere tonight oh an bring yer dad cloak hagrid straightened up and said that good arry it seems teh be growin well he then strode off without a backward glance leaving a puzzled harry later that evening as they were sitting down for dinner ron took a seat beside harry harry ron whispered i just saw charlie coming in at the entrance hall harry turned to him puzzled charlie here what could he be doing here harry ginny said in his mind remember what charlie said as we were saying goodbye at the platform he said he may see us soon way before christmas harry raised an eyebrow you think this has something to do with the triwizard gin i think so harry ginny said i doubt he here for a social visit especially considering how hard it is for him to get time off his work i think he already used up any vacation time he had during the summer visiting for our birthdays and the world cup his work harry said in his mind ginny what if he here because of his work you dontthink ginny asked him no they d be crazy to do that crazy or brilliant harry said now i have a feeling what hagrid wants to show me sure enough later that night harry found himself staring at three huge male dragons of different species as he huddled under his invisibility cloak more than twenty wizards including charlie were busy tying them down within some form of enclosure at the edge of the forbidden forest harry could feel ginny horror and fear as she watched the scene through him not even the presence of madame maxime who seemed to be on some sort of date with hagrid judging from the flowers he had given here could tear harry from watching the dragons as they struggled against the keepers when he got back to the common room harry found it empty except for the new marauders he knew that ginny had told them what he had seen they now looked at him with looks that showed the same dread and fear he felt harry flopped down in his favorite armchair and placed his head in his hands merlin how am i going to handle a full grown dragon what are they going to make us do the chinese fireball welsh green and hungarian horntail all looked formidable especially the horntail ginny moved herself into his lap and wrapped her arms around him causing his tension to ease harry hermione asked is it really true they have dragons here at hogwarts harry sighed yes hermione three of them one for each of us neville let out a low whistle blimey what are they on about how can they think you can face a dragon well hermione said maybe they donthave to fight them as such maybe they re just an obstacle you have to get pass after all you d have to be a professional like charlie to really handle a dragon harry thought about it for a moment maybe you re right hermione maybe all i have to do is get pass it so if that true how do i do that no one had the answer to that question hermione and rose volunteered to research on that harry hoped he could get an answer from dumbledore but doubted it due to the contest rules of course that should have prevented hagrid from showing him the dragons in the first place therefore it was surprising when on sunday night with the day of the first task only three days away moody asked him to speak to him after dinner when he got to the defense classroom he found the ex auror removing his wooden leg ah potter the man said gruffly come in i just wanted to commend you on your spellwork lately close the door as soon as harry had closed the door moody cast a silencing charm and an imperturbable charm on the door and room i also wanted to ask how you intend to get past your dragon yes i know you know never mind that it sort of a tradition to cheat at the tournament harry started getting nervous as moody magical eye gazed at him well sir i haventcome up with anything yet i ve gone over a lot of spells but as you know most spells just bounce off its hide yes potter he said i know that i have one piece of advice i hear you re a pretty good flyer i suggest you use that skill how do i do that sir harry asked mr crouch mentioned that we d only have our wands for the first task we wontbe allowed to have our brooms ah that the rub potter you re only allowed to bring your wand with you to the task what you do with it is another matter he then lifted the charms now go on with you think about what i said harry went up to gryffindor tower wondering about that harry ginny voice broke into his mind do you remember one of the spells remus taught us this summer the one we had a little trouble concentrating on harry eyebrows drew together as he struggled to remember then his eyes widened as he remembered the spell ginny was hinting at one of the spells remus had taught them just before the world cup was the basic summoning charm with pillows as objects for the spell of course i can summon my broom of course they d only managed to move the pillows a maximum of twenty feet when they were practicing in potter manor ginny go and get my invisibility cloak and the map from my trunk and meet me outside the portrait what for harry isntit late to wander around looking for an empty broom closet harry could feel the teasing tone in her mental voice oh you naughty girl we ll have to do that another time but right now i ll need your help practicing the charm for the next two nights ginny helped harry practice the summoning charm in an empty classroom until midnight by monday night anything he summoned to him moved immediately and quickly no matter how far he even managed to summon a book from the other end of the corridor on their way back to gryffindor tower then it was the morning of the first task harry woke up before dawn feeling tense and frightened more than during any quidditch match he had played in for the past three years he reached out to ginny mind and discovered that she was still asleep knowing he wouldntget any more sleep he changed quickly and went down to the common room he sat down in his favorite chair by the fire and looked deep into the embers of the dying fire then feeling a bit of anxiety he stroked the fire back to life when it was nice and warm again he went back up to his room and grabbed a pouch from inside his trunk when he reached the fire he took some powder from the pouch and threw it in the fire which turned the familiar green he poked his face into the green flames then said potter manor living room he looked around the familiar room which was starting to lighten up from the rising sun shining through the windows he saw a lumpy shape on one of the couches it resolved in the light to that of a sleeping man covered in a woolen blanket dad harry whispered then after a few seconds said louder dad james jumped up and spun around his wand out unfortunately his feet caught in the blanket and he toppled to the floor harry grimaced and then said dad it me harry by the fire james put on his glasses and peered at the fire harry what are you doing making a floo call this early in the morning well harry began not quite knowing how to put his feelings into words er it the day of the first task i i i just wanted to know if you knew james knelt beside the fire and saw the anxious look of his eldest looking back at him i ll be there son james said himself feeling worried now i ll be there officially to help guard the school just in case unfortunately your mum isntallowed to watch until the third task she was a bit upset over that which is another reason i sleeping here since i didnttry to get permission to let her come the other parents arentbeing allowed so we couldntmake an exception for lily now dontworry about the task whatever it is i sure you ll do fine after all you know more spells than most fourteen year olds i ll bet a few of them are unknown to krum and that delacour girl just make sure you move around a lot harry eyed his father critically you know dontyou you know what we re facing today james sighed yes son i know all the tasks and all about this tournament that why i didntwant you to enter but now that you re in it i want you to be careful winning isntimportant i dontcare if you re last place just be careful and come out of this alive otherwise i think your mum and ginny will kill you not to mention me barty bagman and albus you canttell me what we re doing against those dragons can you harry asked james gulped you know about the dragons yes dad harry said we saw no other reason for him to be at hogwarts james sighed all right i guess i can tell you a bit you ll each be facing one dragon you have to rescue someone from the dragon someone will explain the exact nature of the task to the three of you just before the task rescue someone from a dragon harry asked incredulous are they daft how are you supposed to do that who are we going to rescue james gave a wan smile i afraid the details escape me son just be careful okay i have to go change i ll see you after the task but be aware that i ll be there watching you okay dad harry said i guess that all i can ask you i ll be seeing you harry then stepped away from the fire his mind now wondering who he would be rescuing from a dragon a half hour later he felt ginny stirring from her sleep harry why are you awake already ginny asked in his mind her voice still a little wooly are you still worried just a bit ginny he answered her wait a minute ginny said you found out something about the task it causing you a lot of anxiety what is it harry sighed and told ginny about his dad information ginny was a bit shocked about it she then changed and hurried down to harry she helped calm him down and come up with a strategy to get past the dragon using his firebolt the first task was to take place after lunch harry spent the morning drifting through his classes during lunch harry could only eat with gentle coaxing from ginny he was only vaguely aware when colin told them that rose had been called by flitwick to remain after their charms class finally mcgonagall came by the gryffindor table asking him to follow her ginny gave his a fierce hug and a brief kiss on the lips as she wished him luck mentally the other new marauders added their own words of encouragement as he walked through the great hall more words of support came from the other tables to harry surprise even draco gave him a nod ignoring the glares the other slytherins were giving the hogwarts champion harry plodded along behind mcgonagall as they walked down the grounds to the area at the edge of the forest where hagrid had shown him the dragons to his surprise he saw that a tent had been erected about fifty feet in front of the enclosure mcgonagall led him inside the tent where bagman was already talking to krum and fleur delacour they were both sitting down and looking as nervous as he felt ah good mr potter bagman said the third of our champions good now about your task in this bag he showed them a purple silk sack are models of what you will face please pull one out he offered the bag to fleur ladies first fleur placed her hand in the bag and pulled out a model of the welsh green with a number one attached to it fleur hand trembled as she held it ah bagman said the first one mr krum you next he held the bag in front of krum who pulled out the model of the chinese fireball with a number two around its neck hmm bagman said well that leaves you mr potter with the last one harry pulled out the model of the hungarian horntail with a number three around its neck he gulped as the model moved on his hand and twitched its nasty looking tail right bagman said the task is a version of one of those muggle fairy tales with the dragon and the princess each of the dragons you will face will be guarding someone you care about some relative who has volunteered to play the part of the princess he grinned at the alarmed look on each of the champions faces now dontworry there a shield and repelling charms around each er victim who will be tied to a pole none of the dragons will be able to get within twenty feet of the princess the shield will even repel its breath what you must do is get past your dragon and up to your princess you ll be safe while you re beside her but you have to get her away from the dragon and back the way you came the moment you and your princess get past the dragon again the handlers will take charge and subdue the beast the tent was silent as the three champions assimilated the information bagman had given them harry wondered again who his princess would be he knew it wasntginny he had a sinking feeling who it would be and ginny seemed to agree with him outside they could hear the noise of hundreds and hundreds of feet walking past the tent as the rest of the students headed for whatever area they would be viewing the task from all the while talking laughing and joking through ginny eyes harry could see them climbing up a set of stairs into wooden stands that had been erected around the enclosure after a few seconds bagman said now the number around the neck of each model refers to the order in which you are to take on the dragons i have to go now as i ll be commenting ms delacour you will be first just go out into the enclosure when you hear the whistle all right good with that he left the tent another couple of seconds passed then they heard a whistle fleur gulped and slowly stepped out of the tent her hand tightly grasping her wand a few more seconds and there was a great roar from the crowd signaling that fleur had entered the enclosure and was now facing a real welsh green harry sat down heavily in a stool as he started to see what was happening through ginny eyes while doing so he tuned out bagman commentary ginny was seated high in the stands almost in the exact middle below her there was a pole stuck into the ground and a small figure probably a little girl was tied to the pole fleur was at the opposite end of the enclosure coming in through a gap in the fence between the tied up girl and fleur was the welsh green sitting on its haunches and facing the beauxbatons champion fleur seemed to spend an inordinate time staring at the figure tied to the pole she then started moving at a run first toward the dragon then weaving to its right all the while the dragon watched her suddenly it opened its mouth and spewed a jet of fire at her fleur barely managed to jump aside avoiding the flames then rolled to stand up again she cast a spell and a red light hit the dragon the dragon roared a bit and started shaking its head then its head started to droop fleur seemed to cast the same spell again the dragon head seemed to hold still as if it was just staring straight ahead fleur then started to wave her wand in some sort of complicated pattern the dragon just stood there watching the wand movements finally its head hit the ground followed by its body it seemed it was asleep fleur moved cautiously past the beast and up to the pole she cast a spell to untie the ropes then carefully hugged the little girl slowly the two walked past the sleeping dragon suddenly the dragon gave a snort and another burst of flame erupted from its nostrils and hit the edge of fleur robes the crowd gasped as one but fleur cast a spell that sent a jet of water onto the flames putting them out she and the little girl then ran up to the gap in the fence once they had reached it about a dozen wizards moved forward and attached chains to the sleeping dragon they then levitated it out to a cage set at the side of the enclosure harry closed his eyes and put up the mental wall he habitually used to prevent seeing things through his soulmate eyes he didntwant to see anymore he just listened to bagman commentary as the scores of fleur were tallied by the judges after a few minutes the whistle again sounded and krum slowly walked out harry kept his eyes tightly shut as he concentrated on remembering his plan to get past the dragon all the while he could hear bagman comments on viktor efforts harry heart began to pump faster and he felt the fear tingling down to his fingertips he nearly jumped up from the stool when he heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible shriek finally harry heard bagman announce that krum had gotten his princess past the dragon then he heard the whistle taking a deep breath and painfully aware of his hammering heart harry walked out of the tent and up to the gap in the enclosure fence as he stepped into the enclosure harry looked up to the stands filled to capacity with the students the faculty bagman propanov madame maxime and mr crouch all sat together in the middle ginny and the rest of the gryffindors were near them on harry right harry turned his gaze to the floor of the enclosure his heart sank as he saw the small figure tied to the pole just beyond the imposing blackish bulk of the hungarian horntail it was rose she was dressed in a light blue shirt and blue denim pants she also appeared to be asleep harry could barely see the silver shimmer of the domelike shield around her the horntail flicked its tail this way and that as it eyed harry with its yellowish eyes harry yelled accio firebolt he waited for what seemed like ages before the familiar sight of his broom came through the gap in the enclosure and stopped beside him mounting quickly harry kicked of from the ground and felt the fear leave him as he soared upward go harry go save rose he heard ginny tell him in his mind harry flew directly at the horntail drawing gasps from the crowd then he suddenly banked hard to the right just as the dragon unleashed a jet of flame which barely missed him harry climbed upward and circled above the dragon the dragon roared and followed his movements with its yellow beady eyes furling and unfurling its wings as it stood about thirty feet in front of rose harry started to rise higher slowly inch by inch enticing the dragon to follow him finally the dragon extended its wings fully and pushed off the ground harry immediately dove and slipped right below the beast avoiding its jaws by mere inches he felt himself pass through the shield and landed right beside rose she still seemed to be asleep there also seemed to be a golden locket shaped like a seashell on a gold necklace around her neck harry decided to leave this for later rose harry said as he came up to her come on sis wake up harry pointed his wand at her enervate rose woke up with a start and looked around confusion evident on her face she calmed down a little when she saw him harry where am i what happened why am i tied up to a pole just relax rose harry said it seems our dear headmaster and the organizers of this tournament thought it interesting to have a version of the prince the dragon and the princess it seems you re the princess i rescuing what rose said her face showing outrage what dolts thought that up come on get me out of these ropes she started struggling against her bonds take it easy harry said just give me a few seconds to get this right diffindo harry used a well placed cutting curse to sever rose ropes harry watch out for the dragon ginny suddenly screamed in his mind harry whirled around to see that the horntail had landed just a few feet from them closer than it should be able to it raised its clawed arms and took at swipe at them harry grabbed rose and dropped to the ground the dragon arm hit the shield the shield collapsed in a shower of sparks and the dragon hand passed through the air just above their heads its claws barely struck the pole leaving a groove of claw marks a half inch deep on the wood harry grabbed rose and they mounted the firebolt rose wrapping her arms around harry waist harry kicked off the ground just as the dragon took another swipe at them this time it connected with the pole tearing it out of the ground harry made the broom climb upward zooming above the stands hang on rose harry yelled to his sister rose tightened her hold around harry waist harry flew out over the forest looking back he saw that the dragon was following them its wings occasionally flapping to give it bursts of speed after about few minutes harry heard ginny voice in his mind harry dontgo too far over the forest head back to the enclosure the handlers are gathering to decide what to do okay gin harry made a wide turn and headed back toward the enclosure the dragon made a tighter turn and closed the distance to them to only twenty feet harry suddenly banked right just in time as a stream of fire passed by them harry dove down into the trees once they were among the trees harry slowed down he weaved in and out of the trees trying to head for hogwarts harry stopped a moment and used his wand point me he knew that hogwarts lay west of the forest finally they saw the stands and harry guided the broom over the stands cheers erupted as the crowd saw them the cheers turned to screams and gasps as a shadow feel over him and rose harry leaned forward and pushed the broom forward to move faster then he heard the dragon roar harry rose said someone firing spells at the dragon from the stands harry turned around and saw that the dragon had stopped and turned around to face the stands harry heart clenched when he saw ti standing at the top of the stands his wand out and pointed at the dragon behind harry rose gasped the dragon hovered for a moment then flapped its wings once and dove toward harry friend harry do something ginny voice bordered into panic harry guided the broom to dive back towards the dragon he aimed his wand and concentrated stupefy stupefy stupefy he cried in rapid succession the red jets of light struck the dragon back hard one after another the dragon slowed and shuddered it started to loose altitude slowly then several of the handlers came up and cast their own stunners at it it finally landed on the ground with a loud thud and lay still harry guided his broom back to the entrance of the enclosure professors mcgonagall moody and hagrid met them there they helped harry and rose dismount from the firebolt harry wrapped his arms around rose who he noted was starting to tremble shh harry said as he embraced his sister it all over rose the dragon been subdued ti all right you re all right i all right he felt her stop trembling how is she potter mcgonagall asked i think she ll be fine professor harry said she just needs a few minutes to collect herself that good mcgonagall said then she frowned what were they thinking putting her in danger like that i cantbelieve the horntail got up so close to the two of you and the shield collapsed so fast she right arry hagrid said krum dragon couldn get within ten feet of im and is mother harry frowned is that so hagrid that very suspicious i should say so moody said gruffly there should have been no way for any of that to happen even the stands had repelling charms around them to keep the dragons away from the crowd harry frown deepened it was becoming obvious that someone had tampered with either the shield or the dragon come on potter mcgonagall said a bit gentler than usual we should have madame pomfrey look at you and your sister then i have to go deal with mr malfoy i mean mr black what was that boy thinking trying to cast spells at a dragon dontbe too harsh on him professor rose said unexpectedly he may have saved our lives he distracted the dragon just when it was closing in on us well he should have left it to the handlers mcgonagall said gruffly still i see your point miss potter i will take it into consideration when i talk with mr black mcgonagall and hagrid led them into the first aid tent which was now divided into several cubicles that were separated with curtains harry could see fleur sitting down on a stool in one of the cubicles with the young girl beside her madame pomfrey ushered harry and rose into one of the cubicles and fussed over them as she ranted about the dragons just as madame pomfrey finished her examination the curtains were thrust aside and james potter peered into the room seeing his children inside he rushed in and drew them both into a hug after a few seconds he looked at madame pomfrey how are they poppy they re fine james madame pomfrey said nothing a good dreamless sleep potion cantcure they probably should take one tonight really dragons tying a child to a pole what were they thinking shaking her head the school nurse let james lead his children out of the cubicle one arm around each just as they were exiting the tent ginny came running up to them she grabbed hold of both harry and rose and gave them very tight hugs reminiscent of her mother s hey love harry said hugging her back it all right we re both fine yes ginny rose said patting her friend on the back we re not hurt just tired ginny didntanswer only tightening her arms around both of them paying no attention at all to james james smiled well i see you two are in good hands i ll just check on those dragons i ll see you guys before i go home i dread to face your mother after this i bet she ll send another howler to dumbledore and maybe one to crouch and bagman he shuddered ah well looks like another week on the couch for me at least he strode off then as soon as james had gone ron hermione and neville came up to the three harry rose hermione asked are you guys all right of course they are hermione ron said you think madame pomfrey would let them out of her sight if they weren t hermione huffed at him it only proper to ask them ronald hey easy there hermione neville said you can see they look okay we were all worried about them all right neville hermione said i sorry ron i just needed their reassurance ron shrugged well that okay hermione now that we know they re fine we can tell harry his scores you guys took so long in the first aid tent that they decided to give them without you there so what did i get harry asked well neville said the scores are out of ten they used their wands to show your score madame maxime gave you an eight crouch and dumbledore each gave you a nine and bagman gave you a ten however propanov gave you a five that scumbag ron said darkly he said it was because you left the area he gave krum a ten and krum mother was almost squashed by his dragon as they ran away from it how did that happen harry asked i decided not to watch that part after seeing what fleur went through he cast a spell right in the dragon eye ron explained it made the thing go berserk stomping all over the place at first the dragon couldntget near the place where krum mother was tied up but when they tried to get past it the beast stomped a little too close krum fired another spell at the bottom of its feet just as it was about to step on his mum anyway harry with your combined scores you managed to tie for first place with krum isntthat great harry grinned yeah that fantastic then bagman came in the tent ah good you re up and about harry i just need a word with you and the other champions about the next task all right come on back inside the tent oh bring your princess with you harry almost laughed out loud as he saw the sour look on rose face over bagman referral to her as his princess all right guys harry said i ll see you in the common room he gave ginny a kiss on the cheek while mentally asking her to wait for him and rose he then followed bagman back inside the tent one hand pulling rose along they found fleur and krum waiting for them inside their own princesses with them harry thought that the young girl with fleur must be her sister since they bore a striking resemblance to each other krum mother on the other hand looked less blocky and severe than her son well bagman said a beaming smile on his face congratulations are in order to all of you for completing the first task now you ve got a nice long break before the second task which will take place at half past nine in the morning of february the twenty fourth however if you all notice the princesses each have a locket around their necks in that locket is a clue to the next task so you can prepare for them opening the locket is a bit tricky which is part of the fun all clear good now off with you then harry and rose exited the tent and found ginny waiting for them as they were walking back to the castle they ran into rita skeeter who was wearing acid green robes today oh how lovely skeeter said congratulations harry how about a quick word how did you feel facing that dragon to rescue your sister did you think the scoring was fair for you harry glared at rita he knew his sister and ginny were also glaring at her you want a word harry said well here four no comment and goodbye he then walked rapidly away his two favorite redhead girls on his arms a n i sorry this took a while i had little time to write this past week i hope the next one will be up soon chapter 47 mcgonagall announcement disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations james had dinner beside his children in the great hall that night he told harry that he and the other aurors were concerned over the ease with which the horntail had broken through the shield no one had a clue how that had happened though dumbledore had a few theories since the shields had been created by dumbledore moody and james together it seemed impossible to attribute it to a flaw in the shields themselves on the other hand charlie weasley and the other dragon handlers were puzzled over its aggressiveness giving chase to harry and rose over the forest far from the enclosure ordinarily it should have been content with chasing them away then there was the seashell shaped locket that had been around rose neck during the task harry had tried to open it after the task but failed there was no visible seam between the two halves of the shell preventing him from prying it open he tried a few spells like alohomora but none of them worked this baffled even hermione and rose harry decided not to dwell on these problems for the moment and simply enjoy having survived with the second task almost three months away he preferred to concentrate on his studies his training with dumbledore and spending time with ginny he and rose thanked ti for his attempt to help them against the dragon their thanks included a kiss on the cheek from rose which caused the younger boy to blush furiously they found out that mcgonagall hadntbeen too harsh on ti merely docking him fifteen points and a nightly detention with her for three days lily did send dumbledore another howler the day after the first task to spare harry any embarrassment she decided to send it during afternoon classes unfortunately her voice was so loud it was audible throughout the main castle if not understandable harry stayed in the common room during dinner and hid under his invisibility cloak for the rest of the night with ginny of course the house elves were all too happy to serve the bonded pair a late dinner and ginny made sure harry went to bed happier after a nice good snog session in an empty classroom a week later on the way back from care of magical creatures harry was at the rear of his fellow gryffindors anticipating a nice lunch with ginny when he heard someone call out hey potter from behind him turning around he was surprised to see draco standing there without his usual cronies behind him what do you want malfoy harry asked as he eyed the approaching slytherin suspiciously malfoy scowled look potter this isnteasy for me to say but i just um wanted t t to t t thank you for saving tiberius that day from that dragon harry eyebrows rose to his hairline he also felt ginny surprise at draco statement what did you just say are you thanking me for saving someone you disowned malfoy scowl deepened what the matter potter that dragon roars damage your hearing then draco sighed something harry had never seen him do before look potter i admit i wasntsaddened over what my father did in fact i almost considered throwing a party after he disowned that blood traitor but he held up a hand to cut harry angry retort this past summer i found it lonely at home without him there i i guess i missed him then during the dragon thing when i saw that beast start to head for him well i felt fear fear not for myself but fear for someone who shares the same blood in my veins draco shrugged his shoulders perhaps i do care for the little twit after all but you better not tell him that anyway thanks for saving his life whatever father says he still got the blood of a malfoy without another word he brushed past harry and walked back to the castle harry stared after him wondering what had gotten into his blonde rival maybe he does care about ti after all ginny said in his mind i dontknow gin still he does seem to be less hostile lately even to me harry said to her mentally i better keep a better eye on him we all will harry ginny said if he is changing for the better it ll be good for ti now hurry up and get here i saving you a place and i want to start eating harry smiled both physically and mentally yes dear coming dear another week passed and the gryffindors were finishing up their transfiguration class when mcgonagall cleared her throat class i have an announcement to make she said once the class had quieted down she continued now the yule ball which is a tradition during the triwizard tournament is fast approaching the ball is open to all fourth years and above but a student in a lower year may attend if invited by one of you harry noted that lavender brown parvati and hermione all looked at him and giggled he guessed they knew who he would invite since his relationship with ginny was now well known to most of the students of his house he also felt ginny elation over the news mcgonagall looked disapprovingly at the three girls for a moment before continuing dress robes will be the attire for the ball it will take place on december 25th from eight o clock until midnight you will be allowed to go to hogsmeade this weekend to attend to any thing you may require for the ball she then stared at the whole class the yule ball is a way of socializing with our foreign guests while this is an opportunity to relax and er let our hair down i will expect each and every one of you to be on your best behavior i will be very displeased if a gryffindor embarrasses this school have i made myself clear the bell rang just then and the class hurriedly gathered their things just as he was leaving mcgonagall asked harry to remain behind yes professor harry asked potter mcgonagall said i expect you will be inviting miss weasley to the ball harry felt his cheeks flush er yes professor she d be really mad if i didn t you better believe it potter he heard ginny say in his mind mcgonagall gave him a slight smile then i have to inform you that part of the yule ball tradition is that the champions and their partners open the ball with a dance harry eyes widened b b but professor i dontdance mcgonagall frowned then you had better learn potter you wouldntwant to disappoint miss weasley now would you it tradition so you have to do it harry sighed all right professor harry could hear ginny laughing in his mind as he walked to the great hall for lunch he had never liked to dance his mum had tried to teach him muggle dancing when he was younger but it had never really interested him it looks like he ll have to ask his mum to teach him oh your mum will be delighted to know that harry ginny said amusement in her mental voice be kind ginny harry said a bit annoyed i only doing this so i dontstep on your feet while we dance okay harry i sorry ginny said still amused come and have some lunch love there treacle tart today all right i forgive you harry said his mind now on his favorite dessert the following saturday was the day for the hogsmeade trip that mcgonagall had announced harry and ginny planned to wander around the village in the morning meet up with hermione rose neville ron and the twins at noon for lunch at the three broomsticks then they would split up to all boys and all girls for some late christmas shopping before meeting again at half past three for the walk back to the castle harry and ginny met in the common room at seven o clock in the morning since they wanted to get an early start to hogsmeade ginny was excited since this would be only her second trip to hogsmeade they were dressed warmly since it had been snowing for the last two days and the grounds were covered with the white stuff when they entered the great hall they found it almost empty they had a quick breakfast and managed to get past filch with no trouble they walked hand in hand down the path through from the school as they walked past the train station harry asked so ginny where do you want to go first why dontwe go first to honeyduke sweetshop ginny said verbally before switching to talking in harry mind there are a few things i want to get there then we can go to zonko joke shop sounds good to me harry answered mentally a smile forming on his face they entered the candy shop and were greeted by the shop owner mr flume who was behind the counter harry allowed ginny to lead him around the store each of them holding a basket to fill with their favorite sweets as ginny basket filled up faster than harry s harry struggled to keep his amusement in check if there was one thing ginny shared with ron aside from red hair freckles their last name and parents it was a sweet tooth ginny absolutely adored chocolate and sweets which used to be harry only gift to her on past christmases and birthdays finally ginny basket was filled to capacity with chocolate frogs jelly slugs ice mice licorice wands pepper imps peppermint toads sugar mice sugar quills and all sorts of nonmagical chocolate and candies harry basket had less variety but almost as much they paid for their choices and went two doors down to zonko joke shop there they replenished their supply of dungbombs hiccup sweets and other joke items they were a bit disappointed that there seemed to be nothing new in the store when they graduate fred and george are going to make their own joke shop they ve got ideas that ll blow the competition away ginny said to harry in his mind as they left the store you said it ginny harry said those two are great pranksters and their ideas are original i heard them one time asking sirius for tips on prank items oh and sirius gave them some you bet they d probably get him as a consultant for their future store if he wasntan auror i doubt that ll stop sirius from helping them you know you re probably right they laughed at that so harry said where do you want to go now ginny the other students were now coming into the village making the streets a little crowded i think we need a little alone time harry she said to him a wicked smile forming on her face i know you brought your other cloak let go toward the shrieking shack harry grinned your wish is my command gin they moved into an alley where harry drew his invisibility cloak from a pocket and threw it over them concealed from sight they moved to the woods near the shrieking shack when they were among the trees with no one in sight harry threw off the cloak and spread his normal cloak on the snowy ground ginny pushed him to a sitting position on the cloak and sat on his lap so harry said to her what do you plan for us to do during this alone time oh something like this ginny answered as she placed her arms around his neck and planted her lips on his for an indeterminate amount of time they lost all awareness of their surroundings finally the need for air made them pull apart they could feel each other heart racing from their passion they sat there in each other arms the heat from their passion holding the cold at bay then ginny happened to glance at harry watch harry it fifteen past twelve we re late they quickly brushed themselves off and hurriedly walked to the three broomsticks upon entering the pub they looked around when they spotted their friends sitting in a booth along the wall they moved there hey ron said what took you guys so long we ve been waiting for hours now ron hermione said that not true it not even half past twelve yet we d only just got here ourselves before his two friends could get into a row harry said sorry we took too long at zonko s we re here now so let order our food and eat we still have some christmas shopping to do neville and rose quickly agreed and called madame rosemerta over to take their orders after a nice lunch harry went off with ron and neville while ginny went with rose and hermione as they walked down the street neville turned to harry so harry do you have any idea what to get ginny harry nodded i think i do nev but i canttell you or even think of it i want it to be a surprise oh right neville said she might find out about it because of that thing you share still harry ron said it must be nice to be able to talk to each other even when you arentwith each other yes ron harry said smiling it like we re never really apart from each other we really are half of a whole they soon reached a shop that had only opened the previous year which specialized in jewelry and little knick knacks both magical and nonmagical that could be given as gifts it was called the little menagerie and was the shop where harry had bought ginny previous christmas gift the boys found many gifts in the shop including harry gift to ginny they moved on to the other stores they met up with the girls on time for the walk back to the castle together they talked and joked as they trudged through the snow all in all it had been an enjoyable and fruitful day the week that followed was filled with last minute assignments and surprise tests before they knew it it was the last day of the term harry and ginny were entering the gryffindor common room after an after dinner walk around the grounds when they noticed ron sitting in an armchair in front of the fireplace his face pale hermione was sitting beside him a look of pity on her face the common room was empty except for a couple of sixth year girls talking in the opposite corner ron ginny asked taking a seat on the other side of her brother is something wrong i shouldnthave done that ron mumbled done what harry asked as he sat beside ginny what did you do ron er he asked fleur delacour to go with him to the ball hermione said harry and ginny eyes widened in surprise you what they blurted out together i dontknow what came over me ron said i was just passing by as she was talking to that diggory bloke when it came over me and i asked her ron moaned and put his head in his hands she didntsay anything just looked at me like i was some unsavory thing and then i sort of just came to my senses and ran for it that too bad ron harry said maybe she was trying to charm diggory with her veela charm and you felt it i found out from dumbledore that she is part veela since her grandmother was one never mind i sure you ll find someone else to take to the ball yeah ron said dully i guess you and ginny are going together right of course ron ginny said raising one eyebrow we are boyfriend and girlfriend after all well that makes me the only one without a date ron said neville asked lavender and seamus and dean asked parvati and her sister in ravenclaw padma he then looked at hermione hey hermione you re a girl oh well spotted ron hermione said acidly i would have thought you d take longer to guess that ha ha ron said very funny anyway how about coming to the ball with me i sorry ron hermione said blushing but someone already asked me and i said yes oh come on ron said you cantbe serious yes ronald hermione said angrily if you haventnoticed i a girl all these years it doesntmean someone else hasntnoticed with that she stomped off toward the girls dormitories ron stared after her someone really asked her to the ball yes ron ginny said someone did who is it ginny ron asked you know who it is come on tell me no ron ginny said it not my place to tell ron then slumped dejectedly down into the chair he was sitting in with ron distracted harry pulled ginny over onto his lap ginny snuggled up to him and placed her head on his chest harry placed his chin over her head and they wrapped their arms around each other ginny sighed contentedly ron glanced at them a grimace momentarily crossing his face after a few moments of watching them he cleared his throat harry ron said can you do me a favor what kind of favor ron harry asked warily well ron said you re taking my sister to the ball i think it fair if i take yours can you ask rose for me harry eyes widened are you daft ron you want to take rose to the ball are you sure i not sure that a good idea either ron ginny said is that what you really want ron shrugged i ve known her for years ginny you two are alike in many ways i just figured it wouldntbe so bad to go with her as friends it ll be like taking my sister except she isntmy sister so harry please can you ask her for me he ignored the scowl that formed on ginny face no ron harry said firmly you want to take her to the yule ball you ask her i not going to be your messenger boy especially with rose ron deflated again fine where is she anyway i think she in the library writing an essay for snape ginny said she told me so at dinner i hope she gets back here soon ron said i d like to ask her tonight as if on cue the portrait hole opened up and rose stepped inside accompanied by ti they seemed to be talking animatedly about something harry and ginny glanced at each other then at ron who was watching rose and ti warily rose and ti then came up to the three smiles on their faces hey guys they both said what are you all doing down here this late rose asked er we were just relaxing ron answered quickly you know last day of term no more homework ti yawned okay i going to turn in good night rose harry ginny ron good night ti they all said rose yawned and stretched snape essays are bloody mind twisting i never thought i could finish it she flopped down on one of the couches beside them i d go up myself but i need a few minutes to get my mind relaxed enough to sleep she then closed her eyes the three other gryffindors looked at each other then harry whispered to ron all right ron if you really want to ask her now probably a good time to do it she more likely to say yes right now than tomorrow morning ron gulped and cleared his throat a bit noisily um rose yes ron rose asked her eyes still closed wouldyougotoballwithme ron said rapidly what was that ron rose said opening her eyes are you eating while talking again ron took a deep breath i said would you like to go to the yule ball with me rose stared at him for a moment then said i dontknow ron is it going to be like a date because i dontlike you like that please rose ron begged we can go as friends we ve known each other for years i think we can do this without being uncomfortable with each other otherwise i ll be the only one in my year without a date oh rose asked who are the others going with well ron said seamus asked parvati and her twin padma from ravenclaw to go with him and dean while neville asked lavender yesterday to be his date only ginny saw the momentary look of pain in rose eyes when ron told her about the other fourth year gryffindors dates rose looked thoughtful for a moment then shrugged her shoulders er sure why not no one else will probably ask me anyway great good ron said er thanks okay ron rose said getting up now i think i ll go upstairs now i starting to feel sleepy i ll go with you ginny said she gave harry a kiss on the cheek and he did the same the two redhead girls said good night to ron then went up the stairs to the girls dormitories after a few seconds harry said ron i dontthink it a good idea for you to take rose to the ball just so you can have a date she ll be really mad if she doesntenjoy herself hey relax harry ron said it ll be okay as i said i ve known her for years it ll be fine all right ron harry said i just warning you like you did when ginny and i got together though there more to it if she gets hurt it wontbe just me you re going to have mad at you okay okay ron said i understand i know ginny will be pissed too dontworry harry hoped that ron wouldntregret his words chapter 48 a christmas dance disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations the week passed quickly with the students doing nothing but relaxing and waiting for the christmas day and the ball harry and the new marauders spent it playing in the snow and admiring the decorations of the castle it seemed the staff wanted to impress their visitors since the castle was decked in some of the best d cor harry had ever seen in the castle there was a lovely feast on christmas eve at the end of the feast the new marauders did a repeat of the show they did at the previous end of term feast they added a few more subjects like madame maxime and the dragons at the end of the show another sign appeared on the ceiling merry christmas to all from the new marauders enjoy the yule ball the message also appeared in french and bulgarian applause rang around the great hall christmas morning dawned early for harry for a moment he felt sad over not being at potter manor with his parents and younger siblings but he was here with ginny rose and the rest of his friends that was enough for now at any rate they were going to potter manor on the afternoon of boxing day anyway harry musings were interrupted by ron pushing aside the curtains of his bed excitement in his eyes harry get up ron said it christmas harry laughed all right ron i awake give me a minute hurry up will you ron said the presents cantwait for long he then bounded out of the room still chuckling harry set off for the bathroom giving a mental good morning to ginny on his way there later he came down to the common room to find it full of his housemates he moved off to the area in front of the fireplace where the other new marauders were gathered they spent half the morning opening presents everyone got the traditional weasley jumper including ti whose jumper was red with gold lettering ginny loved the delicate crystal figure of a leaping tiger that harry had given her the gift ron ti and neville gave her was a nice silver hairclip with tiny figures of cats moving along it rose and hermione gave her a set of scented shampoos harry presents included a photo album from ginny with pictures of the two of them taken since the previous christmas including their respective birthdays he received several fine quills from hermione and rose and chocolates from ron ti and neville ron received mostly various chocolates and candies hermione gave him a new book on quidditch harry and ginny gave him a pair of woolen gloves to go with his new jumper rose got a lovely rose shaped pendant on a silver chain from harry and ginny hermione gave her a book on famous seers ron neville and ti gave her a dragon shaped jewel hairclip hermione received a new cloak from ginny and harry a set of magical makeup from rose a gift certificate from flourish and blott from neville and a set of quills from ti and ron neville got mostly stuff related to herbology ti got a set of quills from hermione and rose a range of zonko products from harry and ginny and a bunch of chocolate and candies from neville and ron breakfast was served by the house elves in the common room as the great hall was being prepared for the ball they went outside to walk around the lake then returned to the common room for lunch after lunch they had a good snowball fight which involved most of the school at three o clock the girls who were going to the ball went back to the castle why do they have to go back now ron asked it still five hours to the ball harry just shrugged then threw a snowball at ron face and ran away laughing oi ron shouted i ll get you for that potter ron then started chasing harry around the grounds at six o clock the boys from fourth year and above went back into the castle to get ready the fourth year gryffindor boys dorm was a whirlwind of rushing boys and scattered clothes as the occupants dressed in their best harry looked at himself in the full length mirror of the room he was dressed in formal robes of bottle green his mother had said that shade of green brought out the color of his eyes hmmm you really look good in that harry ginny no peeking we promised each other not to look through the bond whenever we were changing or dressing up sorry harry i couldnthelp it all right i ll go for now see you in a while love harry shook his head and sighed he really wanted to see what ginny looked like but he intended to keep his promise not to look at her while she was dressing he went back to trying to make his hair lie flat fifteen minutes later he and ron were sitting in the common room waiting for their dates ti and maggie were sitting with them envy evident on their faces as they couldntgo to the ball seamus and neville had already left for the great hall with their dates while dean was meeting padma at the entrance hall harry felt ginny approaching them through their bond and looked up his breath caught and he felt his blood rush down between his legs standing at the top of the last flight of stairs to the girls dormitories was ginny she was wearing light pink robes and her hair was arranged to fall like a cascade of fire and curled near the ends as it fell around her shoulders she was also wearing the necklace he had given her for christmas the previous year and the charm bracelet he had given her for her last birthday was on her wrist then rose came down and stood beside her she was wearing silvery white robes and her hair was bunched up above her head in a style he had seen his mother wear when she was younger now that the two redheads were side by side one could see they were growing in different ways rose was now taller than ginny by at least three inches her face was becoming narrower and her hair was getting darker much like her mum s ginny on the other hand had lighter hair and a fuller figure with fuller breasts both of them looked really lovely tonight ginny smirked and descended the stairs she approached her boyfriend and closed his open mouth with one finger then she kissed him he returned it with passion hey can we go now ron asked as he linked his arm with rose arm i starving ginny and rose rolled their eyes the four said goodbye to ti and maggie and headed out the portrait hole ginny saw a stunned look on ti face as he watched them leave gryffindor tower she knew he was only looking at rose and sighed the four friends descended the marble staircase and headed for the entrance hall when they arrived there it was packed with students waiting for the oak front doors of the great hall to open at eight o clock they saw and greeted several of their friends and housemates like fred who was with angelina johnson george who was with alicia spinnet and oliver wood who was with a seventh year ravenclaw they didntknow they also saw seamus with parvati dean with padma and neville with lavender as they worked their way to the doors i wonder where hermione is ron said looking over the heads of the crowd you dontthink she skipped out of this do you no ron rose said looking annoyed she left the girls dorms a half hour ago to meet her date just then the doors of the great hall opened and everyone turned to watch the durmstrang students enter with professor propanov leading them viktor krum was in the front of the bulgarian students accompanied by a pretty girl in blue dress robes who seemed vaguely familiar to harry harry eyes narrowed as krum and the girl came closer to him and ginny then his eyes widened as he recognized her it was hermione she was dressed in a lovely set of periwinkle blue robes her hair was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny and twisted up in a lovely knot at the back of her head she looked just as lovely as ginny and rose harry then heard mcgonagall voice call out champions over here please harry and ginny walked over to mcgonagall after giving ron and rose a see you later once krum hermione and fleur and her date roger davies the ravenclaw quidditch captain were with them the assistant headmistress explained to them that they would all enter in a procession once the other students were seated when the entrance hall was empty mcgonagall told them to arrange themselves in pairs and follow her as the champions and their partners did as she bade and walked through the hall towards top of the hall everyone applauded them harry saw that the walls of the hall were covered in sparkling silver frost and hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossed the ceiling instead of four long house tables there were now about a hundred smaller round tables set for a dozen people each the large round table at the top of the hall that they were now approaching was already occupied by the five judges and professor dumbledore golden plates were set out in front of each seat though they appeared empty menus were also set standing on the table harry held ginny seat out for her my what a gentleman you are tonight mr potter ginny said to him in his mind as she sat down a smile forming on her face only for you milady love harry said to her mentally a smile also on his face dumbledore demonstrated how to order the food by speaking his order to his plate and the students followed suit as they ate fleur and viktor commented on the decorations and compared them and the castle itself to their own schools all throughout the meal harry noticed that davies barely ate as he hung on every word coming out of fleur mouth he struggled to keep from laughing at the lovestruck older boy harry dontyou laugh at him ginny said to him in his mind there are times you look like that when you re with me all right gin i ll behave it just that he looks like he d been hit by a bludger several times well leave it alone harry and i ll make it up to you later promise harry asked amusement in his mental voice yes harry now finish your tart yes dear once everyone was done eating dumbledore asked everyone to stand and moved the tables to the side with his wand he then conjured a platform and several musical instruments once this was done the weird sisters a popular wizarding band came into the hall and took their places on the platform to the wild applause of the crowd harry realized what this meant and nervously looked at ginny may i have this dance ginny he asked her ginny grinned of course harry harry and ginny moved to the center of the hall followed by the other champions and their partners the weird sisters started with a slow mournful tune as they danced harry felt himself floating he held her close as they swayed to the music by half through the song most of the students had joined the champion pairs on the dance floor the next song was a little faster but harry and ginny stayed close to each other by the third song another slow one they were really enjoying themselves harry felt like they were the only ones dancing in the hall harry ginny said in his mind yes gin he answered back mentally you really dance well she said to him mentally your lessons with your mum turned out well in preparation for the dance harry had gotten permission to floo to potter manor every evening during the week before the ball to take dance lessons from his mother yeah they sure did gin he said to her i glad she was patient with me i think i stepped on her feet more than on the floor that first night well it was worth it harry ginny said it allowing us to be this close in a room full of adults she snuggled up to him as they slowly danced a little later harry saw hermione and krum dancing they seemed to be enjoying themselves after the fifth song harry could feel ginny tiring and decided that they needed a break gin let sit this one out he asked her in her mind let me get us a couple of drinks sure harry ginny said smiling at him as she looked up they walked off the dance floor which was already full of people go find us a table ginny harry said i ll get us a couple of butterbeers okay harry ginny said ginny looked around the tables and spotted ron and rose sitting at an otherwise empty one as she approached them she saw the glum expression on her best friend face ron seemed to have his attention on something other than his date ginny looked in the direction ron was looking in and found it was toward the area where hermione and krum were as they danced as she came up beside them she saw that ron eyes were narrowed ginny frowned and sat down beside rose who seemed to be looking elsewhere as well ginny touched her shoulder rose started and looked at ginny she seemed surprised to see her sitting beside her rose ginny said are you all right is everything okay rose waved her hand yeah i okay everything peachy she said and turned her gaze away from ginny the glum expression forming again on her face ginny followed her gaze and saw that she seemed to be watching the group of neville dean and seamus who were dancing with their dates just then harry came up with two bottles of butterbeer and handed one to ginny what going on ginny he asked through their mental link why are these two just sitting here i think ron distracted harry ginny said to him in his mind he watching hermione and viktor krum i think he jealous harry eyes widened what he blurted out loud before regaining control of himself you mean ron fancies hermione harry said to ginny mentally when did this happen honestly love you can be so thick sometimes i ve noticed this months ago sometime last summer ron seems to be livelier whenever she was around blimey what do we do now right now i think you better help with your sister she seems down in the dumps too it may be for the same reason but i not so sure go dance with her well all right harry walked over to rose and sai come on rose let dance rose shrugged sure whatever it isntlike my date is interested in dancing with me anyway she sent a glare at ron rose turned to ginny as harry pulled her out of her chair oh ginny when hermione comes by i wouldntsit too near ron if i were you she then allowed her brother to lead her to the dance floor sparing a last look at the group of fourth year gryffindors boys thankfully harry led her farther into the crowd away from his dorm mates ginny turned to ron but before she could say anything hermione dropped into the seat vacated by rose it hot isntit she asked as she fanned herself with her hand ginny smirked yeah i noticed so where your date viktor went to get us a couple of drinks hermione said still fanning herself so it viktor is it ron said then what hasnthe asked you to call him vicky yet what are you going on about ron hermione asked him have you wondered why he asked you to this ball hermione ron asked after all lots of other girls have been following him all over the school for the past month and a half hermione eyes narrowed i asked him that when he asked me ron he said that he found me attractive especially since i wasntfollowing him like the others and he wanted to get to know me better hah what a load of bull ron said and you fell for it what do you mean by that ron ginny asked her own eyes narrowing isntit obvious ron asked waving his arms around he from durmstrang he going out with hermione because he knows who one of her best friends is he trying to get close to harry to get inside information on him or even get close enough to harry to jinx him hermione stared at ron looking like she had slapped her are you daft ron we haventtalked about harry he hasnteen mentioned my being friends with harry he probably was waiting until later when you were warmed up to him maybe even snogging him before he started on that ron said bitterly as he grabbed a bottle of butterbeer from the table and took a swig hermione glared at ron her eyes showing her fury at his insensitivity ginny felt a surge of power from the older girl and she slowly got to her feet and stepped away as ron took another swig from the bottle suddenly the bottle in ron hand exploded drenching him in butterbeer ginny just avoided getting splashed you insufferable git hermione shouted at him she jumped to her feet and walked swiftly onto the dance floor disappearing into the crowd ron watched her go with a mixture of fear and indignation butterbeer dripping down his face ginny just looked at him with pity and contempt she looked around for harry and rose and saw them at the edge of the crowd walking back to them harry looked furious as he stared at ron obviously having heard every word of hermione and ron conversation ginny quickly grabbed his hand come on love let go for a walk dontmind ron hermione already given him something to think about she steered him out toward the entrance hall and down to the rose garden that had been created in front of the castle front doors harry allowed himself to be led down the winding ornamental paths there were fairy lights that winked and twinkled in the rose bushes large stone statues and stone benches were scattered about the garden harry heard the splashing of water which indicated that there was a fountain somewhere couples were seated on some of the benches finally ginny made him sit on an empty stone bench a distance from the front doors the fountain was right beside the bench the water sparkled in the moonlight they sat side by side their arms around each other the sound of the flowing water and ginny presence soothed harry and calmed him down from his anger with ron are you okay harry ginny asked him mentally harry sighed i guess so i cantbelieve what ron said to hermione how can he think krum asked her to the ball just to get to me has he even looked at how hermione looked tonight she gorgeous just as beautiful as you and rose gin ginny smiled yes she is harry i think the problem is that ron noticed and he was just acting jealous and he was jealous because he fancies her harry was genuinely puzzled they seem to row half of the time over some stupid thing ginny smirked i think it may be a form of sexual foreplay for them that just weird harry said grimacing wait a minute does that mean hermione fancies him too of course it does ginny said otherwise she wouldntbe as upset with him as she is harry shook his head that just great why dontthey just say something i mean if they just told each other they fancied one another this mess could have been avoided i dontknow if it can be that simple harry ginny said i think they re scared of how the other will react to knowing that harry sighed trying to come to terms with his two best friends developing feelings for each other just then they heard a commotion not too far from them something like some bushes being blasted followed by squeals then they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice say ten points from hufflepuff fawcett and ten points from ravenclaw stebbins a few seconds later the familiar figure of snape came around the corner he stopped when he saw harry and ginny a sneer crossed his face ah potter and miss weasley i hope you two were not doing something inappropriate something your parents would disapprove of of course i doubt your parents would entirely disapprove of something like that potter harry felt a wave of annoyance and anger course through him ginny took his hand and squeezed it dontdo anything you may regret harry the git is just jealous harry firmly clamped down his anger we were just sitting here professor enjoying the peace and quiet of this spot we werentplanning anything inappropriate snape eyed them suspiciously for a moment then said very well get back inside i noticed before coming out here that your sister didntseem very happy potter i assume that mr weasley is her companion for the evening it seems he is neglecting her i suggest you address the issue before someone else does in a manner you may not approve snape then left them with a swish of his cloak now what was that about ginny asked harry softly it like he was concerned that rose wasntenjoying the ball i know what you mean harry said it strange anyway as much as i hate to agree with him he right ron not been paying attention to his date even if he fancies hermione he invited someone else tonight and he should be concerned with her i warned ron about this yes you did as much as i love him my brother can be a really insensitive git all right let go they both got up and walked back inside to the great hall they spotted ron still sitting at his table still dejected and unconcerned rose wasntwith him ron harry said when he got to the table where rose huh ron said intelligently looking up at harry you know rose my sister your date harry said emphasizing the last two phrases oh yeah ron said her i think neville asked her to dance with him and you let him ginny asked incredulous she your date ron you should be dancing with her ron shrugged i wasntin the mood neville asked her she asked me i said she could harry ran his hand over his face exasperated with his best mate oh forget him harry ginny said to him in his mind let the prat brood at least someone is paying rose some attention come on let get back on that dance floor all right gin we cantlet ron ruin our evening harry and ginny danced until midnight when the weird sisters finally wrapped up their act everyone gave them a long and loud last round of applause then moved toward the entrance hall many people wished the ball could have gone on longer including harry and ginny who had enjoyed dancing in each other arms they found hermione in the entrance hall saying goodbye to krum before the bulgarian boy went back to the durmstrang ship she saw them and headed for them a wide smile on her face so ginny said a smirk forming on her face enjoy your evening with the greatest seeker in the world it was a title fred had given to krum during the world cup yes it was quite a night hermione said he not too loquacious but he paid attention to me all night you both know i not one of those fan girls but he was so gallant i not used to someone staring at me like i a beauty queen well you are hermione harry said tonight you rose and ginny showed just how beautiful you three can be hermione playfully slapped him on the arm harry donttease me like that well it true hermione ginny said smiling you look just awesome tonight hermione blushed thanks ginny you and rose looked great tonight too speaking of rose i saw her dancing with neville for the last hour where is she i think she went back to the common room with parvati neville lavender seamus and dean about fifteen minutes ago ginny said we should get back too as they stood at the foot of the marble staircase they heard someone call harry name turning they saw draco malfoy coming up to them what do you want malfoy harry asked just a word potter draco said dontworry i dontplan on attacking you all right harry said he turned to ginny and hermione go on to the common room i dontthink he ll try anything he squeezed ginny hand before letting her go he watched the two girls climb the staircase for a while before turning back to draco all right malfoy harry said what do you want now i just wanted to warn you potter draco said your entry into this tournament is a plot by the dark lord to get rid of you oh yeah harry said how do you know this malfoy it doesntmatter how i know draco said just watch your back potter they ll try again to get you in the next task i dontknow how but just be ready harry stood there for a moment studying the slytherin all right malfoy thanks for the warning it just a little payback for saving my brother life potter draco said i ll let you know if i hear anything else he turned around and descended the stairs to the dungeons harry watched him for a few seconds then went up the marble staircase to gryffindor tower baffled a bit at malfoy behavior was malfoy changing his ways did he really care for ti that much harry was about to ask ginny opinion when he noticed that she was distracted by something else and hadntheard his conversation with malfoy then harry saw what had distracted ginny and sped up his ascent when he got to the fat lady she was asleep he had to say fairy lights three times before she awoke and let him in he walked through the portrait hole to find ron and hermione in a blazing row in the middle of the common room ginny rose and the rest of harry year were present staring uncertainly at the two fighting friends harry two best friends were ten feet apart glaring and shouting at each other well if you dontlike me going out with viktor ron hermione was shouting at ron then you know the solution and what would that be ron asked a sneer on his face the next time there a ball ask me before someone else does she screamed at him she then turned on her heel and marched up the stairs to the girls dormitories ginny and rose gave ron a final glare and followed their friend ron just stood there stunned and looking much like a floundering goldfish unable to form any coherent words neville dean and seamus gave him pitying looks harry gave him a disgusted look before climbing up to the boys dormitories disclaimer i dontown harry potter a n thanks to all the reviewers so far iluvwater hozanru hermionegymnast suicides in the blood and athenakitty glad you like it so far i know there isntmuch romance yet but hey they re only eleven oh i changed the prologue a bit just minor spelling and language changes suggested by someone on another site plus a little change in the description of molly weasley i put her as middle aged but it was pointed out that at the time of voldemort first defeat she d be in her thirties athenakitty thanks for the suggestion about the picture charm i ll seriously consider it suicides in the blood interesting story you have i ll continue to read it chapter 4 the marauders return and another quidditch match when harry got back to gryffindor tower the next afternoon he told ron and hermione about his discovery about flamel the bushy haired girl immediately sprinted for her dormitory room warning the two boys to just wait for her where they were in a corner near the fireplace of their common room the other gryffindors werentpaying them any attention engrossed in their own conversations she soon reappeared clutching a rather thick and large book muttering i knew he d be in here somewhere i checked it out of the library for some light reading material the book title was the greatest names and discoveries in alchemy you call that light ron asked stunned now where did i see it she whispered as she frantically flipped the pages of the book ah here it is nicolas flamel is the only known maker of the philosopher stone the what ron asked harry frowned i think i ve heard of that here you two read this hermione said pushing the book toward them and the two boys read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the philosopher stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers it will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have been many reports of the philosopher stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight you see hermione said this must be what that dog is guarding flamel philosopher stone flamel must have known someone wanted to steal it so he asked professor dumbledore to hide it since they re friends with powers like that turning any metal to gold and keeping a person from dying no wonder snape wants it harry said anyone would want it he ll either keep it for himself or sell it off to the highest bidder blimey ron said if he that old no wonder we couldntfind him in the other books so what do we do now hermione asked them we ve got to make sure the stone is safe harry said how do we do that ron asked we cant just walk up to dumbledore and say professor we heard you have the philosopher stone here what guarding it besides the three headed dog no we canttell him yet not without proof harry said i ll think of a way to find out about the stone then seeing fred and george he added in the meantime i think its time to have a little fun raising his voice he beckoned to the redheaded twins oy fred george come over here a sec the twins came over and stood near the trio what is it one said maybe fred you want harry the other completed harry beckoned to them to move closer well guys he said to them in a low voice i decided to agree to what you asked me that first day on the express the two twins grinned oh we re so glad you have agreed to our proposal harry ron also grinned that great harry just imagine the looks on the teachers faces when they realize a new group of marauders is in hogwarts and just what does that mean hermione said moving closer to the four boys who are the marauders only the greatest bunch of pranksters ever to grace the walls of hogwarts hermione frowned pranks isnt that a little childish she looked at harry wontyour parents be mad at you for pranking nope at least not dad harry said grinning he was one of the original four marauders yeah fred said him along with sirius black and remus lupin um of course the fourth one was peter pettigrew forget him harry grimaced he no longer part of that group he can rot in azkaban for all i care he the one who betrayed your parents isnthe hermione asked then turned pink at the sudden blaze in harry eyes sorry it stated in your story in modern magical history that okay hermione harry said struggling to get his temper under control we dontlike to talk about him or that night much but now let forget it and concentrate on making my dad and uncles proud yeah ron said we have to think up some good pranks especially on malfoy or even snape no hermione said you ll get caught we ll lose house points dontworry hermione harry said smiling again i ve got a way for us to avoid getting caught what is it mate ron asked curious did your dad teach you some auror stealth spell nope harry said grinning even better he gave me an invisibility cloak wicked ron exclaimed those are really rare and expensive how many people can fit in it i dontknow yet harry said i only tried it on myself come on let check he sprinted up to the first year dormitory room trailed by ron and the twins hermione reluctantly followed them luckily no one else was in the dormitory harry dug into his trunk and carefully pulled out the glittering cloth the others stared in awe at it as harry spread it out then threw it over him he then pulled ron into it seeing both of them were well covered he then let fred join them unfortunately he was too tall and he caused their feet to be exposed fred got out from under the cloak harry then pulled a reluctant hermione in with him and ron the cloak just barely fit them harry then handed it to fred and george who had to scrunch down in order to be completely covered by it all right harry said now we know that at most it ll only hold the three of us or you two that ll just make us adjust who pulls the prank i really dontknow about this harry hermione said well you donthave to join us if you dontwant to ron said hermione frowned at him come on hermione harry said help us you re quite good at thinking of spells we need a little more fun it just a bit dull with all the studying i promise we wontpull any during classes just at mealtimes or early in the morning yeah hermione ron said come on we can get back at the slytherins for all their nasty comments we ll just do harmless pranks nothing hurtful or permanent harry said hermione was silent for a while looking from harry to ron to the twins who had their lost puppy dog looks on their faces finally she said oh all right as long as it doesntinterfere with our classes or hurts anyone yes all four boys said simultaneously over the next weeks it seemed the slytherins were plagued by unusual occurrences first during one lunch several of them including malfoy and his cronies were turned into small canaries returning to their original states after a few minutes they found out it was due to some strange candies among the sweets at their table then their shoes started turning into bunny slippers for two full days a few days later anyone who used salt on their food developed spots on their bodies while those who used pepper would sneeze instead of talking finally the whole house didnt appear at breakfast one day the rest of the school found out why during joint classes they were all wearing pink robes and had pink hair snape himself was wearing pink robes and had his skin in pink and yellow stripes he was furious and glared at the gryffindors he had his suspects but could not prove it dumbledore on the other hand just smiled his eyes twinkled with mischief as he listened to his potions master complain in their common room the new marauders laughed and laughed at the result of their pranks even hermione smiled though she continued to worry and fret about getting caught three weeks after the start of the term gryffindor had its next quidditch match this time against hufflepuff dumbledore was sitting in his office the night before when his fireplace flared and james potter face appeared in it james dumbledore said smiling what can i do for you nothing wrong at home i hope no professor nothing wrong at this end james replied agitated but i think i could say something is wrong there what are you talking about james dumbledore asked though he had an idea what seemed to be upsetting the older potter can i come through to your office james asked of course james dumbledore said twirling his wand to cast a modification on the anti apparation wards his office james soon appeared in front of his desk how could you professor how could you let that man referee a gryffindor match he asked fury in his voice now james i assume you found out about severus requesting to referee the next quidditch match dumbledore asked he added with a smile i hope you didntfind out from harry no he didnttell me james said his friend ron sent an owl to his parents complaining about it his sister heard about it and told my daughter who told me now james dontworry about severus being the referee he told me he wanted to try it out dumbledore said smiling and you believed him come on professor he just wants to keep gryffindor from winning i bet he calls a lot of fouls against them even against harry you wait and see now now james dumbledore began but was interrupted by another face appearing in his fireplace this time a redheaded woman professor dumbledore is my husband there oh oh james said paling dumbledore turned to the fireplace mirth in his voice yes lily james is here we were just discussing the points of having severus referee in quidditch james you promised to leave it alone lily almost screamed lily come on james whined think about harry he ll be on the pitch you canttrust snape to be fair i trust professor dumbledore decision lily replied cooly let it go we ll be there anyway if you dontcome home now you re sleeping on the couch looking despondent and defeated james bid goodbye to dumbledore and flooed back to potter manor the following day the weather was beautiful just right for a quidditch match when harry entered the pitch he immediately kicked off as he circled the stadium he saw his parents there in the stands he then blinked and almost fell off his broom for beside them were rose and ginny he groaned of all the times for them to watch him play now was not a good time especially with snape refereeing then harry spotted dumbledore also in the stands watching then to the other side of his parents were sirius and remus he grinned in relief with his parents surrogate uncles and dumbledore there he wasntworried about snape trying anything like in the first match now he only had to overcome his nervousness on doing well soon snape blew the whistle to start the game as he released the balls within thirty seconds he gave hufflepuff a penalty when george sent a bludger at him luckily oliver was able to block the shot then he passed it to angelina johnson who tossed it to katie bell she then streaked off toward the hufflepuff hoops followed closely by angelina and alicia spinnet harry tore his attention from the chasers and circled the pitch his eyes searching for the elusive snitch suddenly he spotted it near the ground just below snape he pushed his broom downward and streaked towards it missing snape by inches his hand closed over the snitch just before he would have plowed into the ground he pulled his broom handle up and slowed to a stop raising his hand in triumph the gryffindor section of the crowd roared in jubilation his teammates moved down and crowded around him his parents and their friends soon followed james leaped forward to hug his son great catch son james said really great its not even five minutes into the game and no one had scored yet james grinned at snape who was off to the side pale and glowering lily hugged and congratulated her son while sirius and remus beamed at him with pride you really showed that git harry sirius said sirius lily scolded dontput ideas in his head she turned to harry dontthink too badly of severus harry he not as bad as your father and these two say harry said nothing he was inclined to agree with his father and uncles but didntwant to get on the bad side of his mother he instead turned to his sister and her best friend so guys what do you think of my quidditch skills now harry asked the two redheads rose tilted her head not bad big brother however i spotted that thing a few seconds before you did wait until next year and i may try and convince your captain to let me try out for seeker ginny giggled beside her harry gaped at rose then turned away shaking his head in disgust it didnthelp that his parents and surrogate uncles also found it amusing chapter 49 holiday blues disclaimer everything you recognize belongs to jkr however rose andrew daisy ti and maggie are my own creations as she came out of the fireplace in potter manor ginny just managed to stay on her feet it was sunday two days after christmas and most of the students including the potters and their friends had gone home for the remaining week of the holidays ginny was looking forward to some alone time with harry while ron was stuck at the burrow doing chores she brushed herself off and looked around the living room was empty however she could hear muffled talking coming from the kitchen she went up to the door to the kitchen and peeked in a smile broke out on her face at the sight that greeted her harry was seated inside the kitchen feeding his youngest brother and sister their bottles as they lay in their basinets he was facing the door but his concentration was obviously focused on the twins since he hadntacknowledged her presence yet verbally or mentally ginny could see the bright smile on his face as he cooed and talked to them softly hey andie harry said you really like that dontyou that it drink up soon you re going to be able to fly just like your big brother come on daisy he said turning to his youngest sister you can finish this bottle yes that a good girl ginny smile turned into a grin harry was great with the twins over the last few months whether she saw it visually or through their bond ginny had seen him treat them gently and lovingly with no hint of annoyance even when they happened to interrupt their time together as a big brother he was so different from bill or george as much as she loved her oldest brothers they hadntbeen exactly shining examples of older brothers when she was little her mother often left her and her other brothers in the care of the oldest boys whenever she needed to leave the burrow however as soon as her back was turned bill and george would disappear leaving their younger siblings to fend for themselves it was only when ginny turned four that bill paid her more attention especially when he was home from hogwarts as she continued to gaze at her boyfriend soul mate ginny was happy for daisy and andrew having an older brother who was willing to take care of them like this he d make a great dad one day she hoped that would be only a few years from now she recalled from hermione and rose research on the bond that bonded pairs were allowed to marry once one of them became of age that would make it only three more years for them to wait until harry turned seventeen ginny heard a noise behind her and turned her wand appearing in her wand faster than lightning whoa hold on there ginny it only me lily said ginny felt her face turn red with embarrassment sorry mrs er lily that all right ginny lily said waving her apology away it good you re alert and not taking your surroundings for granted it sad that these times need that but hopefully it wontbe for long i hope so too ginny said well let leave the morose thoughts behind lily said i need your help with a problem what sort of problem ginny asked wondering why harry had not mentioned any kind of problem to her lily sighed it rose since she and harry came home yesterday she stayed in her room except for meals harry been too wrapped up with the twins to really notice so i not surprised that you dontknow about it why dontyou go talk to her i haventbeen able to get anything out of her maybe you can ginny nodded all right lily i ll go right up there and see if i cantdrag her out of there ginny went up the stairs and down the hall to rose door she knocked on the door but didntwait for an answer before opening the door rose was lying on her bed back to the door and facing the window hey rose ginny said her voice bright and sunny what up mind if i come in when rose didntanswer ginny went in and closed the door behind her she sat down on the bed behind rose rose ginny said softly what is it are you still down about ron neglecting you at the ball when rose still didntanswer ginny added or are you mooning over one of your brother other roommates rose stiffened but didntturn around or even say a word ginny gently touched her shoulder hey it all right merlin knows i ve mooned over harry a lot over the years rose sat up and turned to her ginny wasntsurprised to see her wiping her eyes yeah rose said i ve seen you do that a lot so ginny said who is it who caught the fancy of rose potter hm it wouldntbe say seamus finnegan what rose said that bloody twit he so in love with his irish brogue he acts like he merlin gift to girls he isntanything like n rose gulped and her eyes widened as a smirk grew on ginny face hah i thought so ginny said you fancy neville longbottom no i don t rose said almost immediately before turning red well um maybe oooh all right i admit it i like neville okay happy she flopped back down on her bed didntyou dance with him at the ball ginny asked what got your knickers in a twist then rose turned to look at her yes we danced i thought it was a dream come true something like what happened to you and harry he even invited me to sit with him dean seamus lavender and parvati so why are you so down now ginny asked the boy you fancy asked you to dance with him even if he was at the ball with someone else yet you re acting like your pet hippogriff died why for merlin sake you should be daydreaming about going to hogsmeade with him i would except it seems he just sees me as harry potter bloody pathetic sister rose said almost shouting the last three words never mind we ve been doing all that physical and magical training for the past summer ginny raised an eyebrow and what brought you to that barmy conclusion on our way back to gryffindor tower i overheard parvati asking neville why he danced with me and he told her that he found it sad that harry sister wasntenjoying herself rose said can you believe that he didntrefer to me by my name he called me harry sister ginny patted her leg that too bad rose i can sympathize i think if it werentfor the bond harry might still be thinking of me as ron little sister yeah i ve heard you complain about it for years now rose said i wasntreally sympathetic then since it was my brother you were talking about but now i know exactly how you felt it really bleeding awful well you cantstay in here all day rose ginny said mooning over a bloke whose too thick to realize what a great person you are yes i can ginny rose said turning away from her oh no you can t ginny said if you stay here much longer harry will realize you haventbeen out of this room other than at mealtimes what do you think he ll do if he finds out neville hurt your feelings you wouldntwant neville turned out of the marauders do you or worse pranked by him and the others i sure he didntmean to hurt you he seemed to care enough about you to see that you enjoyed yourself at the ball which is more than i can say for a certain brother of mine oh yeah rose said facing her again how is your git of a brother anyway after that scene with hermione in the common room i haventseen hide or hair of him hasntdone a runner has he i would if i were him oh mum got him busy doing some chores at home ginny said grinning some how she got wind of what he did and she wasnthappy with the prat she looked at rose speculatively how about you get off this bed and help me plan a little lesson for the wanker all right gin rose said why not let get harry fred and george in on it i sure they can help us think of something great now you re talking ginny said grabbing her hand and hauling her off the bed come on ginny was about to open the door when she stopped and looked at rose one piece of advice though rose i dontthink you should just lie around waiting for neville to come to his senses i mean he may or he may not in the meantime i noticed a whole gaggle of blokes who were impressed with how you looked that night of the ball if one of them happened to ask you out you should go on and go with him rose looked at her a bit uncertain and skeptical are you sure of course ginny said you should just enjoy yourself dontlet pining away for some clueless bloke no matter how wonderful he may seem keep you from getting to know other blokes that what being a teenager is for after all rose looked thoughtful for a moment then she shrugged okay sure i ll give it a go if someone asks me that is ginny smiled oh i sure someone will just you wait now let find that hot brother of yours and tell him our plans for that git of a brother of mine ginny rose said a grimace forming on her face can you please not talk about my brother that way it just so gross anyway you probably already know where harry is ginny just grinned and led the way out of the room when they got hold of harry they found him more than willing to give ron a little lesson he also agreed with the idea to get help from fred and george harry also suggested approaching sirius for some ideas the rest of the day passed quickly with the three enjoying themselves as they watched over daisy and andrew the next few days rose spent more time with her twin siblings allowing ginny and harry to spend more time with each other they spent it mostly cuddling and kissing simply enjoying the presence of the other though they sometimes practiced some spell work and dueling in the manor dueling room ti and the longbottom siblings came over after breakfast two days later they played a great game of three on three quidditch with rose ginny and harry when neville was placed on her team rose just barely managed to keep herself from blushing and her mind on the game maggie on the other hand was a bit nervous around ti especially during lunch luckily neville didntseem to notice and neither it seemed did ti later in the afternoon after the longbottom and ti had gone home harry was sitting on one of the lawn chairs on the porch with ginny leaning against him and her head on his chest as his arms encircled her harry nonchalantly asked her through their bond so when did my sister get interested in neville ginny was so shocked she hesitated for a moment before answering him verbally er what gave you that idea harry come on gin he said to her mentally i ve noticed her turning a little red whenever he was around for the past year she been hiding it well lately but i could still see her hesitate a bit with him during the game today i think she may have told you about it though i cantimagine how you were able to hide it from me unless she only told you recently ginny sighed before answering him in his mind all right harry you re right about rose having a crush on neville i not sure how long she had a crush on him but i believe it only been a few months she just told me about it two days ago now dontyou go big brother on her it her life anyway neville doesntknow a thing about it but he danced with her at the ball he did it as a friend harry he saw her being miserable what with ron brooding over hermione and krum and decided to help her i doubt he interested in her like that at any rate that none of your business in the same way ron has no business interfering in our relationship harry thought about it for about a minute before replying all right gin unlike my git of a best mate i trust my sister enough to let her make her own decisions about who she likes that very mature harry ginny said she turned around in his arms and gave him a searing kiss now speaking of your git of a best mate i just thought of another idea to teach him that lesson we ve been meaning to the potters and weasleys celebrated new year eve three days later at the burrow hermione sirius remus and ti were invited to join both families just like the year before in addition samantha turgis was also there as sirius guest arthur had been thinking of inviting dumbledore but molly and lily were both still upset with the elderly wizard for letting harry take part in the triwizard tournament and therefore that idea was immediately quashed ron was quiet the whole evening as his gaze shifted nervously from hermione to rose and back again to hermione neither girl paid him any attention which made him even more nervous only the adults were talking to him even his appetite was diminished at midnight harry and ginny shared another sweet kiss as fireworks brought by sirius and remus exploded above the backyard ron looked at them with barely any emotion on his face then said a mumbled goodnight to everyone in the vicinity before heading up to bed in his bedroom as he disappeared into the house harry exchanged looks of anticipation with fred george and ginny a few minutes later a very loud scream ripped through the house that sounded like ron molly said as she started to run toward the kitchen door he being attacked arthur looked around confusion on his face who could it be the wards all seem to be intact james remus and sirius had pulled out their wands and started following molly sirius looked over his shoulder and said you kids just stay here with lily just as molly reached the kitchen door ron rushed out of the house nearly knocking his mother over he was barefoot dressed in a set of pajamas of a glaring orange color and there was a look of pure terror on his face s s sp spiders he yelled they re all over my room before anyone could say anything else a puff of smoke surrounded ron when it cleared ron had undergone several outrageous physical changes his hair had lengthened and changed to a silvery blonde color he was now dressed in a long evening gown and a pair of high heels had appeared on his bare feet in fact he could have been fleur delacour twin at the ball as the adults stood with stunned looks on their faces harry ginny fred george and rose broke into loud bouts of laughter the others looked at them bewildered for a moment before one of them cottoned on to what had happened you guys pranked ron sirius said and a grin formed on his face i guess this was for what happened at the ball eh you got that right harry said in between laughs hey how d you find out about that oh someone who like a son to me happened to mention to me that ron ignored his date for most of the evening then got into a row with hermione sirius said smirking at ron who was glaring at harry fred and george started taking turns extolling ron beauty and his lovely outfit this was enough to cause sirius remus ti hermione bill george and james to join in the laughter and harry ginny and rose to drop to the ground rolling around in their own mirth even arthur sam and lily were smiling only percy looked unaffected boys molly said to fred and george stop that this instant unfortunately her usually stern manner was offset by her attempts to stifle her own laughter mum not you too ron whined someone get me out of this thing he started stamping his foot causing him to lose his balance and fall over since he wasntused to walking in high heels that caused everyone to burst into fresh gales of laughter including molly percy just snorted fine ron bellowed i getting out of this myself with that he got up and slowly made his way back into the house his gait unsteady due to the heels everyone else was now out of breath from laughing so hard oh that was really good harry rose said in between taking in breaths it was just as good as what we did to malfoy at the end of last year harry just shook his head still trying to catch his breath ron should be glad we did it here ginny said smiling instead of at hogwarts at the welcoming feast so what charms did you use on him bill asked what was that about the spiders in his room well rose said we used a modification of a glamour charm and a hair coloring charm together with a clothes transfiguration charm i actually cast the charms on him last night while he was sleeping ginny said since we wanted it to happen tonight without him knowing who was involved we attached a trigger charm to all three charms keyed to saying the word spider three times he must have said it at least twice on his way down remember spiders are the one thing he really terrified of in fact the only thing besides food that will get him running so when he came down yelling about the spiders sirius said he triggered the spells james said grinning how d you get him to yell about spiders remus asked well harry said snickering i sneaked up to his room when molly called us for dinner and cast an illusion charm on all his things as soon as he lighted the room up every surface of his room looked like it was crawling with loads of the little buggers brilliant work remus said that was good teamwork too yes sirius said really good work worthy of the marauders thanks the teen marauders all said together well molly said i better go and see if he back to normal and he doesntsee any more spiders she looked at the children i dontusually condone this type of thing but for once i ll let it pass without any scolding she then walked off to towards the house the other adults moved off to discuss other things while the children gathered together still discussing the prank on ron of course like gin said he should be glad we didntdo this in front of the whole school like i wanted to rose said selfish prat as it is it not near enough payback for what he did leave it along rose hermione said a smirk on her face embarrassing him in front of his family is payback enough for me i doubt he d forget it anytime soon considering the prank was close to the one we did on malfoy you know he ll hate that when he realizes it that should keep him in line all right hermione harry said if you and rose think this was enough we wontdo anything else to the git he turned to rose well sis what do you think rose looked thoughtful for a moment before saying all right if hermione is satisfied then i am too at any rate i doubt he ll be speaking to us for a while which is fine to me they all agreed though not to ignore ron once they were back in school molly soon came back leading a subdued ron back in his orange pajamas with a push from his mother ron walked up to rose and hermione like a condemned prisoner on death row er rose ron said looking down at his feet i i i sorry for the way i acted at the ball i shouldnthave ignored you rose i promised harry that i d make the ball enjoyable to you and i broke that promise i sorry you can prank me all you want just to make up for making your night miserable rose eyed ron for a few seconds then said all right ron i forgive you at least you had the sense to let me dance with neville that made up a bit for your neglect we ve agreed the prank we just did is enough payback just dontlook to me to be a last minute date for you ever again ron shoulders slumped as he nodded he then turned a wary eye to hermione er hermione i sorry for getting mad at you for going with krum i guess i was surprised that he was your mystery date why ronald hermione asked why would that surprise you do you think so little of me that you cantbelieve that someone like viktor wouldntask me out ron shook his head as he looked down at his feet again then said in a soft low voice it just means that you d be beyond me that i would never be worthy of your attention hermione eyebrows rose everyone else looked at ron with widened eyes hermione voice was shaking as she asked w w what are you saying ron i i i fancy you hermione ron said i think i have for a couple of years now but only realized it when i saw you looking so beautiful as you stood beside krum i couldnthelp but think that i d lost my chance with you hermione reached out and raised ron chin with one of her index fingers so they could look at each other but you haven t ron she said softly i admit that i was surprised when viktor asked me out but i thought someone else that i wanted to go with wouldntask me so i accepted his invitation if only i had waited a couple more days then i would have gone with that someone even if his way of asking me was a bit condescending y y you mean that ron asked yes ron hermione said looking him directly in the eyes i fancy you too i ve thought of you as more than a friend ever since last year i never thought you d feel the same ron grinned then will you go to hogsmeade with me of course ron hermione said a smile forming on her face i d love to they then stood staring at each other for a long moment before someone i think it was sirius coughed twice making them aware that they had an audience they both turned red and looked away from each other everyone around them was now grinning and smiling harry stepped up to ron along with sirius james ti and the other weasley males as ginny and rose whisked hermione away way to go mate harry said slapping ron back i never thought you could be so eloquent yeah bro charlie said i never thought you had it in you yes our youngest brother is growing up fred said sniffing it brings a tear to the eyes george said wiping an imaginary tear from his eye oh shut it you ron said turning even more red why didntyou kiss her bill asked grinning er i was just thinking of that when sirius made us know that we werentalone that something i definitely want to do when we re by ourselves ron said grinning arthur came up to the boys just then and clapped ron on the shoulder well son that wasnthalf bad it actually a bit better than the first time i asked molly out in our fourth year ron turned red again gee thanks dad i really could have done without that image he sent a glare at james and sirius who were snickering hey dad harry said grinning wickedly that reminds me of the story of how you asked mum out at the end of your sixth year james turned white and stammered n n now harry i dontthink that story needs to get around oh i dontknow prongs sirius said it may have bearing on tonight events they collectively laughed at the expression on james face meanwhile ginny and rose had hermione to one side wow ginny said i never thought ron would be able to tell you that he fancied you you knew he fancied me hermione asked why didntyou tell me well i never really noticed before ginny said i mean this last year i ve been so wrapped up over harry as if you ve never been wrapped up over him before rose said smirking oh shut it dear sister in law ginny said grinning to lessen the remark sting anyway i guess i realized it during the yule ball with the way he reacted to you and krum i ve never seen him pay attention to someone like that what that muggle saying if looks could kill krum would have fallen dead on the dance floor with the way ron was glaring at him so he was jealous rose asked that why he ignored me all evening yes rose ginny said after all the only reason a bloke would ignore a girl he on a date with is another girl lily came over to them then saying that the potters needed to go home since andrew and daisy were already asleep they all said goodbye to each other glad that the night had ended on a good note which hopefully was a good omen for the coming year a n well another chapter down i bet many of you are surprised to see an r h moment this early well he never really apologized to hermione in the book i figured that if he had he may have been able to confess his feelings for hermione ofcourse it still wontbe an easy relationship for both of them please r r chapter 50 dates and lockets disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is the work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit the kids returned to hogwarts two days later on the hogwarts express along with the rest of the students harry told his friends that the new marauders would resume their physical regimen upon the resumption of school including maggie if she wanted on the first night back harry in a rare show of studiousness convinced dumbledore not to exempt him from the end of year exams simply owing to him being a triwizard champion hermione was beside herself with admiration over her friend dedication to his studies harry confided to ginny that he just wanted to deserve the grades he would receive at the end of the year he had always been near the top of the class in the past three years and didntwant to remain there just on the basis of being in the tournament the first two weeks of january passed quickly for the students as they were preoccupied with their new lessons the third saturday of january was a scheduled hogsmeade trip as well as the day of ron and hermione first official date harry awoke that day to find ron sitting on his bed looking green and nervous he got out of bed and sat beside ron a look of concern on his face ron harry asked his best mate what wrong you arentgetting sick are you it not that harry ron said now getting pale do you realize i taking hermione to hogsmeade today on a real date i dontknow what to do i want to make it special for her for us but i dontknow how he looked like he was starting to hyperventilate okay ron harry said putting a hand gently on ron shoulder first of all close your eyes and take a deep breath harry waited until ron did as he asked then continued now relax it your first date from what sirius and dad used to tell me you should keep it simple it usually the one where you get to know the girl better of course harry paused clutching his chin with his thumb and index finger you ve known hermione for the past three years so that not the purpose of the date now you ve also gone to hogsmeade with her before though i usually with you guys harry thought for a moment and then sighed as he came to a decision before he could say something to ron ginny voice broke into his mind harry you are not inviting them along with us today i dontwant to spend the day with my brother and hermione i wanted to spend it alone with you we haventhad that since we got back to school she whined in his mind please gin he begged her dontyou want this to work out between the two of them with us along we can make sure that hermione has a great time come on harry leave the prat to his own devices he invited her out weeks ago he should have planned for something in all that time come on ginny let help them please i ll make it up to you on valentine day i promise please after a few seconds of silence as she thought it over all right harry i ll go on a double date with ron and hermione but ron better not mess this up and you better make it up to me okay thanks gin you wontregret it just dontpeak into my mind looking for clues about my valentine day plans okay oh all right harry i promise now i ll tell hermione about the double date see you guys for breakfast harry breathed a sigh of relief and turned to ron uh ron if you like you and hermione could go with ginny and me sort of like a double date ron looked at him with wide eyes for a second before grinning that a brilliant idea harry that way you can show me how to act on a date and how to please hermione harry frowned in a way ron but not exactly i can give you general ideas but for specifics you better learn how to please hermione on your own what i do to please ginny is probably different from what may please hermione ron also frowned then how do i know what will make her happy ron you should know some of that stuff harry said exasperated you ve been her friend for more than three years well ron said looking down at his feet i do know she likes books and knowing about all sorts of stuff thing like that all right ron harry said shaking his head from now on you better pay attention to what she says and does know what her favorite color is her favorite foods and other things how do i find out those things ron asked frowning again pay more attention to her you git harry said then talk to her about anything not just quidditch you know she doesntlike it especially since it involves flying ron eyes widened then what do i talk to her about harry rolled his eyes all right i see this isntgoing to be easy i do remember some stuff about her i ve learned over the years i ll tell you about them while we get dressed we d better get a move on we re supposed to meet ginny and hermione over at the great hall for breakfast over the next ten minutes harry gave ron as many facts about hermione as he could remember as they changed then they hurried to the great hall where they found ginny and hermione sitting at the gryffindor table already eating after a leisurely breakfast they walked together out the front doors through the grounds down to the front gates of the school where filch was waiting to check out the students going to hogsmeade once they got passed the caretaker they walked side by side down the path to the village talking about their recent lessons especially in dada where moody was teaching them very useful information on dark creatures the pathway they followed to hogsmeade was still wet and soggy but clear of any snow for the first time in weeks when they got to the village harry whispered to ron ask hermione where she wants to go first uh mione ron asked where would you like to go first hermione looked at ron in surprise since on previous visits to hogsmeade ron would impose his choices on them well she said smiling why dontwe look at scrivenshaft quill shop first i need a couple of new quills then we can check out gladrags ron looked like he almost choked on what hermione said but nodded anyway sure hermione uh let go he offered her his slightly shaking hand and she took it with only a second of hesitation harry and ginny followed behind them holding hands themselves they noticed that ron barely looked at honeyduke as he and hermione passed it wow ginny said to harry in his mind i didntthink ron could walk past the sweets shop and spare it only a glance you re telling me harry said to her he must really like hermione to follow her like this maybe this will work out after all harry ginny said i hope so ginny harry said merlin knows we could do with less of their rows i doubt that will change much like i said when we discussed this during the ball rowing excites them like a form of foreplay dontsay that ginny it conjures images in my head that i wouldntcare to see harry shuddered ginny just smirked and tugged him along in the wake of their friends into the quill shop ron tried hard not to look too bored as hermione spent fifteen minutes deciding the kind of feather she wanted for her quills in the end she chose some eagle quills ginny and harry spent their time there looking at the more exotic tropical bird quills laughing as they imagined in their minds what the birds whose feathers they held actually looked like from scrivenshafts they proceeded to gladrags wizardwear where hermione and ginny went off to look at the coming spring fashions in robes leaving harry and ron to their own devices the boys found chairs near the front of the store where ron noticed he could barely see zonko s he looked wistfully at the joke shop harry thought he might be regretting that he had asked hermione to lead the way around the village hey ron harry said hoping to distract him from any regrets have you thought about what to get hermione for valentine day ron looked at harry with a surprised look on his face why would i be thinking of that harry harry sighed ron you and hermione are dating when a girl and a boy are dating valentine day becomes very important you need to think about doing something special for hermione it will really prove that you like her a lot ron gulped if you say so harry i ve never really thought about it well you better think about it now ron harry said it just three weeks away all right harry ron said nodding his head then he looked sheepishly at harry er can you give me any suggestions harry rolled his eyes come on now ron donttell me you ve never seen your dad do something special for your mum for valentine day my dad has done loads of stuff for mum over the years like what ron asked genuinely interested well like give her lots of flowers take her out to dinner or a show things like that harry said did you do that for ginny last year ron asked yeah i gave her a bouquet of roses and a gift then took her out for a picnic harry said ron gulped it sounds a bit expensive to me harry well i saved part of my allowance for them though i got my mum to put together the food we had for the picnic harry said so i was able to afford it so what are you going to do for ginny this valentine day ron asked eagerly oh no harry said i canttell you if i think about it ginny might find out what i have planned besides i dontwant you to steal my idea ron scowled but before he could say anything hermione and ginny came up to them hey hermione said what are you guys talking about oh nothing much harry said immediately he could sense ginny was barely holding her tongue we re going to talk about this later potter when we re alone she said to him in his mind harry gulped mentally but didntanswer her they exited gladrag and stood in front of the shop so where do we go next hermione asked harry and ginny exchanged glances then looked at ron it your call ron harry said well um why dontwe go to that shop that opened last year ron said you know what its name the shop where we bought the christmas gifts harry groaned a bit mentally since he had wanted to go there without the girls but said you mean the little menagerie ron yeah that the one ron said after which he reached for hermione again she gave him a smile and took his hand they walked into the store and immediately started looking around separately it seemed to harry that there were more pieces of jewelry on display he saw several items he thought ginny would love but found the price a little daunting in spite of his considerable allowance nonetheless he put them on his hidden mental list of items he wanted to give ginny over time after a half hour ron approached harry and whispered to him that he found some things he thought hermione might like he showed them to harry all the while trying to make sure the girls didntnotice them harry gave his opinion on the things he was shown but told ron that it ultimately was his decision something ron didntreally like hermione and ginny came up to them after a few minutes and dragged them around the store to show them items they found interesting nice or affordable harry knew a hint when he saw one and decided to tell ron about it later in their dorm after another look around they headed for the three broomsticks for lunch ginny suggested that they get separate tables for each couple hermione agreed wholeheartedly while ron looked a bit unhappy with that suggestion but said nothing with no further words ginny dragged harry over to a booth in the back away from the other two thirds of the trio harry noticed a large number of students inside the pub including cho chang who was with cedric diggory and neville who was with seamus and dean rose was at a separate table with luna lovegood melinda lisa and colin ginny drew his attention away from the rest of the pub by rubbing her fingers lightly on his knee harry gulped and struggled to control his reaction ginny smiled impishly at him but subsided when a waitress came by to take their orders they ate while holding hands and talking through their bond about the things they had seen in the three stores when they were done harry glanced over to where ron and hermione were seated there were several empty plates around them but it seemed they were talking animatedly it appeared that they were enjoying themselves well enough without his help come on harry they re all right over there i think we can leave them be she leaned over to him whispering in his ear let spend the rest of the day away from them please harry shivered as her breath brushed his ear making him forget where they were he brought his lips down to hers as he said in her mind all right gin let me pay the bill and we can go they soon slipped out of the three broomsticks avoiding ron and hermione they walked past dervish and banges to the opposite edge of the village from the train station the lane followed a winding path past a few cottages with large gardens beyond them was the foot of the mountain in whose shadow hogsmeade laid they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the path with some trees just beyond it harry and ginny climbed over the stile and looked back they could barely see the village there was no sign of any other student in fact the only sounds they could hear now were the sounds of nature they moved toward the trees harry spread his cloak on the ground at the foot of an exceptionally large pine and they sat down on it with ginny in harry lap they spent a pleasurable hour of intense snogging with barely a word exchanged between them verbally or mentally finally they got up and headed back to the village where they found ron and hermione coming out of dervish and banges oi harry ron said where were you guys we ve been looking for you for over an hour ginny spoke up before harry could answer if it any business of yours ron we took a walk among the trees ron eyes narrowed a bit but he then shrugged how about heading for zonko and honeyduke now they all agreed and went first into the joke shop after about twenty minutes they transferred to honeyduke where they spent almost an hour finally it was time to head back to the castle they trudged back all the way to gryffindor tower at the foot of the stairs to the dorms hermione thanked ron for a nice time then she went up to her dorm to rest before dinner ron grinned and thanked harry for his help harry breathed a sigh of relief but hoped ron could do the rest of the dating thing on his own after that day ron and hermione began to sit beside each other during meals instead of across from each other as they used to do they also seemed to bicker less and with less of the energy they used to during the new marauders early morning runs they paced each other harry and his other friends were bewildered by the change but were glad of it then before anyone knew it it was valentine day it was a sunday and dumbledore had allowed another hogsmeade visit day harry awoke that day feeling proud that he had kept his gift to ginny a secret from her he could just imagine the happiness she would feel when she saw the gift he had carefully wrapped for her looking at his bedside clock he saw it was just after six in the morning as he felt ginny stir from her sleep he softly spoke in her mind good morning dear gin happy valentine day love harry she replied still a bit sleepy when what he had said finally registered in her mind she came fully awake harry it valentine day happy valentine to you too sweetie now when are you going to give me my gift impatient this morning arentwe he said to her a laughing tone in his mental voice well i ve been very curious about your gift i couldntget anything out of you for the past three weeks it been frustrating to say the least she said okay ginny meet me in the common room in ten minutes harry said make it fifteen harry i still need another five minutes to fully wake up harry was sitting in the still empty common room twelve minute later in his usual armchair in front of the fireplace three minutes later ginny came bounding down the stairs dressed in a green blouse and blue jeans and sat down promptly in harry lap oof harry cried you really are eager arentyou of course harry ginny said wrapping her arms around his neck i always eager to be with you i cantwait to be married and wake up every day beside you harry eyes bulged and his face turned crimson as his mind assimilated what she had said er me too i didntrealize you felt that strongly about it you bet i do harry ginny said you can feel it through our bond she then brought her lips up to his harry eagerly returned the kiss when they broke the kiss before passing out from lack of air they noticed several minutes had passed ginny laid her head on harry chest as they caught their breaths once their racing hearts were back to normal ginny raised her head to look up at harry all right potter that enough stalling where my present harry chuckled all right you little minx here it is i hope you like it harry gave her a bouquet of a dozen roses then pulled a small box wrapped in white paper covered with red hearts out of his pocket and handed it to her ginny carefully placed the flowers to one side she quickly removed the wrapping from the box and opened it inside was a heart shaped golden locket on a gold chain she opened the locket and inside was a picture of the two of them arms around each other every so often they would share a kiss ginny wrapped her arms around harry and gave him a hug worthy of her mother followed by another passionate kiss thank you harry i love it there an engraving on the back go ahead and read it ginny turned the locket around and sure enough there was writing on the back it read to my darling ginny my one and only love let this locket remind you always of our love for all eternity harry ginny embraced him again harry could feel his shirt getting wet a bit alarmed he pulled back and gently lifted her chin with his finger he was surprised to see she was crying gin what wrong he asked her softly it so lovely harry she said in his mind i just donthave something like this to give you dontworry your pretty little head over it gin he said to her mentally as he looked into her eyes it doesntmatter whether you have a gift to me or not being with you is enough he bent down and gave her a very passionate kiss his tongue seeking entrance into her mouth she eagerly parted her lips and their tongues engaged in a battle of dominance their arms clung tightly to each other suddenly they heard someone clearing their throats noisily as well as some snickering they broke apart and looked in the direction of the voices standing there beside them were hermione ron rose fred and george the twins and hermione had smirks on their faces while ron looked like he was about to hurl i thought i told you not to do that around me ron said ginny quickly became angry for your information ronald you werenthere when we started it not my lookout if you just happen to come while we re in the middle of showing each other how we feel her hand was inching toward her back pocket where her wand was ron gulped and said all right all right i sorry for saying that ginny glared at him before turning to hermione good morning hermione rose hermione has this git greeted you yet or given you anything hermione smiled yes ginny he has on both counts he gave me a nice bouquet of roses and a large box of chocolate good ginny said i was afraid he d forgotten what today is though i think he may have had some help she looked pointedly at her boyfriend soulmate who was looking up at the ceiling whistling a little out of key hermione put her hand on ginny shoulder that all right ginny for now i know ron is a bit new to this so what did harry give you ginny moved away from harry to show hermione the locket while harry came up to ron and the twins so harry said i guess she liked the flowers and chocolates right yeah ron said you heard her thanks for helping me get them mate i ll pay you back what you leant me thanks also for the note you left at my bedside reminding me to greet hermione for valentine day wait a minute ron fred said do you mean to say george said that you needed harry to remind you to greet hermione a happy valentine day ron gulped he shouldnthave said that in front of gred and forge now he d regret it guys please dontmention that to her ron pleaded i ll do anything you want fred and george eyes lit up like christmas had come again really ron they said together anything ron gulped again well anything within reason all right fred said we ll let you know george said in the meantime mum the word they said before walking off ron wiped his brow as he sat down across from harry what have i let myself into he moaned letting them have something on me harry shook his head in sympathy and patted ron on the arm i dontknow mate you never know with those two ginny came up to them just then so shall we go down to breakfast ron looked up his misery at being at the mercy of the twins forgotten over the mention of eating yeah let go you go on ahead with hermione and rose ron ginny said i still haventgiven harry his present you mean snogging me senseless wasntit harry asked i thought it was a brilliant present ginny slapped his arm as ron scowled stop that harry at least dontsay it in front of ron i dontwant him souring the day anymore with his negative reactions harry grinned but turned to hermione and his sister oh before you girls go off to breakfast i ve also got something for you two he pulled out a couple of cards and boxes of chocolate frogs hermione and rose were both delighted and gave harry a kiss on the cheek before leaving the common room with ron ginny sat down in harry lap again and looked sternly at him you know potter if i wasntaware of how you felt about me through the bond i might be jealous over you giving valentine cards to other girls even if one of them is your sister then her face softened but then your thoughtfulness and caring for others is a part of you i ve always liked never change that you hear me she then proceeded to kiss him again they broke apart after a few minutes breathing heavily again ginny then pulled out a package from her robes opening it harry found a copper bracelet engraved with their names intertwined together harry grinned this is great ginny i like it a lot he put it on his left hand and helped ginny place the locket around her neck as they walked down to breakfast ginny asked harry harry speaking of lockets have you gotten that locket from the first task open yet er no gin i haven t i cantseem to find anyway to get it open but harry it only ten days to the second task and you dontknow what you ll be doing i know gin i know look let just enjoy the day we ll try the task locket again later all right harry if you say so after breakfast harry and ginny said goodbye to the others as he led her out of the great front doors ginny said harry you said three weeks ago that you were going to make up to me having to spend a hogsmeade visit with ron and hermione i hope you dontthink those flowers and this locket make up for it oh of course not gin i d already planned to give them to you before that day harry replied as they continued to walk outside the castle onto the grounds no i have a great day planned for us ginny then noticed where they were headed harry why are we headed for the quidditch pitch well harry replied to her i know you love to fly as much as i do and we haventbeen able to do that since summer so i asked professor dumbledore for permission to fly for about a couple of hours within the pitch oh harry that great ginny said to him as she again threw her arms around his neck and gave him a quick kiss she then grabbed his hand and together they ran down to the pitch harry stepped up to the broom shed beside the team lockers and drew out a key from his pocket he fit it into the lock and opened the shed harry reached in and pulled out two brooms his firebolt and ginny nimbus 2001 which was a christmas present from bill and charlie they mounted the brooms and flew around the pitch a few times to get used to them then they drew up and hovered beside each other ginny gave harry a wicked smile let see you try and catch me potter she sped away before she even finished the sentence harry took off after her with little hesitation they were soon doing loops spirals and dives that would make other people sick as they played a dizzying game of aerial tag while trying to remain within the pitch finally harry overtook ginny and pulled past her he stopped at one end of the pitch and hovered a few feet above the ground when she caught up to him harry leaned forward and gave her a quick kiss on the lips checking his watch harry was surprised to find that it was half past ten gin we better get these back in the shed he said to her aw harry do we have to she asked a pout on her lips i afraid so ginny the two hours i asked dumbledore for are almost up anyway we having lunch at madam puddifoot s we need to get down to hogsmeade ginny eyes widened madam puddifoot s that little tea shop why did you set up our lunch there well i heard some of the older students saying it was a nice place to have a romantic lunch which older students were these ginny asked her eyes narrowing in suspicion a couple of them wouldntbe fred and george would it uh yeah harry replied actually they re the ones who recommended it ginny slapped her forehead then shook her head harry luv i would have thought that after being with them all these years you would have taken any advice especially romantic advice from those two with a grain of salt in fact a whole bag of salt er you mean their advice wontbe good for us duh most definitely harry whatever advice they give may be guaranteed to embarrass us but i thought they approved of our relationship harry they may approve of it but it wontbe above them to tease us and embarrass us over it now i know why they didnttease us this morning when they caught us snogging just great that was part of my make it up to you plan ginny could feel the disappointment coming from him and reached out to gently touch his cheek with her hand that all right harry she said softly i glad you went through all this trouble to try to make up to me for what happened three weeks ago it really touches me that you care so much she then squared her shoulders and smiled if you went through so much trouble the least we can do is go there harry smiled back really ginny thanks come on let put these brooms away they dismounted and put the brooms back in the shed harry locked the shed up and they walked down to the front gates after getting past filch they walked around the village for a while visiting zonko and honeyduke s at twelve they strode down to the side street where madam puddifoot was when they entered they saw that it was a cramped steamy little place frills and bows seemed to decorate just about everything in the shop the tables were small and circular many of them already occupied by couples staring into each others eyes harry ginny said in harry mind you do remember i dontlike lace anymore dontyou er well i do remember hearing you complain whenever your mum gave you something lacy for the past three years now that for five years now harry ginny said patiently i not sure we should go in now just then a very stout woman with a shiny black bun came up to them hello m dears i madam puddifoot a table for two she smiled so sweetly that harry couldntbear to refuse her sighing resignedly ginny said as brightly as she could muster yes please as madam puddifoot led them to a table in the corner ginny noticed something else harry look at those cherubs are they actually doing what i think they re doing harry looked around and saw a number of golden cherubs hovering over the tables throwing pink confetti over the occupants uh if you mean throwing pink confetti over the diners then yes they are oh merlin you know i do not like pink it seemed to be getting worse and worse luckily none of the cherubs was hovering over their table they found that the only food and drink available in the shop was sandwiches coffee and tea so they ordered some ham and cheese sandwiches and tea fred and george are so dead ginny grumbled we can leave if you want gin we donthave to stay before ginny could reply they heard a familiar voice from the door oh ron it so cute harry and ginny turned and saw hermione standing in the door a look of delight on her face while ron was behind her a look of horror on his face hermione saw them and said oh look who here too she walked over to them ron followed her in looking like he wanted to hide his face hi harry hi ginny hermione said i surprised to see you two here i didntthink you d like a place like this well we just thought we d see it for ourselves harry said just to see how it looks oh hermione said well we better find a table come on ron unfortunately for harry and ginny madame puddifoot put ron and hermione in a table just a few feet from them after she and ron had ordered hermione went to the bathroom harry took the opportunity of hermione absence to talk to ron leaning over to ron he asked what are you doing here i didntthink you d take hermione to a place like this me ron asked back what about you i know my sister well enough to know that a place like this isnther style i right here ron ginny said a bit irritated i dontlike you talking about me like i not present ignoring ginny ron said to harry look i was wracking my brains wondering where to take hermione for a romantic lunch i wasntsure if she d like eating at the three broomsticks never mind the hog head i asked someone i thought might know hogsmeade better harry groaned inwardly let me guess you asked fred or george right ron eyebrows rose up his forehead yeah i did how did you know i made the same mistake harry said here comes hermione just act like you re enjoying being here harry and ginny orders arrived just then they found that the sandwiches tasted like sandpaper they ate as fast as they could without choking on the sandwiches all the while discussing through their mind ways of getting back at the twins once they were done they quickly stood up harry placed a few galleons on the table they said goodbye to ron and hermione ignoring the glare ron was sending them for leaving them they headed for the three broomsticks where they had a bottle of butterbeer each to remove the terrible taste of the sandwiches after that they walked around the other stores for an hour gin harry said to her mentally while they were looking at the candies at honeyduke s i really sorry about lunch i guess that ruined the day for us ginny couldntstand the sadness in his mental voice harry you donthave to apologize we know the twins are the ones at fault here you are just too trusting sometimes dontworry there a very simple way you can make it up to me oh harry said how instead of answering him ginny grabbed his hand and led him back to the castle she brought him up to the third floor into the same passageway where they had told rose and hermione about the bond a year before they emerged an hour later a bit disheveled but much happier and satisfied however as they walked to gryffindor tower harry caught a glimpse of the locket he had given ginny earlier which reminded him of the other locket he had to open to discover the nature of the second task he wondered once again how to get it open fortunately he would be provided the answer to that question by neville that very night a n sorry for the long wait i couldntfind the time to write and the chapter kept getting longer as my creative juices overflowed thanks to all who sent me reviews in the last three weeks i sorry for not replying to most of them but i lacked the time lame excuse i know but what could i do life interfered anyway i hope you guys liked the fluff in this chapter now back to the action the next chapter will have the second task just wait for it now please r r chapter 51 the locket clue disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is the work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit that evening of valentine day neville came up to harry after dinner while he and the others were studying together in the gryffindor common room hey harry neville said have you gotten that locket that was around rose neck during the first task opened yet harry shook his head no neville i haventfigured out how to yet i see neville said i was just wondering if you had since i think krum has gotten his open already why do you think that he has neville ginny asked from where she was sitting beside harry well neville said i was down by the lake earlier looking for water plants when i saw krum and propanov walking up to the shore a little ways down from where i was krum stripped down to a bathing suit then propanov handed him something small that glittered in the sun and krum went under the water when he got out of the water a little later he seemed very excited as he held up the glittering object propanov quickly wrapped a towel around him and they walked off jabbering excitedly in bulgarian harry thought about it and asked so you think they were excited because krum got his locket opened i think so harry neville said i dontthink there is anything else that could have excited them other than having the tournament cup in their hands probably not harry said now the question is how they got it open neville hermione said all krum did was go into the water right how long was he underwater well neville said it seemed about ten minutes why of course harry cried out just then it so simple one of us should have thought of it earlier considering the shape of the locket neville and ron looked at him in confusion ginny rose and hermione however were smiling which meant they had also figured it out let me just get it harry said he got up and went up to his dorm he opened his trunk and rummaged through it for a while before finding the locket which he had placed in a small felt lined box he then went back down to the common room and resumed his previous seat look at its shape nev harry said it shaped like a seashell right i think immersing it in water will get it open neville eyes widened in understanding so how do we immerse it in water i dontfancy going down to the lake since it still cold outside harry said i think a loo with a deep sink or a bathtub will do where can we find one what about the prefects bathroom ginny said turning to him percy once told me that there a huge bathtub there it on the fifth floor a few doors to the left of this statue of a wizard named boris the bewildered the one with his gloves on the wrong hands there a password though it was pine fresh last year you can try it and see if it still works just the thing harry said nodding his head i think tonight would be a good time to go there and check this locket out he turned to rose and asked quietly can i borrow the map rose they all knew he was referring to the marauder map of course harry rose said you donthave to ask me every time just let me know when you need it let me get it now she got up to get it from her trunk care for some company while you re there love she asked him mentally a smirk on her face harry felt himself blush as he answered her er i dontknow ginny i dontwant anyone to think we re doing anything wrong oh harry dontworry i not ready for anything more than what we ve been doing lately i just wanted some more time just with you well since you put it that way meet me down here tonight at midnight i dontthink anyone else will be around then in the meantime let get back to our homework so we dontwaste any time all right harry ginny said smiling ron looked suspiciously at them for a while before turning his attention to his homework rose got back by then and handed the marauder map to him just then the portrait hole opened up and in stepped fred and george discussing something so intently that they were unaware of anything else before anyone could move there were two flashes of light from beside harry and the weasley twins were suddenly sprouting huge green slimy bats from their noses the surprise was evident in their faces as they started clawing at the bat bogeys as they attacked their faces you prats ginny screamed at them that ll teach you for trying to ruin this day for me and harry fred and george looked at her for a moment eyes wide in fear before running up to their dormitory still covered in bat bogeys everyone else looked in awe at ginny who remained glaring at the disappearing backs of the twins whoa neville said remind me never to get you mad at me that was some wicked curse you bet it was harry said looking proudly at her i doubt anyone can cast that hex better than her ginny blushed at his words still harry she said to him through their bond that only a small bit of what i want to do to those two to make sure they dontdo that again help me plan something all right gin i guess i do owe them for that very bad piece of advice i bet ron does too i sure he ll be willing help us true harry go and ask him later however i dontthink we should tell hermione that ron is helping us get back at them she really loved it at madame puddifoot s ron was really brave to stay with her until she was ready to leave you re right on both counts ginny now we better get back to our homework so we can do our little excursion to a certain bathroom tonight later that night harry made sure the rest of his dorm mates were asleep before going down to the common room his cloak in his hand and the locket in his pocket ginny was down there already waiting for him wearing a bathrobe harry slipped the cloak over the two of them and they exited out of the portrait hole they went down to the fifth floor and quickly found the prefect bathroom luckily the password ginny had learned from percy still worked when they entered it ginny exclaimed to harry in his mind oh merlin harry if using this bathroom is a privilege of prefects it ll be worth it to be one everything in the bathroom was made of white marble and it was softly lit by a splendid candle filled chandelier there was an empty rectangular swimming pool in the center of the floor with a diving board and a hundred golden taps with a different colored jewel set in each handle around the pool edges the windows had long white curtains made of linen hanging from them in a corner was a large pile of white fluffy towels and on the wall was a large golden framed picture which featured a mermaid with long blonde hair sleeping at the moment on a large rock its hair fluttering around its face when it snored harry and ginny wandered around for a few minutes peering here and there eventually they knelt down in front of some of the taps and turned on a few of them harry ginny said softly these have different types of bubble bath wizarding bubble bath mixed with water sure enough one tap gushed pink and blue bubbles as large as footballs while another sent heavily perfumed purple clouds over the surface of the water there was even one that poured out ice white foam that looked thick enough to walk on when the pool was filled up ginny turned to harry well love what are you waiting for get in the water we cantwait all night harry gave her a smirk all right all right sheesh women just turn around okay sure harry sure ginny said a smirk of her own on her face as she faced away from him harry stripped down to some swimming trunks then slid into the water clutching the locket he found that his feet barely touched the bottom he swam a couple of laps down its length enjoying the warm water then he heard a soft splash behind him turning around he was surprised to see ginny had entered the water not only that but she was dressed in a one piece swimsuit that showed her curves quite well driving all rational thought from harry mind he moved up to her and attacked her lips with his he felt her smile against him but didntmind at all after an indeterminate amount of time they broke apart breathing heavily i think we should do what we came here for now harry ginny said softly i guess you re right ginny harry said maybe we can continue this a little later sure harry sure ginny said smiling they moved to the side of the pool all right ginny harry said i going to go underwater and see if i can open the locket okay we ll both go harry ginny said who knows how the clue is given okay harry said take a deep breath now on the count of three we go in one two three they ducked under the surface of the water and opened their eyes they looked at the locket and were surprised to see it glowing before they could say anything it popped open and golden letters came out of it and hung in the water forming words into the nearby waters deep descend to the lowest sand to find the green like man hand tarry not too long below for a brew needs to be made or someone dear like beauty will sleep harry and ginny stared at the words for as long as they could hold their breaths they surfaced and took another deep breath they studied the words memorizing them we really should have brought some parchment harry reflected never mind harry between the two of us we should be able to repeat the whole thing you re probably right ginny but what does it mean i not sure harry ginny said we have to decipher it line by line it may take a while to do that you re right gin harry said let get out of here and back to the common room we can write it all down there and show it to the others tomorrow they can help us figure it out cantwe stay a few more minutes harry ginny asked sweetly i did promise that we could do a little more of what we were doing earlier harry grinned and his lips descended on ginny s when they walked back to gryffindor tower much later the cloak and map allowed them to avoid filch they had one bad moment when they almost ran into snape luckily they were able to hug the wall while he passed them they reached the fat lady with no further incident once they were in the common room harry wrote the clue down on a piece of parchment remembering it word for word with help from ginny the next evening they showed the parchment to hermione rose ron ti and neville while they were huddled in an empty classroom after dinner hmm hermione said thinking deeply ginny is right that we have to go over this line by line let go over the first one into the nearby waters deep it probably refers to a deep body of water that near us meaning hogwarts well neville said the nearest deep body of water is black lake yeah harry said that makes sense it right beside the castle it a perfect area for one of the tasks all right that seems straight forward enough ron said true hermione said though there are many lakes in this area i guess it would be logical and convenient to have it as a venue then the next line probably means you have to go down to the bottom of the lake for the task rose said that probably right ginny said the lowest sand would be at the bottom then the third line speaks of the task itself hermione said find the green like man hand the green like man hand ron asked what the bloody hell is that about ron hermione said watch your language well there are two ways to interpret that it either something that shaped like a man hand or functions like a hand something green may be some sort of plant neville said so maybe the champions have to find some sort of plant down there that may be right rose said but what plant will they need to find let look at the next line hermione said it may give us a clue tarry not too long below for ginny read it just says not to stay too long in the water read it together with the next two lines harry suggested tarry not too long below for a brew needs to be made or someone dear like beauty will sleep ginny read um ron said now what does that mean really ronald hermione said you really need to pay attention obviously the plant or whatever it is you find in the lake is needed for a potion what kind of potion ti asked i think it a potion that will keep someone from falling asleep hermione said now that a bit barmy ron said who wants to keep from falling asleep well hermione said the last line refers to someone dear like a beauty it might refer to someone who looks beautiful to the champion um ginny said i dontthink that it hermione in the message the word beauty started with a capital b so it a name or title wait a minute rose said do you think the beauty it refers to is sleeping beauty that does seem to fit rose hermione said it makes sense now sleeping beauty ron asked like the fairy tale yes ron hermione said you do know it dontyou ron shrugged i dontreally remember the whole story something about a girl who fell asleep for a hundred years before being awakened by a prince found it kind of sappy this last comment earned him a glare from ginny and a frown from the other two girls that happens to be one of my favorite fairy tales ron ginny said oh ron really hermione said in the story a king and queen some say they were french angered a very powerful witch when they didntinvite her to their daughter christening the witch cursed the girl to die when she reached her twenty first birthday but three good witches who were invited to the christening changed the curse so she would only fall asleep however she slept for a hundred years but was awakened by a prince who defeated the evil witch so what does it have to do with the task then harry asked well i think the term someone dear means that it ll involve someone close to you being in danger of going to sleep like sleeping beauty hermione said so the task is for you and the other champions to find a plant of some sort to make a potion to prevent that you know there something strange about that harry said why do you need a potion to keep someone from falling into a sleep for a hundred years just how was sleeping beauty put to sleep well the muggle version had her being pricked by a needle that put her to sleep hermione said is there a wizarding version that says different she directed this last to ron ginny neville rose and harry who had all grown up in the wizarding world ron shook his head as did neville we can look up the details and find out ginny said so in the meantime we have to find out what plant i ll be looking for harry said well it would have to be a plant that can be found in the lake can awaken sleeping people and is shaped or looks like a person hand hermione said i could search through the herbology books i have and in the library for that neville said that would be good neville ginny said yeah mate harry said rose can help you with that while the rest of us research on what can put you in a hundred year sleep she as good with research as hermione uh yeah sure rose said i guess i could help neville she sent a glare at her brother when neville wouldntnotice can i help too ti asked i d like to help rose and neville of course of course ti ginny said smiling at him the more people we have looking the better all right harry said so far this task seems about going into black lake to find a plant which will somehow prevent someone close to each of the champions from going into a hundred year sleep so we have two groups looking into the two parts one more thing harry hermione said if you re going to go down into the lake to search for this plant then you ll need a way to breathe underwater for a long time i know you can swim and all that but i dontthink you ll be able to hold your breath for more than 4 minutes which isntanywhere long enough harry sighed then i guess we also have to look for a way to let me breathe underwater our group can do that while we look for the sleep inducing things it too bad we haventlearned cross species transfiguration yet hermione said it would simplify things if you could turn part fish of course we wontlearn that until sixth year i guess fleur and krum would know how to do that being seventh years and all well never mind that hermione harry said we ll just have to find a way that doesntinvolve spells we wontlearn for another two years now i just wonder who they may try to put to sleep i hate to bring this up bro rose said the likeliest person for you would be ginny that brought an uncomfortable feeling to the group harry hoped that it wouldntbe that way he didntknow what he would do if ginny fell asleep for a hundred years with their bond he wouldntbe able to stand not talking to her mentally like they have been doing for over a year now even if she was alive it would feel like she was dead and that would devastate him ginny felt his feelings of anxiety and despair at that prospect she reached out both with her hand and her mind seeking to calm him dontworry harry i sure dumbledore wontallow that to happen remember the prophecy you ll need me with you to get rid of old tom i hope you re right ginny i really hope so the seven gryffindors carried out their research in between classes meals and homework by tuesday neville managed to find reference to a plant called the maiden hand which grew to resemble a hand with long fingers and could be found in freshwater lakes in northern europe however he couldntfind any reference to it being used in potions or if it could be found in black lake hermione and the others found that in the wizarding version of sleeping beauty beauty was given a potion which made her sleep on the day before her twenty first birthday however they couldntfind any reference to the exact potion on friday harry got permission from professor mcgonagall for access to the restricted section of the library the whole group volunteered to join him there they worked there the whole day of saturday looking through dusty tomes it was almost curfew when hermione suddenly said i think i found something what is it hermione harry said as he and the others turned towards her i found this book on obscure potions and poisons there a poison mentioned here called the cure to insomnia hermione what does that have to do with what we re looking for ron asked ron rose said insomnia refers to being unable to sleep go on hermione well this poison is supposed to put someone to sleep for a hundred years hermione said it can be ingested or coated on something to penetrate the skin enough to draw blood its effect is instantaneous if it makes contact with one blood however it takes a while to take effect if it ingested about eight hours or so depending on the concentration of the poison all right harry said that makes it possible to counter or cure the person poisoned does it mention how to counter the poison then it only says that the antidote to the poison takes four hours to brew hermione said but makes no mention of the antidote name or components well it better than nothing i guess ginny said i guess so harry said his vision was blurring from all the reading they had been doing looking around he noticed that everyone was yawning already at least we didntstay here for nothing today we d better get to bed we can continue this tomorrow they all agreed and shuffled back to gryffindor tower for a good night sleep they spent the whole sunday doing the same thing but had no further success monday found them back at class harry was sitting down in the dungeons for potions when a balled up piece of parchment hit his desk he looked around but could not see anyone who looked like they had thrown it at him keeping an eye out for snape he opened the ball inside was a note potter i need to speak with you it important lag behind after potions and i ll meet you outside the classroom do not tell anyone especially granger and weasley dontworry if i intended to ambush you i wouldnthave provided this warning draco malfoy now what could that git want ginny said suddenly in his mind causing harry to jump gin dontdo that harry said next time let me feel your presence before you speak people will think i barmy jumping up suddenly with no visible reason sorry love ginny said though harry could feel her amusement never mind i guess we ll see what this is about later now let me pay attention snape just came in all right harry i ll see you later at the end of the class period harry pretended to take time cleaning his cauldron he told ron and hermione to go ahead his friends looked suspiciously at him for a moment before leaving when harry exited the potions classroom he heard someone whisper his name from his left malfoy beckoned to him from behind one of the suits of armor harry walked over to him and found that the suit hid an alcove where two people could talk and not be heard or noticed all right malfoy harry said quietly what so important you needed to meet with me secretly malfoy scowled at him look potter i really didnthave to do this but call it repayment for saving my brother life harry raised an eyebrow okay malfoy i listening malfoy took a deep breath before he started i have to warn you i know the second task for the triwizard tournament is in two days everyone knows that malfoy harry said that had been announced at the beginning of the term when the students had gotten back from the christmas holidays yes yes malfoy said i know that potter however i have heard that it will take place in the lake i not sure what the task will be but the thing is there will be another attempt to kill you during the event i ve been led to believe that it ll involve the giant squid harry felt a wave of dread and shock from ginny but ignored it for now how do you know this draco harry asked malfoy if the blonde was surprised by harry use of his given name he didntshow it i have my sources potter malfoy said i know from them that the dark lord wasnthappy the dragon failed to get you because of that he ordered another try during the second task so you d better be ready to handle a giant squid potter and fast malfoy then turned around and left without another word harry waited a few seconds before following harry he heard ginny in his mind now i really scared how will you fight a giant squid in the water i dontknow yet ginny we just had another thing added to our research list maybe hermione has a few suggestions dontworry love i not going to let a giant piece of calamari snuff me not while i can help it you have to tell dumbledore harry and your father they can help you ginny said all right gin harry said i ll send hedwig to potter manor tonight after writing a letter to his dad and sending hedwig off with it harry talked to professor dumbledore dumbledore thanked harry for the information and assured him that the giant squid whose name dumbledore said was edgar would be watched to prevent anyone from casting any spells on him that really weird ginny said to harry later as they continued their search in the library i never thought the giant squid had a name it such a common name too harry shrugged well dumbledore said it was the squid himself who told him his name i a bit surprised it was able to talk with the professor well stranger things have happened in the magical world harry like this bond we have i bet muggles would scratch their heads over what we re doing too true ginny harry said anyway we d better get back to our search harry only told hermione and ron about malfoy warning he didntwant to worry the others especially his sister hermione found some useful spells harry could use underwater for defense hopefully it would affect the giant squid they were still reading when madame pince made them leave the restricted section on tuesday night harry and ginny managed to sneak some books past the librarian much to hermione disgust harry continued reading in bed late into the night still looking for a way to breathe underwater he dozed lightly but when he awakened he saw that it was still dark he felt for ginny presence and sensed that she was still asleep unable to sleep further he decided to read down in the common room when he got there he was surprised to see someone with dark red hair sleeping in front of the fire he got closer and saw who it was rose he said as he started shaking his sister awake come on sprite wake up harry she asked still groggy yes sis it me what are you doing down here harry asked her he was surprised when rose suddenly hugged him tightly and started to cry hey what wrong he asked as he struggled to pull away what got you in a tizzy over rose looked up at him tears flowing unheeded down her cheeks harry i i i had a vision last night actually it was more like a dream what was it about harry asked concerned i saw you in deep water with gills on the side of your neck and webbed feet and hands you were looking for something you found a plant shaped like a hand and pulled out of the ground you started rising to the surface when several grindylows attacked you you managed to drive some of them back but they were swarming you then a giant tentacle wrapped itself around you and started squeezing the life out of you that when i woke up i was so scared that i came down here to calm down i must have fallen asleep while deciding whether to tell you or not i even thought of sending an owl to dad harry let rose talk without interruption when she seemed finished harry asked do you think it was a regular dream or some sort of vision of the future i i i not sure harry she said in my readings on seers it seems some seers see visions like that in their sleep others don t this is the first time i had such a dream all right rose harry said dontworry about it i ve already received a warning about the giant squid being used to attack me during the task he held up his hand to prevent her from interrupting him i ve told dumbledore and sent an owl to dad dumbledore told me he d take care of it so there nothing we can do but wait so dontthink about it okay rose looked uncertainly at him okay harry at least you re warned about it now harry said to her you go back to bed it still a couple of hours to dawn i cantsleep anymore i ll just be down here reading some more rose nodded her head and headed back to her dorm as he watched her disappear up the steps harry hoped her vision wouldntcome true however he knew that was a forlorn hope if he had to base it on his experience with her visions over the past year harry squared his shoulders and turned his attention to the book in front of him it seemed to have more information on the cure to insomnia poison hermione had mentioned harry hoped it would help him with the task he would have to do in only four and a half hours chapter 52 the second task disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is the work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit after making rose go back to bed harry read for only another hour before deciding to get some early breakfast while the majority of the students population was still in their dorms he changed into his swimming trunks and placed his robes over them when he arrived in the great hall there were only about a half dozen students inside but they watched harry walk inside and take a seat at the gryffindor table harry felt his stomach churn as his mind turned to the task he was going to go through in a few hours especially since he still didntknow how to breathe underwater for more than a few minutes now unable to eat he simply stared at the food after an hour of staring at the food he became aware of ginny stirring from her sleep harry are you awake already she asked through their bond uh yes gin he answered her in the same way she became aware of where he was and what he was feeling i ll be there in a few minutes harry dontyou dare go anywhere without me she arrived ten minutes later which was an evident indication of her concern sitting beside harry she took his hand in both of hers and squeezed it gently as she sent calming thoughts to him finally when he was calmer she said all right sweetie you should eat something now she proceeded to pile food on his plate then looked expectantly at him harry took a deep breath and started eating ginny smiled and started on her own breakfast ron and hermione came in a few minutes later and sat across from them thank goodness the food here ron said i starving and thirsty he reached over and grabbed a glass full of pumpkin juice drinking deeply from it ron ginny exclaimed that my juice get you own but it was already filled ron said as he placed the glass down he then started to pile food on his own plate after a minute or two he yawned with his mouth full ron hermione admonished swallow first before you do that it gross suddenly ron head thumped onto the table and he went limp ron honestly hermione said as she started shaking his shoulder you ve had enough sleep wake up her shaking grew more violent as ron failed to stir finally hermione drew her wand and said ennervate when ron didntrespond she gave a panicked look at harry and ginny harry felt alarm course through his body he took the glass from which ron had drunk and sniffed it it smelled like pumpkin juice he was about to take a taste when he heard dumbledore voice unexpectedly say stop harry dontdrink that harry and the others turned to the headmaster who was walking toward them why not professor what wrong with it he had an idea why dumbledore had stopped him but wanted it confirmed i afraid that it is probably poisoned it appears that mr weasley is now part of the second task harry paled he now my someone dear who is in danger of sleeping like sleeping beauty but it was ginny glass that he drunk from she was the one who was supposed to fall asleep i afraid so harry dumbledore said his voice grave i sorry for this but this task is ludo idea and barty supported it fully sir hermione said isntit dangerous to give someone this poison what if one of the champions fails to bring back the plant for the antidote he ll sleep for a hundred years i dontthink it will come to that miss granger dumbledore said but rest assured we are prepared for that possibility now it would be best if we move mr weasley to the hospital wing dumbledore conjured a stretcher then levitated ron onto it harry hermione and ginny followed dumbledore as he guided the stretcher toward the great hall doors just as they reached the doors they opened and rose and ti came through them their eyes widened when they saw ron on the stretcher with dumbledore harry ginny and hermione accompanying him h harry rose said what happened to ron harry frowned he been poisoned rose with the cure to insomnia poison this makes him the one i supposed to get the maiden hand for then it wasntginny who was chosen ti said er actually ti hermione said the poison was in ginny goblet but ron drank from it before she could where are you taking him rose asked the headmaster thinks it would be better for ron to be in the hospital wing now ginny answered we had better go dumbledore said we need to settle ron in the hospital wing before the task starts when they reached the entrance hall they saw neville hurrying toward them through the front doors what happened to ron he asked them hermione quickly explained what had happened earlier to ron oh boy neville said that really awful uh harry can i talk to you for a moment in private uh sure neville harry said you guys go on ahead to the hospital wing we ll catch up they moved to a corner of the hall across from the broom cupboard what is it neville harry asked i ve found a way for you to breathe underwater neville said here take this he pressed a mass of what looked like slimy grayish green rat tails into harry hand what are these neville harry asked it gillyweed harry neville said it causes gills to sprout at the sides of the neck and hands and feet to become webbed once you ve swallowed it it ll allow you to breathe underwater for about an hour that should be enough time to find some maiden hand remember the maiden hand is greenish translucent and is shaped like a long fingered hand it grows in the bottom near the middle within forests of seagrass just watch out for grindylows grindylows were small horned water demons that hid in the weeds and attacked swimmers trying to drown them so they could eat them harry had learned about them the previous year from remus defense against the dark arts class thanks neville harry said i ll try to remember all that well we better catch up to the others i want to make sure ron is settled in the hospital wing before going down to the lake when harry and neville arrived at the hospital wing they saw that ron had already been placed in one of the beds at the side of the room however he was not the only one who had been poisoned for the task and the wing was crowded with people madame maxime was hovering over another bed where a girl with dark brown hair and wearing beauxbatons robes lay apparently asleep fleur was seated beside the unconscious girl holding her hand two other beauxbatons students one boy and one girl were standing behind fleur looking grave on another bed was a boy dressed in durmstrang furs viktor krum was seated beside the boy his face sour and glum propanov was off to the side talking with dumbledore occasionally viktor would glance in hermione direction but she didntnotice since she was too focused on ron causing the older boy to frown hermione had been polite with krum since she started dating ron but didnttalk to him as much as she used to both fleur and viktor were wearing bathrobes their swimming wear was probably under the robes as he gazed at the sleeping victims harry was a bit glad that he wasntthe one in bed though he felt guilty having that feeling since it was ron who was sick and he was that way because of the task harry ginny mental voice broke into his thoughts you have nothing to feel guilty over it not your fault ron shouldnthave taken a drink from my glass in the first place but the one really responsible is the one who entered your name in the tournament she was with hermione rose and ti seated around ron harry sighed and walked over to them with neville you re right gin harry said to her mentally it just that i feel like i a puppet being controlled i feel so helpless seeing ron like this i really want to find out who placed me in this bloody tournament dontthink about that harry the best thing you can do right now is go out there and find that plant all right harry said that what i going to do uh ginny who are the two other victims oh the one with fleur is marie jeconais her best friend while the one with viktor is igor stratislav his best friend ginny said apparently both were poisoned like ron while having breakfast both headmasters were not pleased especially propanov i know how they feel harry said ginny took his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze it ll be all right harry i sure you ll find the maiden hand in time just then dumbledore came up to harry trailed by madame maxime fleur propanov and viktor krum harry dumbledore said it time to head down to the lake for the task dontworry by the end of the task there should be enough time for the antidote to be brewed all right professor harry said if you say so he nodded to fleur and viktor dontworry we ll get our friends out of this both looked at harry with gratitude thank you arry fleur said her eyes wet with unshed tears marie az been my best friend zinz we started at beauxbatons i do not know ow i will go on wiz out er da viktor said igor is being like zat for me also ginny gave harry a peck on the cheek before he left the hospital wing the three champions walked in silence side by side down to the lake trailed by their respective headmasters mistress when they were able to see the lake they saw that there was a gold draped table near the water edge and seated there were ludo bagman and barty crouch on the opposite bank of the lake stands were erected with the seats from around the dragon enclosure students were already filling them when they arrived at the lakeshore harry fleur and viktor glared at bagman and crouch dumbledore propanov and madam maxime took their seats at the table er good morning bagman said nervously as he noted the hostile looks being given to him by the three champions i hope you ve ah all figured out what you have to do oh yeah harry said in a sarcastic tone it a great task you re having us do find a plant underwater to save our best mates from sleeping for a hundred years great wonderful right up with that first task where we saved a loved one from a mad dragon just who cursed you with the brains of a monkey voldemort bagman winced n n now harry there no need to bring you know who into this this has nothing to do with him after all he gone and all thanks to you harry noticed a look of anger on crouch face but it was gone before he could focus on it now bagman continued we just have a few minutes while we wait for the stands to fill while they were waiting harry gestured to fleur and viktor to come closer to him when they did he said in a low voice look it ll be better if we work together on this at least we should cooperate in searching for the maiden hand that way we can find it quickly the two were silent for a few seconds before viktor said i agree with harry ve must work together so finding this plant will be easy fleur nodded oui we must so our friends may wake up all right harry said when we get into the water we have to split up to search as much of the lake as we can from our research my friends and i have determined that all we need to do is look for clumps of seagrass they look like a thick carpet of light green weeds about two feet high the maiden hand grows among the seagrass so ve vill look for these plants at the bottom of the lake viktor asked yes harry said each of us should search each clump we find several strands of maiden hand usually grow together so if we find one there should be enough for all of us after all we only need one strand for each potion very vell harry viktor said how vill ve contact each other once someone finds it well we cantuse red sparks in the water harry said thinking i know flash the light from your wand at maximum power on and off in quick succession five times it should be visible for a mile or two yes fleur said zat should work viktor nodded yes very vell ve vill do that all right harry said if you find one first just make sure the others see where it is before leaving okay oh watch out for grindylows they hide in the seagrass both fleur and viktor nodded bagman called them to change and come up to the water edge when the three champions now in swimsuits were standing bagman pointed his wand to his throat and said sonorus his voice now magically magnified boomed out over the water good morning our champions are now ready for the second task which will start at my whistle they will have one hour to search for the plant which is the main reagent for the potion that will awaken their sleeping friends on the count of three then one two three the three champions walked into the cold waters of the lake fleur and viktor cast spells on themselves then dove under the water harry stuffed the gillyweed into his mouth and chewed he gagged a bit on the awful taste but managed to swallow them as he walked further into the water he suddenly felt as if someone had clamped a pillow over his mouth and nose and a piercing pain appeared on the sides of his neck his head started spinning from lack of air harry get under the water now he heard ginny say to him in his mind harry dove under the water and took a gulp of water the spinning feeling immediately disappeared and he felt the water pass through the gills he now had looking at his hands and feet he saw webbing between his fingers and toes his feet had also elongated a bit grinning harry dove deep into the murky depths enjoying the now warmer water he could only see about ten feet in front of him he glided through the water heading for the bottom of the lake after several minutes a landscape unlike any he had seen before loomed before him forests of rippling tangled black weed and wide plains of mud littered with dull glimmering stones were all about harry turned toward where he thought the middle of the lake was so far there was no sign of the other champions grindylows or thankfully the giant squid harry then spotted a clump of seagrass he dove down to it and starting shifting through the weeds he didntsee any other plant then he felt a heavy pressure around his left leg looking down he saw a grindylow clutching his leg with its long fingers and baring its pointed teeth at him more were starting to rise from the weeds harry pulled his wand out of his swimming trunk back pocket and shouted relashio instead of sound a large bubble came out of his mouth and instead of red sparks a jet of what appeared to be hot water came out of his wand and hit the grindylow causing red welts to appear on its skin and forcing it to let go harry repeated the spell several more times forcing the grindylows to return to the shelter of the weeds harry then moved away looking for other clumps of seagrass after twenty more minutes and several clumps of seagrass harry surmised that he was near the middle of the lake he found another clump of seagrass and spotted a group of translucent green plants whose leaves were thin and elongated that must be the maiden hand harry thought he swam up to it after ascertaining that it was indeed the maiden hand he raised his wand and said lumos maxima a very bright light came out of his wand tip after a second he said nox extinguishing the light he relit his wand two more times with an interval of a second hoping fleur and viktor had seen the light he reached down plucked one strand of the plant and placed it in the front pocket of his trunks then he waited while he was waiting harry saw several humanoid figures with silvery fishtails instead of legs swim up to the edge of the seagrass clump merpeople they had grayish skin long wild hair of a dark green color and yellow eyes around their necks they wore thick ropes of pebbles and had spears in their hands they appeared to be watching him after about a minute one of them pointed to the maiden hand then at harry then made a shooing gesture harry shook his head the same merman came closer and said you have the plant you should go i waiting for the others to find it harry tried to say but only bubbles came out of his mouth he shook his head again and continued watching for the other champions the merman shrugged his shoulders and joined the others the merpeople took one last look at harry and swam off a few minutes later harry saw a slim figure coming towards him it was fleur and she had an enormous bubble around her head making her features appear wide and lopsided harry pointed out the strand of maiden hand to her she smiled and nodded her thanks before diving down toward the plant harry looked around for viktor but saw no sign of him deciding that he had waited long enough he turned for one last look at fleur but froze at what he saw several grindylow were mobbing fleur tugging her and pulling her down toward the seagrass with barely a thought harry dove toward the part veela girl when he got close to her he sent several jets of hot water at the nasty creatures while trying to avoid hitting fleur the grindylows fled before harry spells harry pulled fleur away from them luckily she was unharmed shaking a bit she nodded her thanks again to harry and headed for the surface a strand of maiden hand clutched tightly in one hand harry watched her ascend for a few seconds then he felt a tug on his leg and looked down another grindylow was clutching his foot suddenly the creature bit him harry gasped at the sharp pain the bite caused him he lashed out with his other foot hard and felt it connect with its horned skull the grindylow let go and floated away clearly dazed harry saw more of the creatures rising out of the seagrass he drew his wand and sent more jets of hot water at them forcing some of them back however more came out of the seagrass and started swarming his legs pulling him down some of them started biting him drawing blood it just like rose vision he could feel himself sinking down into the seagrass the loss of blood from his wounds was starting to make him light headed and a bit dizzy harry dontgive up he heard ginny call to him in his mind he could feel her panic mounting dimly he was aware of hermione and rose holding her to keep her from jumping into the water after him harry could barely hold his wand up several grindylows were also clutching his arms keeping him from casting the spell his vision started to grow dim suddenly a large shadow seemed to block out the light from the surface then something long and sinewy with suction cups wrapped itself around his waist great he thought now edgar getting in on the action as he hovered on the edge of consciousness he noticed that the grindylows seemed to be letting him go he then felt himself rising and realized that the giant squid had somehow driven the grindylows off and was actually lifting him toward the surface of the lake as he was being pushed upward harry shook his head trying to clear it then he felt a pair of hands grasp his arms and pull him further upward turning his head he momentarily panicked at the sight of the creature grasping him it appeared to be a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark he realized that it was viktor who seemed to have transfigured himself a bit badly viktor gave him a look that seemed to be asking if he was all right harry looked up and saw that they were close to the surface and gave viktor a thumbs up sign viktor nodded as he let harry go then he started rising toward the surface a strand of maiden hair tucked into his trunks there was no sign of the giant squid harry pushed himself upward with his feet he noticed he was starting to have difficulty drawing in his breath and there was pain again at the sides of his neck he was starting to get dizzy again and water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs oh no the gillyweed must be wearing off he dimly heard ginny in his mind giving him encouragement as he struggled upward and tried not to lose consciousness suddenly he broke the surface of the lake and drew in a great breath of air as his head started to clear he found that he was more than a hundred yards from shore he allowed himself to float as he got his breathing under control finally he headed for shore using strong strokes to move quickly through the water ignoring his aching muscles when he felt his feet come in contact with solid ground he started moving faster harry fell to his knees when he broke free of the water gasping from exhaustion ginny was at his side in a flash draping a towel over him hermione and rose helped him stand up harry ginny said in his mind as she hugged him tightly i swear if you had given up back there i would have hexed you into next week dontworry love i okay now harry said back to her as he returned her embrace no you re not you prat ginny said you re bleeding from all those grindylow bites come on harry let get you to madame pomfrey reluctant to argue with her harry allowed her to pull him over to where the school nurse was examining fleur and viktor madame pomfrey pursed her lips when she saw the wounds on harry legs sit down potter she said i have to heal those wounds before they get worse harry sat down on a stool and allowed the matron to heal the grindylow bites on his legs he saw dumbledore at the water edge talking to several of the merpeople then the headmaster walked back to the judges table and talked with the others snape came up to him then potter the greasy haired professor said holding his hand out i ll have your strand of maiden hair now so i can begin brewing the antidote for weasley harry reluctantly handed over the plant to snape who walked off back toward the castle fleur then came up to harry and hugged him earning a scowl from ginny the french girl said oh arry thank you so much for saving me from the grindylows those orrible creatures they almost drowned me she gave him a kiss on each cheek causing harry to blush and ginny to glower at the beauxbatons girl harry turned to viktor thanks for helping me back there viktor harry said i not sure what would have happened if you hadntcome along you are velcome harry viktor said smiling a little of course i thought the giant squid was attacking you but i saw it drive the grindylows away from you i thought that was what it was doing harry said i guess i owe it my thanks also just then james and lily came up to them they quickly hugged harry are you all right harry lily asked as she looked him over i all right now mum harry said i had a few grindylow bites but madame pomfrey healed them all up that good son james said it just too bad you were third getting back oh ludo is about to announce the scores they turned toward the judges as bagman pointed his wand to himself and said sonorus your attention please ladies and gentlemen bagman said with his amplified voice we the judges have come to our decision based on our observations and some testimony from the merpeople who live in the lake we have decided to award points out of fifty to our champions as follows miss fleur delacour made excellent use of the bubblehead charm and was the first one back with the correct plant even though she was attacked by grindylows we award her forty eight points the crowd applauded and cheered enthusiastically mr viktor krum performed an incomplete crossspecies transfiguration which was nevertheless effective and was the second one to return he receives forty four points more applause and cheers came from the stands finally mr harry potter made excellent use of gillyweed and came back last however we have been informed by the merpeople who were watching that he was the first to find a clump of maiden hand but refused to leave until he was sure the others could find it in addition he came to the aid of miss delacour when she was attacked by the grindylows we applaud him for his moral fiber and courage therefore we award him with forty six points cheers and applause broke out from the stands louder than they had been for viktor and fleur adding up his previous score from the first task put harry in first place well done to all the champions bagman continued now we are up to the third and final task it ll take place at dusk on the twenty fourth of june the champions will be informed of the task exactly one month beforehand thank you for your support of all the champions quietus harry grinned as hermione rose and his parents congratulated him ginny leaped into his arms wrapping her legs around his waist and gave him a passionate kiss much to the amusement of harry parents sister best friend and dumbledore this however bewildered fleur viktor and the other judges harry and ginny broke apart then their cheeks reddened as they realized that they had an audience er sorry ginny said i just got carried away what with harry now in first place oh that perfectly all right miss weasley dumbledore said the familiar twinkle in his eye it so nice to see young love like that i remember a certain other young couple years ago another redhead girl and a black haired bespectacled boy she congratulated him in the same way after they won the quidditch cup in their final year they were just as in love as the two of you are and still are i believe james and lily cheeks turned red on hearing dumbledore comment dumbledore chuckled all right i think we should head to the hospital wing now we have a trio of people to awaken everyone nodded and started to head for the castle ginny helped harry dry off with a drying charm then held his robe as he put them on they then headed up the path to the castle holding hands as they walked harry noticed his dad was lagging behind looking at something suspiciously harry followed his dad gaze and saw that his father was watching mr crouch who was talking to propanov as they walked up to the castle dad harry said what is it why are you looking at mr crouch like that huh james said as he turned his attention to his son what do you mean son dad you ve got that look harry said you know your suspicious auror look what going on james sighed mr crouch seems to be acting strangely lately he seems obsessed with this tournament i heard from percy that he arrived late at several important meetings in the last three months meetings not concerned with this tournament it really strange since he always been punctual then he gone home early often lately leaving a lot of work undone it as if he not interested in most parts of his job anymore that is strange dad harry said you know this morning i got kind of angry at him and bagman for putting ron to sleep and told them they must have been cursed by voldemort into coming up with these tasks bagman reacted the usual way people do on hearing old voldie name but mr crouch actually looked angry for a moment when bagman mentioned that he was gone thanks to me that is a bit unusual son james said even i occasionally get chills when i hear v v voldemort name of course it might have to do with what happened to his son barty jr why james ginny asked as she was walking beside them what happened to his son well after v v voldemort disappeared after attacking us some deatheaters captured the longbottoms to get information on voldemort whereabouts luckily for frank and alice they were caught by moody and some other aurors before they got cursed for too long with the cruciatus curse merlin knows what would have happened to them otherwise anyway one of the deatheaters caught was barty own son barty crouch jr harry and ginny eyes widened what did mr crouch do harry asked a bit afraid of the answer james gave a bitter laugh something harry had never heard from his father barty was head of magical law enforcement and chief judge when his son came to trial the boy vehemently denied the charges and frantically begged his mother who was present to save him barty refused to listen to his own son and sentenced him to azkaban with no regrets even disowned him that horrible ginny said what happened after that james sighed barty jr died in azkaban a couple of years later barty wife never recovered from the shock she died a few months after her son barty was a broken man after that he was in line for minister of magic but his prestige suffered a nosedive after his son trial and he got shunted into the department of magical cooperation of course he worked just as hard in that department as he did in his old job but now he seems a bit different after a few seconds of watching mr crouch james shook his head as if he was trying to clear it well never mind about crouch let catch up with the others you have a friend to awaken and need to celebrate a successful task he then increased his stride to catch up with his wife and daughter harry and ginny looked at each other but decided to leave the matter alone for now they hurried to catch up with james eager to be there when ron woke up a n so the second task is done except for waking the victims up how will ron react to being poisoned what will happen in the third task just hang on for the next chapters please

please r r james and lily said their farewells to their children and their friends when they got back to the castle as they were anxious to get back to andrew and daisy whom they had left with molly in addition they wanted to tell molly what had happened in the task harry ginny hermione and rose barely touched their food during lunch in the great hall anxious as they were for snape to have finished the antidote to the cure to insomnia poison they saw that fleur and viktor were looking equally anxious the four gryffindors returned to their common room when they couldnteat just before three in the afternoon about four hours after the end of the task professor mcgonagall came into the common room to inform harry and ginny that the antidote was ready ti neville and neville sister maggie joined them hermione and rose as the four headed for the hospital wing bagman and the three headmasters were already there along with fleur and victor who were waiting their own friends to be revived harry and his friends held their breaths as madam pomfrey gave ron the antidote when he awoke ron had a confused look on his face as he noticed where he was and the anxious looks on his friends faces then he said that he seemed to have had the most peaceful sleep in his entire life which earned him exasperated looks from the girls and amused ones from harry and neville of course when he learned what had been done to him to say that he was angry would be a gross understatement harry and neville had to hold him back as he tried to get up looking for his wand and threatening to hex bagman ron was even more furious when he learned he had missed lunch at the mention of lunch harry and the others realized that they were as hungry as ron now that the redhead was up and about since classes had been cancelled for the day harry suggested they go down to the kitchen and ask the house elves for some food a suggestion everyone agreed to though hermione was reluctant unfortunately before ron could get out of bed the doors of the hospital wing banged open and his mother walked in when she caught sight of ron she hurried over to his side ron are you all right molly asked her youngest son as she hugged him tightly geroff mum ron said his voice muffled i fine mum i just hungry i cantbelieve i missed lunch ronald bilius weasley how can you think about lunch when you re recovering from being poisoned molly asked exasperated now molly dumbledore said to the weasley matriarch calm down as you can see he is fine the poison actually has no side effects once the one involved wakes up he deliberately avoided saying the word poisoned which would have set off molly how could you let this happen albus molly asked dumbledore letting students be poisoned really i afraid the ministry insisted on having it this way molly dumbledore said it was the suggestion of the representative from the department of magical sports the representative of the department of magical sports molly asked confused then she saw bagman who was now fidgeting anxiously you you re the representative of that department in this tournament what were you thinking molly started to berate bagman in her usual manner her attention drawn away from ron harry gestured to the others that they should leave the other seven children nodded and they all headed for the doors upon reaching the corridor outside the hospital wing they all doubled over laughing hard poor mr bagman rose said i almost feel sorry for him almost i know ginny said never have i been gladder of how protective mum is of us all right ron said enough of this i starving let get to the kitchens the older gryffindors rolled their eyes while maggie and ti looked bewildered they all headed down the main staircase headed for the lower levels and the painting with the basket of fruit which was the hidden entrance to the kitchens when they entered the kitchen with harry leading the way they were surprised by something small that rammed into harry and almost knocked him over squealing harry potter sir harry potter has finally returned to see dobby er hello dobby harry said as he looked down at the squealing elf a bit embarrassed he had forgotten about the exuberant elf he had freed from the malfoys two years ago and whom he and ginny had found working in hogwarts the previous year after the attack by peter pettigrew on ginny dobby is so happy to see you again harry potter sir the house elf said as he let go of harry his huge eyes brimming with tears of happiness dobby had thought harry potter had forgotten dobby oh harry ginny said in harry mind sadness in her tone we did forget about him harry knelt down on one knee so he could be at eye level with the elf i sorry dobby i did forget that you were here i sorry it wonthappen again dobby looked at harry with wide eyes harry potter should not apologize to dobby dobby is only a house elf and doesntmind being forgotten well that wrong dobby harry said you are not my slave or servant i consider you a good friend and friends shouldntforget one another y you consider dobby your friend the house elf asked harry when harry nodded he burst into fresh tears harry potter is a great wizard willing to befriend dobby the elf cried in an attempt to calm the house elf harry said err dobby i d like you to meet my other friends he gently pulled ginny forward you remember ginny weasley she actually my girlfriend oh no sir dobby said awe in his voice she is more than that she is harry potter soulmate the seven gryffindors eyes widened h h how do you know that dobby harry asked in a soft voice you didntmention it last year elves see magical bonds harry potter dobby said awe still in his voice it be one of our magical abilities dobby could barely see it last year but now it is visible to all elves the bond you have with miss weezey is very strong the strongest dobby has seen feeling uncomfortable with what dobby had said harry continued introducing his friends this is my sister rose this is ron weasley ginny brother this is hermione granger that neville longbottom beside him is his sister maggie and beside her is master tiberius dobby shouted rushing forward again and embracing ti fiercely dobby is glad to see you master tiberius sir dobby was so worried what would happen to you dobby was worried that master draco would harm master tiberius again h h hello dobby tiberius said as he awkwardly returned dobby hug i glad to see you too ti looked at harry a smile forming on his face dobby took care of me when i was younger father was furious when you freed dobby harry but i was glad he and draco treated him so badly making him punish himself for the slightest mistake good master tiberius was so kind to dobby dobby said tears again brimming in his eyes master tiberius always stopped dobby from punishing himself when master draco and master lucius were not around dobby was sad not to see him again when dobby was freed well you can see him everyday dobby harry said a smile on his face in fact maybe you can stay with him dobby after all he no longer staying at malfoy manor master tiberius is no longer living with his family dobby asked his eyes bulging no dobby tiberius said sadness in his voice father disowned me last year for being sorted into gryffindor then his tone became a happier one but now i live with sirius black my mum first cousin he great he my guardian and sort of adopted me so i now tiberius black and you can call me ti dobby i no longer your master maybe we can be friends now dobby started watering and he again hugged ti fiercely oh you is as great a wizard as harry potter ti cheeks turned red as the elf continued to hug him unable to respond to such praise he instead awkwardly patted dobby back finally the elf let go and ti turned to harry what do you mean that he can stay with me harry well maybe sirius would be willing to hire dobby harry said i was considering the idea earlier this year but forgot all about it with everything going on maybe you can ask him now ti looked thoughtful for a moment then said i guess i should right now we have kreacher he doesntreally like sirius or me always ranting about how sirius mum would be appalled by what sirius has been doing to the house and how we werentproper purebloods he has to obey sirius since he the rightful heir to the noble house of black but refuses to have anything to do with me dobby looked appalled a house elf refuses to serve good master ti that is horrible what a bad house elf he is see ti harry asked dobby would be perfect we ll owl sirius tonight and ask him i sure he ll be glad to hire dobby all right harry ti said thanks excuse me ron said looking annoyed i hate to break up this little reunion harry ti but we came down here for lunch remember ron hermione admonished how can you be so callous oh come on ron whined i the one who was poisoned and missed lunch now i the bad guy harry snickered ron right hermione he turned to dobby dobby if you dontmind my friends and i sort of skipped lunch could we have some sandwiches or something sandwiches dobby said sounding scandalized that is not a proper lunch for hogwarts harry potter come this way he pulled on ti hand and led them deeper into the kitchens they saw that there were four long tables there harry noted their positions and thought that they were right below each of the four house tables above in the great hall they were presently empty since lunch had been over for the past three hours there were at least a hundred house elves in the kitchens as dobby made them sit down in the table that would correspond to the gryffindor table in the great hall the elves were all wearing the same uniform a tea towel stamped with the hogwarts crest and tied like a toga they were all bowing and curtseying to the seven students harry potter and his friends would like some food dobby said to the other elves instantly two dozen of the elves came up to the table carrying plates silverware cups two jugs of pumpkin juice a whole roast chicken several pies and loaves of bread good service ron said obviously impressed the elves beamed and bowed hermione however frowned as they ate hermione talked with the elves she discovered to her horror that the house elves of hogwarts were not free like dobby but bound to the service of the school she refused to eat another bite until rose pointed out that it was an insult to the elves if she didnteat reluctant to offend the house elves she started eating again though she ranted a bit about elves rights after eating their fill the seven new marauders thanked the elves for the food harry and ti said goodbye to dobby promising to visit him again as they climbed the stairs up to the entrance hall ti turned to harry harry do you think sirius will hire dobby i think so ti harry answered if we explain to him how he raised you and how hard he works i sure he will after all i d think anyone would be better than that kreacher why dontwe go to the common room and write him a letter right now ti grinned okay let go everyone went up to the gryffindor common room except for hermione who said she needed to go to the library to do some research after writing the letter to sirius harry ginny and ti went to the owlery to send it through hedwig to sirius home in london they hoped he d reply soon classes resumed the next day harry much to his disgust was again in the spotlight since he was currently in first place in the tournament students keep coming up to him offering their congratulations several girls would go out of their way to try to talk to harry while walking in the corridors leaning on him and even showing him tantalizing glimpses of cleavage causing him to blush furiously some of them were older than harry including a few seventh years ginny was not amused and took to walking hand in hand with him between classes even if she could be late for her own class despite protests from harry that it wasntnecessary she would scowl at any other girl who approached harry aside from rose and hermione it all came to a head a few days after ron birthday during breakfast as the students were eating a great rush of wings announced the arrival of the delivery owls one owl delivered hermione subscription copy of the daily prophet oh my god hermione exclaimed when she got a look at the front page what is it hermione ginny asked hermione quickly folded the paper um oh it nothing she said hastily nothing of concern to you or harry ginny eyes narrowed i dontthink it nothing if that was your reaction hand the paper over granger or i ll make you hermione reluctantly handed the paper over to the redhead ginny took one look at the headline and shrieked this is the last straw she looked furious harry quickly grabbed the paper from his fuming girlfriend and took a look ron rose neville and ti all crowded together to read over his shoulder they all gasped at what they saw the headline was the boy who lived now the boy who plays the field there were several photos of harry with different girls harry face turned red as the moving pictures clearly showed the girls trying to get him to kiss them and placing their hands suggestively on him the photograph versions of harry looked stiff and embarrassed as he tried to disentangle himself from the girls then they read the main story which was by rita skeeter as they read the article the friends started feeling increasingly angry at skeeter how dare that woman insinuate that harry used dark spells to enter the tournament rose said with indignation in her voice she even says he using his standing in the tournament to get girls to go out with him hermione said hey neville exclaimed there are several quotes from female students his cheeks started to turn pink as he read them wow ron said they think harry is hot and sexy the amazement in his voice was evident that it ginny exclaimed getting up she pointed her wand to her throat and said sonorus all right you lot she said in her magically amplified voice to the rest of the student population get this once and for all you hussies i am harry potter girlfriend we love each other very much and intend to do so for the rest of our lives you d all better back offor the next female to cuddle up to harry besides me or his sisters will find out what the bat boogey hex is all about quietus ginny sat back down as the hall became silent wow rose whispered that was great ginny it about time your relationship is confirmed to this school harry turned to ginny and gave her a quick but fierce kiss thanks love i hope they leave me alone now they better or else ginny said looking around the great hall with a fierce look in her eyes i just wish you didntdo it like that hermione said a bit of worry in her voice you could get a detention for that harry looked up at the professor table and then said oh i dontknow about that hermione i doubt they were displeased except of course for snape the greasy git the others looked up at the head table sure enough excluding snape all the professors were either smirking or smiling even mcgonagall dumbledore had a benign smile on his face and the familiar twinkle in his eye moody even had a grin on his battered face only snape was scowling and looked like he wanted to get up and head for the gryffindor table however since only mcgonagall could discipline ginny for what she did and didntappear like she was going to he couldntdo a thing about the youngest weasley outburst against the rest of hogwart female population just then the bell rang signaling the end of breakfast and the impending start of classes for the day harry and ginny got up and headed for the door they noticed that only their friends stayed close to them the rest of the school kept their distance from them especially the females which suited harry quite nicely later that night ginny and rose were getting ready for bed when hermione entered their dormitory room and sat on ginny bed the redheads other roommates were already asleep uh ginny hermione said earlier at breakfast when you gave that ultimatum you said something about other females cuddling up to harry besides you or his sisters why did you use sister in the plural since only rose is here at hogwarts when i said sisters hermione i meant rose and you ginny said smiling at the older girl i know that harry has thought of you as a sister since the two of you became friends i just wanted to let you know that i do too hermione gaped at ginny for a moment then grabbed her in a fierce hug thank you ginny i ve always thought of harry as a brother hermione broke away from ginny and looked uncertainly at rose who had a smirk on her face um rose hermione said you dontmind my thinking of harry as a brother or him thinking of me as a sister now do you rose smiled as she sat down beside them of course not hermione i glad to have someone as an older sister mum is great and all that but i ve always wanted to have another girl a bit older than myself and ginny to talk to about stuff hermione grinned all right then i d be happy to be your older sister of course i not too knowledgeable on stuff like makeup and partying and boys that okay hermione rose said we can learn more of that stuff together speaking of boys ginny said how is it going between you and my brother you ve been dating now for two months yet you seldom hold hands hasnthe asked you to be his girlfriend yet when hermione face fell both redheads knew the answer was a negative what is wrong with that prat ginny said i mean why is he taking so long to ask you hermione shrugged i guess he needs time to get used to us being more than best friends i dontmind we seem to row much less these days something for which the rest of gryffindor tower is grateful for harry voice suddenly sounded in ginny mind harry stop eavesdropping on us like that this is girl talk go to sleep oh all right gin just let hermione and rose know that i love my sisters both natural and adopted oh i love you too night gin good night harry i love you too ginny ginny rose said waving her hand in front of ginny face when ginny looked at her she asked you and harry were talking again through your bond right ginny cheeks colored in embarrassment yeah he was listening in a bit dontworry i told him off and made him go to bed oh he did say that he loves both his sisters natural and adopted the three girls laughed at this well hermione said i have another reason for coming to see you and rose ginny ever since we saw dobby and the other house elves i ve been thinking of how unfair and horrible the wizarding world treats them i think it time that changes she reached into the pocket of her nightgown and pulled out what looked like badges similar to the ones hogwarts gave the prefects hermione ginny said what are those i ve decided to organize a club to campaign for the rights of house elves including putting a stop to their enslavement hermione said i calling the club the society for the protection of elvish welfare or s p e w these are badges for the members to wear i hoping that the two of you will be my first members ginny and rose exchanged surprised and anxious looks err hermione rose said i d be the first to agree with you that the house elves shouldntbe treated like slaves but it not as simple as having a club to get people to treat them better most house elves arentlike dobby or blinky and her family they really like being enslaved to a family and working for them with no pay or off time but that horrible hermione said how can anyone accept it like that that the way it been for centuries ginny said shrugging most families with house elves are rich and very old like the potters and the malfoys so they re very influential with the ministry my family may be purebloods but we arentas old or have anywhere near their money rose hermione said turning to the other redhead why hasntyour family done anything to remove the enslavement of house elves surely they could have done something like push for an emancipation law rose sighed i dontknow if it would have been that simple hermione as ginny said there are many wealthy pureblood families that have house elves and enjoy a large amount of influence in the ministry they d fight any law that freed house elves from their wizarding families since they like having servants they didnthave to pay then we really have to start with our generation hermione said we have to show them how cruel and wrong it is to enslave house elves that the main purpose why i organizing s p e w uh hermione rose said i dontknow if your club will attract many kids with a name like spew it s p e w rose hermione said indignation in her voice it not spew anyway the name doesntreally matter it the ideals of the club that will attract members both redheads sighed for an intelligent girl hermione could be so dumb sometimes in dealing with people they exchanged a look of agreement all right hermione ginny said we ll be your first two members however we want to think of another name for the club okay hermione looked like she was about to disagree but finally shrugged okay that fine now i was thinking of having our first meeting in hogsmeade during the next hogsmeade weekend that ll give us about two weeks to seek out new members i sure we can get your brothers to join she went on talking about her plans for the club not noticing that the two redheads had been a bit alarmed by her last statement ginny and rose exchanged worried glances how would they get their brothers to join hermione new brainchild maybe they had a chance with harry but ron would most likely prove to be nearly impossible even if it was the brainchild of the girl he was dating they sighed and decided to pay attention to hermione plans maybe they could inject a bit of reality into them hopefully two weeks would give them enough time to organize the club chapter 54 siblings first birthdays disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is the work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit a n i back so sorry for the long delay but i donthave as much time to write lately as i had when i started this story i do intend to finish it which will be in a few more chapters there will be a sequel which will cover harry fifth to seventh year and will include the final battle for now here the next chapter please read and review the next morning once harry was awake ginny talked to him mentally about hermione new project harry was not surprised that hermione would think of such a venture he reluctantly agreed to join the new club for the sake of his almost sister of course he asked ginny to make sure the name was changed and that she and rose ensure hermione didntoffend anyone with her enthusiasm when the new marauders meet for their morning jog which harry had decided to resume after the second task along with their martial arts sessions hermione took the opportunity to talk to the rest of the marauders about her club neville ti and maggie hesitantly agreed to be members while fred and george politely refused to join as expected ron refused to join and laughed at its name and purpose commenting that dragons would stop breathing fire before anyone paid attention to it rose and ginny glared at him hermione then refused to go with him on the next hogsmeade visit this surprised ron and he attempted to apologize but she simply stormed out of the common room she then avoided him for the rest of the day later that day ginny and rose managed to convince colin creevey and his brother dennis to be members though they felt guilty for using the muggleborn brothers ignorance of the issue controversy however they couldntget anyone else interested in the club the other students reacted with disgust astonishment or bewilderment to the purpose of the club hermione became exasperated with her lack of progress and called off her planned meeting for the meantime ginny and rose breathed a sigh of relief over this though they didntdare let hermione know they had already come up with a better name but hadnttold hermione yet the following day they all found out that it was a good thing that hermione had postponed her first club meeting artemis lily owl came with invitations to daisy and andrew potter first birthday the day that lily and james had chosen to celebrate coincided with the saturday of the next hogsmeade visit the party was set for three o clock that day the weasleys hermione neville maggie ti sirius sam turgis remus mcgonagall hagrid and dumbledore were all invited to celebrate that milestone all of the ones at hogwarts accepted the invitation the news excited harry and rose and they looked forward to going home for that as the days passed hermione continued to avoid ron including seating away from him in the classes they shared after a week of this ron asked for harry advice on how to approach hermione harry suggested that he send her something like flowers and a note of apology ron thought about it for a few minutes then asked to borrow hedwig the following morning hermione woke up to find a dozen red roses on her bedside desk with a long apology letter from ron after reading the note she finally accepted ron apology ron promised to join hermione club once it started up hermione then agreed to go with him to hogsmeade on the day before the hogsmeade visit ti finally received a reply from sirius about dobby sirius apologized for the late reply since he had been very busy with his auror duties he thought hiring dobby was a brilliant idea and said he would talk to dumbledore about it the next afternoon when they were all in potter manor he added that he hoped to have another bit of news that would please ti both harry and ti wondered what that meant the following day as soon as they had finished their breakfast harry and ginny got up from the gryffindor table so they could get to hogsmeade early they still had to get their presents for daisy and andrew neville rose ron and hermione soon joined them at the entrance hall doors hermione also needed to buy a birthday gift for her new brother daniel who would be celebrating his own first birthday in two weeks the six gryffindors were soon looking around the shops while they were in honeyduke s ron suggested getting harry and rose siblings some candy hermione reacted badly to that berating ron for attempting to ruin the babies teeth even before they had any rose gently reminded hermione that wizards and witches didntget cavities ron wondered to the others why hermione had reacted badly harry reminded ron that hermione parents were dentists and had probably raised hermione to avoid sweets ron just shrugged and bought some chocolate frogs for harry baby brother and sister neville bought some candy for his sister they found a store selling children clothes harry ginny and rose bought a jumper for each of the potter twins blue for andy and pink for daisy neville decided to buy a couple of pairs of baby booties in the same store hermione was delighted to find that a bookstore had just opened beside dervish and banges she found several books for babies and bought them all ron asked her why she got so many she told him that she was going give them only one each and save the rest for christmas a few minutes later they were standing in front of zonko when ron turned to hermione and asked hesitantly er hermione w w would you be my girlfriend hermione turned to him and eyed him for a couple of seconds before she smiled and said finally i ve been waiting for you to ask that since valentine day ron gaped and asked y you have yes ron i have she replied a smile still on her face took you long enough still my answer is yes i will be your girlfriend ron broke out in a grin and pulling her closer to him he kissed her on the lips hermione didntrespond and just stood there her eyes wide after ron had released her er mione ron asked concern in his voice what is it did i do it wrong hermione shook her head and smiled again no ron i was just surprised that all it was a nice kiss she leaned into him and whispered i d like to do it again just not in front of all these people ron turned around and his face turned as red as his hair as he saw several people staring at them including several of their classmates way to go weasley seamus shouted at him several other boys hooted and clapped beside them harry ginny rose and neville were grinning finally ron ginny said i was beginning to wonder about you yeah mate harry said clapping ron on the shoulder what took you so long well ron said shrugging his shoulders i wasntsure if hermione would say yes i never had a doubt she would ron harry said oh by the way ron since daniel is too young i ll be the one to pound you if you hurt her okay remember i consider her a sister just like rose ron gulped and said um yeah sure okay harry hermione grinned at harry then tentatively extended her hand towards ron who took it gently in his larger one they walked inside the joke shop with smiles on their faces followed by the other four after half an hour they walked over to the three broomsticks for lunch they found it packed with their classmates and other hogwarts students even a few of the durmstrang and beauxbatons students were there they were surprised to see viktor krum there with parvati since they couldntremember seeing them together before yet they seemed to be comfortably conversing unmindful of the rest of the crowd harry and the others joined colin luna melinda and lisa at a long table the younger students noticed ron and hermione holding hands causing them all to grin so he finally asked you to be his girlfriend hermione melinda asked when hermione smiled and nodded she added good took him long enough what does that mean ron asked has everyone been waiting for me to ask her yes ron colin said a grin also on his face i think the entire tower was waiting on you if you d taken longer maybe a betting pool would have started ron groaned and dropped his head on the table harry grinned and patted his shoulder that all right ron neville said at least you finally did oh you boys really hermione said her face red everyone else laughed after lunch they returned to the castle so they could get to potter manor early for the party they went to dumbledore office where they found maggie fred george and ti already waiting for them one by one they used the floo network to get to potter manor dumbledore mcgonagall and hagrid would follow them later james was in the living room when they arrived and greeted them warmly a few minutes later lily came in carrying daisy remus was behind her carrying andrew they set them down in a playpen set up in the living room daisy was dressed in a pink skirt and a white blouse while andrew was dressed in a light yellow shirt and pale blue shorts they both had white booties on harry noted that daisy black hair was not as wild as his and was braided into two plaits with a pink ribbon clipped to the right side of her head andrew red hair on the other hand was sticking out a bit in the back and a fringe covered part of his forehead the teens all gathered around the babies who stood up hanging on to the side of the playpen wide eyed on seeing all the people their eyes brightened as they saw their older brother and sister awee daisy cried throwing up her arms toward harry andrew did the same thing as he cried wose harry and rose exchanged wide eyed looks harry turned to his father hey dad when did the little tykes start to talk they were just saying nonsense words last christmas how do they know our names now james smiled they said their first word a few weeks ago it was mum then it was da a few days later since then your mum and i have been saying your names to them while pointing to a moving picture of you and rose actually it the first time they actually said them harry grinned that great dad i was afraid they may not know us since we ve been away at school yeah dad mum rose said that is awesome that a smart girl daisy harry said trying to lift her up oof you re getting really big and heavy your big brother can hardly lift you up anymore he gave her a big hug instead then did the same to andrew hi little brother you re getting big too ginny and hermione started trying to teach the twins their own names with little success after a few minutes most of the boys decided to go outside to have a game of quidditch dragging with them a reluctant harry who had wanted to spend some more time with his siblings harry ron and fred formed one team while george neville and ti formed the other since there were only three to a side they had two chasers and one keeper per team ron and neville doing the latter job surprisingly ti showed great skill as a chaser almost offsetting ron skill as a keeper after an hour during which only ten points separated the two teams ginny joined harry team while rose joined george team as chasers this allowed fred and george to revert to their favored roles as beaters though on opposite sides with the benefit of their ability to talk mentally harry and ginny managed to increase the lead of their team though rose and ti were able to get a few goals past ron after another hour lily called them down to the party which they were having on the porch there was a long table set up with two dozen seats including two high chairs at the head of the table dumbledore mcgonagall hagrid sirius and sam were already there saying their hellos to the birthday boy and girl as they were seating down they heard the floo activate in the living room a couple of minutes later molly and arthur came out onto the porch sorry we re late james lily arthur said we were waiting for percy ginny came up to her parents and gave them each a hug then she asked so where is he dad er arthur said looking a little nervous he had a spot of work to do at the ministry and extended his regrets that he couldntcome why that insensitive git ginny almost screamed out he working at the ministry today this is a family gathering how can he choose to work instead of being with his family her face was turning red with her anger the other weasley children looked just as mad harry reached out to her and placed his hand over hers it all right gin he said mentally to her no harry she answered back her mental voice filled with her anger it not all right we ve been close for years and have always celebrated birthdays and holidays together now with our bond we re even more one family you know that we weasleys consider family more important than anything percy should be able to set aside one day for that he going to regret this harry remained silent knowing he wouldntbe able to change ginny mind arthur then added that bill and charlie would also be unable to come since they couldntget any more time off from their jobs abroad much to their disappointment well lily said brightly that quite all right let just eat up there a nice cake waiting for our birthday boy and girl to blow its candles out they soon settled down to the meal conversations breaking out around the table once they were done blinky cleared the dishes and lily set the cake in front of her twins who looked wide eyed at it it was a large round cake with white frosting covering it and the words happy birthday andrew and daisy done in blue and pink over most of it a single large candle was set in the middle they sang happy birthday then helped the twins blow the candles out as they ate the cake they helped andy and daisy open their presents there was an assortment of clothes and toys lily and james thanked everyone for the gifts then sirius stood up from where he was seated beside sam we dontwant to upstage andrew and daisy but we have a bit of news he took sam hand in his and smiled down at her sam and i eloped last night and got married everyone looked surprised and shocked unable to say a word after a few seconds of silence sirius raised an eyebrow and said well i didntexpect such a reaction james shook himself out of his stupor walked up to his best friend and clapped him on the shoulder that great padfoot congratulations how d this happen sirius grinned well i realized after a couple of dates that i in love with sam i let her go once which was a terrible mistake so i made a decision to ask her to marry me i did it last night while we were taking a walk after dinner she said yes much to my surprise he looked down at sam who stood up and embraced sirius then she turned to the others i told him that i was in love with him already when we first dated sam said after he broke it off i tried so hard to forget him but couldn t then he asked me out a few weeks after these little tykes were born i tried to keep from falling in love with him again but did anyway anyway after he proposed we started to discuss when to have the wedding then it occurred to both of us that we really donthave any other family since both our parents are gone and i an only child plus sirius broke in she didntreally care about having a big ceremony so we snuck off to paris and got married there we came here straight from the hotel we spent the night in lily then moved forward to embrace sirius and sam in a warm hug congratulations you two we re so happy for you this broke the others out of their shock soon everyone was crowding around sirius and sam to offer their own congratulations however there was one person who didntcome near the two newlyweds someone who mattered to sirius just as much as the woman he had married ti stared at sirius and sam a look of surprise still on his face sirius was the first to see his expression he strode away from the group up to ti and knelt down beside the boy ti sirius said softly i know this is a shock and seems all of a sudden but we hoped you d be pleased i mean you seemed to like sam whenever the three of us were together i hoped that you d like to see her all the time i ve loved her for years ti i hope you ll come to love her just as much as i do it wontchange what we have you ll still live with us sam knows all about what you ve been through by this time sam had come up to them and sat down beside ti that true ti sam said as she smiled i know what sirius means to you and what you mean to sirius i wontcome between the two of you i do hope that you and i will become just as close so we can be a real family everyone else seemed to be holding their breath as ti looked at sirius and sam after a couple of seconds that seemed an eternity to sam and sirius ti smiled and threw his arms around both of them hugging them tightly of course i for it ti said to them drawing back from them he turned to sam grinning so sam do i have to call you aunt sam now sam grimaced for a second oh no you dontcall sirius uncle so let keep it to sam aunt sam makes me feel as old as professor dumbledore her eyes bulged as she caught sight of dumbledore oops sorry professor that quite all right mrs black dumbledore said a smile on his face sam smiled again i think i ll like being called that mrs samantha black everyone laughed harry and ginny felt happy that their friend was getting a new family to replace the one that had abandoned him one that will love him as much as he deserved the party soon wound down as the twins were falling asleep from eating all that food especially the cake sirius remembered to ask dumbledore about dobby and the headmaster was happy to let dobby go to work for ti and his new family the kids went back to hogwarts with dumbledore mcgonagall and hagrid feeling happy the easter holidays soon came which they spent in hogwarts on the last saturday of the easter holidays it was hermione brother who celebrated his first birthday this time only ron harry ginny and rose were invited because the party would have muggles present mostly relatives of the grangers the five gryffindors dressed in muggle clothing for the party they flooed from dumbledore office to the leaky cauldron in london after lunch then took a cab to hermione home hermione lived with her parents in a lovely two story house in the suburbs on the north side of london the house was painted in beige and light yellow with a brick red tiled roof mr and mrs granger met them at the entryway they were a bit surprised when hermione introduced ron as her boyfriend but didntsay anything ron looked nervous as he shook mr granger hand after that they went up to daniel room where the one year old was playing with a ball in his playpen his eyes lit up when he saw hermione hermione lifted him out of the playpen and set him down on the floor the five teenagers spent the next hour playing with him well hermione harry ginny and rose did but ron was more interested in the various muggle toys in the room like the various fisher price toys before they knew it hermione parents were calling them down since the majority of the guests had arrived hermione relatives were curious about hermione friends they had all been told that hermione went to an exclusive school for gifted children in scotland her four friends had to watch what they said fortunately everyone was more concerned with daniel and the party daniel seemed to enjoy his party happily tearing his presents open though he quickly lost interest in each one as something new caught his eye the five teenagers enjoyed the party food like the cake and ice cream finally the guests had all left leaving the grangers and the four wizarding children hermione mum invited them to stay for dinner which they gladly accepted dumbledore had given them his permission to return to hogwarts anytime they wanted as they ate mr and mrs granger asked harry ginny rose and ron many questions about growing up in the wizarding world like their education before hogwarts they were all home schooled by molly activities during holidays places they visited on vacations and how their homes worked after they had done with dessert mrs granger turned to hermione honey you introduced ron earlier as your boyfriend arentyou a bit young for that hermione cheeks turned pink mum we re just dating it isntlike we re engaged or something like that anyway he only asked me to be his girlfriend a couple of weeks ago we re taking things slowly ron suppressed a smirk at that statement the fact was that they had been snogging in broom closets over the past two weeks as often as they could get away with it the last time their hands had even done a bit of wandering but nothing major i see mr granger said all right dear just dontget carried away we dontwant to be grandparents yet i did notice that harry and ginny seemed to be very close to each other glad for the distraction from his relationship with hermione ron said oh yes mr granger they ve been going out for more than a year now hermione parents exchanged looks of surprise your parents are okay with this ron mr granger asked ron our parents are fine with it mr granger ginny answered harry and i have known each other for years and love each other very much we ll probably get married after i graduate from hogwarts er isntthat a bit young for marriage mrs granger asked it different in the wizarding world mrs granger rose replied wizards and witches are usually ready to go to work after graduating from hogwarts we can earn enough to support a family by then many of us do marry right after graduation our parents and ron and ginny parents did just that the grangers looked bewildered by that information but before they could say anything daniel started to cry oh dear mrs granger said i think he needs his diaper changed let me do it mum hermione said mrs granger smiled of course dear let get him up to his room she lifted daniel up from his high chair and carried him upstairs hermione following in her wake mr granger invited the others to wait for hermione in the living room however ginny and rose insisted on helping him clean up harry and ron reluctantly agreed to help over the protests of mr granger they cleared the table and washed the dishes the muggle way in spite of ron grumbling about it being like doing detention for filch when hermione returned mr granger insisted on driving them to the leaky cauldron it was a bit of a tight fit in the back of the granger car but they managed it once they arrived at the pub they said goodbye to hermione dad and entered the pub to floo back to hogwarts the following monday was the start of the summer term so they reluctantly returned their attention to their studies they did find it interesting that krum would often walk parvati to and from classes hermione said that she was relieved that the bulgarian boy had found someone else to bestow his affections on ron heartily agreed with her though he only said so when hermione wasntaround they got a break on the last saturday of april the 24th which was ti birthday unfortunately they couldntleave hogwarts anymore so they held his party in the tower at lunchtime harry ginny rose and maggie kept ti occupied by the lake while the others prepared the common room the surprised look on his face when he came through the portrait hole was immediately replaced by a huge grin that stayed in place for the rest of the party his friends gave him presents which they had bought during the last hogsmeade weekend the party carried on until nearly dinnertime when ron announced he was hungry again everyone shook their heads at that but decided to go to the great hall anyway the weeks passed quickly after that and harry was so swamped with work that he had forgotten about the triwizard tournament until mcgonagall approached him after transfiguration class in the last week of may mr potter she said you are to go down to the quidditch pitch at nine o clock tonight um what ever for professor harry asked bewildered he vaguely felt exasperation emanating from ginny mcgonagall looked sternly at him why for the information on the third task of course donttell me you ve forgotten about the tournament er of course not professor he answered i was starting to wonder about it lately very well she said mr bagman will be there to inform you and the other champions of the nature of the last task do not be late yes professor harry said i ll be on time he then walked out of the classroom harry ginny said in his mind once he was walking down the corridor i cantbelieve you forgot about the tournament well the professors have been working us hard gin harry replied to her mentally all that studying tends to require a lot of focus all right harry ginny said i do wonder what the third task will be about after the dragon and the lake what weird stuff has bagman and crouch come up with now well i ll be finding that out later gin harry said anyway right now i d rather think about seeing you at dinner and looking for a new place for us to snog in after my trip to the quidditch pitch ginny giggled my my mr potter you are incorrigible at least you have your priorities right i ll see you later at lunch then love all right gin harry replied as he felt ginny withdraw from his mind his thoughts turned back to wondering about the third task he also was curious about it why did he viktor and fleur have to meet bagman on the quidditch pitch that was very strange well he d find out tonight so there was no use in worrying over it anyway as he had told ginny he d prefer thinking about snogging her than the third task so with a smile on his face harry entered his next class and left thinking about the final task of the triwizard tournament to a later time chapter 55 the third task disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter daniel granger maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is part of the wonderful work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit later that night at fifteen minutes before nine harry left the gryffindor common room after giving ginny a quick kiss and walked through the grounds down to the quidditch stadium there he found that the pitch was now occupied by hedges arranged in a twisting pattern he met bagman viktor and fleur in the middle bagman quickly explained the task the hedges would grow within a month to form a maze the champions had to find their way through it to the other side where the judges would await them and award the first person out full points along the way they would face various obstacles including creatures provided by hagrid harry had inwardly groaned knowing full well what kind of creatures hagrid could provide after briefing them bagman suggested that they head back to the castle harry found himself walking side by side with viktor viktor gave harry a smile the two male champions had become friendlier over the last month since viktor started spending time with parvati in the library and on the grounds in addition to walking her to her classes they had even discussed quidditch at one time viktor had praised harry for his flying performance during the first task and suggested that harry should consider a professional quidditch career after hogwarts something he had not thought about before harry was intrigued with the idea but was afraid of his father reaction if harry decided to abandon becoming an auror so harry viktor said vot kind off creatures do you think ve vill face harry smiled well knowing hagrid they ll be a challenge he has an affection for the more um interesting ones i doubt we ll meet any flubber worms or pixies viktor raised an eyebrow at this but just nodded his head after a few seconds of silence harry asked so how are you and parvati getting along viktor stopped walking and eyed harry suspiciously vot is it to you harry raised his hands i dontmean anything viktor parvati a nice girl i just glad you found someone here to get together with after hermione um i sorry that didntwork out it is all right harry viktor said and shrugged his shoulders after the new year hermy own ninny didnttalk vit me as much as she did before the yule ball of course your red headed friend ron i believe you call him vos usually vit her scowling at me harry was surprised by that last bit about hermione and ron he hadntbeen aware that his two best friends had been spending more time with each other before their first date then again he had been spending most of his time with ginny but then viktor continued a smile forming on his face i met parvati two days after ve did the second task i remembered that she vos beautiful at the yule ball and that like hermy own ninny she vosntone of the girls following me all around hogwarts she is not as intelligent as hermy own ninny but that is all right i could not understand haff of vot hermy own ninny said anyvay harry grinned you re not alone there mate half of the time neither can we but that the way she is and we love her for it now that he had viktor attention harry decided to ask him something he needed to know about the older boy school though he was a bit hesitant and hoped he wouldntoffend krum um viktor harry said i hope you dontmind my asking but do they really teach you the dark arts at durmstrang if you dontwant to tell me just say so viktor eyed him shrewdly for a few seconds then said i guess there is no harm in telling you harry after vot happened in the second task i feel you vould be a good friend but to answer your vestion yes they teach us some of the dark arts at least they did until last year last year harry asked did they stop teaching them this year why let us move over near the voods harry viktor said this is something i do not think anyone else should know harry followed him back to the edge of the forbidden forest and felt ginny open her senses to him eager to listen in once they got there viktor spoke again you must understand harry that sometimes learning something helps one understand that thing and helps in learning to fight it that is van reason they teach the dark arts at durmstrang so ve can understand it in order to fight it better unfortunately the previous headmaster professor karkaroff had some of the darker and very dangerous spells taught to the older students spells that are better off forgotten he even let some dark magic rituals be taught rituals that involved human sacrifice in exchange for pover fortunately all of that stopped this year vhen professor propanov took over harry was stunned by what viktor had revealed and felt ginny own surprise i remember professor dumbledore saying that professor propanov had just been named your headmaster this year so what happened to karkaroff viktor shrugged he vanished from the school at the end of february no one knows vot exactly happened but it vos as if he had left in a hurry there vas no indication that anyting vas wrong the day before he disappeared but the following day his rooms vere in disarray and his clothes and most of his personal things vere missing i know ovur ministry and aurors haff tried to find him but as far as i know they haff not had any success now that is strange harry said so no one has any idea why he left or where he is yes viktor said i wonder if dumbledore knows something harry said anyway i d better get back to the castle my friends will want to know what the task is so vill mine viktor said smiling i vill be seeing you harry harry watched viktor walk down to the lake and the durmstrang ship for a few seconds then turned back toward the castle he knew ginny was telling hermione ron rose neville and ti about the third task but she refrained from telling them about karkaroff until he had given his permission to do so harry and ginny didntwant to break any trust harry had just formed with krum harry and his friends werentsure on what creatures hagrid might set in the maze but agreed that whatever they were they wouldntbe the docile kind the next day harry sent hedwig to his parents with a letter informing them of the nature of the task hedwig came back with a reply during lunch james asked harry to resume practicing the spells he had been taught over the summer as well as some spells that moody had taught in his dada class since most of them would be useful when he encountered any dangerous creatures in the maze practicing the spells he knew presented harry with a problem some of the spells could cause significant damage if done in an empty classroom he needed to find a place to practice where he wouldntbe disturbed even accidentally professor moody came up to him at the gryffindor table at the end of dinner potter i d like a word with you yes professor harry said he turned to ginny and said to her mentally i ll see you guys after this in the common room moody led harry to his office just above the dada classroom he bade harry to sit down in a chair in front of his desk while he sat down behind the desk moody detached his wooden leg and set it on a stand behind the desk before talking to harry so potter the ex auror began you now know what the third task is going to be about how are you going to prepare for it well professor harry said with hagrid providing the creatures who will be some of the obstacles it wontbe easy my dad and dumbledore taught me several spells over the summer that will be useful i already sent dad an owl telling him about the task and he advised me to practice the spells again along with some of the spells you ve taught in class good advice potter moody said a rare smile breaking out on his hard face your father has a good head on his shoulders though i know some people around here would disagree with me still he one of the best aurors i ve had the pleasure of training there no one else i d have as head auror uh professor harry said i haventhad the chance to ask you this i know it been so long but do you know how my name came to be in the goblet of fire moody scowled as he answered not exactly potter dumbledore let me check the goblet out after the choosing of the champions i couldntfind much except that it was touched by very dark magic that confirms what i ve suspected all along then harry said voldemort wanted me in this tournament most likely lad moody said nodding his head no one else would be willing to use such magic so you better be careful in that maze all right lad now you should get back to your common room so you can find that room you need to practice those spells harry nodded and thanked the ex auror later that night when the rest of gryffindor house had gone to bed he and the new marauders were at their usual place in front of the fireplace in the common room they studied the marauder map for almost an hour but couldntfind a proper room on it for harry purpose harry rose finally said you do remember that the chamber of secrets never appeared on the map two years ago right her gaze momentarily shifted to ginny with an apologetic expression for mentioning the chamber there may be other rooms like that in hogwarts places that most people dontknow about you can practice your spells in such a place without anyone coming upon you that a brilliant suggestion rose harry said but there is just one problem how do we find such a room harry ginny said in his mind do you think the house elves may know of such a room probably gin he replied mentally to her i sure they know every inch of the castle but how do we ask them of course i know who to ask he turned to ti uh ti could you call dobby over here for a second even though dumbledore had allowed dobby to work for sirius and ti sirius had decided to let dobby stay in hogwarts until the end of the school term to be close to ti so dobby was still in the castle uh sure harry okay ti replied a bit puzzled but he turned his face toward the ceiling and said loudly dobby please come here a second later the exuberant house elf appeared within the circle of friends master ti called dobby what can dobby do for good master ti his face turning a bit red ti said uh it not me harry wants to talk with you dobby eyes widened the great harry potter wants to talk with dobby ohhhh what can dobby do for the great harry potter harry felt his own cheeks burning as the house elf started fawning over him er i just have a question dobby um you ve been working in the castle for the past year well we need a room that we can practice spell work in a place where we wontbe disturbed by any student or professor dobby face screwed up for a moment as he thought i know of a place harry potter the other house elves call it the come and go room or the room of requirement why is it called that dobby hermione asked well miss grangee dobby said the room only comes when someone really needs it he has to be thinking hard of what he wants the room for when he is done with the room the room vanishes great dobby harry said smiling that perfect where is it and how do you get in it on the same floor as the entrance to this tower harry potter sir dobby answered in a corridor with a large window at one end and a man sized vase at the other end the door is across from a tapestry of a strange looking wizard who seems to be dancing with trolls but the door only appears if you walk past it three times while thinking of what kind of room you need i ll check it out right now harry said getting up i just get my invisibility cloak he turned to ginny want to come with me gin he asked her mentally ginny grinned of course harry hey ron said are you two talking with your minds again i know i hate it when you do that it usually means you re planning a snogging session somewhere ginny glared at him then pulled harry towards her by the front of his robes and gave him a very forceful kiss on the lips ron rolled his eyes never mind i guess you ll snog wherever you want very good brother ginny said of course i think you and hermione would do the same ron and hermione turned red at this statement harry came back with his invisibility cloak he and ginny then disappeared under it neville opened the portrait hole so they could get out once outside the tower they walked down the corridors on that floor looking for the tapestry dobby mentioned they found the corridor dobby had described with a man sized vase at one end and a large window at the other end harry ginny said look in the middle of the corridor that appears to be a tapestry they moved closer and found that it was a very large moving tapestry of a wizard and some trolls uh ginny harry said mentally am i seeing things or is that man actually in tights and dancing ballet in front of the trolls no love you arentimagining things he really is pirouetting around those trolls there a faded plaque underneath it it says barnabas the barmy and his misguided attempt to teach ballet to some trolls yes this must be the right tapestry now where is the door the opposite wall is blank remember what dobby said gin the door only appears if you walk three times past it thinking of what kind of room you want let try it harry started pacing in front of the blank wall thinking i want a room to practice spells in over and over again as he passed the blank wall the third time an ornate door appeared in the wall harry pulled the door open and he and ginny entered the room they gasped in awe at what they saw the room looked like a duplicate of the duel practice room at potter manor with its slate floor covered in mattresses and stone walls it was so close that harry thought that if he stepped out of the door now he d see the third floor hallway of his family home harry grinned at ginny this is brilliant gin i could really work in here we can work in here harry dontforget you promised earlier this year that the new marauders would learn the spells james has been teaching you oh yeah i sorry i forgot gin what with the tournament and school ginny gave him a swift kiss dontworry about it harry you can show it to us as you practice for the third task we can practice them together this summer maybe we can use this room next year yeah you re right we can um we better get back before ron thinks we re doing more than snogging oh all right harry ginny pouted just one minute she reached up to the back of harry head and pulled him down for a searing kiss that lasted more than a minute and left him dazed there now we can go back she giggled at his glazed expression witch harry said playfully as they left and headed back to the common room still under the invisibility cloak after that harry came back to the room with ginny every evening for an hour or two to practice his spell casting the others came with them as often as they could but with final exams fast approaching they stopped coming with them finally after two and a half weeks harry had to stop practicing so he could also study for the finals he was now regretful that he had refused the exam exemption he was entitled to as a triwizard champion fortunately several days and nights of hard studying including the weekend allowed him to catch up the week of exams passed quickly with his last exam held on the day before the third task harry hoped he had passed all his exams as he went to bed that night he wouldntwant to have survived the tournament only to fail in school harry was awakened the next day by a gentle mental nudge from ginny harry love wake up you need to have a good breakfast for this but the task isntuntil tonight gin he grumbled back at her i know harry but remember that dumbledore said yesterday that the champions families had been invited to watch the task and would be here after breakfast harry shot out of his bed like a cannon ball eager to see his parents he hoped that they d bring daisy and andrew but thought that they d probably leave them with the weasleys after a quick shower he met ginny in the common room and they headed for the great hall once they were at the gryffindor table harry found himself picking at his food in his nervousness over the task ginny sensed his mood and squeezed his hand gently under the table relax harry she said to him in his mind you ll do fine you ve practiced those spells enough to do them in your sleep i know gin i just cantstand the waiting ginny started running her fingers gently over his knuckles this calmed harry down and he dug into his food as he drank the last of his pumpkin juice mcgonagall approached him and said potter the champions families are waiting in the side room to the great hall harry nodded to her he turned and saw the other champions get up from their places and walk toward the door to the side room where they had first gathered after the goblet of fire had chosen them as he got up from the table harry gave ginny a quick kiss on the lip and rose a peck on the cheek to wish them luck they still had one exam that morning so they couldntgo with him now harry entered the side room he saw fleur to one side talking to an older and more stunning version of herself with gabrielle holding the woman hand viktor was on the other side conversing with the woman he had rescued from the dragon during the first task and an older man whom harry assumed was his father harry looked around the room for his parents and was surprised by whom he saw near the fireplace not only were his parents there but so were molly arthur and bill he felt ginny pause momentarily at the door of her classroom as she saw her parents and brother through harry eyes harry walked up to his parents and hugged them both sirius and sam are babysitting the twins harry james said remus couldntcome for the meeting but promises to be there this evening that okay dad harry said i was hoping to see daisy and andy but i guess they arentready yet for hogwarts he then turned to the weasleys i so glad you guys are here harry said to them smiling ginny ron fred and george will be glad to see you we re glad to be here harry dear molly whispered as she hugged him after all we have to support our future son in law harry grinned at that and felt ginny own elation over her mother statement harry then shook hands with arthur and bill he turned to the oldest weasley brother i thought you couldntget off work in egypt anymore i wouldntif i was still working there bill said but gringott decided it needed a crack cursebreaker here starting next month so i was able to get a little headstart on moving back here that great harry said grinning just then fleur came up to them with a smile on her face oh arry iz theez your family the part veela asked harry returned her smile yes fleur you saw my dad and mum after the second task these are ginny parents molly and arthur and her eldest brother bill fleur greeted them shaking their hands it seemed her smile brightened a bit as she shook bill hand harry noticed bill following her with his eyes as she walked back to her mother and sister a strange look on her face harry caught bill eyes with his own and raised an eyebrow bill shrugged and said hey she beautiful all right harry just shook his head he led them out of the side room and the great hall out into the grounds they spent the morning walking around listening to tales of the older ones of their time in hogwarts molly and arthur were fascinated by the whomping willow which had been planted after their time especially since they knew the reason why it had been planted they returned to the great hall for lunch ginny and rose greeted their parents with hugs and the potters and weasleys settled down to eat together at the gryffindor table harry felt like it was another one of their family gatherings again erasing his worries of the coming task after lunch they took another long walk around the grounds this time accompanied by the rest of the new marauders neville was intrigued by a few stories about his parents from james and lily evening soon arrived and they made their way back to the great hall james lily molly arthur and bill again sat at the gryffindor table harry nervousness returned as they had a dinner of several courses ginny did her best to comfort and calm him down finally dumbledore rose from the high table where the staff and all the judges were seated the headmaster cleared his throat and did a sonorous spell ladies and gentlemen in five minutes we will go down to the quidditch pitch for the last task of the triwizard tournament in the meantime i d like the three champions to please follow mr bagman down to the stadium for some last minute instructions james turned to harry and gave him a big hug good luck son remember i wontthink any less of you if you dontwin just be careful okay harry returned the hug willingly not minding any stares from the other students thanks dad i ll try merlin knows i ve practiced those spells enough to do them in my sleep harry fleur and viktor walked in silence behind bagman down to the quidditch pitch harry went through the spells he had been practicing in his mind as his nerves continued to plague him as they approached the pitch they noted with apprehension that the edge was surrounded by a twenty foot high hedge there was a break in the hedge forming the entrance to the maze the passage beyond it looked foreboding and menacing soon the stands of the stadium filled up with students harry saw his family and friends take their seats at the top of the stands ginny sat between molly and lily with bill to molly left rose was on her mother right and james to her right remus was sitting at james right with ron hermione the twins ti and neville to their right harry wondered why they were so far up in the stands but dismissed that thought as he felt calming and soothing thoughts coming to him from ginny easing his nervousness professor mcgonagall came through the stadium entrance with hagrid professor moody and professor flitwick and informed the champions that they would be patrolling the edge of the maze in case of an emergency a blast of red sparks into the air would be the signal in that case bagman gave a speech that recapped the champions standings and the order in which they would enter the maze harry first followed by viktor after five minutes then by fleur after another five minutes bagman then blew on his whistle signaling to harry that he should enter the maze harry took a deep breath and strode forward into the dark passageway he noticed that the noise from the crowd had vanished harry drew his wand and said lumos about fifty yards into the maze the path split into two harry decided to go to the left then he heard bagman whistle in the distance signaling viktor entry into the maze harry picked up his pace the path started to turn left and then right every ten feet he came to another fork he muttered point me as he held his wand flat on his palm the wand spun once then pointed to his right through solid hedge if that was north he needed to go toward the east where the exit was located harry turned left then as he came around the corner he saw a ten foot long creature that resembled a very pale and slimy looking deformed scorpion with its long stinger hanging over its back it was about twenty feet in front of him bugger he muttered one of hagrid blast ended skrewts it was larger than any of the ones had tended with armor all over it just then sparks flew from the creature end and it sped toward him harry yelled impedimenta but the spell bounced off its armored shell stupefy he yelled but the spell again rebounded off the creature hide concentrating hard he again yelled impedimenta this time the spell slowed it down a bit harry dodged a spark that flew at him impedimenta he yelled again the skrewt stopped moving this time knowing the spell wouldntlast long harry immediately ran back the way he had come and took the other path after ten more feet the path turned again harry eyes widened as he came around the corner twenty feet in front of him was a large mountain troll even bigger than the one he ron and hermione had fought in their first year he felt a surge of fear from ginny that doubled his own the troll advanced on him lifting its club above its head roaring loudly harry tried a stinging hex but it bounce off its skin then it was upon him swinging the club down harry dodged to his left and felt the rush of air as the club smashed into the ground beside him he sent a slashing curse at it causing a bleeding wound on its chest the troll roared and swung its club at harry head harry dropped into a roll and came up behind the troll he sent another slashing curse at its back which didnteven cause it to pause as it spun around the troll swung its club again this time as harry dodged the club managed to clip him on his left shoulder pushing him down to the ground harry immediately rolled away and felt the club smash into spot he had just been in he felt ginny alarm and fear increase dramatically harry he heard her call through their bond try doing what ron did to that troll in your first year harry jumped to his feet and shouted wingardium leviosa as he pointed his wand at the troll club the club was wrenched from the troll hand harry maneuvered it above the creature head as it stared in confusion at the levitating weapon then harry cancelled the spell and it dropped down on the troll head before landing on the ground the massive creature bent down to pick it then it toppled over and lay still harry backed away from it slowly in case it woke up before he had gotten far harry turned around only when he felt the hedge at his back he then ran to put more distance between him and the troll the path was much darker now as the sky had turned grey and then black with the approach of night harry did the four point spell again he took a left at the next fork followed a right then as he turned the corner he saw a dementor coming at him harry felt the clammy coldness as the twelve foot high creature advanced on him he summoned the happiest thoughts he could think of concentrating on his memories of his parents and ginny thinking about celebrating with them after the tournament was over expecto patronum he bellowed and a very bright silver stag flew out of his wand it charged the dementor and it fell back the silver stag charged again and rammed right into the dementor causing it to dissipate with a horrible eerie shriek harry eyes widened and he felt ginny shock as well they had never heard of a patronus dissolving a dementor before wow harry what happened ginny asked in his mind i i i dontknow gin he replied it just disappeared instead of running away i ll ask dumbledore about it after this is over i better get moving now donttell anyone yet about this not even my parents all right harry just be careful i love you i will ginny i love you too harry continued down the path he turned left then right then left again suddenly a scream cut through the silence fleur harry shouted what had happened to her the scream seemed to come from his right and not far away harry ran in the direction of the scream he was running so fast that before he knew it he was plunging into a strange mist then the world turned upside down his feet seemed to somehow be stuck to the grass which was now the ceiling the endless sky was below him and he had the sensation of falling into that blackness illuminated by countless stars his glasses were on the edge of his nose and harry pushed them back up the bridge of his nose in the back of his mind he felt ginny amusement at his predicament ha ha right go on and laugh at me ginevra he said to her mentally i sorry harry but i can just imagine how you look right now if i was there beside you very funny now let me think about a way out of this i ve never heard of an anti gravity spell before how do i counteract this as he felt the blood rush down to his head harry went through the spells and hexes he had learned from his father dumbledore and moody none of them seemed to apply to this situation until he remembered a spell dumbledore had taught him and ginny which was useful for removing toxic gases from the vicinity aero purgo he yelled a strong gust of wind blew through the area dissipating the golden mist harry then fell to his knees breathing deeply to clear his head harry shakily got to his feet a few more deep breaths and he strode forward again he couldnthear any more screams he was sure it was fleur and wondered again what had happened we re not sure either harry ginny said in his mind there were no red sparks so we can only assume she all right by the way your dad is proud of the way you dealt with that anti gravity mist he says it a novel use for that spell err you ve told them about that part he asked her yes harry i ve been keeping them updated on your progress that the reason we re so far up in the stands we dontwant anyone to overhear me and wonder how i know what happening to you all right ginny thanks for doing that i know i d be going out of my mind if you were in my place and i could only watch and wait you re welcome love now get on with it and get to that exit first yes ma am harry said to her grinning at her commanding tone which sounded a lot like her mother harry came to another fork he did the four point spell again which pointed to his left so he turned left and found himself at a dead end he backtracked to the fork and turned right even if it took him away from the edge he came to a dead end twice more forcing him to backtrack again then as he stepped into another path he saw a huge shadow in front of him it was a huge acromantula before he could fire a spell it lunged at him harry dodged to one side and rolled forward under the beast he came up behind it and got to his feet impedimenta he yelled the beam of his spell hit the beast pushing it back slightly the spider gave its head a shake and scuttled up toward him harry sent another impediment spell which didntslow it down one bit he then tried a jelly legs curse but got only the rear legs which barely impeded its movement he sent a cutting curse at its body which dug deeply into it momentarily stunning it harry turned to run he had gotten only a few feet when he felt something sticky hit his feet and he went down he looked at his feet and found them surrounded by webs the spider advanced menacingly toward him harry tried to rip the webs apart but they were too sticky then the spider was upon him pushing him to the ground with two of its feet and pinning his upper arms its pincers came down toward him clicking together harry dodged with his upper body to the left then to the right the spider then used two more legs to pin his shoulders harry could see the greenish glint of the poison on its large fangs as they descended toward him harry managed to raise his hand slightly and aimed at the spider belly as the fangs hovered mere inches from his face reducto the spider flew off of him and landed with a crash on the hedge twenty feet away harry frantically attempted to tear the webs on his feet again he was aware of ginny panic and distress in the back of his mind but couldntallow that to distract him finally he said incendio and flames appeared in the webs burning them away as soon as he could harry got to his feet and stamped around to put out the flames before they consumed his trainers he saw the spider getting on its feet again he sent a cutting curse at one of its legs which was severed from its body he sent five more at different legs reducing its movement significantly finally he yelled stupefy twice in rapid succession and was rewarded by the sight of the spider falling unconsciousness he leaned back against the hedge for a few moments catching his breath his shoulders were aching from the pressure of the spider in addition to the bruise caused by the troll club earlier he was dimly aware that ginny was now sobbing against her mother shh it all right gin i fine now no you re not your shoulders are aching and you re exhausted harry i ll be okay in a minute i just need to catch my breath from the looks of it i near the other side now ginny sniffed and stopped crying i sorry harry for being so girly i canthelp it when i saw those fangs coming down toward you i thought i was going to lose you that wonthappen ginny i wontlet it especially in this tournament okay i better get moving see you in a bit harry started walking again finally he saw a light at the end of path twenty feet ahead was the break in the outer hedge which was the exit from the maze he could barely make out the five judges standing beyond he stepped out into an open space just short of the exit at the same time fleur came out of a path to his left and viktor came into view on his right both looked a bit disheveled but not as bad as harry probably looked viktor gave a low whistle vot happened to you harry you look like hell harry shrugged i ran into a few of those obstacles like a dementor a troll an acromantula and a mist that turned me upside down it got a bit hairy there for a while especially with the spider but i got through what did you guys meet i only met a couple of things viktor said a boggart and the large spider mostly it was just all the twists and turns of the path that delayed me it waz ze same with me fleur said i found zis sphinx which gave me a riddle to solve zen the boggart and a dementor but ozer zan zat i got lost a bit that just my luck harry said smiling i ran into more things than you two did i had to be the one to do a lot of spells it a good thing i practiced a lot over the last few weeks he paused and looked toward the exit so how do you guys want to do this shall ve race viktor asked no fleur said why dontwe jez walk out togezer we came out here at the same time i agree viktor said it is only fair but guys harry said if we do it that way i ll win since i have the most points so vot harry viktor said it doesntmatter anymore doing what is right and fair is more important we came out from the main maze at the same time i agree vit viktor arry fleur said we have become friends of a sort during zis tournament zat iz more important zan any old trophy harry sighed then smiled i see i not going to change your minds on this okay let link arms then and walk out together the three champions linked arms fleur in the middle of the two boys and strode forward through the exit harry edged back a bit as they crossed the opening into the brightly lit area in front of the stands wild cheering and applause greeted them the judges faces showed different reactions to the outcome madame maxime and propanov both had frowns on their faces the latter with more of a scowl dumbledore face looked calm and impassive thought the familiar twinkle could be seen in his eyes bagman looked confused but the strangest reaction was seen on mr crouch face he seemed furious and upset at the same time bagman got up slowly and said well we have bit of a dilemma here it seems our three champions have exited the maze at the same time we have to decide whether to split the points evenly or give them all full marks judges we better confer at the side he led them off toward a spot at the side of the stadium before joining them dumbledore approached the three champions and conjured three comfortable chairs please sit down you three looked tired already thank you professor all three replied they all sat down and relaxed they could see their friends fidgeting in their seats anxious to join them after twenty minutes the judges came back bagman looked a bit uneasy while crouch looked calm dumbledore was smiling while propanov and madame maxime had neutral expressions on their faces sonorus bagman said ladies and gentlemen as you have probably guessed with all three champions coming out of the maze at the same time we have a problem as to how much points to award to each however we have viewed several angles of the action it appears that as they exited the maze harry potter and viktor krum allowed miss delacour to precede them and mr potter allowed mr krum to precede him as such the points awarded are the following to ms delacour 50 points to mr krum 49 poins and finally mr potter is awarded 48 points tallying the totals together we have a three way tie at the end of the tournament we therefore declare all three as co champions a loud cheer rose in the air from the students of all three schools we will have the awarding ceremony here right now bagman continued the 10 000 galleon prize money will be split between the three of them and each school will receive the honor of having a replica of the triwizard cup in their respective awards cabinet for now each champion will have the privilege of holding up the real cup for their schoolmates to see has asked for the honor of handing the cup to each champion bagman had the three champions line up with fleur immediately to crouch right followed by viktor and then harry crouch handed fleur the cup and she raised it up the other students from beauxbatons clapped and cheered crouch did the same with viktor and the students from durmstrang also cheered a few of them very loudly finally crouch came up to harry ah mr potter our youngest champion he handed the cup to harry but didntlet go i know someone who would like to congratulate your win morsmorde in that instant harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel oh no a portkey he thought he found that he couldntlet go of the cup which was pulling him onward in a swirl of colors and howling wind he gulped and wondered where he and crouch were going a n well i back with the next chapter sorry for the long delay but it not easy finding time to write lately i hope you guys liked this chapter especially the spell i made up to clear the strange mist anyway please r r rest assured that i working on the next one chapter 56 confrontation disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter daniel granger maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is part of the wonderful work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit on the quidditch pitch of hogwarts chaos erupted as harry and mr crouch vanished before everyone eyes screams and cries erupted from the stands the weasleys and potters all jumped to their feet james and remus leaped to the stairs and descended two steps at a time when they got to the judges dumbledore was waving his wand over the spot harry and mr crouch had been standing in mad eye moody at his side what the bloody hell happened albus james yelled where did crouch take my son dumbledore sighed i dontknow james all we are sure of is that the cup was some sort of portkey who knows where it took them one thing for sure moody said waving his own wand over the area it didnttake them anywhere within a hundred miles of here the portkey detection spell cantfind them this was a spell the aurors used to detect the destination of a portkey but it only had a limited range why did crouch do that remus asked what purpose would he have for taking harry did you hear what he said to activate the cup portkey moody asked it was morsmorde the incantation for conjuring the dark mark i ll bet he took him to voldemort james and remus paled they heard some noise behind them and turned to find the rest of their families approaching them albus lily shouted as she came up to the headmaster this is the last straw you said there was no way harry could get into this bloody tournament then you said he d be safe during the tasks even if he faced dragons grindylows trolls and acromatulas now my son has disappeared from right in front of you lily was now trembling as she stood in front of dumbledore waving her wand and screaming you get him back albus or i ll hex you so bad minerva will need to take over the school lily suddenly turned to james who had come up behind her and collapsed sobbing into his arms how the hell are we going to find him albus james demanded as he held on to his crying wife dumbledore sighed he d been silent through lily tirade as he thought about the situation there is one way have you forgotten that your son has a bond with a pretty little redhead ginny james cried of course they can see through each other eyes he turned around to the mentioned girl he felt a wrench in his heart as he saw the pale and tear streaked face of his son soul mate he knelt down in front of her ginny james said softly you can see through harry eyes can you tell us where he is ginny shook her head tears continuing to flow down her cheeks n n no james i think he been stunned i felt the pull of the portkey through harry but as soon as his feet hit the ground his vision went black i haventbeen able to talk to him since james paled and he took a deep breath as he asked something he dreaded to hear the answer of but he is alive right ginny nodded jerkily yes i can feel him but he just unconscious and seems so far away james blew out a breath he had been holding he turned towards dumbledore now what albus what do we do dumbledore sighed again there isntmuch we can do james until we know where he is we cantapparate all over britain looking for him we ll have to wait for him to awaken so ginny can find out where he is in that case james said i d better contact sirius he ll want to help us he looked down at lily who was still sobbing within his arms lils i have to go tell sirius what happened he ll be able to help once we find out where harry is lily nodded jerkily and stepped away from him come with me james moody said my fireplace is secure enough for you to contact sirius james thanked his former mentor and the two men walked briskly towards castle dumbledore turned to mcgonagall minerva i think it is best if we send the students and the rest of the staff back to the castle please attend to it mcgonagall nodded and turned to address the students lily turned away from her and looked around at the remaining people milling about the pitch madame maxime was off to the side talking with hagrid propanov was still sitting at the judges table looking uninterested molly was holding ginny tightly tears of her own flowing down her cheeks while arthur stood behind her his arms encircling his wife and daughter bill was standing with his twin brothers to one side talking with fleur and viktor krum ron was awkwardly holding hermione in his arms looks of concern on their faces rose was standing alone with a dazed look on her face lily walked up to her daughter rose dear are you all right rose shook her head violently from side to side then burst into tears shh lily said as she embraced rose tightly it going to be all right we ll find harry and get him back in their worry over harry the group barely noticed the rest of the students leave the pitch ginny did notice dumbledore talk for a moment with professor snape who was rubbing his left arm before the potions master left in the direction of hogsmeade ginny found this a bit strange but her worry over harry pushed it out of her mind madame pomfrey came over to take the other two champions to the hospital wing to patch up from their various bruises and injuries sustained during the task fleur and viktor promised to be back for any news on harry the remaining people stayed where they were fretting over harry in their own way after a few minutes of being comforted by her mother rose said i ve failed my brother her voice was slightly muffled since her face was pressed against her mother neck she was already almost as tall as lily whatever makes you say that rose lily inquired still holding her tightly against her i didntsee any of this happening mum she replied i saw the dragon and the squid even bits about the ball but i didnthave any vision of harry being whisked away what use is my being a seer if i cantsee something like this before it happens oh my dear lily said tightening her embrace right now your ability to see the future is not something you can turn on and off it may come at any time you cantcontrol when the visions come to you she gently lifted rose chin with one forefinger so she could look into her eyes dontblame yourself for this just because you had no warning it would happen the ones responsible are crouch and whoever had him take harry away not you after a few moments rose nodded and leaned her head again against lily neck suddenly ginny moved out of her mother arms something different i think harry starting to wake up she closed her eyes and concentrated on talking to harry in her mind harry she called out to him in his mind harry please wake up oh please we need to find out where you are slowly ginny felt him arouse gin he answered her in her mind groggily what happened what going on you ve been kidnapped by mr crouch harry ginny said he used the triwizard cup as a portkey open your eyes love we need to see where you are so we can come and get you as harry opened his eyes ginny saw through them mr crouch was standing with his back to harry in front of a small fire pointing his wand to his left arm harry tried to move but found that he was tied tightly in a standing position to a large headstone he could still move his head a bit and took the opportunity to take a look around they appeared to be in a dark old graveyard judging from the worn headstones and untended grounds the dark outline of a small church could be seen over to the right and a hill to the left the mountains surrounding hogwarts were absent leading him to believe that the graveyard was hundreds of miles from the school harry felt a chill run up his spine as he recognized the place gin this is where i saw lucius malfoy and that other man with madame bones that night after our first valentine date this is the graveyard where they brought voldemort back tell dumbledore it where riddle father is buried as he felt ginny tell the people around her where he was harry turned his attention back to mr crouch what the bloody hell is going on where are we why have you brought me here harry scar suddenly exploded in a searing pain that was the worst he had ever felt he felt ginny gasp as she felt a twinge of the pain through their bond a high cold voice from behind him answered harry a voice he had only heard before in his nightmares you are here on my orders harry potter through his pain he heard mr crouch say m m my lord well barty the same voice said becoming louder as the speaker drew closer you have finally done something right i must welcome our guest the pain in harry scar subsided to a bearable throbbing as a figure in black robes came into harry line of sight his face shrouded by a hood and stopped in front of mr crouch the man lifted long slender fingers to pull the hood down revealing his face harry gasped involuntarily at the sight of face and felt ginny gasp as well it was a face harry had seen only in his nightmares a face whiter than a skull with wide scarlet eyes and a nose as flat as a snake with slits for nostrils the face of lord voldemort dimly through the haze of pain harry was aware of other robed figures nearby figures wearing white masks he couldnttell how many there were voldemort smiled evilly as he looked at harry bound form finally harry potter we meet again face to face it been so long since that night we first met i see you have grown to look like your father though i believe you have your mother eyes and how are they i should have killed them that night but i was more interested in you but it doesntdo to regret past mistakes now that i am whole i aim to correct those mistakes but that is for later right now it is you who i am interested in harry gritted his teeth as the pain in his scar increased in intensity he could feel ginny anger directed at the man who had been the boy who had tormented her in her first year through the diary now as to where we are voldemort continued his voice low so only harry could hear him this is the graveyard where my mother is buried and where my father he said the word with contempt is also buried in fact you are tied to his tombstone in death he has served me as well as the one who brought you to me voldemort turned to mr crouch who now looked a bit different to harry harry eyes widened as mr crouch face changed to a much younger version with a maniacal look in his eyes it was the face of the other man from his dream two years before the man who had helped lucius malfoy bring voldemort back voldemort laughed at the look on harry face a cold and very evil laugh surprised harry let me introduce you to my faithful servant barty crouch jr using polyjuice he was able to impersonate his father and enchant the goblet of fire with a lovely dark spell i found which made sure your name came out as the hogwarts champion and as to why you are here well there are two reasons why i wanted you here the first reason is tied to the reason why i tried to kill you all those years ago voldemort leaned closer to harry as he spoke softly again you see harry there was a prophecy made before you were born one i believe was talking about you and me one of my death eaters happened to hear part of it unfortunately he was chased away before he heard the whole thing i want to know the rest of it i think that old fool dumbledore may have told you about it by now if so then i intend take it from your mind when ginny heard voldemort words she ran up to dumbledore professor tom with harry he going to try to get the prophecy from harry mind dumbledore frowned i see that would not be good let us hope he remembers what i have taught him in our lessons on occlumency have no fear my dear we ll get him back when he noted the pained look on her face his frown deepened is there something else it seems you re in pain ginny voice was breaking and tears were flowing down her cheeks as she answered his scar is burning again professor with voldemort so close to him it like it on fire i can feel it a bit through our bond suddenly she fell to her knees clutching her head he trying to break into harry mind voldemort trying to get inside his head it like one of those huge trucks the muggles drive around trying to smash its way in arthur and molly rushed to their daughter side molly pulled ginny into her arms cradling her just then james came running up with sirius remus and moody what is it james asked when he saw the scene what happened what wrong with ginny i afraid voldemort is using a very brutal form of legilimency on harry and ginny is feeling it through their bond dumbledore answered in a very low voice we must hurry james i coming with you arthur said getting up from his place beside molly and ginny arthur no molly cried as she continued to hug ginny tightly i need to go molly arthur said gently there no way i staying here while my future son in law is in danger ginny lifted her head up to look at her father with a trembling smile all right arthur james said giving him a brief smile just stay with remus behind me sirius and mad eye you re not trained for something like this i want to come too dad ginny said gently pushing her mother aside and getting up no her mother cried you cantgo ginny it too dangerous ginny whirled on her dangerous mum i dontcare harry is out there with voldemort like dad said there no way i staying here while my soulmate and future husband is fighting for his life everyone stared at her silently with various reactions ranging from concern surprise amusement and pride dumbledore broke the silence as he said i sorry ginevra but i cantallow you to come with us please professor ginny begged ignoring his use of her hated given name i cantstay here not while i can feel everything he going through i can help from what i could see through harry voldemort has got some of his death eaters with him you could use another wand i was with harry for the past four weeks when he was training for the task and i know all the spells he trained with i cantsit here waiting please let me come with you dumbledore sighed and looked at her parents molly was shaking her head tears starting to flow down her cheeks arthur sighed and turned to molly placing his hands gently on her shoulder he talked to her softly for a few moments she glanced at ginny for a moment then looked at the ground she gave a barely noticeable nod of her head then buried her head in her hands sobbing arthur embraced her tightly for a few seconds then released her i coming as well bill said coming up to stand beside his father you may have need of a good cursebreaker glad to have you aboard bill james said the other teens then started asking to come along especially ron hermione and rose no dumbledore said none of you know as many spells as ginevra does please remain here we will be back shortly with harry safe and sound seeing the teens subside he turned to the others who would be part of the rescue team as he drew a long ruler from his robes muttering portus softly he watched the ruler turn blue for a few moments all right james remus sirius alastor arthur bill and ginny take a hold of the portkey it will take us to the edge of the village of little hangleton which is where harry and tom are the seven adults and single teen placed a hand on the ruler two seconds later they felt the pull at the navel as the portkey activated sending them to harry location meanwhile harry was concentrating with all his might as voldemort assaulted his mind with sledgehammer blows attempting to gain entrance his need to block voldemort kept him from noticing what was happening on the quidditch pitch dumbledore had taught him and ginny how to build barriers around their minds to protect it from intrusion harry had decided to use steel plates like those used for muggle battleships in making his walls riveted solidly in place all around his mind dumbledore had tested them and found them very strong now those walls faced a real test as voldemort attacked harry mind the walls bent and buckled inward harry struggled to keep the walls intact whenever one part buckled he concentrated to straighten it when a rivet popped out he put up the image of a heavily muscled man in a hard hat with a rivet gun replacing the lost rivet after what seemed like hours though it was only a few minutes voldemort ceased his attack frustration and anger evident on his face you have a strong mind potter not that it matters with no one knowing where you are it will be only a matter of time before i get what i want no one can resist lord voldemort grinning evilly he resumed his attack on harry mind a couple of miles away harry would be rescuers arrived on the outskirts of the village in the light of the half full moon they could just make out the cemetery from the tombstones as she took a step forward ginny stumbled against her father her hands holding her head tom attacking harry mind again she said i can feel it more strongly now that we re closer we ve got to hurry arthur looked at her with concern are you sure you re up to this poppit will you be able to cast spells with you feeling harry pain i ll be all right dad ginny replied i wasntready the first time tom attacked harry just give me a moment she closed her eyes and concentrated bringing up her mental walls which were actually similar to the ones harry had this would allow her to separate most of what harry was feeling okay i ready to go dumbledore nodded can you tell where harry is in the graveyard ginny closed her eyes and concentrated on sensing harry presence yes professor he over to the left just beyond that large tree between a church and a hill dumbledore turned to the other adults now we dontknow how many death eaters are there with voldemort however it doesntmatter we arenthere to really fight them but to get harry out of there he turned to james and sirius james you remus and sirius move to the right alastor and i will go to the left we will distract voldemort and his death eaters and draw them away he turned to the weasleys and remus arthur you bill and ginny wait for 10 minutes then come up in the middle once voldemort and his death eaters leave harry come up and get him once you have harry apparate him and ginny back to hogwarts do not wait for us understand arthur nodded all right albus we ll get them out safely dumbledore alastor remus james and sirius cast disillusion charms on themselves then moved in their assigned directions the others crouched down to wait arthur glanced at ginny and noticed her slumped shoulders he wrapped an arm around her shoulder dontworry poppit we ll get him back ginny looked up at him the unshed tears in her eyes reflecting the moonlight i hope so daddy i dontknow what i d do without him arthur pulled her into his arms and rubbed her back soothing her like he used to do when she was younger bill looked on his father and sister with a little discomfort he had been told of the bond between her and harry and the prophecy of trelawney by his parents during christmas but had little idea of how it affected both of them to see her in anguish like that over a boy only a year older than she was made him uncomfortable yet having known harry over the years he knew the younger boy would take care of her he hoped that whatever happened in the future his sister and the boy who lived would survive to live together into a ripe old age ginny suddenly gasped she pulled out of her father arms and stood up drawing her wand what is it ginny arthur asked as he also stood up and placed a hand on her shoulder tom angry over being unable to get into harry mind ginny said tears starting to flow down her cheeks again he hitting harry with the cruciatus curse inside the graveyard harry gritted his teeth to keep from screaming as the curse voldemort was casting on him caused all his nerves to feel like they were on fire his back arched from the pain but the tombstone and his bonds kept him from bending too far back or flailing about that should weaken your will potter voldemort said grinning as he pointed his wand at the helpless boy after several seconds voldemort lifted the curse causing harry to hang limply from his bonds breathing heavily as he recovered from the pain after a few seconds he heard voldemort again yell crucio and felt the agony assail his body again when harry again refused to scream voldemort grew angrier he kept the curse on the boy for several more seconds then stopped it enough of this i really dontneed to know the whole prophecy once you re dead he turned to crouch release his bonds and give him back his wand but my lord crouch began to say do not question my orders voldemort screamed or you will feel my wrath along with potter harry dropped to the ground in a heap as crouch cut his bonds loose releasing him from the tombstone he then tossed harry wand to the ground beside the boy get up potter voldemort said harry reached for his wand and shakily got to his feet his muscles ached all over and his scar was still throbbing then he felt ginny presence nearby gin i can feel you nearby he called out to his mind shh harry i about half a mile away dumbledore our dads sirius remus bill mad eye and i are here to rescue you what are you doing here you shouldnthave come with them it too dangerous dontyou treat me like my mum harry if it wasntfor me they wouldnthave known where you are i wasntstaying behind while my soul mate was in tom hands but ginny harry started to say but ginny interrupted him no buts harry i here now and there nothing you can do about it now dumbledore your dad mad eye sirius and remus are coming to you from opposite sides keep tom and his death munchers distracted while they come up once they attack dad bill and i will come to you harry sighed all right gin please be careful he turned his attention back to voldemort his mental conversation with ginny had taken barely five seconds but it seemed that voldemort and his death eaters hadntnoticed his distracted look and probably thought he was simply regaining his breath so potter voldemort said we come to the other reason i wanted you to be brought to me it seems that after the events that night i came to your family hiding place there have been rumors that i had passed my peak especially if i was defeated by a fifteen month old baby i must dispel those rumors i must prove that i am still the greatest wizard of all so we shall duel he turned to the dozen death eaters gathered around them no one interfere whoever does will join potter in the grave he turned back to harry and grinned now we bow to each other like proper gentlemen voldemort said bowing at the waist harry mimicked him keeping his eyes on voldemort as he straightened voldemort suddenly shouted stupefy harry barely had time to say protego voldemort spell hit the shield and rebounded to one side barely missing a standing death eater who cursed as he jumped back harry sent a stinging hex at voldemort which bounced off the villain own shield tut tut voldemort said too slow potter he sent two stunner spells in quick succession harry shield shattered from the first spell forcing harry to dodge to once side to avoid the other harry rolled as soon as he hit the ground just in time another red light hit the spot he had been in a mere second ago harry leaped to his feet firing a cutting curse that shattered voldemort shield causing the man eyes to widen in surprise voldemort barely managed to dodge harry next spell furious voldemort sent three cutting spells in succession harry dodged the first two but the third clipped him on the shoulder spinning him around to land behind a small tombstone he crouched behind it trying to catch his breath between the stunner crouch had hit him with earlier and the effects of two cruciatus curses he was tiring fast if he got out of this he vowed to build up more of his endurance come now potter voldemort called out to him donthide behind that tombstone what will your brave auror father think his oldest son hiding from a fight come out of there and face me harry took a deep breath pushed himself to his feet and stepped out from behind the tombstone his wand raised ah that better voldemort said now i think it time to end this avada kedavra at the same time harry had shouted expelliarmus the green light from voldemort wand and the red light from harry sped toward each other and hit each other in a flash of light connecting the wands with a golden beam what is this voldemort demanded holding his wand with both hands harry didntknow what to say but held on to his own wand knowing somehow that he had to keep their wands connected if he wanted to survive just then three of the death eaters were hit by red lights and crumpled to the ground the remaining nine looked around in confusion dumbledore stepped out from the darkness hello tom up to your old tricks again i see with a mighty wrench voldemort tore his wand away from its connection to harry and faced his old professor do not call me that he screamed i am lord voldemort that name has no more meaning for me ah but it is the name your mother gave you tom dumbledore answered it is the name you bore while you were studying at hogwarts bah voldemort yelled it doesnthold meaning for me anymore with that he started casting spells at dumbledore who dodged as he cast spells back at voldemort at the same time more stunning spells dropped two more of the death eaters this time however the remaining ones saw the direction the spells had come from four of them started firing spells that way while two started reviving their stunned comrades soon spells were flying in both directions harry found himself in a duel with barty crouch jr and another death eater he dodged and ducked while firing spells back at them though they were few and far between suddenly he heard a familiar sounding female voice yell chiropterus muccus at crouch causing him to go down screaming and clutching his face as huge green bats came out of his nose the other death eater was distracted enough for harry to hit him with a stunner knocking him out cold someone grabbed him and pulled him back harry turned around intent on hexing whoever it was but stopped when he saw that it was mad eye then a blur of red hit him embracing him tightly he inhaled deeply reveling in the smell of strawberries and wild flowers that was ginny familiar scent he returned her embrace with the same fervor for a few moments it was like there were no other people in the world then harry felt the presence of other people looking up he saw bill mr weasley and mad eye moody standing beside them smirks on the weasley males faces and a grin on mad eye scarred one come on potter mad eye said we ve got to get you out of here i cantleave yet harry said not while dumbledore is out there fighting with voldemort he turned around and saw the two powerful wizards dueling they were casting spells in rapid succession at each other the air was crackling over the power they were displaying it was a bit intimidating and harry was wondering if he would ever have such power yes you will ginny said in his mind remember the power revelation spell they cast on us last year harry the light from your magical power was brighter than dumbledore s you just need to train a bit more then you can kick tom ass true and proper then dumbledore stumbled and fell to the ground voldemort grinned triumphantly no harry yelled he pulled out of ginny arms and rushed out toward the headmaster voldemort aimed his wand at the headmaster then he looked up and smiled just as he cast the spell his wand pointed up straight at harry avada kedavra harry was too surprised to move aside or raise his wand as the green light sped toward him suddenly he was pushed down to the ground and someone stepped into the path of the green beam harry looked up and saw mad eye get hit by the green spell for a moment he thought the old wizard winked at him before crumpling in a heap at his feet then the pops of several people apparating were heard people dressed in auror uniforms appeared in the graveyard more than a dozen of them voldemort snarled and yelled retreat in mere seconds the still active death eaters disapparated leaving harry and his friends in possession of the battlefield a n there you have it harry first real duel with voldie how d you like the end moody took the killing curse for harry gasp how will harry react to that what about his father will the ministry believe that voldemort is back well that for the next chapter please r r chapter 57 after the graveyard disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter daniel granger maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is part of the wonderful work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit a bright ray of sunshine fell upon harry face forcing him to blearily open his eyes he was unsure where he was since his blurred vision prevented him from seeing more than a couple of feet he did see a table beside his bed with his glasses on it he sat up reached out for them and put them on the room fell sharply into focus and he sighed he was in the hospital wing of hogwarts again it seemed he had been spending the last days of the term in its sterile environment ever since he started coming here the clock on the wall said that it was nine in the morning for a moment he wondered why he was here then the memories of the events in the previous night came back to him causing him to flop back down on the bed he remembered feeling the pull of the triwizard cup turned portkey before blacking out then waking up to find himself tied to a tombstone he remembered voldemort coming up to him and trying to enter his mind to find the prophecy dumbledore had told him about the year before then he had to duel voldemort before a rescue party arrived then he remembered with anguish what happened then he saw dumbledore stumble while dueling with voldemort he had run toward them intent on helping the headmaster but voldemort had noticed him and sent the killing curse toward him he had been unable to move away in time but mad eye moody had pushed down and stood in the path of the green beam dying in harry place this had shocked harry after voldemort and the other death eaters had disapparated away upon the arrival of the aurors harry just sat there staring at the body of moody the man magical eye stared back at him lifeless and still harry didntremember much after that a vague memory of his dad gently pulling him to his feet and ginny wrapping her arms around him and sobbing against his chest he wasntsure how he got back to hogwarts after that much less ending up in the hospital wing harry sighed and felt tears gather at the corners of his eyes one of his favorite dada professors his dad mentor in auror training was dead and it was his fault he shouldnthave run toward dumbledore and voldemort he had left himself open to attack and voldemort had taken advantage of it suddenly the doors of the hospital wind flew open harry turned to look and saw ginny standing there a look of anguish to match his own on her face upon seeing him she ran up to his bed and engulfed him in a tight embrace settling her head on his chest dontyou dare blame yourself for that harry she said to him in his mind i was there and i saw the whole thing it wasntyour fault if moody had not taken the curse you d be the one dead would you do that to me harry would you leave me like that she looked up at him tears streaming down her face it broke harry heart to see her like that but gin he answered back in the same manner if i hadntbeen stupid and run toward dumbledore moody wouldnthave to run after me and take the curse he d still be alive maybe harry she replied but then maybe dumbledore would be dead if you hadntdone that and distracted voldemort he might have killed dumbledore feeling a sliver of doubt appear in harry mind ginny went on but that doesntmatter harry the point is that it tom who is at fault he didnthave to cast the killing curse at you he could have used another one it because he chose to cast the killing curse that moody is dead not because you ran toward him so it tom we should blame for moody death harry sighed and kissed her on the forehead how do you know what to say to me to calm me down ginny shrugged the bond lets us know what the other is feeling i guess knowing you for so long i can figure out what going on in your head to cause such feelings and how to handle it so you dontdo yourself any harm harry thought about it for a moment then said i glad you can they continued to embrace each other in silence with ginny head on harry chest and their bodies molding to each other gin harry said in her mind after a few seconds um did you really feel the pain when my scar was burning and when voldemort cast the cruciatus on me ginny eyes widened in surprise that he would know and it was a couple of seconds before she replied uh yes harry i did before harry could say anything she continued dontyou dare suggest severing the bond to spare me the pain harry i wontlet you i dontcare about that harry sighed again she knew him so well but i dontwant you to feel that kind of pain again ginny well we ll just have to find a way to get around that maybe we should continue our training with professor dumbledore in occlumency i guess so gin maybe we can ask him later i think we should do that now hush you need to rest some more just then a distinct cough caused them to look up they saw madame pomfrey watching them from a few feet away the door to her office open behind her ginny quickly got off harry and they both sat up their faces turning red with embarrassment at having been seen in such an intimate position ah mr potter the school nurse said i see that you are awake she didntcomment about what she had seen for which the two teenagers were extremely grateful the nurse came up to them and looked critically at harry she turned to ginny move over miss weasley she said in a kind voice i need to check on mr potter ginny moved to sit at the foot of harry bed taking a hold of one of harry hands and clasping it tightly madame pomfrey waved her wand over harry for several seconds lingering over his shoulder where voldemort had hit him with a cutting curse his limbs and his ribs finally she said all right mr potter you seem much better those curses didntdo any permanent damage you just need to drink some potions i will be right back with them she headed back into her office then the door of the hospital wing opened again harry and ginny looked up to see harry sister and parents enter the room no one said anything at first as they walked over to them rose sat on the bed next to harry s lily sat down beside harry and embraced him tightly james stood behind his wife and son ginny remained where she was and continued holding his hand after a while when it appeared his mother wouldntlet him go harry said mum i need to breathe lily pulled back and looked at him intently are you all right how are you feeling i just feel a little sore mum he replied shrugging his shoulder but otherwise i feel fine are you sure she asked your father said that that monster used legilimency on you then hit you twice with the cruciatus in addition to a cutting curse just then madame pomfrey came out of her office she was carrying a tray with several vials filled with different colored liquids lily turned to her as she came closer how my son doing poppy she asked the older woman he much better now than he was when he arrived here last night lily madame pomfrey replied he had a deep cut on his shoulder then that i healed it shouldntleave even a scar after a few days harry breathed a sigh of relief over that feeling that he already had one scar too many he also had some muscle damage in his arms and legs and bruising around the ribs from being exposed to the cruciatus curse i have a few potions for him to take for that but it will take a few weeks other than that he well enough to leave later this evening harry brightened up at that you mean it madame pomfrey he asked i can leave the hospital wing later madame pomfrey smiled yes mr potter you seemed to have recovered well enough however you will have to take it easy for a couple of weeks being subjected to the cruciatus is a serious thing it would be best if you donttry any heavy physical activity for the next two weeks harry eyes widened at that heavy physical activity yes she replied things like jumping around running and flying especially quidditch harry face fell on hearing that but he consoled himself with the fact that it would be for only a couple of weeks right now madame pomfrey continued i need you to drink these three potions um do i really have to harry whined yes mr potter the nurse sternly replied that is if you want to leave before dinner otherwise i may have to keep you here for another night harry eyes widened a bit and he gulped err in that case i ll drink the potions madame pomfrey gave him the vials one after another harry grimaced as he downed the different potions all of them bitter tasting he caught a whiff of amusement in his mind that he knew was from ginny causing him to scowl at her she grinned back at him even rose looked amused though harry thought he saw a dark shadow in her eyes once she had given harry his potions madame pomfrey said all right harry your family can stay for another hour then you should get some more rest with that she went back to her office harry looked up at his father who looked weary and hadntsaid anything yet dad he said hesitantly i i i sorry about moody i wish he didnthave to run after me james sat down on the bed and placed his hand on harry shoulder squeezing it gently it wasntyour fault harry voldemort killed mad eye not you it that monster fault that alastor is dead i i know dad harry said softly ginny convinced me of that just a while ago good his father said i glad she settled that for you although if it wasntfor mad eye you d be the one dead i sad he dead but i d rather have you alive i dontcare what i have to do or what needs to be done for you to remain alive i want you and this cutie here he waved his hand at ginny to marry someday and give me lily arthur and molly lots of grandchildren i want you to live a life once that monster is gone harry felt tears prickling his eyes upon hearing his father words his cheeks were also turning crimson from hearing the word grandchildren he also felt the same emotions coming from ginny she moved over to james and gave him a hug her mother would be proud of james eyes widened in surprise but he returned the hug harry smiled as he turned to regard his sister now that he studied her more closely he saw that her smile didntreach her eyes rose he said to her what wrong rose lower lip trembled for a moment then she launched herself at harry hugging him fiercely i sorry harry i so sorry she was crying onto his shoulder now harry eyes widened in surprise and alarm he returned the embrace what are you talking about sis what are you sorry for she pulled back and looked at him through teary eyes i i i wasntable to w warn you about being taken by crouch i didnthave any visions of that i feel like i failed you harry pulled her back into his arms and started rubbing her back soothingly shhh it all right just because you didnthave a vision doesntmean you have anything to feel sorry for i not sure how your seer ability works but i bet you cantsee everything that may happen this is just one of those things dontworry about it you didntfail me or anyone else harry felt ginny own alarm and concern lessen with his words she placed a hand on rose shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze harry right rose ginny said gently to her best friend it doesntmatter if you dontget a vision to warn us about something bad that may happen if you get a vision we ll act on it if you don t we ll just be ready for anything so dontlet that bother you we know you could never fail us rose lifted her head from harry shoulder and looked at ginny a all right she sniffed one last time and pulled out of harry arms to sit on the bed the doors of the hospital wing opened up once more when the potters and ginny looked there they saw dumbledore looking in through the half open doors ah harry you re awake the headmaster said i hope you are up to some more visitors who are anxiously waiting to see you with that he pushed the door open and walked inside leaving the door open behind him followed ron hermione neville maggie ti remus arthur molly fred george and bill harry grinned widely and said hey guys within moments they were clustered around his bed greeting him and patting his back hermione even gave him a brief hug molly sat beside lily and engulfed harry in her arms oh harry dear we were so worried when you disappeared from the pitch mum ginny cried let him breathe molly pulled back sorry dear i just so happy you re back safe and sound i wouldntbe able to stand it if anything happened to my future son in law err harry said his cheeks turning red thanks molly he could feel the happiness coming from ginny over her mother words truth to tell he felt glad over molly acceptance that he and ginny would be married one day in spite of his embarrassment over having her say it in front of his parents sister and friends so how is he doing molly asked lily unaware of his embarrassment or thoughts well molly lily said according to poppy he much better now than he was when he got here last night she said he was well enough to leave the hospital wing by dinnertime hooray said ron fred george neville and ti boys really molly said to them a scowl on her face she turned back to lily that good to hear i glad he doesnthave to spend more time here i heard that he seems to always end the year here that he does lily said eyeing her son disapprovingly this makes it four times in a row mum harry whined this time it wasntmy fault lily face softened i know harry she said as she brushed his hair on his forehead revealing his scar i just wish you could have a normal school year for once i know mum so do i harry said as he turned to remus hey remus where sirius oh i sure he ll be along in a while remus said he went to get one more visitor for you harry wondered who he meant when the doors to the hospital wing opened for the fourth time that morning and sirius stuck his head in oh so this is where everyone is he said he came in followed by sam hi sirius hi sam harry said it great to see you again sam where are the twins we left them with blinky and mimi so we could visit you sam said so how did taking care of andrew and daisy for a day go lily asked smiling oh all right i suppose sirius said i mean we didnthave any accidents or problems with them i figured it would be good practice for us practice james asked what do you mean by practice padfoot well i guess now as good a time as any to let you guys know he turned to sam who looked at everyone and said i pregnant the girls squealed and together with the women rushed to sam while the men congratulated sirius with hearty handshakes that great sirius harry said of course i just cantpicture you as a dad hey sirius said what do you mean by that i did okay with you when you were a baby whenever your parents needed to leave you oh i dontknow padfoot remus said a grin on his face i remember most of those times and i recall having to come to your rescue harry here wasntthe most peaceful of babies you could say he the true son of a marauder this i ve got to hear ginny said i haventheard any stories of harry before we met oh no harry said no one is telling any stories of me as a baby i ve seen the pictures i dontneed to hear the stories about them he clamped a hand over his mouth when he realized what he had revealed pictures ginny said her eyes widening rose do you know anything about harry baby pictures cantsay i have ginny rose said staring at her brother i ve never seen pictures of my big bro as a baby at least from the time before i was born she turned to james do you have an album of harry before he turned one dad yes rose james said his eyes laughing at harry scowl we had one but it seemed to have disappeared a few years ago now harry you wouldnthappen to know what happened to it now would you err would no be an acceptable answer harry said still scowling ginny smirked and closed her eyes harry eyes widened and he realized what she was about to do he felt her presence in his mind intensify through their bond he tried to put up his occlumency shields but it was like they were not an obstacle to her she opened her eyes a few seconds later it seems my dear soul mate here nicked the album before he came to hogwarts and hid it she smirked at him then spoke into his mind dontworry love i not telling them where it is and i didntsee anything i shouldn t you were just thinking about it too hard everyone laughed as harry was glowering at ginny at that moment madame pomfrey came out of her office what is going on here i didntallow all of you in here only miss weasley and the potters mr potter still needs his rest dumbledore came up to her and said softly i sorry poppy it my fault i thought seeing his friends and family would cheer harry up after what happened last night madame pomfrey looked sternly at dumbledore for a few seconds then sniffed all right albus they can stay for a while but they have to let harry get some more rest if he intends to leave this room this evening she looked at sam and said loudly of course this gives me a chance to see my dear niece sam came up to madame pomfrey and gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek hello aunt poppy it so good to

and lily exchanged a look and burst out laughing you guys are just so easy to tease lily said in between laughs ha ha james said very funny lils harry stomach suddenly let out a big growl oops sorry

rest of the group bid harry goodbye which included another big hug from molly professor harry called out to dumbledore please stay a while i need to ask you something dumbledore nodded he conjured a nice chair and sat down beside harry bed err harry said how are you feeling professor i saw you stumble in your duel with voldemort i hope you werenthurt badly i fine harry dumbledore my foot just caught on a root as i dodged one of voldemort spells his spells didnttouch me um that good harry said looking down at his bed after a moment of silence he added i sorry about professor moody when i saw you stumble i was afraid voldemort would be able to kill you i forgot he was more interested in killing me harry couldntsuppress completely the feeling of guilt he had over moody death in spite of what ginny and his dad had told him ginny felt this and squeezed his hand in sympathy dontblame yourself harry dumbledore said you acted out of your feelings for me that is not a bad thing moody did the same thing he had grown quite fond of you these past few months in spite of his gruff exterior it was because he cared for you that he took the killing curse in your stead love is a wonderful thing that voldemort can never understand it will enable us to win against him in the end albus is right harry lily said you cantlet moody death dampen your spirits that what voldemort wants as long as we have hope and love we can beat that monster so dontlet this deter you or harden your heart harry simply nodded unable to speak as he felt sadness over moody death a house elf popped in then with a tray containing ham eggs bacon pumpkin juice and bread lily and ginny made sure harry ate every last bit of food and drained the glass of pumpkin juice to the last drop this made him sleepy lily rearranged his pillow and drew the blankets over him she kissed his forehead sleep well son your dad and i will be going home to take care of the twins we ll see you soon james squeezed harry shoulder gently yes we ll see you soon son bye mum dad harry said groggily rose gave him a one arm hug and a kiss on the cheek i so glad you re okay harry thanks sis harry said just remember that you cantpredict everything sleep well love ginny said giving him a quick peck on the lips harry clasped her hand tightly dontgo gin stay with me until i fall asleep please ginny looked at madame pomfrey who shrugged then nodded she and sam stepped into her office to talk in soft tones ginny lay down beside harry her head on his shoulder and one hand clasping one of his harry arm snaked out from under the blankets to wrap around ginny waist neither of them said a thing verbally or mentally ginny listened to harry heartbeat slow down and become regular allowing her in turn to relax half an hour later when sam stepped out of her aunt office she found both teens fast asleep she pulled a blanket off another bed and spread it over ginny before quietly leaving the hospital wing a n well how was that nice fluff or what now please r r chapter 58 a teacher funeral disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter daniel granger maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is part of the wonderful work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit madam pomfrey lived up to her promise and discharged harry from the hospital wing in time for dinner ginny waited for him in the corridor while the school nurse gave him a final check harry however didntfeel like eating in the great hall with the rest of the school he knew the other students would be curious about where he had been he just didntwant to face them then he still felt some guilt and horror from the previous night events ginny knowing how he felt suggested spending some time together in the room of requirement instead then going down to the kitchens once dinner was over to ask the house elves for some food harry wholeheartedly agreed with that idea and the young couple hurried to the seventh floor they walked up and down in front of the blank wall three times while thinking of an appropriate place to relax when they stepped inside they found an exact copy of the gryffindor common room awaiting them they locked the door and sat in the familiar couch in front of the fireplace which had a roaring fire already in place they settled into a tight embrace with ginny sending comforting thoughts to harry after a few minutes harry asked ginny mentally gin how did i get to hogwarts last night um dumbledore made a portkey he gave it to me while i had my arms wrapped around you and it took us back to the quidditch pitch why i dontremember much after seeing moody fall he replied it all vague and foggy madam pomfrey said you were in shock harry ginny said it understandable after seeing moody d d die like that some hero i turned out to be harry said voldemort murders someone in front of me and i space out ginny pulled out of his embrace and hit him hard on the arm dontyou dare pity yourself potter ginny shouted as she glared at him harry rubbed his arm as he stared at her stunned ginny face then softened and she gently cupped his cheek with the palm of one hand madam pomfrey said that shock is a natural reaction to something that horrible it just shows how good your heart is not like tom she encircled his arms around him again and laid her head on his shoulder you care so much harry otherwise moody death wouldnthave bothered you dontdwell on it anymore remember you managed to hold voldemort off until we came moody would have been proud of you let his sacrifice be another reason to beat that monster so how did i get to the hospital wing he asked remus conjured a stretcher and placed you on it ginny replied he dad and bill came back right after we did you were so limp with a glazed look on your face when we got back we took you to the hospital wing where madam pomfrey managed to make you drink a dreamless sleep potion you dropped off to sleep almost immediately madam pomfrey wanted us to go to bed but mum lily rose and i refused to leave you we stayed there the entire night but what about this morning harry asked i was alone when i woke up ginny scowled madam pomfrey said that she didntexpect you to wake up until noon and insisted we all freshen up and get some food i was finishing up my breakfast in the great hall when i felt you wake up and get all morose and depressed so i rushed back there i glad you did gin harry said i not sure where my thoughts would have taken me if you hadntcome and convince me that voldemort was the one at fault for moody death after a few moments of silence ginny said dontthink about it anymore harry let not let this couch go to waste she placed a hand behind his neck and drew his lips down to hers harry gladly let his thoughts wander off as they kissed it was much later when they finally emerged from the room of requirement to head for the kitchens and harry was in a much better mood they were greeted enthusiastically by dobby and the other house elves who led them to the same table they had eaten in with their friends after the second task in a few minutes the table was groaning from the massive amount of food the house elves placed on it as they were trying to place a dent in the food harry and ginny heard a voice behind them chuckle and exclaim i glad you haventallowed last night events to affect your appetite harry they turned around to see dumbledore standing there with the familiar twinkle in his eye err hello professor harry said i didntfeel like eating in the great hall i quite understand harry dumbledore said practically the entire school saw you taken away and some of your classmates can be quite inquisitive i know that it would be difficult to talk about last night events well they better not bother harry or i ll hex them ginny said a scowl on her face now now miss weasley dumbledore said a smile on his face i doubt that will be necessary since i announced at dinner tonight that anyone badgering harry about the events surrounding the end of the tournament will be seeing mr filch for detention thanks professor harry said grinning i doubt anyone would look forward to that you re welcome harry dumbledore said also all the rest of the school knows is that alastor was killed by voldemort no one among the students knows the exact circumstances of his death aside from yourself and miss weasley now i will leave you two to finish your meal the elderly wizard turned to go um professor harry said before you go there is something i need to know dumbledore turned back around yes harry harry are you sure you want to do this ginny voice sounded in his mind i need to know gin he answered her what happened in the graveyard after after moody was killed and ginny and i portkeyed back to hogwarts harry asked dumbledore nervously i was in kind of a daze at that point ah yes dumbledore said he sat down in an empty chair well harry he began i not sure if you are aware that several aurors had apparated into the graveyard by then seeing them outnumber his remaining death eaters tom decided to leave once you and miss weasley were on your way back here arthur remus and bill went back to hogwarts to make sure you were taken care of your dad and sirius stayed with me and the aurors to search the area and make sure nothing was left did you get any of them harry asked what about barty crouch jr unfortunately when voldemort left most of the stunned death eaters also disappeared dumbledore said they may have some form of emergency portkey on them linked with the others when they disapparated however it appears that barty jr did not have one on him so we managed to capture him i must say that whatever hex miss weasley used on him was quite effective harry grinned while ginny blushed from dumbledore praise that would be her famous bat bogey hex professor harry said taking one of ginny hands and squeezing it affectionately it keeps her brothers in line with just the thought of facing it yes dumbledore said a smile forming on his face i can imagine so did you find out anything from barty jr professor harry asked he was the one who got my name in the goblet of fire using some dark spell i ll bet he tried to rig the tasks to try and get me killed your father and the other aurors took him into custody and back to the ministry dumbledore said i believe he is in a holding cell there since azkaban is not a reliable place for prisoners anymore we ll have to wait for him for that harry nodded and looked thoughtful for a moment professor one more thing just before you came up to me and voldemort something strange happened voldemort and i were dueling when i think we cast a spell at the same time the spells hit each other and then our wands started vibrating they seemed to be connected by a golden beam then you came and said something to voldemort and he broke the connection why did that happen priori incantatum dumbledore said softly what that professor ginny asked it the reverse spell effect ginny dumbledore said you see harry wand and voldemort wand share cores they each contain a tail feather from the same phoenix in fact you are well acquainted with that phoenix since it was instrumental in your victory over the basilisk two years ago harry eyes widened fawkes my wand feather came from fawkes yes harry dumbledore said i was contacted by mr ollivander immediately after you got your wand four years ago your wand and voldemort wand are brothers brother wands cannot work properly against each other if however the owners force them to do battle something rare happens the connection you saw last night was the initial effect voldemort broke the connection before it could go further what would have happened if the connection hadntbeen broken professor harry asked softly one of the wands would have forced the first to regurgitate the spells it has performed in reverse the most recent one would manifest first followed by the next recent and so on the spells would be reversed ginny asked no miss weasley dumbledore said what you would see would be merely an echo of the spell it is said that if the wand was used to perform the killing curse some form of the murdered person would appear harry and ginny involuntarily shuddered both wondering how that would look well i think that all that can be said tonight dumbledore said getting to his feet i ll leave you two to finish your meal i suggest you return straight to your common room and get some more rest good night and harry i agree with miss weasley alastor would have been proud of you last night the two teens gaped at him harry turned to ginny how did he know about that he cantpossibly hear what we say to each other in our minds can he ginny shrugged he dumbledore who knows how he does things they returned to their meal but found that their discussion with the headmaster had dampened their appetites they shared a final treacle tart and thanked dobby and the other house elves for the meal before leaving the kitchens they took their time walking in the corridors back to gryffindor tower unmindful of being caught when they finally reached the fat lady portrait harry stopped harry ginny asked what is it i not sure i can face them ginny he replied everyone liked mad eye in one way or another harry professor dumbledore did say that no one here knows he died saving your life even if they knew i doubt our friends would hold it against you harry sighed i guess you re right gin come on he turned to the fat lady and said the password leo victrix when they stepped through the portrait hole harry was relieved to see that the common room was empty except for their friends who were huddled together at their usual spot in front of the fireplace even fred and george were waiting for them rose was the first to spot them harry she cried running towards him and ginny she hugged him tightly have a good time together she asked looking at the two of them with a smirk on her face before harry or ginny could answer the rest of their friends descended on them hugging or slapping harry on the back glad that you re out of the hospital wing mate ron said grinning at him yeah so am i harry said grinning back at his best mate we were worried when you and ginny didntcome to the great hall for dinner hermione said we even went to the hospital wing after eating to see if madam pomfrey had decided to keep you there another night after all she told us you and ginny had left hours ago ti said so we wondered where you two were hermione thought you two had been captured on your way to the great hall yeah neville said they wanted to go to dumbledore but then rose used the map so we saw the two of you in the kitchens fred said you didntmake the house elves feed you again did you hermione asked her tone was a bit menacing you did how could you treating them like slaves i expected better from the two of you hermione ginny exclaimed relax okay did you really expect harry to go eat in the great hall after what he went through last night let me remind you that practically the entire school saw him whisked off by portkey with crouch who by the way was really his son barty jr do you really think he d want to face the rest of the student body so soon to be in the spotlight again you know he hates that ginny voice was low but had a fierce tone to it she was also glaring at the older girl hermione shrunk back from the tirade of the younger girl um i guess he wouldntwant that she squeaked i glad you realize that ginny said i suggested that we just go down to the kitchens and eat there the house elves were very kind especially dobby and gave us some sandwiches to eat and pumpkin juice to drink we ate as much as we could then we came straight here all right hermione said sighing we were just worried that all i grateful for your concern hermione harry said hugging her thanks he turned to the others thanks to all of you i touched that you guys stayed up late to wait for us no problem mate ron said we re just glad you re okay of course i d like to know where you guys were during dinner madam pomfrey did say you left the hospital wing in time for dinner so where were you two ron eyes narrowed as harry and ginny started to blush you didn t did you please tell me you two didntgo into a broom cupboard to snog okay we didntgo into a broom cupboard harry said smirking whew ron said that a relief for a minute there i thought you spent dinnertime in a snogging session when they started to blush again ron exclaimed slapping his hand on his forehead you did i cantbelieve it a day barely passed since you faced you know who and you re snogging with my sister i just glad you didntdo that in front of me hmm ginny said it not too late to do that with that she pulled harry into her arms and started to kiss him passionately ron gaped at them for a moment before turning in disgust and heading up the stairs to the boys dormitories the others just smirked as they watched when several seconds had passed by without harry or ginny breaking the kiss they looked at each other and shrugged they went up the stairs to their dormitories leaving the young couple alone finally harry and ginny drew back from each other and touched foreheads as they tried to catch their breath seeing they were alone again they smiled at each other harry guided ginny to the couch in front of the fireplace where they settled in the same position they had been in when they were in the room of requirement after snogging for few minutes ginny drew back harry you ll tell the others what happened in the graveyard right harry i dontknow gin he answered after a couple of seconds what if they blame me for getting moody killed harry they re your sisters and friends they wontdo that they deserve to know the truth dontworry i know what happened and i dontblame you harry sighed all right ginny but let leave it for tomorrow right now i need a little more comfort from the beautiful redhead in my arms my my mr potter such flattery can swell a girl head she closed the gap between them after another half hour ginny reluctantly suggested that they get some sleep they had one final kiss before ascending up their separate stairs the following morning fleur and viktor came up to the gryffindor table while harry and his friends were having breakfast harry viktor said fleur and i vould like to offer our condolences over de death of your professor oui arry fleur said we are so sorry thanks guys harry said that means a lot to me he taught me a lot this year da i sure he did viktor said he vas said to be a very gud auror we also came over to say goodbye fleur said we are going back to our countries this morning harry stood and shook hands with both of them i glad to have met you fleur viktor i consider you good friends now hard and evil times are coming and we could all use friends in other countries of course arry fleur said you helped me save marie and we are fellow champions afzer all who knows i may be back here soon au revoir arry she gave him a quick peck on the cheek if you are in need of a friend on the continent harry viktor said i vill be there they then said goodbye to ginny and harry other friends fleur even embraced ginny and whispered to her take good care of arry mon cheri he iz lucky to have you ginny blushed from the compliment fleur and viktor then left the great hall the hogwarts students then continued their meal when they had finished ginny turned to harry harry are you going to tell them all right ginny harry replied but i think we should do it in the room of requirement tell the others he got up and left the great hall climbing the stairs to the seventh floor ginny and the others soon followed and they meet in front of the blank wall near the statue of boris the befuddled once inside harry slowly told them everything including his impulsive act that had cost moody his life ginny held his hand the entire time sending soothing thoughts to him several times harry had to pause as the horrible memories threatened to overwhelm him but a gentle stroking of his knuckles by ginny fingers settled his nerves every time when he was finished he searched his friends faces for any sign of loathing or disgust he saw sorrow and understanding on all their faces rose and hermione embraced him as the tears ran down their faces fred george neville and ti each gave him a sympathetic squeeze on the shoulder even maggie gave him a solemn nod then harry turned to his first and best friend ron clapped a hand on harry shoulder dontworry mate ron said i know you didntmean for moody to get killed yeah george said you just wanted to save dumbledore that right harry fred added it wasntyour fault everyone nodded thanks guys harry said thank you for not thinking that it was my fault moody died they all smiled while ginny squeezed his hand they spent the rest of the morning telling each other stories about moody and his classes the next three days saw most of the students staring at harry and whispering behind his back most were curious to know what had happened to him when he had been portkeyed away from hogwarts thankfully few attempted to approach him harry friends intercepted the few that did for which harry was grateful his friends especially ginny did their best to keep his mind from thinking about the horrible things that had occurred that night ginny in fact decided to fulfill ron nightmare scenario and dragged harry into various broom cupboards not that harry resisted much ron for his part refrained from commenting whenever he saw his best friend and sister enter the common room a little disheveled he just hoped they werentdoing anything more than kissing luckily for him he didntair that sentiment to the couple in question three days later and five days after his death a morning memorial service was held for mad eye moody on the grounds of hogwarts harry and the others picked at their breakfast uncomfortable with the silence that hung in the great hall finally dumbledore rose to his feet and asked the students to file out of the great hall behind their heads of house he and the other teachers preceded the students harry noticed that snape was absent he then recalled that he had not seen his potions professor since he had returned from the graveyard he turned to ginny gin have you noticed snape around the last several days he asked her in her mind ginny looked at him in surprise no harry i dontthink i have i wonder why i dontknow either i know he didntlike moody much but i cantbelieve he would skip out on his funeral i doubt dumbledore would allow that i wonder where the git is we ll just have to wait and see harry maybe we can ask dumbledore as if he d tell us harry grumbled the school students and staff walked down to the grounds beside black lake there a bronze and wooden coffin lay on a marble table a dozen yards from the lakeshore more than a hundred white plastic chairs were arranged in several rows in front of the coffin there were already people sitting in the front rows of the plastic chairs among them harry s neville and the weasleys parents sirius nymphadora tonks and several other aurors fortunately there were no other ministry officials there least of all minister for magic cornelius fudge there was a small platform beside the coffin with a podium and a few wooden seats set upon it dumbledore and the other teachers sat down on the seats on the platform dumbledore asked the students to walk past the bronze and wooden coffin for one last look at their dada professor the gryffindors were among the first to reach the coffin harry walked slowly forward ginny and rose beside him until he stood in front of the coffin the two younger girls held one of his hands seeking to comfort him as he gazed at moody body with pain filled eyes after a few seconds ginny gently tugged on the hand she held pulling harry forward they proceeded to seats in one of the middle rows harry watched the other students pass moody coffin most had solemn or saddened looks on their faces a few simply strode past it without sparing a glance at the deceased ex auror and professor harry noted that most of them were slytherins harry saw draco malfoy walk past the coffin he thought he saw the shadow of a smirk on draco face when the slytherin boy stood in front of the coffin but it was gone before he could be sure of it once all the students were seated dumbledore got to his feet and strode up to the podium today he began we are gathered to honor the memory of a brave and honorable man a man who spent his life defending the wizarding world from the dark today we remember alastor moody who some called mad eye he paused for a moment alastor was a man who dedicated his life to defending the light against the dark he sacrificed his own life to allow others to have peaceful lives in over thirty years of service in the aurors he managed to catch many dark wizards including several death eaters he was one of the few people who were considered a threat to voldemort dumbledore ignored the gasps and flinches from most of the people gathered when he mentioned voldemort name he went on to mention the names of the people moody had captured and other accomplishments of the ex auror and finally he concluded he spent this past year teaching young wizards and witches the skills and knowledge they need to cope against the dark arts he will be sorely missed let us spend a few moments of silence in his memory after a few seconds of silence he said now a few of alastor colleagues and former students are here to share their memories of alastor and say a few words in his honor first let me call james potter harry gave a start of surprise as he watched his father get up and go to the podium james scanned the crowd for a few seconds alastor was quite a character unique and strong i first met him he went on to narrate a few of his experiences with moody at the end of his stories he said it was my honor and privilege to have worked with a great man i will always be grateful for what he has done for me and my family his eyes flickered to harry for a moment then he stepped down from the platform and returned to his seat after james several other aurors took their turn speaking like sirius tonks frank longbottom and a tall bald dark skinned male auror named kingsley shacklebolt then dumbledore started to call some of the hogwarts students like oliver wood cedric diggory and cho chang he even called hermione and rose all of these students talked about moody dedication as a teacher and how he encouraged his students when they did practical spellwork harry wondered why he wasntcalled to speak dumbledore probably feels you would feel uncomfortable talking about him harry ginny said to him in his mind i guess he didntwant to cause you more pain i guess that true ginny he replied to her but they arentsaying enough i think someone else has to remind them the real reason he died how he would want to be remembered i have to say something gin with that he stood up and walked up to the podium just as rose was stepping down from the platform she raised an eyebrow but didntsay anything as she passed him she did touch his arm momentarily and gave it a squeeze the crowd was silent as harry stood behind the podium with many having puzzled looks on their faces harry gazed at the coffin as he struggled to put his feelings into words finally he looked at the crowd i will always remember mad eye moody as one of my favorite defense teachers he taught us many things this year that will help us in the coming years but i will remember him mainly as a hero in the fight against voldemort like dumbledore earlier harry ignored the gasps and flinches many people said earlier that professor moody was a constant opponent of the dark and for many years now fighting the dark has meant fighting voldemort there were more gasps but unlike what most people believe that fight has never really ended most people believed that voldemort died the night he attacked me and my family nearly fourteen years ago but that not true somehow he was able to retain a semblance of life and continued to survive for the past thirteen years last year however voldemort was able to regain his body i know that he will want to take up where he left off years ago we cantlet him win so moody fight is now our own we have to continue the fight moody can no longer be a part of and oppose voldemort until he is gone forever we will best remember alastor moody that way by beating voldemort once and for all just remember his motto constant vigilance harry paused for a moment then stepped down from platform and returned to his seat he noticed that his parents godfather and tonks had proud looks on their faces as he sat down ginny again took harry hand in hers and gave it a gentle squeeze great speech love ginny said in harry mind you said exactly what needed to be said thanks gin he replied to her mind i think my parents and sirius liked it too i know they did harry they ve always been proud of anything you do i am too harry felt his face heating up and decided to concentrate on dumbledore who was again standing at the podium i thank you all for your words in honor of alastor moody dumbledore said thank you especially to harry potter for his words young mr potter is correct in saying that the best way to remember alastor is to continue the fight against voldemort because it was voldemort who murdered alastor moody he will stop at nothing to take over our world and impose his ideals of pureblood supremacy on all of us we cannot allow that to happen for it will plunge the whole world into an era of terror and evil not just our world but the muggle world as well we cannot let that happen alastor moody fought all his life to prevent that now that he is gone it is up to us to continue the fight until voldemort is finally vanquished for good a n another chapter done actually the second to the last there just one more to go then this story is done i decided to end this story at the end of harry fourth year since the rest of my version of harry hogwarts years will not follow the remaining books i ll deal with that in the next story which i ve entitled harry potter and the prophesized six i presently working on the first chapter now back to this chapter please r r disclaimer i dontown harry potter or any of the other characters created by ms rowling chapter 5 more mysteries at hogwarts that night still feeling elated despite his sister pun harry decided to celebrate by pranking the slytherins again deciding that this was personal he didnttell any of the other new marauders he slipped out of bed after midnight and donned his invisibility cloak he ignored the portrait of the fat lady as he exited gryffindor tower and moved silently towards the dungeons when he was on the first floor of the castle he heard footsteps approaching and moved to the side of the corridor he saw the figure of snape walking slowly constantly looking around as if he was making sure no one was following him curious harry carefully followed the potions master seeing snape enter an empty classroom harry was just able to slip in before he closed the door in the room was a nervous looking professor quirrell severus i i d d dontknow why y y you want t to meet at this time of night quirrell inquired of his colleague i d think we would want some privacy snape said in an icy tone after all the students dontknow about the philosopher stone being hidden here w w why are we discussing it quirrell asked i d like to know if you ve already found a way to get by that blasted beast of hagrid s b b but severus i wouldn t now you dontwant to make me an enemy quirinius snape said closing the distance between him and quirrell i i dontknow w w what you mean i think you do his voice then lowered and harry had to move closer and just caught the words your little bit of hocus pocus i waiting y y you know i c c can t very well quirinius snape interrupted we ll have another talk very soon after you ve had a while to think and consider where your loyalties lie snape opened the classroom door peered out and then stalked away harry followed him out turning he saw quirrell through the open door just standing there and looking petrified harry seeing that snape was headed back to the dungeons decided to go back to gryffindor tower his prank forgotten the next morning harry pulled ron and hermione over to a corner of the gryffindor common room he told them what he had witnessed the night before so you see we were right the philosopher stone is here being guarded by fluffy snape trying to get quirrell to help him steal it from that bit about quirrell hocus pocus i d say there are other things protecting it it makes sense dumbledore would get the other professors to help snape wanted quirrell to tell him how to get past his bit you mean the stone is safe only so long as quirrell stand up to snape hermione said alarmed bloody hell it ll be gone day after tomorrow ron said ronald language hermione chided over the next few weeks the trio saw quirrell get paler and thinner but snape seemed to be in a foul mood so they assumed the dada teacher hadntcracked yet they soon had other things to worry about as their teachers continued to pile homework on them as the term progressed hermione was constantly pushing the two boys to study much to their annoyance especially ron they were constantly in the library and getting as stressed out as she was then one afternoon while they were researching for an assignment in potions ron noticed hagrid in the library looking at some books when they asked him about his presence there he evaded the question and asked if they were still looking for references on nicolas flamel ron set him straight on that but blurted out that they knew what fluffy was guarding hagrid told them to keep quiet and invited them to his hut later to see something he had ron discovered that hagrid had been looking at books on dragons oh harry said you know since i was little hagrid often mentioned that he d always wanted a dragon you dontthink hermione said i sure hope not ron said i ve had all the stories from charlie about dragons and raising them he my older brother who works with them in romania yeah harry said i remember one time a few years back your mum went ballistic about some burns he received i think it was his first year working there later that afternoon the trio got to hagrid hut upon entering they noticed that it was quite warm inside they had tea but politely refused the rock cakes hagrid offered hagrid harry said we were wondering what other defenses the stone had to protect it from being stolen hagrid frowned you three know i canttell ye that see number one i don know meself what they are number two yeh know too much already i don even know how yeh found out abou fluffy just know that it safe here at leas safer than it was at gringotts come on hagrid hermione said in a warm flattering voice we just wanted to ask you since you know about everything that goes on around here all we want to know is who dumbledore trusts to help him protect the stone well all righ hagrid said reluctantly guess no harm in yeh knowin that okay let see yeh know about fluffy course dumbledore done sumthin then some o the other teachers did some enchantments professor sprout professor flitwick he ticked them off on his fingers professor mcgonagall professor quirrell and oh yeah professor snape what harry said snape yeah yeh aren still on tha are yeh he not tryin ta still the stone he helpin ta protect it hagrid harry then asked you re the only one who knows how to get past fluffy right oh yeah jus me and professor dumbledore hagrid said yep no one else just then harry spotted something in the large fireplace that drove all thoughts of the stone from his mind hagrid harry said tell me that that not what i think it is in the fire hagrid grinned yup it is it was a large black egg a dragon egg blimey ron said where did you get a dragon egg they re a protected species breeding them in britain is considered illegal hagrid bristled won it fair an square las night in the pub in the village from a stranger in a game of cards he showed them a book entitled dragon breeding for pleasure and profit got this outta the library and been followin it even told me what kind of egg it is that there is a norwegian ridgeback it a rare one should hatch real soon i ll let yeh know when it does the three friends exchanged looks of concern but they knew they couldnttalk any sense into hagrid right now they ll have to wait until the dragon hatched a few days later they received a note from hagrid that the blessed dreaded event was very near the three hurried down to his hut during dinnertime arriving in time to watch the egg hatch it proved quite feisty and already breathed fire hagrid named it norbert unfortunately hagrid caught sight of malfoy face in his window that day strangely the slytherin didntseem to make a move to inform his head of house or dumbledore about the illegal creature in hagrid hut the trio finally convinced him to send it away ron owled his brother charlie about it using his brown barn owl barny which he had received as a christmas gift from his parents the owl had been named by his sister ginny charlie soon replied and agreed to take the dragon off of them he arranged for some friends to take the dragon from the astronomy tower two weeks after he had been born hagrid regretfully packed norbert up in a crate harry ron and hermione used harry invisibility cloak to hide them and the crate they managed to slip past filch who was busy restaining malfoy the pale slytherin kept insisting the three gryffindors were also out late when they got to the astronomy tower they only had to wait a short while for charlie friends they soon descended the stairs to return to gryffindor tower only to run into professor mcgonagall harry had pocketed his cloak when they had arrived at the tower and they forgot all about it needless to say mcgonagall was very upset that three students from her house were out after curfew she docked them 50 points each and promised a detention for them and malfoy the trio were devastated over that when the rest of the house found out they were practically ostracized except for the twins who merely grinned at them the slytherins practically gloated since the loss had placed gryffindor at last place for the house cup while slytherin came up to first in spite of malfoy own points loss harry was particularly devastated two days after that night he saw a familiar eagle owl drop a red colored envelope in front of him oh no it newton mum owl is that a howler gingerly he picked up the envelope and ran out of the great hall the slytherin laughter and catcalls ringing in his ear when he got outside the envelope was starting to smoke he pulled the ribbon quickly off the letter immediately lily potter voice echoed around the grounds harry james potter what have you done even your father never lost that many points in one go a dragon of all the things to get involved with you could have gotten hurt werentthe stories of charlie weasley enough to teach you not to mess with them now lily calm down harry just did what he thought best he didntwant hagrid to get in trouble but james you know how hagrid can get carried away with less than acceptable pets you also know how much harry cares for hagrid he like an unofficial uncle or godfather to harry oh all right harry we re disappointed in you for breaking the rules and putting yourself in such danger but we are pleased with your motive i also heard about some pranks on the slytherin though the teachers arentsure who did them with your father and his friends being who they are i have an idea who did so let me make myself clear young man stick to your books no more pranks and no more endangering yourself if you find a similar situation tell professor dumbledore he quite understanding be safe and we ll see you in june at the platform okay harry in spite of what your mother said just enjoy yourself i sorry but with work starting to pile up we wontbe able to attend your next games good luck dontyou dare try to resign from the team over this dontmind the slytherins never mind about the house cup it not that important james now lily you know that it just a silly exercise anyway take care son see you soon okay harry take care harry had mixed emotions over this howler letter he didntwant to disappoint his parents especially his dad his mum was right harry resolved to hunker down to his studies and leave off pranks and meddling a few weeks later one friday morning he ron and hermione received a note that their detention would be that night looking over at the slytherin table harry saw a scowl on the face of malfoy as he read a similar note harry hoped the detention wouldntbe too difficult since he didntwant to spend much time with malfoy that night the three gryffindors and malfoy met with filch who took them out to hagrid hagrid explained that they were going to look for a wounded unicorn harry wondered who would dare harm such a pure and gentle creature hagrid took them into the forbidden forest and showed them a pool of silvery unicorn blood they ran into two centaurs who didntanswer hagrid inquiries about any strange going on in the forest except to say that mars was unusually bright tonight hagrid split them into two groups to make the search easier and faster at malfoy insistence hagrid boarhound fang went with him and harry while hagrid took ron and hermione with him after an hour harry and malfoy were having difficulty following the path as it wound deeper and deeper into the forest suddenly harry saw the silvery white body of a unicorn before they could approach it a shadowy cloaked figure seemed to glide down to it and started to drink its blood malfoy screamed and ran off followed by fang harry stood rooted to the spot then dropped to his knees as the lightning scar on his forehead burst into pain the cloaked figure started moving towards harry then with a clatter of hooves another centaur burst into the area and drove the figure away the centaur knew who harry was he introduced himself as firenze and placed harry on his back heading for the forest edge suddenly firenze turned his head to look at harry harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no harry replied we only use the horn and tail hair in potions i ve never heard of unicorn blood being used to obtain the blood one would need to kill the unicorn and that is a monstrous thing firenze said it is a hideous crime committed only by someone who has nothing to lose but everything to gain for unicorn blood will keep you alive even if you are but an inch from death but at a terrible price to slay such a wondrous and innocent creature and drink its blood causes one to have a cursed life a half life from the moment the blood touches one lips who could be that desperate harry asked i d have thought death would be preferable to such a state yes firenze said yet one can be that desperate if it would keep you alive long enough to get something that will return to one to full strength and power especially if that also made one incapable to dying do you know harry potter what is hidden in your school at the moment of course the philosopher stone which can be used to produce the elixir of life but who would want can you not think of anyone who would do anything to return and to live again harry felt a sudden rush of fear and cold his parents didnttalk much about the night he had gotten his scar all harry knew about it was from some books and he had never been too curious of what had really happened to voldemort since he wanted to distance himself from the fame hagrid had told him once that he had simple disappeared and he believed that voldemort wasntreally dead you dontthink that voldemort just then hagrid arrived with ron and hermione and firenze said goodbye when they got back to the common room harry told his two friends what had happened and what firenze had insinuated he was still shaken by the implications all this time we thought snape wanted to steal it all for himself harry said to sell it to someone else we never thought he d steal it for voldemort he ignored the shudder that went through ron at the mention of his name yeah we never thought of that possibility harry said raving did you notice tonight that snape seemed happier and quirrell just wasnttalking he must have caved in to snape all snape needs to do is find out how to get past fluffy then he can give the stone to voldemort harrry please stop saying that name ron whispered fervently his face pale yeah all i have to wait for now is for snape to steal the stone harry went on then voldemort can finish me off like he was going to do ten years ago harry hermione said looking frightened people have said that the only wizard you know who fears is dumbledore and he here at hogwarts as long as dumbledore is here you know who wouldntdare come here looking for you you re safe as long as dumbledore is here harry took some comfort in those words he wanted to owl his parents but was afraid that they would pull him out of hogwarts he had come to love the school and he didntwant to leave his friends he decided that as long as dumbledore was there he didntneed to worry about voldemort soon exams took all thoughts of voldemort and the stone from their heads they proved to be both harder and easier than they had imagined the stress was so bad that even hermione breathed a sigh of relief when the last exam ended on friday the three headed down to the entrance hall with ron narrating how he would spend the next few days of relaxation harry on the other hand still had a problem his scar had been aching since exams started he had thought it was due to the stress yet even with them over the scar was still throbbing he mentioned it to his two friends hermione had suggested he go to the school nurse but harry insisted that it might be a warning sign of danger danger ron asked relax harry what possible danger could there be with dumbledore around i mean we never had proof that snape found a way around fluffy he nearly lost a leg that one time malfoy ll be singing praises to gryffindor before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry suddenly realized something and headed off the two running to catch up he slowed down only when they arrived at hagrid hut hagrid was sitting on the front steps whittling on a piece of wood hey yeh three hagrid called exams all done how about some tea not right now hagrid harry asked sitting down next to him we need to ask you something that night you got the dragon egg did you recognize the man who you won it from well harry hagrid said i dunno he wouldn take his cloak off he raised his eyebrows at their stunned looks look yeh get lots of odd folk at the hog head pub all the time never saw his face as he had his hood up did he seem interested in your work did he ask about hogwarts well i think it came up hagrid said his face screwing up as he tried to remember i not sure cause he kept buyin me drinks yeah he asked what i did an i tol him i was gamekeeper here then we talked about the sorta creatures i cared fer then i hap ned to mention i d always wanted a dragon then then he said he had a dragon egg on him an we could play cards fer it but he had ta know if i could take care of it he didntwanta send it to just anyone so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy then he asked me how much trouble fluffy was so i told him that fluffy a piece a cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play a bit o music and he falls right to sleep hagrid then looks horrified forget i said that hey where yeh goin harry ron and hermione tore off running back to the castle we ve got to find dumbledore harry said come on my dad told me where to find his office soon they came to the gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the headmaster office as they were figuring out how to get around it they heard a voice call out what are you three doing there they turned around to find professor mcgonagall coming towards them several books in her arms professor we ve got to see the headmaster hermione said whatever for miss granger she said her eyes narrowing with suspicion we just do professor it very important harry said mcgonagall nostrils flared well whatever the reason it ll have to wait the headmaster isnthere right now he received an urgent owl from the ministry in london just a half hour ago he left immediately by broom what he canthave left harry cried getting agitated professor tell him to come back it about the philosopher stone we think it ll be stolen tonight mcgonagall dropped the books in her arms in surprise then said how did you find out about that what do you mean stolen please professor hermione pleaded we have to call dumbledore back mcgonagall looked at them for a while with suspicion replacing her shock finally she said professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow i dontknow how you found out about the stone but rest assured it too well protected but professor that my final word potter weasley miss granger leave the matter to your elders now go outside and enjoy the weather instead of going outside the three headed back to the entrance hall they ran into snape who looked suspiciously at them commenting that gryffindors shouldntwaste such good sunshine by being indoors when they were back in the empty common room harry turned to the other two it ll happen tonight with dumbledore gone snape will have the best chance to get the stone for voldemort tonight harry ignored ron shudders what are we going to do hermione asked harry looked thoughtful then said that it then i going out there tonight i going to get the stone before snape does harry you cantdo that hermione said they might expel you it doesntmatter hermione harry said dontyou understand if voldemort gets his hands on the stone from snape he ll be whole again even immortal you dontknow what it was like when he was trying to take over i ve heard the stories from sirius and remus even overheard my parents a couple of times talking about it it was very bad it ll be like that again there wontbe a hogwarts to get expelled from the house cup quidditch all that wontmatter to him he going to come around and try to finish what he started he tried to kill me once he may even try to kill my family the potters have always fought the dark side he cantallow us to live i wontlet him try to murder us like he did so many people back then not if i can help it i sure my dad would understand you re right harry ron said pale my family the same they ll never give in to you know who he ll try to kill them too i going with you you two are crazy hermione said staring at the two boys crazy but so brave all right i going with you two you may need someone with brains to see you through this hey ron said harry smiled all right together then all for one and one for all like the three musketeers ron groaned didntthey all die chapter 59 the green lord and the white ram disclaimer rose andrew and daisy potter daniel granger maggie longbottom and ti malfoy black are my own creations everything else is part of the wonderful work of jkr and is not being used for any personal profit moody was buried in a cemetery at the edge of the forbidden forest beyond the vegetable patches and greenhouses where other teachers without any family were buried it was rumored that professor binns body was buried in the same graveyard after the burial harry and his friends and their parents guardians sought each other out how are you doing harry lily asked as she hugged him i guess i ll be okay mum harry said ginny been making sure i dontget all moody and depressed he sensed and saw ginny embarrassment as her face turned as red as her hair he grinned inwardly lily hugged ginny and murmured thank you for taking care of my boy a anytime lily ginny said turning even redder if that was possible i ll get you for this potter she said in harry mind harry just grinned as he turned to his father lily turned to hug rose she also greeted ron and hermione who were also there with them neville and maggie were a few feet away talking to their parents and ti was conversing with sirius and tonks fred and george were also talking to their parents that was a great speech son james said clapping harry on the shoulder it really told them what going on thanks dad harry said grinning at his father i just felt i had to tell them some of the truth ginny said the same thing you did she did did she james said grinning at the petite redhead standing beside harry i knew she d be good for you ginny looked down as her face again turned as red as her hair sirius walked up to harry great speech harry he said it makes me proud to be your godfather i hope my kid turns out just like you with you and sam as his parents i think he ll be even better harry said gee thanks harry sirius said grinning molly and arthur came up to them then molly hugged her daughter then she hugged ron harry and rose you did well harry molly said telling everyone that we needed to continue fighting you know who i just wished you didnthave to see alastor die like that i wish i didnteither harry said arthur placed a gentle hand on harry shoulder we know harry it not something someone your age should see yet but i guess with v v voldemort now active again it was only a matter of time just dontlet it get you down okay i ll try arthur harry said thank you arthur smiled you re welcome son it swelled harry heart to hear ginny father call him that then he remembered he had something to ask his father and turned back to james uh dad harry said toning his voice down so only his father could hear him i haventhad a chance to ask you this were you able to question barty crouch jr ah i was wondering when you d ask me that james said yes sirius and i were able to question him what did you find out harry asked james sighed i canttell you son harry started to get angry but james immediately added at least not here most of what we found out is supposed to be limited to ministry and auror personnel wait until we get home to potter manor where we can discuss things fully okay harry sighed in turn all right dad i ll wait until then good james said we ll have a lot to talk about with voldemort now coming out into the open we have a lot of plans to make for now we have to go we ll see you guys tomorrow at king cross station harry lily said hugging him again okay mum harry said hugging her back lily hugged both rose and ginny goodbye as well harry and ginny hugged and bade goodbye to molly and arthur then turned to sirius well sirius said i ve got to go too i need to get back to that lovely pregnant wife of mine bye kids see you tomorrow the adults headed for the gates of hogwarts so they could apparate away the ten children headed back to the castle huddled together in a group the rest of the students had already returned to the castle the pensive silence between them as they walked was broken after a few minutes by hermione i not sure you should have said anything about v voldemort harry the bushy haired girl said softly why that hermione ron asked i thought what he said was brilliant harry really told them off you heard dumbledore and harry dad they all thought it was a great speech i bet even ginny said so i dontdispute that it was a very good speech ronald hermione said tartly i just think harry should not have said anything about v voldemort regaining his body people will wonder how he knew about it come on hermione neville said what would it matter people know voldemort back i dontthink it ll matter to people how he came back i dontknow neville hermione said i just have a bad feeling what harry said may be used against him whatever hermione rose said the important thing is that harry told them that the fight against voldemort has to go on professor dumbledore agreed with that you heard him all right all right hermione conceded i agree with both of them that we need to go on fighting voldemort good harry said quietly now that that is settled let go to the room of requirement we need to discuss something they followed him up to the seventh floor and the secret room behind the blank wall when they were all sitting in a room that was an exact copy of the gryffindor common room harry said i asked you all to come up here because i think it time the rest of my friends learn something ron hermione ginny and rose already know he looked at fred george ti neville and maggie you see about thirteen years ago a prophecy was made about voldemort a prophecy given by professor trelawney now i know she mostly a fraud but this was a real one he took a deep breath it goes like this the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies what does that mean ti asked well hermione said the first part means that the one who can defeat voldemort once and for all was born near the end of july to parents who had defied voldemort three times already maggie eyes widened and she looked at her brother could it have been you neville patted her hand yes mags it could have been me our parents had defied voldemort three times by then but it didntturn out that way since there was another baby who fulfilled those requirements he looked at harry harry parents had also defied voldemort three times and he was born only a day after me that quite astute of you to figure it out quickly neville hermione said not really hermione neville said my parents told me about the prophecy last august before we went back to school professor dumbledore had told them about it after i was born they decided to tell me about it when they were told that voldemort was back he turned to maggie they didnttell you sprite because they thought it would be too traumatic for you to know voldemort could have attacked us as well maggie patted neville hand that okay neville i understand just dontdo it again neville grinned and nodded so fred began if it could have been harry or neville how did harry become the one in the prophecy george asked look at the second part of the prophecy guys ginny said it talks about voldemort marking his future foe as his equal it seemed someone heard the first part of the prophecy and told tom seeing a danger he decided to act he found out that harry and neville were the only possible candidates but he chose to attack harry and his family first he then marked harry as his equal when his killing curse backfired and cause that scar on harry forehead then the prophecy means that harry ti said i the only one who can defeat voldemort for good harry said a little bitter i some sort of chosen one you will defeat him harry ginny said to him taking his hand you hear me you ll meet him and beat that monster i hope so gin harry said but there more to it the first prophecy doesntsay who will win just that one has to kill the other to go on to live a real life but there another prophecy that more specific as to who can win it was given less than a year ago and speaks of several people whose help is necessary for the chosen one to defeat voldemort who gave this prophecy neville asked not trelawney again no harry said you d actually know her who was it fred questioned who gave that prophecy george asked me rose said softly fred george ti neville and maggie looked at her in surprise i ve been seeing flashes of things happening before they did like when that butterbeer bottle exploded in ron hand during the yule ball and the squid helping harry during the second task of the triwizard professor dumbledore and my parents think i a seer believe me i was as surprised as you are when they said that rose said sounding almost as bitter as her brother had a while ago neville gave a low whistle well if someone was going to be a seer it would have to be you rose glared at him what do you mean by that longbottom neville smirked since harry seems to be the one chosen to defeat voldemort it just seems fair that his sister would have a power all her own he ignored the glare rose continued to give him wait a minute ti said we re getting ahead of ourselves what does this second prophecy say exactly well harry said i think it went like this they gather now they who would stand by the chosen one his six companions bonded by love deep and true the soul mate his other half his strength the seer his sister in blood his guide the wise lady his sister in all but blood his font of knowledge the strategist his best friend his right hand the green lord his equal in power his general the white ram saved from evil by him his left hand training they need together to defeat the dark lord let not one be lost or all will be for naught and the dark lord will defeat the chosen one so the chosen one is supposed to have six companions who will help him defeat this dark lord if they work together yes hermione said that what we figured out we presumed that the dark lord is voldemort since his followers use that title when talking about him so who are the six helpers supposed to be ti asked have you guys thought about who they are based on the clues given in each line harry said i think some of them are here i mean who else but ginny is my soul mate the seer is obviously rose hand down the wise lady is hermione since i consider her almost a sister and we know how smart she is the strategist is ron no one has been able to beat him in chess or other strategy games it the last two people we re somewhat stuck on yeah ron said who are the green lord and the white ram i think the green lord is neville rose said what greener than plants and who else is brilliant in herbology how can that be neville said i not equal to harry in power there one way to find out harry said professor dumbledore has a spell that detects the magical level of a person based on the color starting with black for muggles up to white showing the most power also brightness of the color is another indication of power level let see what was the incantation i think it was potentia ostendo harry ginny said that right harry said thanks gin he turned to neville i think i can cast it and we can see he drew his wand and pointed it at neville ready nev when neville nodded harry waved his wand over him and cried potentia ostendo a white light surrounded neville almost blinding everyone when the light subsided the room was eerily silent finally ron spoke up bloody hell ron language hermione chastised but then i agree with you that was incredible it seems the prophecy is right ginny said that about the same level of brightness that harry showed when professor dumbledore tested him so rose is probably right and neville is the green lord in the prophecy all right ron said so who is this white ram then that where i stumped hermione said sighing if we re right about the identities of the companions we ve made the white ram has to be someone about our age then based on the line in the prophecy it has to be someone harry as the chosen one has saved that about right hermione rose said but the line talks about the white ram being saved as in the past tense it must mean that harry already saved him or her by the time i gave the prophecy that happened during the summer before we got to school so the only person who d qualify would be ginny but since she the soul mate it cantbe her then who is it ron asked clearly exasperated wait a minute ginny said harry what the first line again it something about gathering um i think it goes they gather now they who would stand by the chosen one harry answered her why rose has a point that the prophecy was stated with the timing in mind ginny said the first three words of the prophecy are they gather now as in the six companions are already connected or friends with you ginny right hermione said her eyes lighting up look at the ones we ve identified ginny rose ron me and neville yes harry exclaimed my soul mate sisters and best friends that right plus you re all part of the new marauders therefore whoever the white ram is he or she was already a part of our group by the time rose gave the prophecy then who is it ron asked the only ones left among the new marauders are fred george maggie and ti ginny said i think the white ram is ti look at the imagery if being the green lord refers to neville and his success in herbology being the white ram has to mean something significant with ti a white ram harry said thinking deeply wait a minute what is the term used when one refers to a person who is at odds with his family character a black sheep hermione cried yes harry that must be it the malfoys are among the strongest supporters of the dark arts someone who would be opposite to that would be considered white and a ram is a male sheep that settles it harry said ti must be the white ram in the prophecy he looked over at ti who now looked nervous and apprehensive hey mate what wrong i dontknow ti said his voice soft and unsure i in a prophecy i supposed to help you against v v voldemort harry sat beside the thirteen year old and clasped his shoulder hey i know how you feel when my parents told me about the first prophecy i was scared i mean i just a kid and i supposed to kill off the most powerful dark wizard of all time it a bit overwhelming but remember there are six of you in the prophecy you arentin this alone now i know i not against voldemort by myself we re all in this together if we stick together we can do this and kick his ass once and for all so o chosen one ron said a smirk on his face how do we do that watch it ron harry said smiling at his redheaded best friend dontbandy that title around or i ll show you how great the chosen one is but to answer your question we first continue what we ve been doing lately with the workouts and martial arts sessions then i have the rest of you train in dueling like what i ve been doing i sure dad sirius and professor dumbledore will help with that it ll take time but we can do it harry then noticed that maggie had a sad look on her face he knelt down in front of the first year and asked what wrong maggie maggie turned red and looked down at her feet it nothing she said softly harry gently lifted her chin with his right thumb and index finger come on it has to be something if you look like that we re your friends too not just your brother s you re part of our little group maggie stared at harry with tear filled eyes i not in the prophecy harry looked at her in surprise he looked at neville who looked troubled but shrugged harry turned his attention back to maggie now maggie harry said being in a prophecy isntsomething you d like all it does is place unwanted pressure on you do you really want to be in a prophecy that says what you have to do i certainly dontwant to be but you re in that first prophecy she said yeah said feeling a bit uncomfortable but look at what it wants me to do kill someone even if it an evil git like voldemort i have no choice in the matter i d rather not face that monster but i have to because the prophecy says i the only one who can get rid of him for good with this other prophecy sis neville said ginny ron rose hermione me and ti all have to help harry or it says he wontwin it gives us our roles we have no choice as to what those roles will be you on the other hand have a choice you can help us stay away from us or even run off and hide now i think you wontdo either of the last two but at least it your choice being free to choose what we want to do is something precious maggie hermione said it a basic right being in a prophecy removes that and it dreadful harry said you surely dontwant something as awful as that right anyway maggie fred said the two of us george said arentin rose prophecy either fred said so we can do what we like george said of course we couldntthink of walking away from the others but at least it our choice george said you see sis neville said the three of you arentmentioned in rose prophecy but now you can help anyway you like i d like that maggie said softly can i train with you guys again harry smiled of course all ten of us will be undergoing training if i can arrange it even you all of the new marauders will go through the same thing just then ron stomach gave a loud rumble startling all of them for a moment before they all laughed i guess not even discussing how to defeat voldemort can keep ron from getting hungry harry said grinning at his friend i ll talk with my dad and see how we can resume our training this summer for now let get some lunch they left the room of requirement and descended to the great hall for lunch after the meal they spent the afternoon in the common room playing wizard chess exploding snap and gobstones harry and ginny took a walk around the lake after supper just enjoying each other company harry invisibility cloak and the marauder map in his pocket when they got back to the common room it was past curfew only fred and george were in the common room sitting at a corner table working over some parchment curious harry and ginny walked over to them hey guys harry asked what are you working on i sure it not homework since the term over nah of course not fred said it just some plans george said plans ginny asked plans for what the twins grinned at each other well sister dear fred said you do know george said that we ve only got fred said one year left here george said we ve decided that zonko s fred said could use some competition george said so we plan to fred said open a joke shop of our own george said that brilliant harry said with all the things you ve done so far you d do well we know fred said smiling the smile slipped from his face then of course it won t be for a few years george said we need to save some money yeah fred said we still haventgot enough galleons to rent a space at diagon alley george said you need some startup cash harry asked wait a minute without another word he dashed up the stairs to his dormitory fred and george looked inquisitively at ginny who only smiled back at them a minute later harry came back down and threw a bag onto the table in front of the twins the unmistakable sound of metal came from the bag as it hit the table whoa is that fred said your triwizard winnings george finished yeah harry said it my third of the prize money three hundred thirty three galleons five sickles and nineteen knuts wait a minute harry fred said we canttake it george said pushing the bag towards harry you can and you will harry said look guys i dontneed it i have enough from my allowance i dontwant it because it only a reminder of what happened to moody we re going to need a lot to laugh about in the coming years i ve heard from my parents about how bad it was the first time voldemort was around i ve a feeling it ll be worse so take it think of it as an investment okay all right harry fred said thanks o future brother in law george said grinning oh shut it you ginny said punching george arm playfully sure you want this one harry george asked rubbing his arm where ginny had hit it yeah pretty violent she is fred said oh definitely harry said that one of her endearing qualities good answer harry ginny said pulling his head down to capture his lips with hers eww fred said i think we ll continue our work george said in our dorm and leave fred said you two love birds alone george said harry and ginny didntanswer them caught up again in their own world fred and george just shook their heads and went up the stairs to their dormitory the next day the entire student body gathered at the train station of hogsmeade for the train ride home harry and his friends took one compartment near the rear of the train for themselves except for ti maggie fred and george who decided to spend some time with their other friends as the train wound its way through the british countryside neville and ron faced each other over a chessboard with rose watching hermione had her head in another book harry and ginny were cuddled together against the window ginny was asleep with her head on harry shoulder harry was facing towards the window but his eyes didntsee any of the scenery his mind was busy thinking of plans on how to fulfill the prophecies in their favor he knew that voldemort would stop at nothing to win the coming war harry was just as determined to defeat him and be rid of him for good all too soon the train was pulling up to king cross station harry and his friends gathered their things ti maggie fred and george joined them in the corridor of their train car harry let the rest exit the train ahead of him he looked around and saw his parents molly arthur sirius sam and remus coming toward them this was his family and friends his heart swelled with the knowledge of their support for him he was sure that with them by his side he would succeed in defeating voldemort he just hoped that all of them would survive it would be a long road but hopefully if they stayed true to each other they would emerge victorious in the end a n well we ve reached the end of this story but dontworry harry and his friends will be back in a new story soon harry potter and the prophesized six it will be almost completely au and not follow the rest of the books sorry no horcruxes i just dontwant to be like the other stories thanks for reading i hope you ll wait for the next one merry christmas and a happy new year to all disclaimer i dontown harry potter or any other characters created by jkr a n some of the readers may have seen a different chapter 6 i have replaced it with this since my betas on another site thought the original was too much a paraphrase of the original i may post it later here as an outtake to show what happened in the meantime enjoy this new chapter chapter 6 after saving the stone harry blearily opened his eyes he couldntsee very well since his glasses were not on his face a blurred figure seemed to hover above him then harry felt his glasses being placed on his nose and the image sharpened into the face of professor dumbledore suddenly harry remembered everything he ron and hermione had been confronted by neville longbottom leaving the gryffindor common room after curfew unexpectedly he had insisted on going with them to help them four people were a tight fit for harry invisibility cloak fortunately they didntmeet anyone in the corridors they had found fluffy already asleep and managed to go down the trapdoor without waking him landing right on top of some kind of vines neville told them it was devil snare and explained how to destroy it before it strangled them neville proved quite helpful after that helping the trio chase down a flying key to open the next door and aiding ron in chess strategy needed for them to beat a lifesized game of wizard chess however both he and ron were injured forcing harry and hermione to leave them hermione used logic to figure out a puzzle involving some potions get past some black flames into the next room unfortunately potion dose was only enough for one person so harry sent her back to take the other two boys to the hospital wing and send an owl to dumbledore harry was surprised to find not snape in the next room but quirrell who was no longer stuttering and inept he quickly binded harry and then turned his attention to a large ornate mirror in the room harry read some strange words that made better sense read backwards he then realized that it was the mirror of erised from a description he had seen and read in a book in the potter manor library when quirrell tried to use harry to find the stone in the mirror harry was surprised to see his reflection pull it out of its pocket then discovered it was in his own pocket quirrell then revealed to harry what was under his turban voldemort himself attached to the back to quirrell head like some ugly parasite voldemort tried to get harry to give him the stone but harry saw through his lies and realized this man had tried to kill him as a baby and would not hesitate to do so voldemort tried to get quirrell to grab harry and take the stone but quirrell burned himself on touching harry bare skin harry then managed to throw quirrell off and use his wand to throw a spell at quirrell a spell he dimly remembered voldemort throwing at his mother that night he tried to kill harry the expelliarmus spell quirrell skull cracked on contact with the stone wall and voldemort sped away like a ghost vowing to return the last thing harry remembered was growing weak and sleepy now harry had only one thing on his mind professor he said to dumbledore the philosopher stone quirrell tried to get it what happened to it calm down my boy dumbledore said dontworry it no longer a problem but sir relax harry please dumbledore said otherwise madame pomfrey will throw me out harry now had a good look around he was lying on a bed with white linen sheets in a room full of similar beds he realized that this must be the hospital wing now i will answer your questions before i summon your family who are quite concerned for you dumbledore said in fact they only just left to get a spot of dinner harry then felt sick his parents everything must have taken place earlier than just last night for them to be at hogwarts already what would they say putting himself in such danger he turned to the headmaster again sir how long have i been lying here he asked dumbledore how are ron and neville you ve been here three days already harry your friends ronald weasley hermione granger and neville longbottom are quite all right but have been worried about you but sir what about the stone quirrell wanted it for you know who ah the stone dumbledore was silent for a while be reassured that neither professor quirrell nor voldemort got the stone when i got there i was in time to see the shade of voldemort fleeing the room i would have chased after him but i was more concerned for you as for the stone it has been destroyed but if the stone has been destroyed what will happen to nicolas flamel and his wife wontthey die i afraid so nicolas and i had a talk and agreed it would be best to destroy the stone lest voldemort or someone else make another attempt to get it but they reassured me that they had enough elixir of life to allow them to set their affairs into order dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement and concern on harry face do not worry harry they have lived a long and wonderful life together the love they share will carry them on for death is but another adventure harry lay back pondering what dumbledore had said dumbledore just sat there admiring the ceiling as he hummed some tune professor harry said at last i was thinking now that the stone is gone does that mean that vol volde i mean you know who say his name harry dumbledore said kindly fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself yes sir harry said without the stone will voldemort ever come back i mean he not gone is he no harry dumbledore said sadly i afraid he still out there somewhere perhaps trying to get another body but not being truly alive he canttruly be killed even then you have delayed his return to power there are other ways he may return to his original state and there are other followers beside quirrell who may try to help him but if he is constantly delayed or thwarted then he may never return to power professor harry said why is it that quirrell couldntbear to touch me the mere contact with my skin burned him ah yes dumbledore said well harry when professor quirrell started drinking unicorn blood to keep voldemort alive he became as evil and monstrous as voldemort you have on you a mark granted by your mother when she tried stand between you and voldemort harry hand went to his forehead to touch his scar no not that scar or any physical mark dumbledore continued but a mark of love within your very skin something as pure and good as love cannot be understood by voldemort so it caused him agony to touch something marked by it harry smiled at his words he had always felt that love from his family dumbledore looked kindly at him a twinkle in his eyes one last thing professor harry said how did i get the stone out of the mirror i ve heard of it before i read somewhere that it lets you see your deepest desires yet the most contented man will only see himself ah yes the mirror dumbledore smiled that one of my more ingenious ideas if i say so myself you see only someone who wanted to find the stone find it and not use it would be able to now i believe those very people who love you are here just then the doors of the hospital wing burst open and several people came hurrying in harry looked up and groaned at the sight of his mother and father bearing down on him harry james potter few things could match his mother in full fury strangely among those that did were his sister molly weasley and ginny weasley redheads an hour later lily had calmed down enough to allow her son to explain things luckily madame pomfrey allowed ron and hermione to visit harry soon after his parents had arrived and they helped him narrate all that had occurred the older potters told harry that they had left rose with the weasleys but had owled her that her brother was fine james smiled down at his son as he sat beside him great work son i proud of you you threw a real great spell more powerful than many of my colleagues you ll make a great auror someday harry beamed at the praise he had always been afraid he wouldntmatch up to his father in spite of the boy who lived title james lily chided from the other side of harry dontencourage the boy it bad enough he lied to me when he was researching about flamel but he went up against vol vol voldemort harry looked at his mother with admiration all these years she always used you know who when referring to voldemort a healer trained in muggle psychiatry techniques had attributed it to trauma from the attack well lily james retorted call it payback for what he tried to do to harry all those years ago i just sorry he still around dad mum harry said quietly i was wondering just now it seemed voldemort went to a lot of trouble then i mean using peter and all just to find us and try to kill me i mean i was just a year old then what threat could i be to him harry couldntmiss the looks exchanged by his parents now harry his father said you know we were strong opponents of him and his followers he was going around killing any enemies since i come from an ancient line of purebloods and your mother is muggleborn it natural for him to target us he just tried to kill you first to torture us dontconcern yourself over it harry his mother added whatever reason he had to try to kill you it doesntmatter since he ll never have a chance to try again harry could sense that they seemed to be hiding something but since he was still a bit tired he let it drop for now soon madame pomfrey came in and told his parents and friends that they had to let harry rest some more harry soon drifted off to sleep after seeing ron and hermione to gryffindor tower james and lily joined dumbledore in his office as soon as the door closed james stomped up to dumbledore who was seated behind his desk really headmaster this has gone too far james please calm down lily said no lily james said i have to get this off my chest in spite of what i told harry i was dismayed and shocked by what happened i know you also were scared by this but you took it out on our son but the ultimate responsibility for this rests with the headmaster i afraid he right lily dumbledore said please sit down both of you dumbledore conjured two cushioned chairs in front of his desk and the elder potters sat down on them all right then professor lily said fixing him with a glare that often frightened her husband and children what were you thinking when you placed the stone here then there that three headed dog of hagrid s how could you hide them in a school please understand lily james dumbledore said at the time we werentsure who was trying to steal the stone being a good friend of nicolas i offered to keep it for safekeeping i reasoned at the time that no one would think to look for it in a school unfortunately you didntcount on quirrell james said dumbledore sighed yes i had no idea he had gone so far into the dark let alone become a supporter of voldemort in asking the help of my fellow teachers i let him know where the stone was fortunately your son has once again stopped him the three adults were silent for a few minutes then lily said professor please my dear dumbledore interrupted you two can call me albus it been more than ten years since i was your professor all right albus lily amended blushing a bit harry expressed curiosity as to why voldemort had tried to kill him ten years ago we managed to give him excuses albus james said but eventually i think we may have to tell him about the prophecy james no lily said he has to know lily james said he got a right to know it his life and this concerns him but he still too young lily said tears forming in her eyes james moved to her kneeling in front of her and cradling her in his arms i know what you re thinking love i his father i want to spare him from this as much as you but it something he ll have to face someday it best he be prepared that way he ll have the best chance to survive and go on with his life dumbledore sighed i understand james concern lily with this reappearance of voldemort we must assume that the prophecy will be fulfilled in the next few years we have to prepare harry for that however he held up his hand to forestall any angry comment from the redheaded woman we will do it slowly so as not to arouse his suspicion for now we will not let him know of the prophecy maybe by his fifteenth birthday it would be right james and lily agreed reluctantly to dumbledore idea specifics could be worked out later the couple thanked dumbledore and went to the guest quarters in the teachers wing where they had been staying since they got word of what had happened to their son they hoped he would be better the next morning the nurse ran her wand over harry and proclaimed him fit enough to leave the hospital wing that night in time for the leaving feast his parents spent an hour visiting him before hugging him goodbye promising to meet him when the express came in to platform 9 when he went out the door of the hospital wing he was surprised to find ron hermione and neville waiting for him hi guys he said to them glad you came to get me neville grinned that all right quite an adventure we had eh harry grinned back as did ron boys hermione said indignant before breaking out into a little smile of her own the four gryffindors walked down towards the great hall say neville harry said that was quite a good bit of flying you did i know ron is quite good but frankly i was surprised you were that good thanks harry neville said my dad and i fly around longbottom mansion grounds once in a while do you play quidditch ron asked well dad was a chaser on the ravenclaw team for his last three years here we often toss the quaffle between us but never had enough people to play well harry said why dontyou come over to potter manor or the burrow this summer it too bad i never got to know the kids of my dad co workers but i think its time i did neville grinned sure be glad to harry turned to hermione maybe we can get mum to let you come too hermione as our friend ron and i d like you to get to know our families yeah ron said especially our sisters quite a pair those two are may be good for them to have an older sister to control them ron failed to see the scowl form on hermione face well hermione said my parents are taking me to france for two weeks but we ll be back by the end of july so maybe i can visit you then great harry said just in time for my birthday by now the four gryffindors had arrived at the great halls doors and entered to enjoy the end of term feast by the end of the evening harry thought it was one of his best evenings initially the hall had been decked in slytherin colors of green and silver since slytherin had won the house cup for the seventh year in a row then dumbledore had awarded some last minute points to gryffindor for the events of the stone forty points had been awarded each to neville ron and hermione and fifty had been awarded to harry for outstanding courage and loyalty to the light so gryffindor ended up beating slytherin by two points for the house cup with a wave of dumbledore hand the green and silver were replaced by gryffindor red and gold and the huge banner behind him changed to that bearing the proud gryffindor lion amidst thunderous applause from all except the slytherins the four gryffindors were repeatedly congratulated by their house mates harry had looked at the high table to see hagrid beaming at him and snape stiffly shaking mcgonagall hand a false smile plastered on his face the potions master turned to his direction and from the look on his face harry was sure his next year in potions would not be good harry didntcare a fig the feast was even more wonderful than usual yes he would remember this night as one of his best at hogwarts yet he couldnt wait to tell rose and ginny about it the next day the grounds of hogwarts was in chaos as the students hurried to catch the hogwarts express back to london harry managed to get a compartment for him ron and hermione he pulled neville in to join them and the twins soon showed up to sit with them they spent the trip back talking and laughing harry and ron got into a friendly discussion with neville over the chudley cannons quidditch team hermione discussed some ideas the twins had on tricks and pranks for a while but she mostly had her nose in a book soon they arrived at the platform harry pulled neville and hermione with him when he and ron went over to greet their families dad mum he said as they came up to him with rose this is neville longbottom neville my parents oh that my sister rose she ll be joining us next year at hogwarts together with ron sister ginny rose rolled her eyes gee thanks for remembering me big brother she shyly smiled at the slightly pudgy boy who also smiled back so you re frank and alice boy james said i glad harry got to know you in hogwarts your parents are among the best aurors under me it a pity we never had time to get to know each other family neville beamed at the praise for his parents it an honor to meet you sir and mrs potter shaking their hands dad harry said i was wondering if neville and hermione could come over some time they re both their parents only children and it probably gets lonely for them during summer neville can stay in my room and i sure rose wouldntmind another girl with her harry harry his father said amused at his son nervousness okay it okay i sure we can accommodate them i ll just have to adjust the wards at potter manor for the two of them harry grinned thanks dad of course lily said that wontbe for at least a couple of weeks harry eyebrows rose in question well young man lily said we still arenthappy with you for going into danger to prove our point you re grounded for two weeks you ll stay in your room doing homework no telly or videogames not even going to the burrow at any rate i sure molly will have ron too busy to make up for his part in your little escapade harry looked at his mother in horror and then scowled at the grin on his sister face neville looked away in embarrassment harry saw ron nearby red faced as his mother was scolding him ginny was standing behind her mother wearing a look of both amusement and sympathy on her face hermione came over to the potters leading her parents who were dentists they seemed a bit apprehensive but harry mother soon put them at ease after agreeing to allow their daughter to visit potter manor they followed their daughter to meet the weasleys harry noticed a smile creep on ron face as he watched hermione approach his family interesting he moved up to the weasleys with rose he was immediately smothered in a hug by molly weasley how are you harry dear the things you and ron get into really it okay mrs weasley harry said his voice muffled from within her arms have you met our other friend hermione he asked hoping to distract her why yes mrs weasley said pulling back ron was just introducing her i think its good of you to befriend her she must have felt out of place at hogwarts being muggleborn ron introduced hermione to ginny who was now standing side by side with rose the two redheads looked similar though ginny had freckles all over her face ron looked to ginny you know i thought it would be good for you and rose to have an older girl as a friend maybe she ll be able to control you two ginny and rose scowled then ginny stepped on his foot while rose hit him hard on the arm oww what was that for ron shouted at the two redheads hopping on one foot while rubbing his arm he scowled at harry and hermione who were covering their mouths with their hands shaking that was for being such a git ron ginny said glaring you re lucky we dont have our wands yet you better watch out ron harry teased next term these two are going to be a real terror you better believe it harry rose said we heard what you ron hermione and the twins were up to and we want in harry eyes widened in shock and concern well they were five now two more couldnt hurt maybe neville would like to join the new marauders rounding their number up to eight later as he and his family walked to the ministry car his father was allowed to use on occasion harry reminisced about the past year and thought about the coming summer he looked forward to neville and hermione visiting he d even have a joint birthday celebration with neville he was surprised to learn that neville birthday was just a day before his of course he d have to get through his enforced confinement first merlin he grimaced he wondered how he would survive two weeks without ron television his music and even videogames he just hoped the next two weeks would pass quickly disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter 7 summer talks harry was seated at the mahogany desk of his room scratching with a quill on some parchment numerous books spread open around the same desk pausing he looked out the window and frowned outside the weather was bright and sunny and he could see the little figure of his sister floating around on a broom it had been a tough two weeks with him stuck in his room doing nothing but homework at least he ate his meals with the rest of his family in the dining room thankfully today was the last day of his punishment now if only i could finish this potions essay for the nth time he silently cursed snape for being a git who else would have given so much summer homework four feet on the uses of troll blood three feet on the properties of european waterplants and five feet on the results of mixing any of the potions they had done in the past year every combination at least his father had agreed with his opinion of snape in general and the homework in particular but his mother insisted he finish it before he would be allowed to enjoy his summer now harry picked up a ruler and measured his work on the last essay he put it down in disgust he was still short six inches even if he wrote in rather large letters he wondered what else he could find to fill it he looked again out the window seeing rose now flying low over their mother flower garden harry sighed rose had not made the last two weeks any easier teasing him by playing the radio in her room and the telly in the family room on high volume and flying past his bedroom window every so often not to mention talking about her constant visits to the burrow of course she also told him about ron being stuck with all sorts of chores as his version of grounding this filled harry with a mixture of relief that he wasntalone in his suffering and guilt that he was the reason for ron punishment harry sighed again and turned back to his essay after twenty minutes of searching through the books around him he threw down his quill in frustration he moved to his bed and threw himself on top of it lying down on his back with his hands behind his head he needed a break harry gazed wistfully around his room there was an empty space in the middle of his cabinet about the right size for a television his parents had removed it along with his playstation and atari videogames as part of his punishment even his old toy chest was locked up sometimes he wondered if it had been worth it but then he d rather be bored than cowering and waiting for voldemort to come get him again he thought about his confrontation with old snakeface as he had now come to call him over the past two weeks as he lay on his bed at night he had wondered about the reason why voldemort had wanted to kill him at first he had accepted his parents answers but as he thought about it more and more he wondered why voldemort hadntkilled his parents first if it was just an ordinary attack against his enemies he decided to ask his friends for their opinions maybe ron and hermione could suggest what to do he just felt that his parents were hiding something as frustrating as that was he knew he wouldntbe able to discover what that was for now harry then got up and went to his door slowly opening it he peeked around seeing no one he stepped out and made ready head on downstairs he hoped his parents might relent with his punishment today since he hadntcomplained about it since he got home he had just gotten a few feet from his door when he heard a pop behind him master harry shouldntbe out of his room a high pitched squeeky voice said harry sighed and turned around to face a small creature with tennisball sized green eyes and large bat like ears wearing a butler suit with the crest of the potter family on the left breastpocket come on blinky harry said it the last day surely i earned a pass by now blinky was one of the four free house elves who worked for the potters the others were his wife mimi and their children orni and lamni mistress lily hasntsaid anything to me master harry blinky said sternly shaking a finger at the boy master can come down later for lunch but that two hours from now harry whined canti just take a walk in the garden i bored master harry still hasntfinished his homework blinky said but i stuck i ve only got six inches to go and there isntanything i can add please blinky let me walk around a bit i haventhad any sun since i got home harry made a sad puppy dog look on his face after a while the house elf said oh all right master harry just a walk mind you i ll have to tell mistress lily later when she gets home harry grinned thanks blinky oh by the way remember what i said last year i dontwant you to call me master anymore just call me harry you and your family are free elves you may work for us but i want to be considered as your friend and not just your employer no no blinky said clearly flustered it not right master harry even if we is getting wages and clothes we is just house elves it not right to presume more especially with harry potter and his family curious harry asked why is that blinky what so different with me and my family why you is harry potter blinky said since you beat he who must not be named we house elfs have been treated better by wizards harry frowned he d never known house elves were treated badly before his parents had always been respectful of their house elves and taught their children the same he d have to ask them about it sometime especially his dad since he was a pureblood wizard all right blinky harry said we ll discuss this another time yes master harry blinky said and he disappeared harry moved outside to the garden and reveled in the warm feeling of the sun on his body hey what are you doing out here he heard rose yell at him from above harry smirked as he looked up at her just enjoying the sun you re supposed to be studying she said to him i ll tell mum and dad i almost done just a few more inches on one last essay harry replied anyway i asked blinky for permission he ll probably beat you to telling mum plus it the last day of my detention at that rose smiled hey that means ginny can come over again she landed beside her brother i guess so harry said ron will be glad to anyway i hope he not too ticked off at me for landing him in trouble with his parents nope i dontthink so harry rose said he quite the big thing with his brothers now none of them ever had such an adventure suddenly she dropped her broom and hugged harry fiercely harry was surprised by this for a moment then he awkwardly hugged her back hey sprite what wrong he asked her i suddenly remembered you confronted you know who again just like you did when we were babies her voice muffled he pulled back at held her at arm length he was surprised to see that her eyes were moist and glistening come on sis it all right she suddenly slapped him on his arm you could have died you big git when i heard i was so worried i dontknow what i d do without you to bother harry heart swelled his sister really did care for him in spite of her teasing he led her back to the porch and sat her down on one of the sundeck chairs then sat beside her wrapping his arm around her she laid her head on his shoulder dont you worry sis he said i survived again i doubt he ll be back anytime soon there no reason i ll be meeting up with him again they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time finally rose said so what do we do when ron and ginny get here harry smiled oh i dontknow yet i sure we can think of something they heard a pop and another house elf this time wearing a yellow dress stood there in front of them lunch is ready young master and young mistress she said the young potters smiled thanks mimi harry said then turned to rose come on sis let eat after lunch harry decided to give the essay another try he first went to the library to get a few more books on potions three hours later he had only added another three inches to it he sighed in frustration hopefully his mum could help him out she was quite good with potions just then he heard a knock on his door turning around he saw his mum standing in the open door of his room her arms crossed over her chest he gulped at the stern look on her face i heard you left this room before lunchtime she said er yeah mum harry said uncertainly i just needed to clear my head i thought a little sun couldnthurt when she didnt make any comment but continued to stare at him he added please mum it was just for a while i was already on my last bit of homework just six inches short i went back to it after lunch he picked up the parchment and waved it at her could you take a look i still short three inches and i cantfind anything else to add please lily held her stern look for another few seconds then gave him a little smile well i guess you ve earned a pass since you ve been a good boy these past two weeks let see that essay what the subject erm it a potions essay harry answered it about reactions from mixing the different potions we learned to brew this year that a bit over your head lily said frowning as she took the parchment from her son she skimmed through it then said well looks like you ve covered most of it but i think you should consider the effects of mixing the calming potion and the agitation producing potion wouldnt they cancel each other out harry asked remember that the strength of these potions depends on the amount of the ingredients consider if one or the other had more of some ingredients harry thought about it for a while then he understood thanks mum he said smiling lily smiled also glad to help she turned around to leave the room mum lily turned around yes harry um rose and i had a bit of a talk harry said after a short pause she was quite worried for me wasntshe lily closed the door and sat on harry bed patting a spot beside her harry sat down we all were harry she said at least me and your dad were there with you in the hospital wing she was quite upset about being left at the burrow molly and ginny tried to distract her but harry hung his head i sorry for worrying all of you for putting my friends in danger then his head came up but not for what we did come on mum what were we supposed to do dumbledore was gone mcgonagall wouldntlisten i couldntlet the stone get stolen with voldemort wanting it once we were down there we couldnt stop until the stone was safe lily sighed then put her hand on harry shoulder i realize that harry she smiled at him you re your father son you just cantstand back and do nothing while something bad can happen you want to help no matter what harry blinked in surprise it seemed his mother understood him harry lily said i dontwant you to think that we were punishing you for going after the stone we appreciate that you tried to warn professor dumbledore we just want you to think a bit more before doing something like this again i realize that now mum harry said it a bit hard to think when you re so worked up i mean i was so concerned to stop snape i let three of my friends come along even though we knew almost nothing about what we d face after fluffy you know that still amazes me that my 11 year old son and his friends could get through things many adult wizards wouldntdare face like your dad said we are proud of what you did in spite of the circumstances she then pulled harry into a hug we re just glad you re alive harry suffered through the motherly hug something ron or any other 11 year old boy would have tried to get out off immediately when his mother finally released him he asked mum about snape why is it he and dad seem to hate each other i noticed even uncle sirius and remus werenttoo friendly with him not like you lily looked down at her son for a moment before replying that is between severus and james something from our days at hogwarts and remember he professor snape to you he did something to dad didnthe harry asked lily looked down for a moment a mannerism harry had learned meant his mother was thinking about what to say harry believe it or not your father was a different person back then lily said seeing the skeptical and questioning look on her son face she added oh he was a typical gryffindor he was just as brave and honorable as he is now but before our sixth year let just say i didntlike james potter very much and wanted little to do with him outside of classes and homework harry eyebrows rose in surprise then again most of the stories he d heard from his father and his friends had been about hogwarts in general the stories he had been told about their pranks never gave any specifics like the names of who they pranked except that they were almost always slytherins or the spells they used he and rose had never been told about how their parents had gotten together not that they d ever been interested in such now he was curious and a bit disturbed that his parents hadntalways gotten along so what was he like then mum harry asked how d you two end up together and does snape have anything to do with it lily again dipped her head all i can tell you sweetie is that severus and i were friends even if he was in slytherin and i was in gryffindor we still are after a fashion even after i hooked up with your father about your father character then and how we came together that is something best left for another time i didnt except you to be interested in that sort of thing yet anyway it almost time for dinner she got up and walked to the door opening it and going through then she turned around oh since you ll be free of this room tomorrow you can floo call ron later and invite him over if you want harry grinned and said thanks mum a n this is shorter compared to the previous chapters i just had to get it out since i ll be away from a computer for a week while i attend a convention dontworry the next chapter will have more stuff hope you enjoyed the potter family fluff iluvwater i sorry if you got confused with the titles i decided to remove the chapter which described their rescue of the stone since my betas on another site thought it was too close to the original i posting my original chapter 6 as another story disclaimer nope still dontown harry potter chapter 8 summer birthdays and a trip to diagon alley the next day ron and ginny came over after breakfast through the floo network finally ron said after dusting himself off mum had me cleaning the attic and degnoming the garden by hand blimey that was real hard work and little miss perfect over there pointing his thumb at ginny who had just stumbled through the floo didntmake it any easier with her laughing and teasing ginny smiled cheekily at her brother then moving up to harry embraced him hey you long time no see yeah right harry said grinning it only been two weeks since we came home from hogwarts of course i ve been confined to my room most of the time while your twin in all but name terrorized the house elves and irked me quite a bit oww rose had just hit harry on the arm serves you right you know ginny it a good thing we ll be at hogwarts in a few weeks someone got to keep an eye on these two bozos harry and ron both yelled hey ron added we dontneed any minders especially girls younger than us rose and ginny simply rolled their eyes then moved off to go upstairs just as she got to the foot of the stairs ginny turned around and said smiling i glad you re okay harry then she raced after rose before harry could say anything harry raised an eyebrow normally ginny paid little attention to him after greeting him every time she and ron came over or whenever harry and rose went to the burrow he turned to ron who just shrugged and asked so what do we do now mate how about a nice fly around the back harry said the rest of july passed in quickly for the four kids soon it was the morning of the 31st harry was awakened by a sudden blast of sound in his ear yahhh what the hell was that he said as he sat up in his bed he found his sister laughing hysterically at him a muggle bicycle horn in her hand harry scowled what d you do that for canta bloke have a lie in on a summer morning rose smiled sweetly at him come on big brother do you really expect me to believe you want to lie here on your birthday harry said cant fool you can i then he grinned and said now dear sister unless to want to see me starkers you ll clear out so i can get dressed rose scowled ewww that something i dontwant to see she then ran out of harry room once he had showered and changed harry went down to the kitchen where they usually had their family meals together when he went through the doors he was greeted by a chorus of happy birthday s standing around the kitchen table were his parents and sister and the four house elves a delicious looking cake being held by the latter four harry grinned and said thanks everyone his mother came forward and hugged him his father patted him affectionately on the back then ruffled harry already messy hair hey dad harry said cut it out i twelve already james laughed well son you ll always be my little boy harry frowned rose giggled well dad i ll always be glad to be your little girl even when i turn seventeen the potters settled down to a nice breakfast lily cast a preservation charm on the cake to keep it fresh for harry dinnertime party after breakfast harry and rose did some flying in the backyard charms and wards kept them from being seen by muggles after a couple of hours harry and rose moved to the living room to watch a little television just before lunch the fireplace flared green and two redheads stepped out happy birthday mate ron said slapping harry on the back ginny came up and said happy birthday harry then she gave him a hug harry was surprised by this as she had only greeted him on previous birthdays with a pat on the arm or a smile in spite of their being friends for years harry was further surprised and confused by a warm feeling that settled in his stomach before he could think about it she released him then ron asked him so seen your presents yet nope harry replied to his friend grinning unlike you i can be patient um harry ron said how are neville and hermione coming over oh harry said dad gave the floo address to neville parents and i think he going to get hermione from her house i not sure if they ll take the floo apparate or portkey in just then the fireplace flared green and neville stepped out of it harry and ron hurried over to greet him hey neville harry said great to see you oh belated happy birthday i glad we can celebrate together thanks harry neville said hi ron he looked around the living room nice place you ve got here looks just as cozy as longbottom manor thanks i sure it is harry replied oh

ron snorted yeah right i doubt you won t if you two arentmagical enough i a squibb a pop sounded behind them and as they turned around a mass of bushy brown hair moved against ron and harry engulfing them i so glad to see you two ron and harry laughed hey hermione come on it only been a month returning the embrace of their female best friend after releasing her best friends hermione turned around and saw neville and her friends sisters oh hi neville you re here already happy birthday to you too hi ginny rose hi hermione neville said a bit pink thanks for the greeting so hermione ron said how d you get here well ronald hermione replied a bit frostily since i didntcome out of the fireplace not by floo and since i alone and not yet seventeen then i canthave apparated so i came by portkey she held out a teacup how was it harry asked i ve never traveled by portkey yet weird there a pulling sensation around your navel and a feeling of being pulled inside out i not eager to repeat the experience anytime soon sounds bad ron said i think i ll stick to the floo well hermione harry said maybe my dad can get your house connected to the floo network even if your parents are muggles just then blinky popped in causing hermione to give a short screech what is that oh this is blinky hermione harry said he a house elf they re sort of like servants in the wizarding world most wizarding families of status or wealth have them though many of them treat them like slaves making them wear rags and towels we employ four as a family pay them proper wages and wear proper clothes they only stay because they like the work otherwise mum would probably let them leave he looked down at blinky who was cowering behind his legs after hearing hermione screech come on out blinky this is my friend hermione granger she didntmean to frighten you she never seen a house elf before since she muggleborn over there that neville longbottom they ll probably be coming over often now hermione got on her knees in front of blinky hi blinky i sorry if i scared you blinky got out from behind harry and said er that all right mistress granger blinky just wanted to let the young master and mistress and their weezeys know that lunch is ready what did he call ron and ginny neville asked weezeys well they seem to have a hard time pronouncing weasley harry explained come on guys let have lunch after lunch in the kitchen hermione and neville were given a tour of potter manor then the six kids spent time in the playroom with neville intrigued by the computer and play station the dinnertime party was a wonderful affair as the rest of the weasleys sirius remus neville parents and grandmother came over to potter manor harry liked the presents he had gotten like the new pair of quidditch gloves from ron and ginny the broom servicing kit from his parents and sister and a book titled best seekers in the last fifty years from hermione neville was surprised to receive as many presents including a book on herbology from each of the trio the party ended well after midnight with everyone satisfied and full over the next few days hermione and neville were frequent visitors to potter manor usually neville going off with ron and harry and hermione spending time with rose and ginny the younger girls were glad to get a girl viewpoint of hogwarts since their knowledge of the school came from the more numerous boys of their families ginny eleventh birthday was celebrated in the burrow it started off well at breakfast with a school owl bringing her letter of acceptance to hogwarts which left rose a little envious when she learned about it the weasleys held a party in the evening with the potters hermione and neville as invited guests hermione was fascinated by the way the weasleys used magic in their daily activities and by the burrow crazy layout among the presents ginny got were two dresses with frilly lace from her parents she looked at this with disgust they still think i six years old she confided to rose i cantwear them to hogwarts at least my brothers got me some jeans and i like the green jumper your parents gave me yeah rose said smirking i noticed that green was getting to be a favorite color of yours lately hey i have a few older clothes in green right three dresses out of thirty that compares to five of the last six dresses and tops you bought this year i wonder why you like that color all of a sudden does it have something to do with someone eyes oh shut it ginny said her face reddening like her hair and she scowled at the amused look on her best friend face thankfully the rest of her family especially the twins and the other guests didnthear their conversation a week later hogwarts letters arrived and the two families decided to take a trip to diagon alley the following saturday for the coming year schoolbooks ron and harry would meet with hermione and her parents there rose prevailed upon her parents to get her school things already even if she hadntgotten her letter yet one strange thing about their book lists was the fact that all the books for defense against the dark arts were written by one gilderoy lockhart he was a wizard whose exploits against dark creatures was well known in the wizarding world through the books he himself had written and women went gaga over him because he was quite handsome needless to say james was quite suspicious of him and his exploits lily would often tease him that he was just jealous of lockhart good looks after a stop at gringotts the potters and weasleys split up with the womenfolk going to madame malkin for new school robes for ginny and rose and the males going to quality quidditch supplies and the pet emporium except for percy who said he wanted a new set of quills they all agreed to meet in an hour at flourish and blotts the bookstore the men noted a sign outside the sports store which announced a book signing session by lockhart for his latest book magical me at flourish and blotts at the time they would be there just great james said we get to see the big blowhard bloody publicity seeker he is harry and ron snickered at this comment it was a good thing the girls and women were not there especially lily potter when they got to the bookstore there was already a large crowd molly ginny and rose were near the front lining up with lockhart other fans to get books signed lily was on one side watching the circus with a smile of amusement on her face james spotted hermione and her parents standing nearby and went over to them to introduce arthur weasley to the elder grangers the latter excited to meet the muggles harry ron fred and george moved forward to stand beside lily and get a good view of lockhart when lockhart saw harry he grabbed him before lily could intervene making harry stand next to him while a photographer from the daily prophet took their photos when lockhart tried to give harry a full batch of his books lily stepped in and allowed harry to slip away from the blonde man as harry slunk back to the back of the crowd a drawling voice said hah i bet you loved that stunt potter it was draco malfoy before harry could answer the slytherin boy ginny said sod off you harry didnt want any of that he no gloryhound draco smirked well potter looks like you got yourself a girlfriend she looks a bit puny though harry felt his blood boil over draco insult to ginny who had turned scarlet as he moved forward with his fists balled he felt himself being held back by the twins harry dontdo it hermione said it not worth it draco glanced at her and said mind your own business you mudblood know it all several gasps were heard ron lunged at draco but was suddenly held back by his father my my arthur cantyou control your brood trying to attack another boy like that this was said by a blonde man dressed in impeccable robes of high quality who was now standing behind draco he had a smirk on his face and a silver snake tipped cane in one hand then you should make sure your son minds his language lucius arthur said mr malfoy merely smirked then he saw ginny holding her new cauldron filled with her books among the brand new books for dada mr malfoy picked up a battered copy of the standard book of spell grade 1 well well this is interesting with the money you re getting as a deputy minister arthur i d expect you to be able to afford new things for all your children but then with such a large brood as you have a government salary isntenough pity you donthave as large a vault as your children best friend hmm and what do you mean by that malfoy james potter said coming up from behind arthur weasley who had turned as red as his hair ah potter mr malfoy said i knew you wouldntbe far away especially if your famous son is here your two families are quite close to each other these days mr head auror birds of a feather as the muggles say speaking of muggles he glanced over to the grangers who were standing nearby and looking apprehensive how disgraceful two wizarding families can get associating with them we have different opinions of what can disgrace a wizarding family malfoy james said hotly yes i can see that mr malfoy said looking clearly at lily you went so far as to marry a mudblood pandemonium broke out as james lunged at malfoy sr knocking him into several tables filled with books a lot of books were scattered as they rolled on the floor there were yells of get him dad from harry and rose get him mr potter from ron fred and george and james no from lily shrieks from mrs weasley saying arthur stop them the shop assistants saying please gentlemen and then a booming voice said all right gents break it up hagrid picked both men up and separated them both men had black eyes mr malfoy tore himself from hagrid grasp how dare you potter i should bring you up on charges for this just try it malfoy james said it may give me the opportunity to get another chance to search your place i know there are dark arts artifacts there mr malfoy just scowled and thrust ginny book which he was still holding back into her cauldron he gestured to draco and they were gone lily rounded on james as their children rushed to him james really brawling in front of the children james grinned at her now i canthave him insulting my wife can i that was great dad harry said you really showed him wish i could have done the same to his son harry lily said dontlower yourself to their level yer mum right arry hagrid said rotten ter the core that family nuthin will come of gettin inta a tussle with that bunch he turned to james yeh shouldn let him rile yeh like that james even if he said that what does that word mudblood mean hermione asked it a really foul name for someone who muggleborn like you or mrs potter ron said it one of the most insulting things you can call someone in the wizarding world people like the malfoys think they re better than everyone else simply because they re what they d call pure blood yeah harry said it ridiculous dirty blood common blood it really stupid most wizarding families are halfblood now right ron said most of us know it doesntmean a thing being pure blood doesntmake you a better wizard look at you and mrs potter both of you are brilliant with spells and your parents are muggles if wizards hadntmarried muggles we d have died out he didnt seem to notice hermione turn a nice shade of red well it doesnt matter lily said we d better go it almost lunchtime hermione why dontyou and your parents join us for lunch the days flew by after that and soon it was the 30th of august harry sneaked up to rose room at 6 that morning holding the muggle bike horn his sister had used on him the morning of his birthday as he slowly stepped into the darkened room his bare feet stepped on several sharp objects oww oww oww he yelled light flooded the room and his sister stood there smirking at him thought you could take a page out of my book eh she asked him laughing harry hopped around on one foot extracting the jackstones embedded in the sole a scowl on his face it was worth a try he said later as they ate breakfast rose seemed preoccupied her gaze on the windows of the kitchen fidgeting in her seat lily smiled dont worry honey it may take a while for the school owls to find the house rose merely scowled then she perked up when she saw a tiny dot in the distance it steadily became larger until it became the unmistakable profile of an owl in minutes it swooped through the window harry opened and dropped a large envelope with green ink in rose lap rose just sat there looking at it in apprehension finally harry said well arentyou going to open it rose shook her head no what if it says i cantbe accepted it won t silly harry said laughing otherwise they wouldnthave bothered to write you with trembling hands rose slowly opened the envelope and read the letter contained within yes she finally yelled her hand pumping upward i going to hogwarts harry grinned congratulations sis happy birthday again james and lily hugged and congratulated their daughter and the family returned to their breakfast later ginny came over through the fireplace rose ran over to greet her clutching her hogwarts letter happy birthday ginny squealed hugging her it certainly is now rose said showing her the hogwarts letter you got your letter ginny said great now we re really going together i hope we both get into the same house even gryffindor rose smirked i doubt otherwise since when has a weasley or potter not been in gryffindor true true ginny said oh i ve got something to show you she showed rose a small thin black book it not your birthday present i found it in within that old copy of the standard book of spells come on let look at it closely in my room rose said heading for the staircase to the second floor in the sitting room they found harry lounging in one of the armchairs hey ginny he called where ron oh uh he degnoming the garden with the twins ginny said keeping her head down he ll be over later for rose party she then moved rapidly to rose room dragging her with her harry raised an eyebrow it seemed to him that ginny had been acting oddly the whole summer he wondered if it would be like that when they got to hogwarts in a couple of days he looked forward to riding the hogwarts express again later that evening the potters had a party for rose with the weasleys sirius remus hermione and neville as guests among her presents were a wandholder from remus her godfather a jumper knitted by mrs weasley a pair of nice jeans from the weasley kids and a brand new trunk from her parents and brother it was almost midnight by the time the guests left before she left ginny approached rose see you at the platform rose yep see you there thanks again for the jeans oh by the way her voice lowered to a whisper what are you going to do with that diary um well ginny replied tom seems friendly enough he may tell us something about hogwarts the others dontknow i dontknow ginny rose said i have a bad feeling about it oh all right ginny said i ll keep it at the bottom of my trunk for now she raised her voice to its normal level as she embraced rose again well happy birthday again see you soon rose returned the embrace and watched her best friend step into the fireplace and disappear she hoped ginny would forget about the diary of tom marvolo riddle something about it gave her the creeps anyway in another day they would be at hogwarts with their brothers she hoped they ended up in the same house a n sorry it took so long had a week with no computer
